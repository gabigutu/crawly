		<shortDescription>Character over glamour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Scent of a Woman is the kind of film that many would think belongs to a bygone era. While it is frank and contemporary without sugar coating it illustrates the value of character over glitz and how small acts can have long lasting consequences.The film pits two characters who are diametrical opposites. Al Pacino plays the world weary retired Army Lt. Colonel who through a stupid accident looses his sight and his way of life. Chris Donnelly is a young prep school kid on a scholarship whose way of life may be coming to an end owing to the acts of richer kids at the exclusive prep school who pull a stupid stunt.The blind Lt. Colonel needs an escort so that he can go to NYC and have a rip roaring time before he makes a fateful decision. The poor preppy needs to earn a few bucks to travel and is in desperate need of some advice on how to get through his crisis at school.The interplay between the two characters is mind boggling. It is more riveting than the best Grisham novel.Both characters are asked to make life and death decisions that call for them to reach deep into their inner core. The right decision is unhappily the tougher decision to make.Two terrific scenes that are not to be missed. The first is in the New York ballroom where the blind Lt. Colonel teaches the actress Miss Anwar to dance the tango. It is so smooth and dramatic that even a couch potato is tempted to reach for the Yellow Pages in search of dance lessons. The second and most profound is the speech that Al Pacino makes in defense of Chris Donnelly at the prep school disciplinary hearing. It has to go down as one of the great orations of all times.The Scent of a Woman is very satisfying on many levels. The character development is superb, dialogue terrific, glamorous locations and a story line that requires the characters to show themselves to be the people they really are. The film has a lot of funny lines and great drama. This film is almost a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It.s one of the most beautiful movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this incredible movie leaves a legacy of life, it makes us appreciate life an also understand that a life can be lived in a minute just like Al Pacino says in one of this movie's most beautiful scenes, it also talks about values, integrity, and moral principles, by sides of this movie's wonderful script it's incredible cast makes it one of the most outstanding movies I have ever seen. The incredible scene of tango, the deep arguments about life between Al Pacino's character and Chris O'Donnell's, and also those scenes when Al Pacino's character senses women's scent and tells them the name of the perfume or the name of the soap it's really amazing, all of this with the sarcastic sense of humor of this movie, it's really great. I TRULY RECOMMEND TO SEE IT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Pacino's best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank God! Pacino FINALLY received the Oscar statue he so rightfully deserved in all the years he was in the acting business. It's nice to know the Academy finally came to their senses, and awarded him a Best Actor Oscar for this landmark role. This is one of his most memorable performances, and I'm sure when people think Pacino they think about his portrayal of the blind Colonel Slade. Hoo ha!The movie itself is not, technically, great. Very good, but not great. The plot is quite predictable and driven via patented Hollywood devices. The courtroom climax contains one of Pacino's most powerful monologues. However, its outcome is melodramatic.Personally, I thought the whole idea of Pacino being more perceptive of the world than any man or woman with perfect eyesight was far-fetched and sometimes more implausible than stunning. I'm sure there are blind men in the world who ARE in fact very perceptive to what goes on in the world, but few--if any--who can recall a whole history triggered simply by the sound of one's voice. How is he able to tell Chris O'Donnell has pimples? He's not handicapped by blindness; this guy has psychic powers! He doesn't need sight! I do have to say that some of the most memorable lines come from this movie. Pacino says some original and wildly funny monologues involving subject matter I cannot discuss in this message. And of course there's the timeless quote: "Hoo ha!" Which later became a Pacino trademark."Scent of a Woman" is a somewhat flawed, but effective and entertaining film. It's a must-see for Pacino fans everywhere! It's not everyday you can catch a performance this powerful!My score: 8 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most overall pleasing movies I've seen, Scent of a Woman wins on all levels--emotional and intellectual. Of course the primary reason it succeeds is Al Pacino, whose Oscar was well-deserved, needless to say. Chris O'Donnell doesn't overplay his part, and in doing so is realistic and natural. The tango scene, the Ferrari scene, the pseudo-courtroom scene are excellent. Pacino is wholly believable, and although at first he seems overly gruff and nasty, we grow to sympathize with him--especially when that twerp Randy insults him cutthroat-style at Thanksgiving. It's obvious that while Slade acts like he doesn't care, his repetitious "hoo-ha" response makes it obvious he does. My favorite line comes during the Ferrari scene (I was laughing so hard when the cop left, failing to realize Slade is blind.) As Slade careens down the street at 70 mph, Charlie yells, "You're going to get us killed!" Slade answers, "Can you blame me? I'm blind!" On that note, Pacino succeeds marvellously in portraying a blind man. We never doubt for a second that he does, in fact, live in total darkness. Yet others, like the cop, probably the spectators in the restaurant in the tango scene, don't realize it. Ironically enough, Slade acts as though he doesn't want to be treated as the proverbial blind man who needs a cane and a guiding arm. However, in the final scene, he emerges with a never-before-seen pair of dark glasses (after which follows the charismatic speech.) I wonder, was this to throw them off guard??This movie is a modern classic. Some find it too long, but I enjoyed every minute and didn't acutely notice the 2 1/2 hrs gone by. A wonderful film that I recommend to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Men Won't Cry- Scent of A Woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is Pacino such a beast acting? I'll tell you why. His passion. Passion that overwhelms all surrounding him. His voice starts roaring and he forgets that he is Al Pacino. He suddenly becomes his character, he stops seeing around him and he is now a prisoner in his role.The movie is about Pacino. His acting is grand, superb, majestic, heart-wrenching, deep, emotional, so forth. His portrayal of a blind man dangling in the rope of his life, is not only credible but immensely touching. We see directly, through his crystalline performance all of the pain that griefs on his character. Any other actor would have given a corny, over the top performance. Pacino is the Ace.Chris O' Donnell gives also a fantastic performance, shy and unsure will start to understand Colonel Frank Slade in a short trip that will change their future lives. This movie is not Hollywood Rubish. Martin Brest directs a movie that hits no cheap feelings and floods on great emotions that immediately contact the viewer. You have to be rock solid to not be touched.A masterpiece, one of the best studies on man's desperation, helped by wonderful performances and and a stirring, poignant script, with no wasted lines. You will raise goosebumps with scenes like the tango scene, you will laugh, you will cry, you will feel empathy, sorrow, anger. Isn't this movie the Holy Grail of Emotions.Don't miss it. One of a kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scent of a Woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pacino's Col. Slade is a portrait of turmoil. Not because he's blind, but because he's never been able to rise above the blindness and still find peace with himself and with the world. One of the great tragic characters of recent years. His story is much like Hickey's in "Iceman Cometh" or Howard Beale's in "Network." They never think they do good in the world with what they have, so they find themselves in this dark hole and they stay there. No one can help them out. No one looks after them. No one feels what they feel. As years go on and opportunities are lost, the dark hole gets filled with a lot anger, sorrow and possibly regret. Can they be healed? Do they want to be healed? In "Scent of a Woman," Pacino presents this dark, gloomy character perfectly in his Oscar winning performance. He overwhelms you with his constant bellowing and ordering of O'Donnell's Charlie. He's a man who never left the Military. My guess is that you can never take the military of out the man, only the man out of the military. He doesn't blame anyone or anything for his blindness. He's man who thinks that somehow, he was destined to "tour the battlefield" this way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The two best syllables in the world are...hoo-ha!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies often have lines that become part of our culture. The line from this one is hoo-ha! I don't know why for sure Pacino says that. He does though and it's great. Whenever I ask anyone about this movie, those who have seen it 99% of the time answer with a hearty hoo-ha!As for the performances: Pacino, I dare say, gave his best performance ever. It was also the riskiest. We're not supposed to like him, but we do. We can tell he doesn't think that Charlie is a moron. We can tell that he likes him in fact as a son. It strikes us as sad though. We can sense that this man has always been lonely. But then he lost his sight because of his mere stupidity and fondness for booze. He became even more lonely and sarcastic. Mean in fact, but funny. I was laughing my $ss off when he drove the Fararri, yelling hoo-ha! at every turn. Charlie has what Slade attempted to achieve his whole life: integrity. As he says, Slade did stuff just to do stuff. Charlie does it because he means it. Chris O'Donnell, as Charlie Simms, is good. Albeit a bit understated. As I said before, Pacino is masterful. The actor who played the rich boy George is funny too.When I first saw this, I thought the ending ruined it. It seems a bit trite and cliche ridden, but the final speech is good. Brilliant, in fact. Pacino's character comes to his own realizations and ultimately his climax in the speech. Brilliantly acted by Pacino, I may add. He takes several stupid lines in the speech and makes them forceful.This is a good movie. Great really. It ranks on my top 10 of all time. Number 1 being Saving Private Ryan. If you want to see what Academy voters are swayed by, see Unforgiven. If you want to see a masterful movie that contains one of what I consider to be the best performance by an actor ever(the real best being Charles Sheen in Major League 2)see Scent of a Woman. The script does have its errors. The time duration is often unclear. Slade tells Charlie that his gun is not a gun, but a weapon or a piece. Seconds later, Charlie asks for it and Slade refers to it as his gun. Just little stuff like that are the reasons why the Academy didn't give it their vote. I don't care about that though. See it. Remember, the two best syllables in the world are....oh wait. I can't print that. If you've seen the movie, you get the joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a terrific movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino (The Godfather, Looking for Richard) won an Oscar for Best Actor for his outstanding performance as Lt. Col. Frank Slade. I have the tape and have watched it a bazillion times. I have seen many other actors playing a blind man but Pacino outwits them all. I have watched it closely just to watch his eyes. He is terrific! Every time we watch the movie we spend at least two days going: "Oo-rah!" I like prep school movies and I have two movies where Chris O'Donnell (Circle of Friends) Charlie Simms is in a prep school. I guess it goes with his type. I like the part of Charlie who is doing the best he can with the weekend he has to face. One of the most difficult things for people is to feel is useless. That is how Lt. Co. Frank Slade feels. He also has a cynicism about life that in a sense is funny because of its irony. He meets Charlie and has everything planned out. The Colonel has extremely good taste. Meeting young Charlie, who is in a very difficult situation, the outspoken Lt. Col. found a reason to live and to feel useful again, even enjoying the smell of the perfume of Charlie's teacher. I did not see the 1974 Italian film "PROFUMO DI DONNA," but would love to see the performance of the late Vittorio Gassman, one of the most well known actor of the Italian Theater and Cinema. My Favorite Scenes: Lt. Col. driving in New York city, dancing tango, and giving a speech before the student body, to clear up Charlie's name. This is a great movie! My Favorite Quotes: Lt. Col. Frank Slade: "Oo-rah!" ..." But there isn't nothing' like the sight of an amputated spirit, there is no prosthetic for that.." "There are two kinds of people in this world, Charlie. The first group are the people that face the music; the second group are those who run for cover. Cover is better." </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delicious high-class drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not tend to go along with Hollywood-created cult figures, that kind of hero-worship, idol-making, whatever: you can have your Julia Roberts and such like making endless and mindless blockbuster hits with such insipid nonsense as `Pretty Woman', `Notting Hill' and so on, but it has to be something more serious like Joel Schumacher's `Dying Young' or even Steven Soderbergh's `Erin Brockovich' to convince me that Ms Roberts can/might be a good actress. The same goes for Al Pacino. Until the arrival of `Scent of a Woman' he was just merely another actor of those who come out of the Hollywood mass-manufacturing industry. `Scent of a Woman' changed all that: here Pacino shows he is a grand master, a brilliant actor. It is not important that this film is a redoing of an Italian original, or even whether this film won him an Oscar: the film stands up for its own merits, and Pacino reaches colossal heights in this well-directed drama, ably and willingly aided by a refreshing Chris O'Donnell. Very much a two-man film as the characterisation centres masterfully on these two leading characters, Pacino had to carry out a truly theatre-like interpretation of a blind retired colonel; Bo Goldman's dialogues are up to the challenge, creating some magnificent monologues which Pacino so superbly enacted.My rating is somewhat higher than the surprisingly low IMDb user rating: a memorable and classic piece of serious cinema which puts Pacino into a very high category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story, brilliant acting, what more do you want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie once again proves that Pacino is one of the greatest actors of our time and that we all should be very glad he choose to portray Colonel Frank Slade in 'Scent of a woman', no one else could have done it. The story of 'Scent of a woman' stands and falls with Pacino's acting and the bringing alive of his character. It's touching and makes you smile and leaves you behind with the feeling that you've just have had the pleasure of meeting Colonel Frank Slade, a crazy but interesting man. Chris O'Donnell does what he has to do, he gives Pacino the opportunity to shine and triggers the story. The interaction between him and Pacino does the job and provides us with great lines. Overall a great movie. I give this one a 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacino makes a difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every few weeks on TV in Croatia you can watch four movies with same actors in it. This week on TV were Al Pacino's movies: "S1m0ne", "The Merchant of Venice", "Cruising" and finally "Scent of a Woman". Of those four movies "Scent of a Woman" probably isn't the best choice but for Pacino fans answer is definitely positive. And not only for his fans. I just don't understand those people who cannot recognize great acting when they see it. Can you imagine how hard it must be to act a blind man? His performance as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade is so powerful that this is one my favorite performances I have ever seen (along with Brando, Nicholson, Dean and Depp). Pacino simply blown me off. My favorite scene is in a hotel room when he's trying to kill himself and when he says: "I'm in a dark here." For a while I didn't breathe at all, that effect Pacino left on me. I'm his big fan and the Academy gave him Oscar for this role but I dare to say that he should have won the golden statue long before that ("Godfather", "Serpico", "Dog Day Afternoon", "Scarface" ...). But good things comes to those who wait. I don't even won't to talk about the movie, only about Pacino. I'll only say that I didn't like the last scene when everybody applause him in the school (so American happy ending). Also lots of people aren't familiar with the fact that this is remake of Dino Risi's "Profumo di donna" which is excellent film. And also I will explain my grade of the whole movie. 8 for the movie, 10 for the Pacino = 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Speech Everyone Likes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a different type of story with excellent acting by Al Pacino, who makes a speech at the end of the film that many people think is one of the coolest speeches they've ever heard on film.Pacino's character, "Lt. Cl. Frank Slade," is a turnoff for awhile because he's so gruff, but he grows on you and becomes fascinating to watch as a blind man who doesn't act like a blind man. Chris O'Donnell, as "Charlie Simms," plays the opposite: a nice, young college kid whom Pacino winds up taking under wing. The only part I didn't care for was the beginning with Charlie's obnoxious friends, but that ties in later with Pacino's memorable speech.A different kind of story, marred only by a little too much profanity. If you haven't seen it, I recommend checking it out. You'll enjoy it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesson of life. An Extraordinary film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extraordinary film. I can't think of enough adjectives to praise "Scent of a Woman". You can watch it with high expectations and you will feel pleased.*SPOILERS Col. Lt. Slade is a man angered with life and has infinite bitterness towards his pyyiscal disability. The man knows how to give himself a good life but it seems that it just doesn't fills him. In an exquisite way, Lt. Slade reveals that his passions are traveling, Tango, women, and cars. It may sound superficial that life's about that (in fact it's not) but Frank Slade displays a feeling of tenderness and liberation when doing them. The Tango scene speaks by itself and it's one of the most wonderful moments in the film. Also check the Porsche action sequence. It's fun and intense.His depression is very deep that he even considers committing suicide.After Lt. Slade meets Charlie his point of view towards life changes as the young man teaches him that life is worth to live even if you are physically disabled. Lt. Slade realizes that he is a man blessed with many gifts and he can see through people's feelings. In my opinion, the best moment in the movie is the powerful scene where Lt. Slade comes in defense of Charlie against Bert's directors and the honorable table. Obviously Charlie is a victim of bourgeoisy; unfairness is against him because he's a loyal, honest, and humild school mate. Mr. Trask and George Willis's father take advantage on the naive student and when Mr. Trask is about to recommend Charlie's expel from Bert, Frank Slade enters aided by Manny and sits next to Charlie as his tutor. Slade gives a powerful, intense, and moving speech. When Mr. Trask yells to Lt. Slade that "he's out of order", Frank starts his memorable speech. Let me refresh your mind by writing it:"Out of order, I show you out of order. You don't know what out of order is, Mr. Trask. I'd show you, but I'm too old, I'm too tired, I'm too f***in' blind. If I were the man I was five years ago, I'd take a FLAMETHROWER to this place! Out of order? Who the hell do you think you're talking' to? I've been around, you know? There was a time I could see. And I have seen. Boys like these, younger than these, their arms torn out, their legs ripped off. But there isn't nothing' like the sight of an amputated spirit. There is no prosthetic for that. You think you're merely sending this splendid foot soldier back home to Oregon with his tail between his legs, but I say you are... executin' his soul! And why? Because he's not a Bairdman. Bairdmen. You hurt this boy, you're gonna be Baird bums, the lot of ya. And Harry, Jimmy, Trent, wherever you are out there, F**YOU TOO! " (IMDB - Memorable quotes).You need to watch the movie to feel the whole experience. "Scent of a Woman" is a movie that masterfully displays drama, comedy, sadness, and makes you feel positive towards everything for a moment.ACTING. Pacino's performance is WONDERFUL. No wonder why he got the Oscar for Best Actor. He has the charm to make the audience laugh, cry, and really feel his pain. You either love or get annoyed by his character at the beginning as he's very sarcastic, cold, and mean sometimes. As the movie evolves you totally feel symphaty for him and you can't help but ask for more of the character's personality. A delightful performance, period. Hands down to Mr. Al Pacino.Chris O'Donnell (Charlie Simms) gives also a wonderful performance. The young man looked mature for a role of this difficulty. His innocence and decision were totally believed. When his dramatic abilities are required he delivers perfectly. When he has to deliver a decent performance when Mr. Pacino steals the scene because of his huge acting capacity; he delivers and never gets opaqued or dulled by Pacino. In my opinion, it's O'Donnell's best role to date.DIRECTION. Martin Brest's direction is very stylish with the Hollywoodesque technique but it has a feeling. The movie looks beautiful and it's cinematography makes the movie look attractive for the eye. Brest knew how to create a powerful drama with the necessary touch of comedy. "Scent of a Woman" is an easy watch that will active all your emotions. Great job Mr. Brest. Check out also Gabrielle Anwar's brief appearance. She surely enlightens the screen with her extreme beautiness. Wow, what a woman. The ending will also leave you satisfied.This is one of those movies that you can watch 1000 times and you don't get bored. There's always something new to find on it.10/10. An important and sometimes overlooked (by the Gen. X) film. Recommended FOR EVERYONE. It will move and provoke on you an internal reflexion of how you act towards life and it's burdens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Simms (a very young Chris O'Donnell in one of his first movies) is a young student of a very famous and conservative school named Bart. Different from his classmates, Charlie is not rich and only studies at the Bart because he won a scholarship;besides that, he needs to work to have some money to visit his parents. In ThanksGiving holiday he decides to work as a 'boysitter' of the coronel Frank Slade,a bitter and rough man who stayed blind when he was in camp. ( That's the reason of his bitterness)Charlie has many problems with Frank's personality,but needing to have 300 bucks as quick as possible, he decides to take care of the blind man. What happens is a nice travel to New York, where both Charlie and the coronel are going to know each other better and learn about their own weaknesses. The end of this movie, when the coronel is helping Charlie with some discussions and problems at School, is one of the most exciting scenes already watched in a movie !:)</fullReview>

The story is great, the acting is perfect, and you can't help but get attached to the characters. The relationship, trust, and love that develops as the story unfolds is nearly unparalleled in modern cinema. One of Pacino's BEST performances. Not like some of his other roles. Chris O'Donnel actually puts in probably his best performance of his career. This movie is full of great scenes (Pacino driving the Ferrari), Pacino yelling at the school dean, and unforgettable one-liners (hoo-ah). Do yourself a favor and rent this classic.

Pacino gives Slade authority, humour, stuborness and a sense of class few could manage.O'Donnell pulls off the 'wet-behind-the-ears' role of Charlie Simms very well considering the presence of Pacino, giving the role exactly what it needed, somebody to take Pacino's crap and look completely out of his depth (the character not the actor).The scene in the hotel room where Slade tells Simms to pass him over a few bottles of that 'John Daniels' and Simms responds 'don't you mean Jack Daniels' the next line is my one of my favourite ever...'When you've known him as long as i have kid, you can call him John'Love the character, love the film, for once the Oscars got it right 1993s best actor in a leading role deserved it fully.</fullReview>

This movie, he acts with his eyes...quite amazing because eyesight is exactly what his character has recently lost. "Scent of a woman" is one of those movies one has to see several times, not because it's too complicated, but because it seems to be new and different every time you see it. Once at the age of 18 and then again after 5 years...It's the same plot, the same story, but something seems different, new...and that is YOU!

		<fullReview>Al Pacino won his first and only Oscar for "Scent of a Woman" in 1992 and he deserved it far more for "Glengarry Glen Ross," released the same year. Although he yells a lot in both pictures, the over-the-top screaming was justified by the character in "Glengarry Glen Ross"; in "Scent of a Woman," his Lt. Col. Frank Slade comes across as a gross caricature, sort of like Robert De Niro in "This Boy's Life." Both terrific actors made some mistakes in the 1990s: This was Pacino's largest in my opinion.First of all, like De Niro in "This Boy's Life," Pacino's fake accent is constantly varying from scene to scene. He's supposed to be from the south and has that southern twang in his voice, and pronounces words "lak dis, y'know." (In fact, he says "y'know" a lot in this movie.) The problem is that the accent comes and goes; sometimes Pacino's got it down-pat, and at other times we feel as though he's playing another character. The end speech in particular careens from Louisiana speech patterns to New York City, y'know.The movie starts off fair enough but it's so sappy and oozing with cheesy sentimentality that, by its finale, I felt as if I'd seen enough and wanted to turn on something else.Because basically I've seen something just like this before. It was called "Dead Poet's Society" and it followed the same formula, and carried the same sentimental goo as "Scent of a Woman." Chris O'Donnell delivers the best performance of his career, and outstages Pacino. But the movie -- clocking in at nearly three hours! -- really falls apart in the last act.Yes, it's nice to feel refreshed by cinema. Frank Capra got away with this endless times - just look at the final speech by Jimmy Stewart in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." The problem is that it's out of place, awkward and unrealistic in "Scent of a Woman," a movie that otherwise proposes it is very real. Pacino rants for about five minutes straight, as if he's reading his lines from "Witty Catchphrases People Will Remember for Years to Come: For Dummies." Overall, Martin Brest has made far better character pieces (just look at "Midnight Run," and that was a comedy!) and although "Scent of a Woman" is NOT a horrible film by any means, I do believe it's quite overrated and too sappy at times to be altogether memorable. It's okay, and worth watching now and again if it happens to come on television, but don't expect the masterpiece some people have made it out to be. It's really quite average, and follows a formula that's been followed far too many times over the years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly amazing acting by Al Pacino and a long overdue Oscar finally received. Also, O'Donell had a very fine performance. It is incredibly hard to act like Al did, specifically given his condition, but he did a master work in my opinion. Truly recommended for everyone. A masterpiece. Kudos to the director as well. And some scenes, like the dancing are just amazing. The passport to heaven, he says. Isn't that a wonderful statement? I wish there were more films like this made. And a great comeback for Al. If he had to come back from anything, that is. Movies like this are pure inspiration. To fight. And never give up. And thats what Al did. He never gave up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film For The Lonely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something about this film that keeps you company. It's like you're also spending the weekend with Colonel Slade. The film entertains your darkest notions and tops your depth of grief and then somehow elevates you to find hope amidst our consciously blind existence. At first I had a problem with Pacino's performance. I thought Al was definitely over-acting. He's playing a man who is consciously suicidal, a man suffering the loss of his dependence. He seems preoccupied in fulfilling a sexual desire but what he really yearns for is the acceptance of a woman now that he's been injured. However, even beyond his glorified apparition of woman what he presently needs is someone, anyone who will listen. He needs someone he can bark orders at like in the past. Some babe in the woods he can bemuse and corrupt amidst the decadence of `Freak Show Central', his personal nickname for New York City. In this contrived situation he finds life again and with these considerations Pacino's bravura performance is forgivable. Pacino ironically switches energies with O'Donnell's character being the Colonel's high energy defuses Charlie's depressed low energy. The Colonel is psyched for his weekend's desperate romp, `A little tour of pleasures', he says. Given this distinction in performances, Charlie should have been the suicidal one, the defeated one because O'Donnell walks around this film like a deer caught in the headlights and there really isn't anything inspiring or motivating about him. It would have been an awesome acting exercise to have a young actor go against Pacino and realistically attempt to change his character's suicidal mission, granted his whole outlook on life yet what we have is a quick resolution that is very intense but not very intellectual. In the end, this movie somehow manages to conduct all it's emotional payoffs thus rendering the viewer at the mercy of what may seem bathos. Many have criticized the film as negotiating Hollywood Plot A with Plot B or C. However, the Colonel realizes his biggest failure in life was in his interpersonal relationships. He learns that sometimes having friends can be a stronger and more important bond than family- a point well taken. Sometimes when a film comes together, after all the pre and post production, the result can be undeniably charming and this film manages to soar above its foundations, those manifested in the most basic of premises of melodrama. `Scent Of A Woman' does inevitably work and it's a very heart-warming film.</fullReview>

Maybe it's just me - but I feel that Al Pacino should be pretty much given gangster roles or edgy roles...not roles with preppy kids, trying to explain life to them.It's overdone monologue which means to protect the dignity of a honour student over some trivial event expands into something so ludicrous that you would think you are watching a serious courtroom drama with something so insanely intense that somebody's life is at stake - while in reality, it's some preppy kid who may or may not have some some idiotic prank.Big EFFIN deal! Overblown on all counts with nothing to hold it together.I'm waiting for his return as a gunslinging gangster causing carnage and snorting huge amounts of drugs.</fullReview>

Adapted from the Giovanni Arpino novel and 1974 Italian film "Profumo Di Donna", this overlong picture directed by Martin Brest is unrestrained, overreaching and ham-fisted. Filmed in autumnal colors (brackish reds and browns), it doesn't even look good. Oscar winner Al Pacino chews the scenery in inelegant fashion--there are few real highlights to his performance because Brest encourages Pacino to treat every scene as a show shopper. Chris O'Donnell is easier to take as his teenage charge, yet the screenplay is obnoxious and continually prods us for a response with 'darkly comic' histrionics. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly in the top 10 of the most overrated films ever made. Colorless collegiate Chris O'Donnell gets stuck babysitting volatile,loud-mouthed blind veteran Al Pacino on a trip to NYC. This minimal storyline is unbearably expanded into a meandering, pointless 3-hour dirge of epic proportions. There is a frightfully uninteresting subplot, which provides the film's coda concerning whether O'Donnell should rat out the privileged obnoxious students responsible for vandalizing a snooty professor's car, but given that the students are worthless, the professor boorish and O'Donnell so vacant, it is hard to develop much interest. Instead, the wonder lies in watching Al Pacino (in his worst and only Oscar-winning performance) scream, sputter, gesticulate, cuss, yell "Hooha" after every other line, chew huge chunks out of the NYC scenery and basically provide an atrocious performance that contains no traces of subtlety or introspection for the entire running time. The actor responsible in giving us some of the best acting of the 70s in The Godfather films, Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico, etc., gets rewarded for his most execrable work? That's Hollywood for you! As the only other cast member of note, O'Donnell lowers his eyes to floor, mumbles his lines and basically allows Pacino to trod all over him. By the climax, when Pacino takes to the stage at O'Donnell's Ivy League School to defend his honor (over a ludicrous issue) and starts cussing and threatening to burn the place down with a flame-thrower, you know the film is utterly worthless because in reality security would have immediately escorted him to a padded cell somewhere.

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino is excellent in this otherwise unremarkable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, "Scent of a Woman" is standard Hollywood fare, featuring a "heartwarming" and "uplifting" story about personal growth, the strength of friendship, and the discovery that life really isn't so bad after all. The plot involves a young student (Chris O'Donnell), who agrees to watch over a blind and embittered ex-colonel (Al Pacino) for Thanksgiving weekend. He then goes on to teach the older man a few lessons about life, while learning just as much himself. If this sort of relationship sounds familiar, it is because it has been the subject of countless other films (think "Finding Forrester," for instance). "Scent of a Woman" is at least partially redeemed by the presence a few memorable moments, such as the scenes involving the Tango and the Ferrari.What really sets this film apart, though, is Al Pacino's brilliant performance. Although he tends to overact on occasion (as in some of his other post-1970s films, such as "Scarface"), he still manages to reveal the complexities of his character in a way that no other actor could have managed. While Chris O'Donnell and James Rebhorn are fine in their roles, it is Al Pacino who gives us a reason to watch this otherwise unremarkable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A token gesture for Pacino.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino is undoubtedly one of the finest actors of his generation and his performance as retired Army Colonel Frank Slade in Scent of a Woman, finally earned him his long overdue Academy Award for Best Actor, however, in my opinion, it is far from his greatest role, though it is certainly a memorable one.My problem with this film is that for me it's an example of Pacino's dominating screen presence preserving a movie that would otherwise have been mediocre at best. The basic premise of the film is fairly dull. A young prep student called Charlie takes a job aiding a blind, lonely, retired colonel over thanksgiving weekend. The weekend turns out to be considerably more eventful than he anticipated, with the Colonel taking him first class to New York for one final bourbon-soaked hurrah, before intending to end his own life. When they head out to the city I expected there to be some good and perhaps amusing scenes where these two completely mismatched characters, one bitter, world weary and cynical, the other innocent, and naive, really get at one another and, to be fair, there are a couple of excellent moments. The tango scene, in which the Colonel dances with a complete stranger, in a classy New York restaurant is truly captivating, and another where he and Charlie test drive a Ferrari around some Brooklyn back-streets is also entertaining, however if a blind man were to drive and drift a Ferrari at over 70mph in real life, there would likely be some very severe consequences. These moments are few and far between however, and with a runtime of 2 ? hours, the film does begin to drag.Al Pacino has faced up to, and bettered, some outstanding actors in his career (think Johnny Depp in Donnie Brasco, or even De Niro in Heat), but casting him alongside Chris O'Donnell was a big mistake. It's the cinematic equivalent of feeding a lamb to a T-Rex. Pacino simply devours him in every scene; he literally walks all over him. O'Donnell's (non) performance as Charlie is just flat, bland, empty, clichéd and tepid to the point of irritation, and pretty much undermines everything good Pacino brings to the film.Visually, Pacino does an excellent impression of a blind man, to the point where many characters in the film understandably, and believably, don't even notice. Admittedly, he isn't given the best script to work with but he still manages a couple of excellent monologues, most notably in one of the final scenes of the film, which brings me on to another failing of this picture.The subplot, which involves Charlie facing expulsion, as a result of refusing to grass up his peers over a particularly spectacular prank involving the headmaster, just seemed trivial and insignificant, and completely undeserving of Pacino's glorious tirade about integrity, and 'facing the music' which should have really been a highlight of the film. You watch this scene, admire it, and realise there was far too little of it in the preceding 2 hours.In conclusion, had Pacino not received the Oscar for Best Actor at some point in his career it would have been a travesty and an outrage, it's just unfortunate he received it for this role. He was so much better as Michael Corleone in The Godfather, or as ex-con anti-hero Carlito Brigante in Carlito's Way, or even as the overbearing, scenery- chewing, crack snorting gangster icon Tony Montana in Scarface. These are the roles I remember him by, and more importantly, they are vastly superior pieces of Cinema. Scent of a Woman, by comparison, is a mess. The plot is uninspired and boring, the script weak, the characters stereotypical. I've often felt that Al Pacino has an uncanny ability to make poor films average, and average films brilliant, and the former is certainly the case here. The film Two for the Money is another great example of this. A film about sports bettors with Matthew McConaughey that would have certainly been diabolical, and possibly never even released, were it not for Pacino's participation. His somehow makes it watchable... perhaps even.......interesting. Those who are new to his work (I envy you); please watch the other great films I mentioned above, before resorting to this. Disregard the Oscar. His ability to draw you into a scene and light up a film, or even just one casual line of dialogue, makes him the greatest actor of his generation, and consequently, my favourite actor of all time. It's for this reason ONLY that I give this film the 6 stars that it probably doesn't deserve.</fullReview>

Moreover, the movie relies a lot on melodrama which is annoying and turns out to be counter-productive in relation to the alleged sincerity the story is b, as evidenced by the very corny happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After 7 previous Oscar nominations i suppose The Academy thought it was Al Pacinos turn. (it works---a lot---like that). However, Al did deserve this one for a really great performance in this average movie. After the first 15 minutes ....the rest was VERY predictable. Without the Pacino performance...this would have sunk like a stone. Al stamps his authority over the poor schmuck who has come to "look after" him (he is a blind ex army colonel) for a weekend...and in doing so...makes this movie, a one man show. Oh ..there are tiny sub-plots and some humour here and there, but when Pacino is in frame (90% of the time) we all stand to attention. Al Pacino is one of the truly great movie actors, and i was in awe of him here. I cant remember this guy giving an average performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say Frank Slade is scum would be an insult to scums everywhere ^_^ He is supposed to be this rough and tough guy, but the Thanksgiving dinner scene reveals his cowardice. It's not intended to show his cowardice, of course, the scene is supposed to show how Slade is still a man of action, a dangerous man able to kill, even when blind. But a little thinking shows just how much of a coward he is.We find that he's been insulting his family for years now. He seems to especially reserve his venom towards Randy and his wife. Now, what kind of a man insults a woman? A coward, I would think.Then Randy turns the table and starts giving him a rough time. Just 10 seconds, and suddenly Slade had Randy at the throat. Wow, macho man can't stand even 10 seconds of ribbing? What a wimp! Of course, it has to be said, that though blind, Slade is a military man, well trained to kill. Randy, on the other hand, is just a soft civilian. It's no contest really. Again, this shows what a pansy Slade is, using his lethal training against unarmed and unwarned civilians.Randy's story of how Slade got blind also shows Slade's gutlessness. He talked tough, but when push came to shove, he chickened-out and basically caused his own blindness. Hail the gutless hero! What a yellow-bellied spineless wimp.Al Pacino played him with gusto, and his performance salvaged the film. His performance is so good that viewers everywhere basically overlooked his spine jelly. That's how good Pacino's performance is. He's great! But Slade can just suck rocks and swim in the deep end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of the good acting, especially by Mr. Pacino (has he ever delivered a poor acting job?) I can't possibly say that I found "Scent of a Woman" a good movie. The story isn't bad, and there definitely are some very good moments, but about halfway through the novelty wears off, and what's left is a predictable and somewhat sentimental Hollywood vehicle, in the vein of "A Beautiful Mind" or the "English Patient".The largest problem is that it's all terribly overdone: the movie keeps stressing and stressing how blind and depressed Al Pacino's character is and how great he used to be, leading to some pretty ridiculous scenes of a blind man driving a car and an quite ludicruous speech in which Al basically says it's OK to lie and cover things up. It's all so exaggerated: they keep stressing why it's supposed to be touching and it just gets annoying. After a while I just waiting for the movie to end: it had made it's point but it kept going on and on and on. I was glad when it was finally over.** out of *** stars (mainly since it's acted very well).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe you can detect the downward sloping trend in the reviews from 1999 to 2007 here. A few years later, people will view this piece as a relic and open it only for academic purposes. That's right, this is a classic, but time can easily wash away the cheap spirit embodied in this film. Therefore I might be the last one to comment on this outdated film here. But to pay my respect for the wealth and effort that was squandered on this production, and my laborious 2 hours straining myself from smashing the screen, I'll write something anyway.The reviews render Al Pacino's acting worthy of an Oscar, but I have to argue otherwise. Sometimes the stress of the sentence sounds strange, like he suddenly remembered the next word is the point he roared, so he jumped abruptly from a chastising to a explosion, leaving the audience perplexed and uncomfortable. Someone says he is passionate, sometimes he forget the boundary between Lt. Slade and himself. That is a highest accolade invented for actors, because only the VIP class actors can walk in and out characters' inner world with ease. And I won't deny the sense of sincerity that sometimes drifts out casually, Al Pacino should take the credit for this, but he doesn't deserve the Oscar because his talent is blocked by a braggart screenplay writer. The movie was a product of 1992, we should respect flaws in the technique of camera angles and editing the way we respect a old man for walking slow and saying gibberish. But the huge paragraphs in the scene in which Lt. Slade contradicts the headmaster about his decision to expel Charles, I think the whole paragraph about right path wrong path can be spared, because it sounds like an old men's annoyingly didactic speech. His fury suits perfectly in the plot, but the effect will definitely be more stunning if he didn't go on and on for 1500 words. I wanted to cry in my palm, because according to a ancient movie theory, it you take out all the fantastic lines, the movie is still tasty, then it's a good movie. A Scent of Woman without all the breath-drawing lines is more barren than a dessert, which is why it deserves to be left in the dust and wither in time.I'll recommend this movie to my uncle who is going through a mid-life crisis, but definitely not to anyone who still believe in hope, love, future and dream. If you are a shallow person that has faith in lust and pompous bragging and empty shell of wealth, this is the movie to go. I believe it's your fault if all your family hate you and seem embarrassed when you show up, Lieutenant, and I believe it's your fault if you are trying to shoot yourself knowing it will jeopardize a sweet boy that pity you and take care of you all the way. The police will doubt if Charles murder you for your wealth, and that still can't explain why you has a grasp on so huge amount of money to enjoy such luxury. A good man would give the money to the Rosie's for they live such a humble life with you sitting on hundreds of bucks and Mrs, Rosie still firmly believe that you are "sweet in the heart." Shame on you, Lieutenant.It's not a good movie for Saturday night's fun, but it's a great movie to gnaw your fingers at because it's your weekend assignment, and scratch a few words about and get it over with. I must mourn for my precious 2 hours, for I could have watched Schindler's List with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar bait that was caught</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that Martin Brest's Scent of a Woman awarded Al Pacino his first and only Oscar to date is a fact that satisfies and infuriates simultaneously. It's nice to see an immensely talented actor finally get his due from Hollywood, however, it's upsetting to see it's for a film that largely pales in comparison to Pacino's other pictures such as The Godfather trilogy and Scarface and a performance that doesn't hold a candle to the ones he gave in the aforementioned films.It's bizarre out of the library of terrific Pacino performances we've been so grateful to see over the years, the Academy recognizes one that is good at the same time all over the place and inconsistent, even though it's one of the best inconsistent performances I have yet to see. The film centers around Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a student at a prestigious New England prep school who is assigned to look after a retired Army Ranger Lieutenant Colonel named Frank Slade (Al Pacino). Frank is a blind man, often loud, frequently outspoken, loves his drinks, and feels completely entitled to speak his mind whenever he feels like it. It is only a screen writing obligation that these two will embark on some life-altering adventures and find ways to open up to each other in ways they never foresaw.Scent of a Woman's writer Bo Goldman pulls no punches whatsoever, for this is a straight-forward drama about companionship and loss with little to no presence of deeper meaning or multilayered storytelling. Not every film needs to be heavy on symbology or even multilayered, but when a story is a sometimes merciless one-hundred and fifty-three minutes, one hopes that at some point a line is drawn and deeper, rawer human emotions surface or some other facet pops up to reveal another layer.But sadly there isn't one, and because of that, Scent of a Woman flounders because of how basic it is. We see young Charlie leave a lasting impact on Frank and Frank leave an impact on Charlie, which as cute as it is sometimes, can also be dreadfully boring, especially for such a lengthy amount of time. This is one-hundred and five minutes of material stretched out forty-eight minutes longer and occasionally finds itself going in circles over material and events it has just covered.When it comes down to the chemistry between Pacino and O'Donnell, it's uniformly solid. Both actors have a believable sense of friendship in the film, especially during scenes like the one at the dinner table, the one when Charlie allows Frank to drive a Ferrari down an unpopulated alleyway, or when Frank sticks up for Charlie in the end of the film. Both men are believable as friends and work well as an on-screen duo.With that being said, Pacino's performance still finds itself registering all over the place and having issues setting up a clear tone throughout the film. Frank will be calm and collective on some occasions mirroring the likes of mentally unstable on other occasions. Some scenes, Frank will be shouting at the top of his lungs, others, he'll be barely cracking a whisper. This is the performance that won Pacino the Oscar, mind you - not the subtleties he presented as Michael Corleone, not the brash assertiveness he exerted as Tony Montana, but the up-and-down tendencies he brought to the table in Scent of a Woman. While this is by no means a bad performance (and definitely shows its effectiveness by the end, with Frank in the courtroom scene), it still isn't the kind of performance one would see Pacino winning, especially with his already exceptional résumé.Furthermore, it's worth noting that the presence of Thomas Newman's turgid score that needs to emphasize every emotional instance in the film gets to be insufferable to say the least. Newman's score chimes in and plays precisely the kind of tune you expect to hear during scenes of conflict, happiness, joy, and sorrow with absolutely no subtly whatsoever. Then there's the courtroom scene that concludes the film, which feels extracted from a completely separate film.When you have a film that already overextends itself in its groggy runtime, presents a performance that is, for the lack of a better term, all over the place, and a score that leaves no ambiguity, Scent of a Woman almost seems down and out accept for the fact that it does present a well-orchestrated human interest story and how companionship is one of the fundamentals to a good life. Regardless of how long, occasionally tiresome, and overblown the film can be, it still possesses a delightful focus on character over plot, which I always admire.The film comes from Martin Brest, an underrated director known for his action comedies such as the exciting Beverly Hills Cop, the hilarious and too-often enthralling Midnight Run, and the unfairly bashed Gigli, which ostensibly crippled his career (Brest hasn't directed since its release in 2003). Brest's usual investment with character relationships is present but absent this time around are his action set pieces, which provide a nice addition of variety in Brest's short but sweet filmography.Scent of a Woman reminds me quite a bit of Dead Poets Society for more reasons than it deals with a prep school. Both films have a cloying obviousness to their writing and directing, making their themes completely heavy, and staging their emotional sequences as if they were the most powerful to ever exist. The film works best when it is underplaying its central ideas, focusing on more abstract scenes like the key scene here, which involves Frank on a plane fondly recalling the beautiful qualities of a woman, detailing the scent of her hair, the feel of her lips, the texture of her breasts, etc. It's a beautiful scene - Scent of a Woman needed more of those.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino is splendid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few characters in cinema history are so well defined, so memorable and fascinating as Col. Frank Slade, miraculously played by Al Pacino. Slade broke my heart, I'm not ashamed to admit it. I hate "three-hankys" and overly sentimental "chick flicks", so I kept avoiding "Scent of a Woman". When I've finally watched it recently, it didn't strike me as a "chick flick" though. Pacino's performance really moved me. He never lets the story slip into cheap sentimentalism, because his character is heart-wrenchingly real.C. O'Donnel is bland and uninteresting, but that's the way it was meant for his character to be. He's only a catalyst for Slade, a blank book waiting to be written. After all, he's just a 17 year-old. I love it when Hollywood is sending out a positive, moral message, even if the delivery is flawed. The ending of "Scent of a Woman" kinda spoils the story's realism, but nothing can diminish Pacino's brilliant performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scent of a Woman (1992) - Whoo-Ah! Whoo-Ah!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from the Italian film version from Giovanni Arpino, "Scent of a Woman" tells the story of Chris O'Donnell as a preparatory student, who takes a weekend job, taking care of a blind, medically retired Army officer, portrayed brilliantly by Al Pacino, scoring his first ever Oscar win for Best Actor. Director Martin Brest and screenwriter Bo Goldman has perfectly made a visionary portrait of life, hope, friendship, and honesty. When I first started watching, I immediately realized that this movie was better than I thought it would be. I was drawn into the clever well-written dialogue from Bo Goldman, and the stand-out performances from the entire cast. But the shining cast member is Al Pacino, delivering one of the greatest performances of his career, that rightfully deserves his Best Actor Oscar. Although sadly, this is the only award he has won in his entire career, his award win will finally make others realize how excellent an actor Pacino is. But besides Pacino and O'Donnell, James Rebhorn, Gabrielle Anwar, and a young Philip Seymour Hoffman, round up the supporting cast with some clever, if necessary, performances. Delivered with some powerful sequences, provided with some beautiful directing, wonderful writing, and insanely wonderful music, "Scent of a Woman" is one of the many masterpieces of Al Pacino's career. Although the 157-minute run time seemed to drag a bit, with some scenes that needed to be in the movie or not, that were just sort of stuck, that didn't ruin the movie's true potential, luckily. Since 1992 was considered the year of the woman, "Scent of a Woman" might not have been a movie that was all about women, but it does share a wonderful and beautifully made tale, through the case of an insanely enjoyable motion picture. "Scent of a Woman", in my review, "immensing and groundbreaking, Pacino is brilliant".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, let's settle the Oscar issue: For Al, the wait is long undue and as a matter of principle, I don't support awards for any movie starring disability, especially if it's biography. About Al's blindness, I will just say that sometimes, he overplays his hands but from start to finish, he's exceptional with his eyes: he really seems to see nothing.Beyond, this movie combines two themes that are special to me: boarding school and NYC. It's not often that you can have a movie that excels in those categories simultaneously: It's as much about a student's life as a trip in uptown NYC. As a lot of Al's late movie, he embodies a fatherly figure for a young disoriented. But, here, the cards are a bit different: Al can be as supportive as he is stern and very difficult. If he speaks not very clearly, you can guess that he has a great life behind and you understand that Al is in a fight against time that he can't win. In front of him, O'Donnell is perfect as the All-American boy. Thus, it's the delicate meeting of courage and integrity and it's really moving to see the two characters taking each other's influence. When I was summoned by superiors to take a blame for helping my colleague., I wish I could have delivered Al's speech but at last, i have O'Donnell honor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably one of the finest movies of all time...Al Pacino is the life of the movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted by Bo Goldman from the novel Il buio e il miele (Italian: Darkness and Honey) by Giovanni Arpino and from the 1974 screenplay for the movie Profumo di donna by Ruggero Maccari and Dino Risi, Martin Brest's 'Scent Of A Woman' is evergreen classic from the early 90&#x2032;s. Movies often have lines that become part of our culture. The line from this one is hoo-ha!This film may look plain but it isn't: it's a very strong one, showing us how someone who lost all faith in life (Frank ? Al Pacino) can learn from someone whose life may end by doing something right (Charlie ? Chris O'Donnell): not selling himself for his future. At the same time, Charlie will learn that sometimes you shouldn't trust everything people tell you: usually it is easier to speak the right thing than actually DO the right thing. It is a beautiful film, to be watched peacefully: believe me, if in the beginning you will wonder how it is possible that someone like Colonel Frank Slade, by the end you will like him more that you thought possible.SCENT OF A WOMAN (1992) is an outstanding piece of work! The legendary Al Pacino FINALLY took home the coveted Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant work in this film and he shouldn't have to apologize for it. Yes, he should have won for his work in THE GODFATHER and SCARFACE, but too many actors to be named have been sadly overlooked for their best work.Pacino perfectly essays the role of retired Colonel Frank Slade, who was compelled to retirement being blinded during duty(due to his own stupidity and drinking habit). Stuck living with his niece and her family in their guest house and drawing monthly stipends from the government, Col. Slade is an embittered man of late middle age. Slade's niece has hired local boys' school student Charlie Simms (young Chris O'Donnell in a very underrated, genuine performance) to take care of Frank for the weekend during the Thanksgiving holidays. Slade opts to take Charlie with him on a weekend of luxury and reckless abandon in New York. Meanwhile, Charlie must wrestle with the moral dilemma of "should he or shouldn't he" squeal on his fellow classmates, who he along with another student saw commit a punishable act prior to the holidays. Charlie is to go before the disciplinary board upon his return. Charlie and Frank are two extraordinary actors in the film, "Scent of a Woman." They are a perfect pair, one who has always stood firmly for what he believes in and the other one who is learning how to do just that.Still of Al Pacino and Gabrielle Anwar in Scent Of A WomanAl Pacino is extraordinary, he steals every scene he is in, truly crafting a superb and incredible performance. One of his greatest performances ever and in the history of cinema. Chris O'Donnell is marvelous, a great performance. It's absolutely unforgettable and flawless. The supporting cast is golden, too .Gabrielle Anwar (charming as the beautiful young lady that Slade gets to tango with!), the always reliable James Rebhorn (pitch perfect as the stern headmaster of the boys' school), a young-looking Phillip Seymour Hoffman (terrific as Charlie's shifty "best friend" at the boy's school, who was his fellow witness), Richard Venture (as Frank's older brother W.R. Slade), a young Bradley Whitford (wonderful as Frank's resentful nephew Randy in my favorite scene of the film!), Ron Eldard (winning as the NY cop who stops Slade and Charlie for speeding), and a young and vibrant Frances Conroy (as an English teacher at Charlie's school who I always imagine that Frank ends up with!).There are great scenes in "Scent of a Woman" from the ruckus at Thanksgiving dinner when Frank takes Charlie, both uninvited, to his brother's house where the relatives don't think much of him to at one point driving a Ferrari despite being blind. But the most wonderful moments are the few on the dance floor. The scene of Frank(Al) and Donna(Gabrielle) doesn't get out of my thoughts. From the moment he catches her perfume, through the introduction, till the sweetest tango dance ever. Of course, the choice for Donna ? Gabrielle Anwar, is perfect, she plays the shy (very) pretty woman very good. The scene when the colonel wants to shoot himself and suddenly decides to shoot the boy,too is brilliant. The fight between the two men -as well as Charlie's attempt to convince the colonel give up his plan- is full of suspense and very well structured, so it's impossible to anticipate how the things will work out. The climax scene in the disciplinary meeting, though a bit clichéd, is wonderful. Pacino's speech is absolutely amazing. He delivers it with a panache.The big lesson from SCENT OF A WOMAN is about the true meaning of honor. I like the dichotomy of Slade's situation with Charlie's and how Charlie, the student, inadvertently teaches Slade a valuable life lesson, that through the toughest of times and situations, it is the human SPIRIT that must remain intact if one is to truly LIVE!Riveting, electrifying and satisfying. A magnificent film. A heartfelt, funny and outstanding experience. Powerful and very touching throughout. An excellent movie in every way. Superb storytelling and stunningly crafted. A towering and masterful drama. Wickedly funny and spectacular. A film you cant turn away from. You cant stop but smile when you think of this movie. A two and a half hour pleasure from start to finish.Nominated for Best Picture, directed by Oscar nominated director Martin Brest (MIDNIGHT RUN, BEVERLY HILLS COP) and starring the one and only Al Pacino in his Oscar-winning role, SCENT OF A WOMAN is a film to enjoy over and over! I refer it to everyone, everyone who want to watch a beautiful movie with great performances. I rate it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good With A Unique Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really did not know what to think coming into this film. The title, "Scent of a Woman", certainly does not really give the viewer much idea of what this film is all about. The audience immediately feels for Charlie who honestly does the best he can to do what is right, but luck does not usually shine in his direction. So he meets up with Frank who certainly does not give him any leniency from the get-go. After a while, Frank becomes a father figure to Charlie and the two learn from, and help each other out.The plot does not sound extremely original, that is until you factor in the fact that Frank is blind and ready to give up on life. Al Pacino really makes this film with his over-the-top portrayal of the colonel. He is a very interesting character and it is neat to see him interact with different people.One little problem I had with the movie was the courtroom scene. I know in some private schools they have these mock courtroom situations to deal with disciplinary actions, but this one seemed a bit too far fetched.This is a great movie to work and has the unique variable of someone who cannot see to make it stand out more than others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one is a masterpiece. First of all because Al Pacino cuts a character he is in no way close to being in real life. He plays a retired lieutenant-colonel which is nothing, but a blind one. His blindness is the symbol, and result, of both a heroic career and a sad end because he was passed over for general. This mixture of so many emotions and feelings and frustrations is marvelously conveyed by the actor. His tone, his behavior, his general stand, his unpredictable reactions, his decision to leave this world and his second decision to stay can be read in the way he speaks, the words he uses, the expressions his blind face carries, his attitudes toward other people, etc. He is a millionaire in emotions. But it is a masterpiece for so many other reasons that I am only going to quote a few. First it is a journey, the journey of a prep school teenager, a student on a scholarship mind you, from Oregon to Cambridge, Massachusetts, then to New York, a round trip with the colonel he is taking care of for the Thanksgiving long week end. This journey, and particularly the lap to New York and the subsequent events, are an initiation. The young chap is to learn what principles are in life and that you have to stand by them, especially if you are poor and fragile in body and social status: then be strong in soul and mind and spirit. Your ethics are your only asset and power in life. He also has to learn how to understand his colonel companion and feel when he has decided to send him buy cigars while he is putting an end to his life and the gun loaded with his bullets are an impressive key to the solitary tower of growing up with death in front of you. He saves that man with a crazy idea of a ride, for a blind man, to drive a Ferrari in the Bronx or somewhere under the Brooklyn Bridge, and with all the frills of such a ride including the cop who catches him speeding but does not realize he is talking to a blind man. But this film is also a film about the elite education these Ivy League prep schools provide the young men of today with to prepare them to be the leaders of tomorrow. There I will not hint too much at that side of the story. Let's say an act of vandalism which is a student prank and nothing more, leads the headmaster into menacing the two student witnesses (our poor one and a rich kid) with the worst punishment going as far as trying to buy the cooperation of the poor student. The final disciplinary hearing is absurd in its logic. The three culprits go through because there is no clear cut witness, the rich one, with his father, pretends he did not have his contacts on but gives the three names with a maybe, and the poor one, Charlie by the way, refuses point blank to be a fink, a stool pigeon. And there the intervention of his would-be-and-could-have-been-suicidee colonel saves the day. That you will have to find out by yourself. In many ways it is a lot stronger than the Dead Poets Society and the drama is avoided. It is better because it is the vision of a poor scholarship student and not the vision of one rich kid, in recent society and not in the 1920s or so. The point of view makes it a lot more powerful about society and courage, even if less dramatic as for the relations between the rich kid and his father. The loser all along is the headmaster who did not know how to recognize a prank and over-estimated it into an act of vandalism. Yes that kind of repressive attitude produces soul cripples and there is no prosthesis for that type of amputation.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best performance by Al Pacino. He made an extraordinary character, a blind Colonel Frank Slade (war veteran) who is sad and lonely man before he met young Charlie a Baird student. They both created something special. Unique connection between innocent teen and damaged adult. In time they learn from each other and become friends, sharing their problems. "Scent of a Woman" is very profound and full of beautiful scenes. For example when Al Pacino is dancing tango with gorgeous girl or driving Ferrari in the New York. The blind man needs a guide in life like a teenager needs support in his school. Amazing speech about twisted reality where we live, where we must choose our destiny. This movie is truly worth watching and it will give you hope. It also gives me a strength to live on, not give up and just be myself. I love movies. There is only one film like this and in my opinion it is a classic. Remarkable art and deep dialogues make this movie a top one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Generation Gap Of Values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Scent of a Woman Young Chris O'Donnell at the Baird Prep School on a scholarship, has to earn the money he needs for a round-trip back to Oregon to see his family at Christmas break. He takes a job posting off a bulletin board at school advertising for a companion to a blind man. The blind man turns out to be Al Pacino whose sister and her family want to unload him so they can go away for Thanksgiving.Pacino is no helpless invalid however. He's a former lieutenant colonel in the army and used to being obeyed on command. But he's facing a crisis in his life, he's just tired of being an invalid and dependent on people. O'Donnell's having a crisis too. Headmaster James Rebhorn feels he and another student, Philip Seymour Hoffman, saw an act of vandalism committed on the school grounds. It goes against O'Donnell's grain to be an informant. But these other kids, Hoffman included come from old money and can buy their way out of most things. If the ax has to fall as Pacino tells him, it's going to fall his way.The film is a touching story involving a generation gap of values that is bridged when Pacino and O'Donnell discover a genuine respect and affection for each other. Pacino's iconoclastic retired Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade finally won for him an Oscar for Best Actor that his peers had not voted him, despite being nominated 7 previous times in both the lead and supporting categories. In fact that same year Pacino was also up in the Supporting Actor category for Glengarry Glen Ross.Chris O'Donnell had a breakout performance as the young preppie who has far more integrity than his richer and more privileged classmates. And Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as the kid who rats under the financial umbrella of daddy's millions.Scent of a Woman is a great part for Al Pacino, not my favorite role for him. That one for me is ....And Justice For All. Still this award like the one given to Paul Newman for The Color of Money is more for Pacino's lifetime of artistic achievement in the cinema. And that's one artistic life anyone could envy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino's and Chris O'Donnell's best film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scent Of A Woman is an extremely different film than we have ever seen in film cinema before. It tells the story of a "town drunk" who is blind and also had a great service in the United States. Al Pacino plays the blind man and Chris O'Donnell plays the part of Charley, who is hired to take care of Pacino for a weekend. I found this film humorous in some areas because of the way Pacino's character acts. Al Pacino has never played a character like this before and he executed the part very well! Pacino's eyes are always pointed in the opposite direction he would be looking if he weren't blind, which is brilliant. Scent Of A Woman's mood and setting made this film enchanting in a sense. It took place in a white and gray sky Autumn mood during Thanksgiving weekend. O'Donnell attends an Ivy League school and may or may not have witnessed a scheme that took place that involved humiliating a teacher in front of many students. Pacino's character is more complex than anything else and his character still holds a United States Military mood. Pacino constructs a list of things he wants to do and at the bottom of the list is killing himself. Scent Of A Woman did well at the Academy Awards, FINALLY giving Al Pacino an Oscar. I was very thankful for the "Academy" awarding Pacino an Oscar, but he should have received one a long time ago for The Godfather, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, or Glengarry Glen Ross. Hopefully he will receive another one later on in his career. However, it did not recognize Chris O'Donnell for his fantastic acting in this film, which disappointed me very much. This movie is somewhat emotional as well. I would recommend that you rent this film during Thanksgiving or in the fall. Scent Of A Woman was a very unique,entertaining, wonderful film.</fullReview>

As if they were born to take those roles, they both seem to slip into the character with complete accuracy. Not only do we see a great blend of fascinating material; but we also see a large amount of versatility in Pacino. We see a person who is both bold and sensitive, angry and supportive, etc, etc. As for O'Donnell, we see a character who's naive and understanding, smart and gentle.

		<fullReview>A blind ex-officer Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino) goes on a trip to New York city to end his miserable life with a top student Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell) who serves as a baby sitter. Their Friendship and affinity are brewing on such a soul- searching trip. Having gone through all the twists and turns, they both find their renewed lives back. The simple plot has nothing to do with the eye-catching title, but Al pacino??s performance really inspiring. Judging from its script, this movie might be nothing but a tedious and even repellent one, but The two protagonists Al pacino and Chris O'Donnell amazingly elevate this low-budget and silly-plotted movie on to one of the classic Al??s masterpieces. Al Pacino again brings his artistic talents into full play by playing the blind officer, who enjoys flirting with girls, tends to speak sentimentally and possesses such an ability to see through others with his sharp eyes that nothing can escape his notice. Al, in this movie, talks Charlie into joining him on the trip, then manages to keep him in company. There are many delicious moments of the movie , among which Tango is no doubt an excellent scene, in which Al shocks me with his fantastic and masterful dancing skill!!! In contrast,Chris O'Donnell gives a fine and competent performance although he by no means matches up well to Al. He is a student with full scholarship. He goes to Al in response to an advertisement for a baby sitter, but only to find Al is the one he needs to care for. At first, Al is knotty and troublesome, but as movie goes on, Al??s true life and past reveals, he becomes aware of the real purpose of his trip.While experiencing ups and downs together, his curiosity about Al grows as his compassion for him develops. He prevents Al from committing a suicide which Al thinks himself is a glorious end. In a sense, he helps Al recollect faith and courage which used to be suffocated by his blindness by an accident in war. In the meantime Chris O'Donnell is caught in trouble back in his school. He is being used as a scapegoat for the trouble made by his wicked fellow classmates. In the end of the movie, he is put on a trial in school. When he is faced with a bitter choice between being expelled and retaining his seat in the prestigious school at the expense of his integrity, Al saves him by showing up and giving a inspirational speech on truth of friendship and importance of life choice. I think car-driving and suicide attempt deserve a second viewing. As a blind car driver, Al shows excitement and calmness about driving in contrast with Chris O'Donnell nervousness. Although in my opinion this suicide attempt seems a little contrived , Al still captures Lieutenant's mentality exactly. The only flaw in the movie is Chris O'Donnell, who could have delivered a much better performance if given a more intelligent script and more room to act emotionally. Finally, the speech by Al in the end is full of wisdom and inspiration. Faced with choice between betrayal and integrity, Charlie hesitates but eventually chooses integrity instead of selling friends. Al defends and protects him by defying the absurd accusations by school authority and convinces them of the truth of friendship and importance of life choice.?°He has come to the crossroad , he made a choice and he choosed the right path, this boy??s future lies in yours hands, it is a bright future, embrace it , not destroy it, believe me, one day you will be proud of it.?± Al??s voice is always so real, so convincing, and so reasonably aggressive!! I just enjoy watching and listening to him !!! the movie earns Al an Oscar award for best actor in 1992!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Performances to Remember and Treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now and then it is refreshing to turn back time and elect to watch older films of substance, a reminder that there are certain cinematic characters that have become indelible. SCENT OF A WOMAN provided Al Pacino a stage on which to perform a true character, unlike any he had played before, and make it one of those creations that still, 15 years later, evoke a smile and applause.Blind, acerbic, loudmouthed, irascible Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Pacino) hires preppy, in need of money, Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell) to escort him to New York for a 'final fling'. Charlie has his own issues that depress him, but the two end up having such a grand time in New York that they bond strongly - until Slade dresses for his final moment. The tearful Charlie convinces Slade not to off himself, Charlie's innate character wins Slade's gruff heart, and Slade ends up defending Charlie in an unforgettable prep school 'mock trial'.The complete manner in which Pacino inhabits this role is a stroke of studied genius: as a blind man his every physical and verbal movements are wholly convincing. There are many fine moments in this film, not the least of which is the famous Tango scene, or the confrontation between Charlie and Slade regarding a suicide plan. Pacino won Best Actor for his role and it is richly deserved. This is a film to cherish. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For me, more moving than 'It's a Wonderful Life'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie again on the TV and have done at intervals of maybe four years since it's release. For the first time it has brought tears to eyes! It's just a beautiful, beautiful film. The performances are superlative, particularly of course from The Maestro, the soundtrack is thoughtfully and expertly mixed (as is the cast) and the interplay between the leads is genuinely heartwarming. Of course, the script and story underpin the work but the premise of adult learning from youth has only been rivalled by 'Rushmore' as far as I'm concerned. It's just lovely : ) Watch it, and when your kids are old enough to understand it make them watch it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blind man with a perfect Vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino at his best. Never seen a better drama that this. The background music is wonderful and the sentiment flows through out the movie. Charlie simms the ideal student with excellent integrity has some trouble going on in the university. He has to work in the weekends , find a part time job for his livelihood. He is a merit student and is excellent with his academics. To his dismay(initially) his weekend job turns out to be more adventurous than he could ever imagine. With his troubles already at peak in the university, his adventure turns out to be learning lesson for him and also to the person who is none other than Al Pacino(blind retired army officer). The whole movie glitters with exuberance. The last 30 mins are quite remarkable and to be honest the heart of the movie especially the climax scene. To be frank i saw the climax about 20 odd times :) and i dare say that every man on the earth will like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacino's brilliant Oscar winner!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino gives one of his best performances as Col. Frank Slade, a blind man who just exists after a drunken accident caused his blindness. Chris O'Donnell is also great as student Charlie Simms, who agrees to be a sort of guardian to Slade during the holidays in order to raise some money. The relationship that develops between the two men is, in my opinion, one of the most memorable in film history. Everyone remembers certain scenes (the tango scene, Colonel Slade driving, etc.), but the rest of the movie is also fantastic. This is a must-see movie for every film fan. I give "Scent of a Woman" a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowadays, it's hard to believe that this was directed by the same guy who did "Gigli".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After twenty years as an A-list star, Al Pacino took home an Oscar for his role in "Scent of a Woman". He plays blind Lt. Col. Frank Slade, who talks like he's ready to tear your throat apart, but has a heart of gold. Sound like a cliché? Well it's not. "Scent of a Woman" succeeds where so many movies have failed, probably because Al Pacino is in the lead role (almost anyone else very likely would have turned the character into a maudlin dweeb).Anyway, the story has college student Charlie Sims (Chris O'Donnell) agreeing to be a caretaker for Col. Slade, and the colonel takes Charlie on an adventure that he'll never forget. Along the way, a rather unusual event happens at Charlie's college (that scene will most likely make you at least giggle if not break out into laughter), and the colonel sees no choice but to get involved.Among other things, this movie has a number of people who weren't yet famous but would make their marks in later years: Philip Seymour Hoffman as Charlie's friend George, James Rebhorn as the dean, and even Frances Conroy several years before "Six Feet Under". "Scent of a Woman" is like a breath of fresh air in the stench of so many lousy movies. Which brings us to the question: why did director Martin Brest have to direct that god-awful "Gigli"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very moving piece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sentiment in "Scent of a Woman" does not feel false or forced - it is yearned for. This is the first movie in a long time where i've not found myself looking at how long there is left about half way through. I didn't want it to end, and now its over i have this lingering affection for it. I knew this would be a beautiful movie, no matter the outcome, when Colonel Frank Slade (Pacino) lets his newly hired assistant Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnel) know, as they sit at a lush meal, in an expensive restaurant, where they came from their hotel, the Walforf-Astoria, that while they are in New York, Slade plans to drive a ferrari, sleep with a beautiful woman, and lay down on his bed and blow his brains out.This is a movie about what there is to love in life - what reasons there are to live. And for Colonel Slade, above all things, that is making love to a woman - and a distant second, driving a ferrari.Feminists may find themselves uncomfortable when seeing this movie - because it indulges in a traditional stereotype of women, putting them up on a pedestal, so that they're so special they can not even be spoken to as a man can speak to a man. In many ways (contrary to what you might think) this is a man's picture. Its about the brotherhood between men, where the highest virtue is integrity; and its about man's love of women. In fact, women only pop up in this picture to serve the needs of the male characters, and the male scriptwriters. The most memorable of these cameos, of course, is Gabrielle Anwar, in the magestic (and famous) tango sequence. It surprised me that Anwar didn't return, until i realised that she was only there to dance with Slade, and what was important was the relationship between Slade and Simms.So although this movie is very much about men, and is very old-fashioned in its value system, it is these things in an affectionate way. Since women consider this a chick flick (i think), then perhaps they like the way they look through men's eyes?In any case, this is a special movie, which leaves you with a lingering feeling for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino's finest performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've often wondered what is the very greatest, most colorful, stylish and intense performance of an adored movie legend Al Pacino. It's such a hard choice to pick just one role considering how outstanding his career has been. He played Michael Corleone in the celebrated "The Godfather" -trilogy, Tony Montana and Carlito Brigante in Brian De Palma's marvelous masterpieces "Scarface" and "Carlito's way" and he has an enormous amount of terrific roles in amazing films like "Dog day afternoon", "Heat", "Donnie Brasco", "The Devil's advocate" and so on.I haven't come to my final conclusion yet and I probably never will but naturally it goes without saying his phenomenal, Oscar awarded performance in "Scent of a woman" is one of the most magnificent highlights of his career. Chris O'Donnell is surprisingly good in his fourth film role as youth called Charlie Simms but Pacino indisputably steals the show with his clever and impressive acting. Story is rather touching, definitely funny and to cut it short: irresistible. No doubt Pacino is one of the great ones and if I claim that he's still going to be in the numerous excellent films I think my expectations aren't gratuitous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blind! Now I'm Deaf!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scent of a Woman is not so much a story of one mans repressed humanity finally breaking through after many years locked away in a dark shed as it is an attempted showcase for Al Pacinos acting skill. Pacino is undoubtedly one of the finest American screen actors of any generation, let alone his own, which is why his performance in this picture is an entirely frustrating experience. Why was is necessary for Pacino to shout every last word? The man is intimidating enough without him having to burst your ear drums. I suspect that much of the films budget went on strepsils for Pacino and ear plugs for the crew. If this man ever got his hands on a loud speaker he could clear half the world's trees of their leaves with one short monologue! Yes, the character was intended to come across as overbearing... but why at the risk of serious and lasting damage to the viewer?How could this character, who could dance a perfect Tango, drive a Ferrari, dismantle a hand-gun and repeatedly pre-empt and outwit the actions of all supporting characters despite his blindness, manage to make pouring a whiskey such a difficult task? Do we really need to be reminded that this man can't see in such an obvious way? Apparently we are incapable of remembering this for more than five minutes, so continuous are his fumblings! During many scenes I felt manipulated, I could feel the director tugging at my feelings rather than gently manipulating them or moulding them beyond my awareness. Especially when Al visits his brother and receives abuse from his nephew, who displays such contempt and wicked spitefulness, that your forced to begin your transition from loathing to empathising with him. On a plus, note the film was beautifully captured, especially the scenes in and around New Hampshire. Its just shame that the undoubted quality of the cast and crew could not shine through, blinded as they were by Pacino's attempts to deafen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell) is a poor scholarship student attending an exclusive prep school filled with wealthy kids. He takes a job babysitting angry blind hard-drinking retired Army Ranger Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino) over the Thanksgiving weekend. He needs the money to go home to Oregon for Christmas. He witnesses with George Willis, Jr. (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a prank being prepared by some students on Dean Trask (James Rebhorn). Trask pushes Charlie for the names promising to expel them both at a special assembly. Trask also promises a guarantee admission to Harvard for Charlie. Frank convinces Charlie to go on a trip to NYC. Finally Frank reveals his plan to have a blow out and then kill himself.I am not a Chris O'Donnell fan during his early years. He is too weak and too bland. I hate it when movies make him the lead. He's not compelling enough to be the lead. Al Pacino is acting big and overshadows everything. His antics leave the movie with some very memorable iconic moments. I just don't care enough about the limp weak Charlie. The movie is also too long by half hour or more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May the next version be the best one yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story concerns an old man and a young man. The old man was once formidable. He saw and achieved much. Then, at the height of his powers, he was struck down by an accident that left him disabled and dependent on others. He takes refuge in cynicism, bigotry, and bullying the few people who can still stand to be around him. The young man, as the story opens, is just a kid. He has promise of a sort. He studies hard, takes jobs at school and on the outside for extra cash, and knows how to obey authority. He may be destined to be just a cog, but he's going to be a cog in a classy wheel somewhere. One long weekend, the old warrior needs a substitute caretaker, and the young man needs an extra job for money to see his family. They meet, to their mutual dismay. The old man considers the boy a scrub-faced wimp and tells him so, between gulps of whiskey, puffs of cigar smoke, and ghastly war stories. The shocked young man looks frantically for a fire exit. The man decides he's going to see some old stomping grounds and make the weekend an adventure, with his temporary valet in tow. The boy feels obligated to go. After all, his default mode is obedience, even if the boss is a raving, obnoxious nut case.This wonderful plot idea has yielded first, a 1969 novel by Italian author Giovanni Arpino (who also wrote the book on which "Divorce Italian Style" is based); and two movies - Dino Risi's Profumo di Donna in 1974, with Vittorio Gassman, and Martin Brest's 1992 work, Scent of a Woman, which earned Al Pacino an Academy Award for Best Actor (yes, it should have been Denzel Washington for "Malcolm X," but that wasn't Pacino's fault).Bo Goldman's 1992 screenplay builds on the first two works. Here, the old warrior plunges into his last wild foray into a world that was once his, bent on showing goody two-shoes what it's all about. The young caretaker finds himself overwhelmed and unable to break away. Beyond that, our young man has just landed, the Friday before the crazy weekend during which the film takes place, by bad luck and no fault of his own, he has landed in deep, career-threatening trouble back at school. So for both members of this mismatched pair, it is a last weekend of sorts -- and a time to consider the problems the other person is facing.The Italian versions of this story are very European -- touching, troubling, realistic. Life isn't always fair, and Italian cinema doesn't kid about that. There are many movie lovers who feel the Italian approach is artistically, intellectually, and morally superior (see several comments here for example). They decry the Hollywoodization of this poignant story. And what they say is absolutely correct. But it is also true that to Hollywoodize this story into a more positive direction yields more opportunity to develop the plot, and this, to an extent, we get in Scent of a Woman. It may be film school heresy to say this, but in some ways, the 1992 film is the better version, because it adds interplay and drama between the two characters. They both have to face the world. The new ground broken here isn't quite credible but it's interesting in the evolution of this tale. Maybe the story on which Scent of a Woman is based is one of those plots that will be retold and improved again and again. It seems too good to end here. May the next version be the best one yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thanks to Al Pacino's Bravura Performance, This One Bears The Sweet 'Scent' of Success!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to make an extra buck, prep-school teen Charlie (Chris O'Donnell) takes a job caring for Colonel Frank Slade, an embittered blind war veteran, over Thanksgiving holiday. Charlie wants to back out of the job as soon as he meets the cantankerous man, but he's too nice to say no to the colonel's harried niece who obviously needs a vacation. A tough, aging ex-military man, the colonel no longer has control of his life due to blindness. Charlie has his own problems - for one, he's a small-town teen attending a fancy prep school on scholarship. He's also witnessed his bratty "friends" committing a crime, and after the holidays he'll be forced to rat on them or be expelled. Charlie thinks the weekend will be spent in the colonel's grim little cottage, watching the old guy drink and listening to his insults. The colonel however, has other ideas - more than Charlie can even begin to guess. Charlie's life-changing adventure begins when the irritable, outspoken, whiskey-guzzling colonel drags him to New York City for a weekend of indulgences, before "blowing his brains out". As the weekend wears on, Charlie grows to care about Frank, discovering the sensitive man behind the gruff exterior as the two slowly come to understand each other.Director/Producer Martin Brest knows how to blend humor with drama to good effect. His mix is nearly flawless, and he manages to do almost (and I emphasize almost) the entire film without resorting to manipulative tricks. Bo Goldman's screenplay is witty but far from perfect. The script loses its edge near the end, when the film loses its sharp-tongued humor and becomes maudlin and slightly melodramatic. But what salvages the screenplay is the vastly interesting and original character of Frank ? a character so flawed that he is never boring. And a large part of the credit for that goes to Al Pacino! For two hours, he brings Frank Slade to life in a way that few others can. As portrayed by Pacino, there's far more to this man than a rancorous outlook on life and a couple of hearty "hoo-ha"s. His convincing work here is another testament to his incredible talent and versatility. Chris O'Donnell is solid, if somewhat obscured in the more experienced man's shadow. Although the role of Charlie is understated by O'Donnell, he nevertheless manages to fashion a rapport with the audience.A funny, impassioned, and all-around enjoyable film, Scent of a Woman bears the sweet scent of success!</fullReview>

It's my first time to write an interview and i am not a fan of Al- Pacino even but i just like tango and the tango scene from this movie really attracted me that's why i saw this movie . And i was setting watching the movie with an open mouth how the hell there could be such a beautiful acting you feel as if he is blind for real and even it's his character there's no way that this could be an acting . I didn't like the acting of the others really but he was enough you will stay all the movie long want more of Al Pacino acting . This is no movie that you would see like or to see something better than it in the future this isn't this kind of movies which could be forgotten . It needs an artist to be able to make some kinds of movies like this. And luckily the artist made the best piece of art nothing less .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Pacino finally got his Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scent of a Woman, a film mostly remembered for two things: "Hoo-Ah" and where Pacino finally got his Oscar. The film itself is quite well-made however. Two lost souls, both with difficulties communicating with the people around them, finding and helping each other sounds like the foundation for a wonderful movie if done right. This film does it mostly right.Charlie (Chris O'Donnell) is a prep school student. He witnesses a prank on his school's headmaster. He knows his friends did it and the headmaster asks Charlie to divulge the names of those responsible. If he does, he'll get a free ticket into Harvard. Sounds like a dilemma that will be solved by the film's end. To pay for a trip to spend Christmas time with his parents, he agrees to look after Frank, a blind, retired Lt. Colonel. Once Frank's family leaves, Frank reveals his plane is to go to New York. Charlie panics, but doesn't see any option but to go with the stubborn Frank. Once there and they check into the Waldorf-Astoria, Frank reveals his plan: to bask in certain luxurious pleasures before committing suicide. Needless to say, the emerging relationship between Charlie and Frank will be life-changing for both of them.And therein lies the true appeal of this film. Yes, it's formulaic and predictable, but when done right, these stories can still warm the heart. And this film does it mostly right. It combines drama and humor in a balanced way that easily enables us to sympathize with these characters: Charlie with his desire to get into Harvard and fear of being called a snitch, Frank with his regrets in life regarding his family, etc. The great acting by Pacino and O'Donnell also helps a great deal in lending the (sometimes sappy) drama an air of credibility. Despite the parodies that've surfaced online, make no mistake: this is a pretty good film.There are two things that hold it back however: the length and the ending. At 2,5 hours, this film is just way too long. The drama is too 'thin' to support such a timespan and the film suffers for it. The ending is also a tad cringe-worthy. It features a 'trial' at Charlie's school where he's compelled to give up the identities of the pranksters (his friends). Frank, of course, makes an unexpected appearance and has a big speech in which he defends Charlie and accuses the system and Charlie's friends. The disciplinary committee has seen the light and excuse Charlie. The students present rejoice and all's well that ends well. As if that's not enough, there's also a suggestion of a future romance between Frank and one of the teachers. If all this feels way too sappy, then you are a master of understatement. While there's a lot of truth in Frank's Big Speech, the lack of subtlety undermines the quality of the rest of the film. If this and the overall length were altered, Scent of a Woman would've been a truly great achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scent of a Woman is an inspiring life affirming film you will never forget.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A prep school student needing money agrees to "babysit" a blind man, but the job is not at all what he anticipated. Frank played by Al Pacino, is a retired Lt Col in the US army. He's blind and impossible to get along with. Charlie is at school and is looking forward to going to university; to help pay for a trip home for Christmas, he agrees to look after Frank over thanksgiving. Frank's niece says this will be easy money, but she didn't reckon on Frank spending his thanksgiving in New York. Scent of a Woman is a life affirming film that the viewer can learn from. I just can't articulate what effect this film has on me, it inspires, it captivates and it stirs a variety of emotions in me. Al Pacino speech will go down in cinematic history as perhaps one of the greatest speeches in film. An example of this is when Lt. Col. Frank Slade said: "I'm not finished! As I came in here, I heard those words, "Cradle of Leadership". Well, when the bough breaks, the cradle will fall. And it has fallen here. It has fallen. Makers of men, creators of leaders. Be careful what kind of leaders you're producing here. I don't know if Charlie's silence here today is right or wrong. I'm not a judge or jury, but I can tell you this: He won't sell anybody out to buy his future! And that, my friends, is called integrity. That's called courage. Now that's the stuff leaders should be made of. Now I have come to the crossroads in my life. I always knew what the right path was. Without exception, I knew. But I never took it. You know why? It was too damn hard. Now here's Charlie. He's come to the crossroads. He has chosen a path. It's the right path. It's a path made of principle that leads to character. Let him continue on his journey. You hold this boy's future in your hands, committee. It's a valuable future. Believe me. Don't destroy it. Protect it. Embrace it. It's going to make you proud one day, I promise you." Scent of a Woman is an inspiring life affirming film you will never forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scent of a Woman is one of those rare movies that I will spend years apart from viewings and fall all over in love with it once it begins again.This beautiful ? no, creation ? film had so many attributes, it's hard to sum them all up in one review. So many, that this film could be studied as part of a film class's curriculum. It would be easy to just compliment the cinematography, score, dialogue, originality, deep comedy that holds up more than 20 years from its original release, suspense, dramatic themes, depth and character spot on interactions. And while all of those were absolutely astonishing in this fantastic film and each could be dissected in said film class, my favorite aspects of this film are Pacino's iconic role, the remaining acting and the big finale.I used to think that the Oscar Pacino won for this role was a "pity" one since both he's had plenty (more than, actually) of extremely fine performances prior and the Academy does, in fact, do that, which is a wrong move. But, taking aside all his previous excellence, he was above and beyond great here as recently blinded Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade.While he had me both cracking up and witnessing greatness, the rest of the cast was also very good, namely Chris O'Donnell's quiet, but deep teen role and a just-noticed-by-me Phillip Seymour Hoffman.And finally of my favorites, and one I hope to completely memorize one day ? I have about 80% of it down, is the big, climatic showdown. I've already listened to it so many dozens of times?that it's hard not to shout out at the screen line by line of what Frank is preaching. (I did, this time too. I had to reverse back to enjoy it without my own interrupting.) Now, I don't 100% agree with Frank, or Charlie's stance ? if you hadn't seen this by now, I will not spoil it ? but Frank's passion and drive and Charlie's uncompromising ethics made me stand behind them one hundred percent.Besides all that, it was a fantastically written scene of heart, humor and depth. It ranks up there with Jack Nicholson's A Few Good Men courtroom scene and Pacino's own The Devil's Advocate's Devilish finale speech.The movie breaks into two separate story lines: One involves angry ex-military Frank Slade and his free spirit bucket list in NYC and prep-school on a scholarship teen Charlie Simms's dilemma on whether or not to rat out fellow students.Charlie reluctantly accepts a "babysitting" job of caring for Frank over Thanksgiving so he can earn the plane fare to see his parents over Christmas. Only, he didn't know the "easy money" would require chasing blind Frank all over New York City and beyond.The movie's hilarious, touching and makes me emotional every time I watch it. I laugh hard on the lines, marvel on how imperfect Frank is but we still believe in everything he says and enjoy the crisp scenery and movement of the story. Truly, this is one of my all-time favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rated other movies that were cinematically better with a lower rate. I believe that this film has some flaws, not to be denied. Some clichés, like the applause at the end, the bad guy being good on the inside and so on. I don't want to see this side. A movie doesn't have to be perfect, it should be like a human, with ups and downs, and I will evaluate by considering how high are the ups.In scent of a woman, the ups are high up in the sky, the story and the acting are legendary, absolutely magnificent and you are left with a feeling that makes you want to fight. Yes, that's right, makes you want to fight, against injustice, against cowardice, against...and that made me remember instantly about Mr. Smith goes to Washington. The supreme idealist, the child we should all be like.I feel this movie is one that should be somewhere in the universal patrimony of humanity because it contains and explains in one story all the themes of humanity, all our fears and ideals: death, idealism vs materialism, honesty, richness vs. poorness, the mysterious course of life, illness, frustration, war, child innocence, sincerity, vulgarity vs academy and I could go on with this...It seems to me that all acting was great, except maybe the principal of the school that looked like a cartoon character. I don't even want to remind the flaws cause within my eyes this movie was flawless. There is no flaw, there is just the idea left deep in my head, in my soul. Only this and nothing more.</fullReview>

Masturbation jokes are a trademark of the Italian movies?they are still in 'Maléna'. Nothing left in the American rendering. The Italian original is a bitter comedy, breathtakingly reasonable and grounded, good?sensed, intensely sad, and benefiting from a somewhat better actor?anyway, one from a wholly different acting tradition or school. The Hollywoodian remake is a bit stained by blandness, a certain childishness.My writing on this site has become somewhat loose and careless?not to mention unduly self?referential?for which there's no better apology than improvement, the restoration of a more impersonal shape, and of a tauter style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...others are unforgettable. I watched this on TV for the first time, late night, a few years ago. When I spotted that old style clothes and hair I immediately decided the film was terrible. But still I kept watching it and, by the end, I had regretted my decision.This is probably my favorite film of all times: until the tango scene I was convinced the guy playing Lt. Colonel Frank Slade was, indeed, blind - only later I found out he was Al Pacino, the actor I have heard so much off but hat never seen before in any film. Also, at first I thought Chris O'Donnell was a little bit too zen, but then I realized: it's exactly how the character is supposed to be. More, since Colonel is such an imposing and, sometimes, impertinent character, he was exactly what was necessary in the film.This film may look plain but it isn't: it's a very strong one, showing us how someone who lost all faith in life (Frank - Al Pacino) can learn from someone whose life may end by doing something right (Charlie - Chris O'Donnell): not selling himself for his future. At the same time, Charlie will learn that sometimes you shouldn't trust everything people tell you: usually it is easier to speak the right thing than actually DO the right thing.It is a beautiful film, to be watched peacefully: believe me, if in the beginning you will wonder how it is possible that someone like Colonel Frank Slade, by the end you will like him more that you thought possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scent OF A WOman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino (Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade) is a retired from the US army. He's blind and mad at the world, making him hard to get along with. Chris O'Donnell (Charlie Simms) is a boy from Oregon who attends Baird School which is a boys boarding school. Charlie is not wealthy like most of his peers; he is there on a scholarship. Charlie and his friend Baxter Harris (George Willis Sr.) witness a couple peers setting up a prank on the head principal James Robinson (Mr. Trask) who finds out that they can identify who did the prank. Neither Charlie nor George is willing to tell him who the peers are. He gives both of them until after Thanksgiving to decide what they will do because, if they do not talk, they will have other consequences to deal with. Charlie is faced with a bribe from Mr. Trask that could make it possible for him to attend an Ivy League College. For Charlie, it is a struggle between standing up for what is right or doing what is best for his future. While dealing with all of that drama, he needs to make some money so that he can help pay for a trip home for Christmas. He does a brief interview with Gabrielle Anwar (Donna) who is Frank's niece. He agrees to look after Frank over Thanksgiving. When taking the job, he is not aware of the trip to New You with Frank and his agenda while they are there. While in New York, Charlie make a couple calls to George and finds out the type of friend he really is. Once again, Charlie is faced with some really difficult decisions that are a matter of life and death. Charlie and Frank are two extraordinary actors in the film, "Scent of a Woman." They are a perfect pair, one who has always stood firmly for what he believes in and the other one who is learning how to do just that. The prep school setting, and Charlie learning to stand up for what he believe is a cut out of one of the prep school movies. Like, in the movie, "Dead Poet Society," there is the coming of age and learning to stand up for what is believed. I feel that the lighting contributed to the film. There was a mixture of high and low key lighting throughout the film. The direction of the lighting that was used in the film only added to the images. There was the use of natural lighting and artificial lighting. The lighting emphasized the characters and suggest some of their inner qualities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't care what anyone says, I form MY OWN opinions about movies. And SCENT OF A WOMAN (1992) is an outstanding piece of work. This is actually one of the few Oscar honored films from that decade that I find myself watching repeatedly. The legendary Al Pacino FINALLY took home the coveted Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant work in this film and he shouldn't have to apologize for it. Yes, he should have won for his work in THE GODFATHER and DOG DAY AFTERNOON, but too many actors to be named have been sadly overlooked for their best work. But if you don't think this is a great performance, then I don't know what film you're watching. Instead of worrying about who everyone else THINKS should have won, I say show some real objectivity and really watch the movie! Pacino perfectly essays the role of retired Colonel Frank Slade, who was compelled to retirement being blinded during duty. Stuck living with his niece and her family in their guest house and drawing monthly stipends from the government, Col. Slade is an embittered man of late middle age. Slade's niece has hired local boys' school student Charlie Simms (young Chris O'Donnell in a very underrated, genuine performance) to take care of Frank for the weekend during the Thanksgiving holidays. Slade opts to take Charlie with him on a weekend of luxury and reckless abandon in New York. Meanwhile, Charlie must wrestle with the moral dilemma of "should he or shouldn't he" squeal on his fellow classmates, who he along with another student saw commit a punishable act prior to the holidays. Charlie is to go before the disciplinary board upon his return.The thing that I love about the great Pacino is that his acting seems to raise other actors' games to another level. Contrary to all too popular opinion, Pacino in his later years is NOT an overactor! The character he is playing here calls for him being bombastic, ornary, and mean-spirited. This is who Frank Slade IS! And the fact that Mr. Pacino is truly a great actor makes him all the more believable. Not to mention that throughout the entire film, every time I watch it, not once do I feel like Pacino is PLAYING a blind man. I really think he is blind! Awesome performance.I think other actors just naturally react to Pacino's flawlessness and that is a huge reason this film still holds up because I actually like most of the minor roles in this movie. I wouldn't love it near as much if there were weak points, and, pardon the pun, "frankly", there are really none! The big lesson from SCENT OF A WOMAN is about the true meaning of honor. I like the dichotomy of Slade's situation with Charlie's and how Charlie, the student, inadvertently teaches Slade a valuable life lesson, that through the toughest of times and situations, it is the human SPIRIT that must remain intact if one is to truly LIVE! The supporting cast is golden, too....Gabrielle Anwar (charming as the beautiful young lady that Slade gets to tango with!), the always reliable James Rebhorn (pitch perfect as the stern headmaster of the boys' school), a young-looking Phillip Seymour Hoffman (terrific as Charlie's shifty "best friend" at the boy's school, who was his fellow witness), Richard Venture (as Frank's older brother W.R. Slade), a young Bradley Whitford (wonderful as Frank's resentful nephew Randy in my favorite scene of the film!), Ron Eldard (winning as the NY cop who stops Slade and Charlie for speeding), and a young and vibrant Frances Conroy (as an English teacher at Charlie's school who I always imagine that Frank ends up with!). Nominated for Best Picture, directed by Oscar nominated director Martin Brest (MIDNIGHT RUN, BEVERLY HILLS COP) and starring the one and only Al Pacino in his Oscar-winning role, SCENT OF A WOMAN is a film to enjoy over and over!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scent of a Woman" is without a doubt one of my favorite movies. I could watch it every day and never get tired of it.One thing that is incredibly impressive about this movie is how well it ages. Not many movies are like that, most will really start showing their age within a few years from their original release date, especially now that every movie seems to make references to current pop culture trends that won't stand the test of time and lines referring to such trends won't be understood by future audiences because of their topical nature.Al Pacino gives a powerhouse performance as Lt. Col. Frank Slade, a blind Army veteran. Some may consider Pacino's greatest work to be "The Godfather" but not I! This, to me, is easily Pacino's best work.Chris O'Donnell is also great as young prep school student Charlie Simms.I don't want to give anything away to anyone who hasn't seen this wonderful movie -- but I hold no reservations in saying I highly recommend it and that you shouldn't still be reading this review...you should be out buying this movie! It's a movie worth purchasing for sure and for certain. You don't want to catch it on TV because the censors will water it down too much. It's a much more enjoyable and powerful movie when seen as it was intended -- in its "R" rated form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino - one of his best performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am fascinated with Al Pacino in this movie, although he is my favorite actor of all times, he can always surprise me more. From my point of view this movie is perfect: I love the actors, Chris O'Donnell is great, the dialogs, New York, the guys at the prestigious school. I first saw this film a few years ago, but from time to time I feel the need to see it again, it is very close to my heart. What I enjoy most in the story is the connection between Colonel Frank Slade and Charlie, how it develops along the 2 days. I think Chris O'Donnell had a very difficult part, to act such a shy guy and in the same time a good guide and a life savior for Frank. Al Pacino is making one of his legendary roles (along Michael Corleone,Sony or Tony Montana), you just can feel his passion, his pain, his regrets. So, go and see the movie, you will have a great experience! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scent of a Woman is a movie in which i found to be inspirational, watching Al Pacino play the role of one LT. Frank Slade; to play such a role of a blind man and create this character that fills you with many emotions, joy and sorrow, i felt i really became close with the characters and was able to understand the things they were going through during the movie. The Character Charles Sims, played by Chris O'Donnel was also another character that caught my attention as well, to be able to question the decision in which he must make, a decision in which you think; "What would i do in his shoe's?" Overall This movie was amazing, great Characters, Great Plot and an outstanding Speech. A movie that fills you with a wide variety of emotions and draws you into the characters. I Would seriously recommend this movie to any fans of the Drama Genre, also in my opinion Al Pacino's Greatest performance in which he won an Oscar for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film presents the compelling story of the friendship between a teenager and a blind, old man. The sense of justice the boy possesses conquers the former colonel, who up to him, no longer believed he has any reason to live. He had lost the respect for humanity and no longer hoped there are still just people left in this world. But the boy proves him wrong by standing besides him when no one else cared. He risks his life to save an old man he has only known for 2 days. Thus, a babysitting job turns into a friendship-reasoned help. The film captures the weekend the two of them spend in New York, which was supposed to constitute the last days of the colonel. But with Charlie's help and encouragement, these two days turn out to be the labor of a new life for colonel Slade.The climax is the scene when the colonel wants to shoot himself and suddenly decides to shoot the boy,too. The fight between the two men -as well as Charlie's attempt to convince the colonel give up his plan- is full of suspense and very well structured, so it's impossible to anticipate how the things will work out.After all this tension, the film's ending emanates hope and puts a smile on anyone's face. Two and a half hours that pass in no time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flattened out karaoke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared with the Italian original it's just a shallow retell of the original. Parts are taken off because of the so-called pureness of the US audiences. For a movie made so much later it's a shame they can't keep up the pace with the mild sexuality of the original. Than other parts are taken off because they are not politically correct. Than some parts are taken off because they probably don't make a lot of sense to a character (lt. col. Slade) who is already flattened out, ironed as much as possible to make him shallow and barely credible. To compensate they put in the silly scene with the blind driving... feeble substitute.This version has it's strong points - the interesting Pacino monologue (typical for his late career), the quite well done transformation of the child from a young Italian to a young American and the inspired exchange of female character. Yet, from the point of view of Al Pacino this is just a karaoke night of the exceptional creation of Gassman. Which makes that Academy Award so much more offensive - from all his roles, they choose a pale copy. He has created so much, yet his only acknowledge comes from this. A true shame! Nevertheless, for a Hollywood production this is one of their best movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not try to determine what is the best film performance in Al Pacino's career, which included Donnie Brasso and Michael Corleone and Serpico. But his performance as Lt. Col. Frank Slade in SCENT OF A WOMAN must rank among his top ten performances. It was a surprise film performance that captured his second Oscar, and gave new impetus to his career. It is also an interesting view on the importance of character, and how it can be intentionally smashed by those supposed to be building it up.Chris O'Donnell is Charley Simms, a teenager on a scholarship to one of the most elite prep schools in America. He works in the library. One day he and another student are the last two locking up the library, and they see three students (one is Bradley Whitford) trashing an expensive new automobile belonging to the pompous and unlikeable new headmaster Mr. Trask (James Rebhorn). Trask sees the activities and runs to his car, but the three boys scatter. He is pretty certain who they are, but he did not see them clearly. He does stop Charley and the other boy and demands to know what they saw. And here the problem begins that will mushroom until the film ends.Trask is a petty little snot-nose, and wants the heads of the three boys not so much because they did a wrong, but because they held him up to ridicule before the school body. Soon he is pressuring his two "witnesses" to cooperate, or face serious consequences (expulsion and probable social ruin). The other boy, your typical rich kid party animal, is weak and under additional pressure from his father (who'll ship him to the military if he does not knuckle under). Charlie is poor, and can be easily swatted, but Trask is willing that if Charlie cooperates there is nothing the school won't do for him when he heads for a high university career.It is Thanksgiving weekend, and Charley is not going home to Oregon. He sees that there is a blind officer who wants to go to New York City for the holiday, and needs an assistant. It is Lt. Col. Slade, and Charley goes to offer his services, only to find Slade a bitter and prickly man. He was once a promising military figure (he was an aide to President Lyndon Johnson) but he lost his eyesight in a stupid trick he was playing, and was retired from the military. Although he has a good pension he feels his life is in tatters.The two go to Manhattan, checking into a first rate hotel, and enjoying the sites (as much as Slade can enjoy it, or Charley for that matter due to the crisis back at the school). But the two click, and Slade begins seeing in Charley the son that he would always have liked to have. Highlights of the trip include a wonderful moment when Charley and Slade (who can pretend he can see) test a magnificent convertible on a deserted twelfth avenue in Manhattan on Sunday morning with Slade driving while Charley keeps an eye on potential dangers. Slade also is still quite the lady's man, the title being a reference to his enhanced sense of smell of women's perfumes.In the end Slade learns what the situation is for Charley, who cannot depend on anyone to help him (his father is long gone from his life, and his step-father could not care less about him). Slade ends up with Charlie at the conclusion - a hearing where Trask is going to break both his witnesses to get at the three guilty parties. And while the other boy somewhat caves in, Charley just can't bring himself to say anything.SPOILER COMING UP: Slade is the one who humiliates Trask. He announces that whatever Charley failed to do to satisfy the little headmaster he was not a snitch, and that the ideals of the school are dying in the hands of the headmaster who'd break the spirit of the boys there for his own pettiness. The quote in the Summary Line is part of Slade's speech, in answer to Trask commenting about the great men who came out of the prep school. What good of having these great men to talk of if the very character building blocks that are sought are demolished by the likes of Trask? Slade points out to the students and teachers that if they leadership they should stick to Charley who won't snitch as opposed to the other fellow and the three idiots who caused the prank but lack the spirit to confess and face punishment. Slade's speech does the trick, and Charley is not punished.In the end one senses the two men will remain close. It seems right that they should.Oh, I kept referring to the other witness without telling who he is. It was a surprise when I watched the film recently. The character, George Wills Jr., is a party animal type - not really bright and his father has paved his way in with money and donations. I knew someone like that in my college - he was a nice guy but a heavy drinker. He died prematurely (before his own father) in 1989, from the results of his heavy drinking. The character of George Wills, Jr., helpless in the hands of his dad and Trask (though he tries to limit the damage of his "testimony") was played by the young Philip Seymour Hoffman. It's interesting to see a budding personality of the screen in an early performance of promise. Within fifteen years Hoffman too would have his best acting Oscar.As for my old college acquaintance, this is dedicated to the unfortunate Donald.</fullReview>

When you look at your watch you won't believe 2 1/2 hours has passed.Pacino carries the movie with one of the best performances ever put on film. Like Anthony Hopkins' Hanibal Lector in The Silence Of The Lambs, this kind of acting is raw and utterly hypnotic.Martin Brest directs with detail and confidence, you feel you're in good hands. The touching moments, and there are many, never come off as schmaltz; the moments that stretch believability stay just on the right side of that line through this sturdy, very well-handled direction.When it's all over you'll feel you have just digested the perfect celluloid meal - very full and very satisfied.</fullReview>

It's a moving story that can be likened to some that have come since, like "With Honors" (1994) and "Good Will Hunting" (1997), in their sentimental coming of age story manner, due to a relationship developed with a mentor type figure. It's really just a character study with a big time director (for the time at least) and a major star, which is a combination not often seen out of Hollywood, so they should get some praise for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris O'Donnell doesn't need to be in this movie. Instead, Pacino needs a guide dog following him throughout, to whom he can rant whenever it pleases him (meaning Pacino). O'Donnell is essentially a vacuum in this film, there to provide sheepish counterweight to Pacino's bluster.This is a fun movie to watch, for a lot of reasons. Pacino's lectures on the beauty of women, an incredible tango sequence with the beautiful Gabrielle Anwar, and a painful but humorous intra-family fight over Thanksgiving dinner are just a few of the great scenes this movie has to offer. But other scenes, like the overacted and overpreachy Pacino lecture near the end, make me wonder why the director didn't skip making a movie and just give Pacino a two-hour monologue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not care if anyone says that The Godfather is Pacino's film! His character was full of integrity! Granted he was blind, Frank Slade was still very perceptive on Life. O'Donnell's character was sappy at first but, Pacino taught him a few lessons on standing up for himself against all his rich snotty colleagues. The film has great characterizations especially those of Pacino and O'Donnell. I quite fancy that famous "hoo-ah"! ha ha ha ha! The best scene was the Baird courtroom scene in which he tells off that snob master James Rebhorn. Another good scene is the tango and the scene in which Pacino tries to do away with himself that was very powerful and extremely eloquent!

The pair seem worlds apart at the outset and it is no surprise that Charlie already regrets taking the job, especially after having been indirectly caught up in trouble at school. Despite it's considerable length, the film keeps the attention of its audience, through the old man's quirky and amusing attitude to life. Ultimately moving, this film is a joy to watch from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favourite films. The story is interesting and engrossing, the acting powerful and the sentiments spot on. Considerateness and sincerity win over cynicism in a superbly crafted school hall scene at the end. Pacino is at his very best. The title seems to me to mislead somewhat, since the response to blindness is not the first thing to enter one's head on hearing it. Yet it is a very romantic film. Except for a very brief interlude with the sweet Miss Anwar, it is without a leading lady. I do enjoy the work of these very meticulous directors. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

It was the most amazing film. Al Pacino couldn't have been any better if he actually was blind. It is so moving and intelligent that few films can match it. The performances were staggering; Al Pacino being the perfect mix of tough but sensitive on the inside; the script was perfect and the directing left me in the state of shock and amazment. It is a hell of a ride ( at 2h 30 min long ) but the twist at the end and the truth of it makes this time well spent. It deserves no less than 10/10.</fullReview>

I notice a new riff every time I watch it - tonight it was when Chris O'Donnell asks for Pacino's gun, he tells him it's a "weapon" or "piece", never a "gun", then a minute later, exasperated, tells him "I'm not givin' you my f***in' gun!" (yes, they did that on purpose, you fools!) Stuff like that cracks me up and Pacino works a great script and a great character.Lest you think this is a comedy or something, let me assure you the movie does have a message. In fact, it's got two or three, but it's never heavy-handed about it, which I appreciated as well. Even Chris O'Donnell is good in this movie, and that's saying something (seen him as Robin?)If you haven't seen Scent of a Woman, you're definitely missing out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7.9/10 rating?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched that movie last night, well 95% of it, after that I threw in the towel. Specifically during the scene where Pacino started to cross the street against a red light. Why all the hype about this so-called masterpiece? The basic scenario was good and would have made a great believable story but Pacino's regular philosophical diatribes started getting on my nerves after a while. Not 20 minutes before the end of the movie I told my wife that I just couldn't take any more so I went to bed, not even caring how the story ended. I don't want to get into the silly scenes of the movie; there were too many.A rating of 7.9/10? Give me a break! :-(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent drama with an optimistic message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Scent of a woman" perhaps for the 20th time and it touched me like it had touched me the first time I watched it. It gives the positive message that another great movie ("As good as it gets") gives: in spite of all hardships, life is worth living! Even if there is too much "testosterone" in this movie(there are few feminine characters in the story who are, I must admit, delicately and non-mysoginistically presented!)the male actors are magnificent, starting with the future Oscar-awarded Phylip Seymour Hoffman and continuing with young Chris O'Donnel who is extremely natural and convincing( I am still unsure if I liked Chris O'Donnel or Al Pacino most!)As for this great actor, Al Pacino, he is the reason for which "we, the people" are forever bewitched by the charms of the cinema...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>trite pile of crap. The only ten stars I saw is when I pitched over sideways and struck my head on my end table. Every part was over acted except Charlie, who was hardly even present. At best this movie deserves to be dispatched to the Lifetime Network where all such easily digested confections belong. I didn't believe one character throughout. Most of the situations came directly from Hollywood's rather large can of corn.Who haaaa...............as the stomach to watch this mess again?

		<shortDescription>One of Pacino's very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like or admire actors, there is so much to love in Al Pacino. Having consistently given 100% of his talent over a long career, he is among a very small group of actors in any language who evoke epithets that verge on hero worship. He takes us to places in human experience that we often are too timid to explore on our own and we gratefully acknowledge the courage, we are thankful for having it portrayed for us. Unlike Brando, who hated what he was best at, Pacino continues to shine on, using his demons to craft and create penetrating and powerful re-creations of humanity, often on a large scale.The premise of this film is quite believable. Pacino's character is so burnt out that at any moment we expect him to either shoot at someone (a version of a blind mans 'road rage') or else see him destroy himself. And, this is the thread that runs through his character until the very end - but I won't spoil that. Pacino's character is meaty, deep, troubled, worldly, street wise, tough, bitter, frustrated. In short, many facets that sound a lot like Pacino. Would it then surprise us so much that his performance is so volcanic, cutting, as it probably does, closer to his own soul than we know? A true mensch of the "method school", he has dug into his own essence and what comes pouring out is so hot that Pacino just overwhelms the picture with his presence. There is in his character so much potential, but did you notice that we do not know all that much about him? He was a tough ass army man, attached to waiting on Lyndon Johnson. He relates the story several times in the movie but I get the impression that he hated this type of army service. He also reveals that he had first hand knowledge of the gory mess of war, perhaps in Vietnam. Again, we are not given too many details and we do not learn all that much about him. What we do know is that because of a foolish act (perhaps in a drunken state) he ended up blinding himself in an accident. The more we watch Pacino's character unwind, the more we (can) assume that this event might have much more to do with his incipient self-destructive (perhaps self-loathing) demons, than merely an accident. Did he want to blind himself, having just seen enough and having taken in enough pain for one lifetime? It's worth considering. Again, we do know that he is embittered and that his vision went from partial vision to total blindness over the last half year. So, when his young student shows up to take "care" of him over a weekend, he has arrived when the earthquakes have already been coming on and the full volcano is now erupting. Pacino's character has tipped over the edge and is ready to exit his pain. That he comes to change his mind is a surprise both to us and to him. Chris O'Donnell as Charlie Simms both irritated and then satisfied me. I was at first put off by how weak he seemed. Sure he had to face a furnace and his lines were not confrontational. He was supposed to be young, fresh, inexperienced, naive, etc. What I found a bit disappointing is that O'Donnell was either too young an actor or too shallow for the role. He just wilted under the withering storms that Pacino kept expelling. Pacino had little trouble mopping the floor with this young guy and after a while we just wished that some spine would be found to stand up and push back. Nothing. Later in the film I decided that to accept that Simms was just that: young, tender and just not blackened by the torment that inhabited Pacino's character. The contrast is a weakness in the film and it could have been even finer had the director urged O'Donnell to put up some resistance and thrown a few left hooks. Leaving this weakness aside, the story as it is keeps you glued to your chair. The thanksgiving dinner Pacino suckers O'Donnell into taking him to adds layers of self-loathing to his character. Had he gone ahead with his original plans, he would have left his family with the iron clad conviction that this was one bad dude, one hateful shell of a man that thankfully was no longer in their lives to dirty their shadows with. As he leaves the dinner, having upset everyone as much as possible, he pauses to admit to his brother "I'm no good, never was". Later in the film when he shouts out "I'm in the dark here" we now know it's a very lonely and hateful darkness and in this space almost anything can come about. Just like you can say "...there was a lot of love to share", this was a man with a lot of rage to share and share it he insisted on. The school-court scene is of course where Pacino makes a surprise visit. His speech, quoted by everyone, just about burns the house down, as he laments he would have done five years earlier. The beauty of this film takes place at that moment; he has clearly saved much more than Charlie Simms. He has saved his own soul, which was so much convinced that a final leap into the dark hole of death was the only answer left in a life turned cancerous. That moment is the catharsis we hoped for and we leave the film feeling sure that two good men will not take the road to oblivion. The road to perdition was transformed to the road to salvation. What a film. Pacino so deserved the Oscar. May he gain more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, excellent story. A movie you should want to see over and over.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pacino gives an amazing performance. You love him, you hate him, you love him. The tango scene should go down as one of the all-time classic scenes. The supporting cast is superb. O'Connell gave the perfect "quiet" performance so that Pacino could shine. Kudos to O'Connell for his portrayal. I understand the story is a remake of an Italian film. To Pacino's credit, he did not watch the Italian version until production ended. While the film was long, I didn't want it to end. The school "trial" allowed Pacino to give another sterling performance. I found myself even applauding the chauffeur for his limited performance. To cap off the movie, the final scene with the two children was the perfect ending. One of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

Then I was 14 or so and saw this movie on television. I know some people say it's overrated, and that's their right, but it's such an intense character study that I just fell in love with movies after watching it. There are scenes in the movie like driving scene, the dinner with Josh Lyman, the dancing at the restaurant and the climactic hotel room scene... just outstanding. I proudly own and watch this one to this day, and hokey or not, I still love that final speech. Take THAT you no good dean!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Scent of a Woman'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino gives one of his best performances as Lt. Colonel Frank Slade. This blind and retired colonel is certainly a bitter and disagreeable man. Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a college student, realizes this immediately after taking a thanksgiving weekend job to look after the colonel. Simms, being a non-financially secure student, reluctantly accepts the job. What Simms doesn't know is that the colonel plans to go to New York, where he plans to live the high life, make love to a beautiful woman and blow his brains out.All of the performances in the film are of the excellent variety. O'Donnell, giving a charming and heartfelt performance that matches up well with the Slade's harsh and amusing antics and provides stability to the film. But this is Pacino's show, he is definitely at the top of his game in this fiery and touching performance. In the best scene of the film, a tango dance between Slade and a gorgeous woman (Gabrielle Anwar), we see the colonel's compassionate side that Pacino plays with much tenderness.Even though the subplot involving Charlie facing a dilemma with regards to snitching on his classmates is definitely weak and things are tied up to cleanly at the end of the film, it is still a fine piece of filmmaking. It's great to watch Pacino work his acting chops in creating something so memorable.Rating: (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie (spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people say that this movie is too long, boring and a chick flick. Wrong, very wrong and dead wrong. Although there isn't much "action" the movie is very good. You meet Chris O'Donnell as the student who agrees to watch the blind retired officer played masterly by Al Pacino. The journey takes them both to New York and here the friendship evolves. Chris finds out that Al Pacino is planning to kill himself at the end of the weekend. But after the weekend is over, Frank Slade (Al) has a new view on life and so does Charlie Simms (Chris) I really think this is a good movie and those who say differently probably love coyote ugly and wild wild west :) I give this movie a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scent of a actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May contain Spoilers: A blind man could even enjoy a Al Pacino movie by just the sound of his voice, and I dont think I'm exeggerating that notion. I think Al Pacino could play a performance without saying one word or just lay in a bed(as Denzel did in the Bone Collector) , I mean you can place him in the opposite and make it difficult but he will just squabble his way through somehow, breaking out and shining. He is defined as a masterpiece by almost every moviegoer and I couldnt agree more and this movie just exemplifies how much authenticity Al Pacino embarks on and continues even today and tomorrow.... I watched this movie once when I was around 12 and loved it and just watched it tonight for the second time and loved it even more. A beautiful film with a beautiful performer to make it sail and there isnt really much I can say when I'm talking about Pacino. He is always worth watching no matter what movie he is in(Revolution). He is always method acting into each character, giving the character raw energy and dynamic portraits that are like paintings in a gallery, his magic is so rare that when you try to wonder where it comes from or how it was created it is gone and into another character in a blink of a eye and thats how swift Pacino is, he can really fool you with his characters and even though he is older now and not as enlightening with roles compared today to yesterday he is still fun to watch and only time will tell when you get to see him explode into another role because there are so many and I'm sure he will give us many more great explorations into his character odyssey's before his time on earth is complete. The most beautiful thing you can experience in this movie is Pacino's brute attitude and negative charge in the beginning proceed into New York where he is going through with his 'plan'! The school part as people thought was unecessary to the film actually contributed well for the films final scene and I think Pacino's womanizing ways in many scenes were brilliantly done and showed you why that year he easily won the oscar. It's hard tip toeing through this without giving much input as I wont because this is definitely one you have to venture out on your own so I wont get as deep but for Pacino there is only one word to sum up this exquisite, sublime actor......Hoorah!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino makes this movie work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scent of a Woman had the potential to really suck. Dumb storyline and the hideous casting of Chris O'Donnell. Chris O'Donnell's acting style seems to be "I'm going to try and be as white bread and annoying as possible." Al Pacino is what makes this movie fun and funny to watch. Pacino's Lt.Col. Frank Slade (Ret), is one of the most colorful characters that he has ever played and has a lot of fun with Frank's biting dialogue. The end scene is quite a fire breather. It's too bad that Pacino didn't have a good co-star to match his talent or at least come near it. Bottom Line: If you like Pacino, you'll love this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happens when a boy searching for answers meets up with an old man searching for happiness. You get Scent of a Women. This coming of age tale stares Chris O'Donnell as a poor boy going to a rich university through a scholarship. But one night him and another student see something they shouldn't have and not telling on them could cost him his scholarship. But it's Thanksgiving weekend and a decision can't be made until returning Monday. So strapped for cash he decides to make a few hundred bucks by taking a job looking after a women's uncle while her and her family go off for the weekend. Now we meet Al Pachino as an old, grumpy, profane, blind veteran. What comes ahead is a journey through the trails and tribulations of life. See Pachino has a plan. As soon as his family leaves he takes O'Donnell to New York where he planes to eat a fancy meal, have Thanksgiving diner with his brother, make love to a beautiful women then go back to his hotel room and "blow his brains out". Of course what becomes of this movie is a story that unfolds to pull on your heart strings and make you smile in joy both at the same time and ends with a climax so powerful you will want to get up out of your seat and cheer for Pachino as the tears role down your face. This film makes it very clear why Pachino is considered one of the finest actors to date. He gives one of his most effective performances to date here and thought it may turn off some of his fans of Scareface and Charlito's Way he does a bang up job here. So if your looking for an eve that will move you and touch you in a way never before and may even make you appreciate the value of live a little more, Scent of a Women is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino at his best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Godfather" series, "Carlito's Way", "The Dog Day Afternoon"... surely Al has always been known for those famous films and roles. However, of all his works, even though I am not an Al Pacino fan, I would raise both my thumbs for this work, which he won Academy Award for - Scent of a Woman. A truly heartwarming story with marvelous acting, righteousness and friendship. The speech at the end of thie film is most enjoyable and meaningful! I am especially touched when he said "Integrity, courage, are the stuff leaders should be made of" and felt his strong courage and a heart for truth when he criticizes Mr. Trask and the meeting. Yes, he's blind. But he sees much clearly than anyone does; yes, he may seem violent, but through conflicts and togetherness with Charles Simms, their friendship reveals. Like Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, Al succesfully interpret a blind man and his heart for righteousness and his friend Charles Simms.However, there is something I don't understand. The story doesn't seem to have to do with the title. But the greatness about this film is not to be doubted and questioned. This is Al Pacino's best work!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just this movie last night, and already I want to watch again. It's a movie that grows on you, and teaches you something new everytime to watch it. Al Pacino is absolutely stunning, in the best performance of his career, and though he had never won an Oscar before he made this movie, the Oscar he receieved for his performance was well worth it. It is impossible to tell anything about the storyline without really giving away the story. All that can be said is that the end is one of the best testaments to hope ever made for a motion picture, even though it isn't the ending that is expected. The language does get a little tiring though, and there are parts where the language is just crude, but if it is possible to look past that, the movie is a wonderful testament to what the human spirit can do. See the movie and you won't be dissapointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd have to say one of the most underrated films ever. It's not even in the IMDb 250 which I find hard to believe that Monsters inc. is there.Its a real classic film that makes you feel so good at the end like Shwshank Redemption and On the waterfront. Al Pacino is as always fantastic with his only best actor Oscar for his portrayal as the colonel who is blind. He is brilliant at playing blind and very convincing. Chris O'Donnell is brilliant as well which surprised me after seeing Batman and Robin.The scene where the colonel has a 45 to his head is great and really chocked me up. It is the most significant scene to the film because it changes the colonel's way of looking at things forever. When you see both of them with tears in their eyes you realize for the first time that they are very similar to each other. The chemistry between the 2 actors is amazing and intense. The scene when he dances and the ferrari scene are pure magic.I think Martin Brest forgot about the colonel asking Charlie to be his adopted son because that would've made the film even better if he had adopted him at the end. For me the ending is fantastic with the whole school watching Al Pacino win his Oscar with an amazing speech that will make even the most horrible people smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might have been half decent if it wasn't so LOOOOOONG!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can count on both hands how many films clock in past 2h30 and actually succeed. And believe me this is no Godfather. How Al Pacino could have won an Oscar for this film and missed out on the two Godfather films still has me puzzled. This film has a few clever scenes, particularly the tango scene in the restaurant, but they're surrounded by terribly long, dreary scenes that seem to neither go nowhere nor have anything to do in terms of plot value. And that's the main problem with this film; there's very little in the way of plot value. You could cut an hour from this film and trim some of the repetitive Pacino monologues and you'd have a decent film. But some scenes, which could be good, just drag on far too much. The driving scene, for example. Cut half of the driving scene off and you have a strong scene. As it is, it's just plain boring. Same goes for the great final monologue, cut the intro to shreds and ease up on the speech, and it would be a very powerful scene. As well, Chris O'Donnell simply can't act. I've yet to see a film he's in where I was impressed with his acting. I can think of half a dozen actors who could've done two hundred percent better...like Ethan Hawke or Ed Norton...or even River Phoenix (bless him!). There were a few bright spots, one being Gabrielle Anwar. A very small role, but she was charming and had a wonderful presence. Her charisma played beautifully off of Pacino's forward character. As well, Phillip Seymour Hoffman had a too small role, but he played it perfectly, especially in the awkward final scene. Wasn't up to his fabulous role in Boogie Nights, or his stand-out performance in State and Main, but it was strength where there was little else. Overall: wasted talent and a waste of film. The strong potential is ruined by the yawn-filled monotony. If it was 1h45 I'd probably rate it a seven or eight, but as it stands: 5/10.</fullReview>

He has lost his sight, and he tries to put an end to his life because he has been left with no motivations or interests in life, but in the course of the story a young man who works as his helper causes him to realize the value of existence.The story at the beginning seems appealing, but after a while, it becomes unbelievably predictable. I kept guessing the ending all the way through the movie. Most movies with this kind of story have a happy ending. The scene where Frank (Al Pacino) tries to kill himself is overdone, and I kept laughing at it, because it was so obvious that he wouldn't succeed. I don't understand why Al Pacino won an Oscar for this movie. He was better in Insomnia.

Al Pacino's performance was interesting, but aside from the annoying mannerisms like "Haaaaah!" he never escapes the ol' Pacino shouting match cliches. I hate to say it, but the emperor has no clothes -- Pacino has a great deal of screen presence but surprisingly little acting ability, he plays the same basic character in every film I've ever seen him in. The plot of the film itself was interesting and engaging, but "great" is not a word I'd use to describe this movie. In fact, I'd barely even use the word "good." Decent entertainment with likeable characters is more like it, but the film ultimately has nothing new to say that hasn't been said a thousand times already (unless the "deep message" here is "great men and leaders don't snitch on their friends"). 5/10, and if you see anything 'deep' in it then you just need to get out more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Radiates like sunshine from its cosmic center.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie bears the unflattering moniker "remake." True, it is an adaptation of 1974's "Profumo di donna", but it is so much more. Al Pacino, a living legend, delivers a spectacular performance. Despite landmark performances in Any Given Sunday, Donnie Brasco, Carlito's Way, The Godfather Trilogy, Glengarry Glen Ross, Scarface, Cruising, Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico and others, and even after multiple Oscar nominations, Pacino never scored the homerun. This time he hits one out of the park.Pacino is Lt. Colonel Frank Slade, a retired officer blinded by an accident he caused when drunk. Now he lives with his sister and wallows in what's left of his life, and it's precious little. He dreams of his former life filled with power, prestige and, most of all, the scent of a woman. Along comes Chris O'Donnell as a prep school student in need of a job. He reluctantly agrees to be Pacino's escort on a last hurrah trip to New York. But The Colonel has a dark purpose, and therefrom arises the story.I'm not going to tell you how it unfolds. Suffice it to say, it radiates like sunshine from its cosmic center; Pacino. He is magnificent. Proud and yet humiliated. Powerful and powerless. But always in charge. And even blind he can kick the crap out of everyone and everything in his path.On these levels, the movie is perfectly satisfying. But underneath is a thought provoking premise. A young man learns to savor the true pleasures of life from a broken and blind man bent on ending his own life. A very young Philip Seymour Hoffman is suitably disagreeable, a trait that appears to come naturally to him, as the unprincipled rich boy who will sell out his friends to save his hide. James Rebhorn is the headmaster, a 90's version of Jeffrey Jones' Edward R. Rooney in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. And Bradley Whitford, of The West Wing, is the wiseacre nephew who pushes Uncle Frank a little too far.Strangely enough, the dark premises from which this movie proceeds lead to a celebration of the joy of living. Beautiful, moving, touching and revealing. Watch it again. You've probably forgotten how good Pacino is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remake of original with Gassman eighteen years earlier.Scent has a number of things going against it. The original has nary a sympathetic character; Al Pacino bellows his lines, screams his scenes; O'Donnell plays too stiff and unsympathetic a wimp; the school subplot comes out of nowhere; etc.And I have seen this movie I don't know how many times, and always felt the same: empty. I was glad Pacino won an Oscar for it, but have always felt it was an occasion to give the award, not the reason for it.So why, when I see it again after so many years, can I suddenly not pull away? Why does it water my eyes and rip at my gut? After several viewings it seems to draw one in like an intense morality play, a rite of passage.There are some wines that are not ready for drinking at harvest or even soon after, but which get much better with aging. Some turn into legendary wines; others improve but will never be great wines, but not for not trying. Some seem to try very hard.I think Scent is such a wine. It's Hollywood, it's scripted in Hollywood fashion, it doesn't have the world's easiest premise to begin with, it may never be top drawer, legendary, but give it time and you realise you have a rewarding experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Our first introduction to Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade is behind a thick wall of smoke, sitting next to a bottle of Jack Daniels. He yells at Charlie Simms a lot, the kid who will be taking care of him in order to earn money to spend for his trip to his family during Christmas. He also seems to be stuck in the past, in the days when he was in the army. Oh, and he's blind. Charlie is instantly scared, and is in a lot of trouble in school. He goes to a (fictional) prep school for college, and was seen near the people that were setting up a prank as they were setting it up. However, only him and George Willis Jr were there to see exactly who it was that did it, but George is in the group of people that set up the prank. These kids are spoiled and ridicule Charlie for being poor, as well as ridiculing the headmaster for thinking he is above them thanks to a Jaguar car that he was recently gifted, while also pretty much thinking they are above everyone else. Despite Charlie thinking he is only going to stay a day with the Colonel, once they go to New York (unexpectedly) and he doesn't make it in time for his train. He soon learns Colonel Frank is planning on spending all of his money on a night with his family, a nice night and a nice woman (one of the two things he says he loves, the second being Ferraris). The fact that Colonel has lost his sense of sight and the thing he loves most is women shows how much he has lost, since the only thing he has to go on is their voice, and, well... their scent. Frank learns that George is in trouble and his advice is to "take cover" rather than to face the consequences, as that is what Frank has always done. George doesn't even like these guys, but something is telling him not to do it.George naturally grows closer to the Colonel, especially after one revealing (and incredibly tense) dinner with his family that shows that not even his family loves him. And it ends with the Colonel choking his niece for several seconds for calling Charlie "Chuck". The most important part of this scene however is when he admits he is a bad person at the end of the scene, showing that he is aware of his flaws. The next day Charlie and Frank go to eat, and end up meeting a girl in a bad relationship who Frank ends up dancing with and Frank is reminded of why he is still living. He is reminded of the pleasures of life, and how the tango, unlike life, "doesn't get tangled for good, you just keep on tangoing". That night George takes the bullets away from Frank to make sure that he won't kill himself. Frank even gives him the last one. The next day, however, Frank doesn't look well. Then George finally gets Frank to drive a Ferrari and it is both terrifying and somewhat funny. He goes way faster than he should and almost crashes a multitude of times, but afterwards, the thrill is gone. Frank goes back to the hotel room, asks George to go get him cigars and liquor and suits up to kill himself. When George gets back however he simply won't let him do it, and from here, Frank points the gun at him. He can't stand to see him sell out to his principles life and go on living a boring and unfulfilled life, because George has too much integrity for that and that's rare. But George still won't give up. As Frank says, he's always stood up to people because it makes him feel important. George stands up to them simply because he has integrity. So that's what George does to him. He reminds him of the great moments of life, like the Ferrari and the tango, and how his life could be those moments. Eventually Frank decides not to do it (but very nearly does) and the scene is both heart-rending and incredibly tense, and Pacinos performance in this scene, no, this movie (specifically this scene, the final scene, and the dinner scene) rival that of the greatest of all time and I mean that. The next courtroom scene show Frank's change in character as well as George's decision to take the right path in life. George doesn't even like the people that he is not snitching on, yet he will not sell out their lives to make his own better, and THAT is integrity. Frank knows many of the men who died in battle who were with him are better men than him, he knows facing the consequences of leading a good life are hard, which is why he has always chosen the easy way out. But being with George has made him realize, as proved by the final scene when Frank is playing with the children he was yelling at in the beginning, that life is only as good as you make it. If you try to have integrity and spread happiness and well being to those around you, even in the toughest situations, you will be happy in the long run. And even though that courtroom scene where Frank delivers his great monologue, and everyone starts clapping sounds a little cheesy, I feel it is earned by the film, because the journey that the characters had been on led them to that defining moment, and the message that comes with it is an important one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melodramatic but affecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made famous by the fact it featured a grandstanding Oscar winning Al Pacino performance and the career making turns of future Robin Chris O'Donnell and future Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman, Beverly Hills Cop and Midnight Run director Martin Brest's Scent of a Woman is a film that by today's standards is a tad too over the top and melodramatic to be highly praised but it's an at times affecting and emotionally powerful portrait of friendship and finding ones place in the world.Drawing out a seemingly simple set up of odd couple pair in the form of Pacino's blind and disgraced former Army Colonel Frank Slade and O'Donnell's baby faced and non-worldly wise prep school student/makeshift babysitter Charlie Simms going on a life changing weekend trip into a 2 and a half hour meditation on living, loving and tango dancing, Brest struggles to maintain a consistent momentum to the flow of the movie and after a lengthy lead up and a downright cheesy finale, Scent of a Woman stays afloat and becomes something more than it perhaps deserves to be thanks to Pacino and O'Donnell's intriguing partnering.In what's the very incarnation of an award baiting role, Pacino walks the very fine line of parody and an acting masterclass as the cantankerous and feisty Slade and while he walked away with the golden statue at the1993 Oscars it's hard to say how his performance would be regarded had it come to fruition in today's climate but one suspects a golden statue would not have fallen in his direction.It's a committed performance by Pacino but his over reliance on yelling of the phrase "hoo-wah" is nicely counteracted by O'Donnell's dialled down (sometimes too much so) turn as the well-meaning Charlie. Between the two actors they find a nice middle ground and make the hard to believe central premise of Scent work despite the fact it's never far away from being purely fanciful in terms of character decisions and the aforementioned over staged finale involving a college court of law.For all committed Pacino fans Scent of a Woman is must watch as it features the actors most flashy performance outside of Scarface and acts as a reminder as to just how dominate the now sporadically entertaining actor could be as well as a showcase for O'Donnell, who just never quite went on with the talent he showed in his early career.As for director Martin Brest whose career story is now Hollywood lore, Scent of a Woman marked the last noteworthy entry into the filmmaker's short filmography that was put to a swift and sad end by the one two double pronged attack of cinematic stinkers Meet Joe Black and notorious movie crime that was the 2003 Bennifer led Gigli.3 ? intense tango's out of 5</fullReview>

The whole movie is a delight to watch and include all sort of thrills and joys that any movie can offer. That's the Al-Pacino I always wanted to see. This movie includes love care and a man's determination and courage. And a well deserved Oscar given movie to Al-Pacino. Although He should get that way before when "serpico" came out or in "carlitos way". Other actors well acted too throughout the movie but Al-Pacino really dominated the acting part and also direction is done in quite a way that it make the movie more love-able. Really liked the movie and I give it 10/10 on any scale of filming and acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreaking, heartwarming and absolutely remarkable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is undoubtedly one of the best and most emotionally mixed movies I've ever seen. It's heartwarming, yet heartbreaking at the same time, all its contradictions are what makes it a great film.Frank Slade, the old, clumsy, self-centered, rude and blind man is a person we all know and have dealt with (perhaps he's not blind at all cases) and to see him on screen portrayed to absolute perfection was great to see. That complicated, philosophical man with the pessimistic view of life yet he can come up with stuff like "No mistake in the tango, Donna, not like life. Simple. That what makes the tango so great. If you make a mistake, get all tangled up, just tango on!". he couldn't be more right. And Charlie Simms, the awkward, timid young man that I suppose we can all identify with. The poor college student that feels threatened continuously due to his lack of "support". The support that he later gains. I saw in these two the father-son relationship that they both lacked and craved, they found it in each other. And because it was chosen by both of them, and wasn't inevitable, it was stronger and more truthful than any other father-son relationship. They absolutely loved each other. They looked tailor-made for each other, and they indeed were.And Al Pacino. What can you honestly say about him. One of the greatest actors ever. It came as a shock to me when I knew that he didn't win but one academy award. They should be given to him left right and center whether or not he makes a movie, that's how good he is! He absolutely executed the role to absolute perfection, in fact he ejaculated all over the role's Hoo-ah if you will! Frank Slade was a blind man. A blindness that he was compensated for by his remarkable sense of smell, he could indeed identify a woman's scent effortlessly in a blink of an eye. And if he had been a real person alive among us today, he would have identified the scent of a great movie, the scent of the scent of a woman..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woo Haa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm at the age where the movies I watched in my youth have been reduced to flashes: a scene here, a quote there, or maybe even just a mood. In my efforts to re-watch/re-experience some of the movies of yesteryear Scent of a Woman crossed my desk. Or should I say, Scent of a Woman was being offered on Amazon Prime which made it free to view. In any case, I was pleased to watch it again with new eyes to really understand the movie.First of all, I never knew Phillip Seymour Hoffman was in the movie. Granted, he did play a small yet significant role and he wasn't the actor he was when he died, but it was still good to see him and have that, "OMG I didn't know he was in this!" moment. My God did he play such a good rich snobby a-hole. I couldn't help but disdain him in this movie.Secondly, I'd forgotten that the oft sampled "Woo Haa" from Al Pacino was from this movie. Somehow I thought it was from a lot later movie like "Every Given Sunday" or something in that date range.As for the movie, it was a classic. Al Pacino plays Frank Slade, a surly old retired military man that became blind. He ended up at his nieces home for care because he annoys or outright angers everyone and she was the only one that would put up with him. He has no regard for social etiquette or the feelings of others, especially when it comes to his own family. Chris O'Donnell is Charlie Simms, a poor teenager attending Baird private school on a scholarship 3000 miles from home. To earn money he agrees to look after Colonel Frank Slade during Thanksgiving break.The movie hinged upon Al Pacino's performance as most of the movie was just him and Chris. Al Pacino certainly delivered. Not two minutes after Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade was introduced did I find myself wanting poor Charlie to tell him to jump off a bridge and leave him by his blind, lonesome self. Of course there would have been no movie then but there would have been a small bit of satisfaction.What the movie showed was that everyone has some good and everyone has at least a small part to play in improving the lives of others. Frank Slade, as embittered and abrasive as he was still had some endearing qualities and could still serve a purpose in bettering someone. The tenuous and patronizing relationship between Frank and Charlie grew in only the fashion that a Frank Slade relationship could develop; it was forged in the fires of Frank's drill sergeant tongue and his crusted still-beating heart.Really, if I enjoyed the movie for anything it was Frank Slade's speech at the end. Many a movie--especially dramas of a certain type--end with an impassioned and portentous speech, but not many of them are good or hit the mark. Scent of a Woman was the exception. Frank entered into a "I'll tell you" tirade in Frank Slade fashion that was only made more striking because of how it was given and the situation in which it was given. It was a wonderful way to end the movie although it didn't end exactly there. Yes, two-and-a-half hours of viewing was worth the three to five minutes of Frank Slade v. Baird School.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino puts in another tour-de-force performance in a flawed, but very impressive film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cash-strapped student Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell) takes a weekend job babysitting blind retired lieutenant-colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino). However, Charlie wasn't expecting Frank to decide to up and leave to New York albeit with a spare ticket for Charlie. Being the dutiful minder, Charlie tags along with Frank to New York which ultimately turns out to be a journey that Charlie is unlikely to forget.The story itself is rather predictable and is something we've seen time and time again; a buddy film where one party is naive and wet behind the ears and the other party is a hard-assed tough as nails individual whereby a personality clash immediately ensues. Of course the two individuals gradually bond and find some common ground (the narrative has to swing this way otherwise there wouldn't be much of a film). Despite the clichéd storyline, Scent From A Woman rises above these clichés and is a very good film for several reasons...I've no idea what the novel is like, but I thought that Bo Goldman's screenplay was pretty good and what I liked about it is that for the most part it is free from schmaltz and cheese. With Frank being blind, it would have been very easy to have turned this into a pity piece which not only would have made it a weaker film, but it probably would have made the film a waste of Al Pacino's talents. The film essentially has two strands to its story; 1) There is Frank's desire to live life to the full and 2) The various life-lessons that are experienced and shared between Charlie and Frank. Point 1 is quite fun, but doesn't offer enough to carry the film, but point 2 is really where the film is at its strongest. Although its heavily suggested that Frank is giving Charlie the life-lessons I believe that Charlie also gave Frank some valuable life-lessons too. For me, Frank was like a father-figure to Charlie and helped toughen him up and helped him to see things from a different perspective. Whereas Charlie made Frank realise that he had more to live for than he'd initially assumed - his excellent dancing skills, his gift of the gab etc. I think the question that is being asked here is would Charlie and Frank's lives have been different had they never met? Have they come away from their weekend together as better people? My answer to that question is Yes, but I realise this is purely subjective.Pacino's performance was amazing here and I always feel that portraying a blind person convincingly is a very difficult thing to pull off, but Pacino does it effortlessly. He shouts a lot here, but unlike his cartoonish performance in Scarface it works here (firstly because he is a retired lieutenant-colonel who is used to barking orders at people and more importantly because he's blind - he doesn't know how far people are away from him when he's speaking to them). O'Donnell does his best, but he is no match for Pacino - although he is good in the scene where he's talking Frank out of killing himself.As much as I enjoyed this film, I feel I need to draw your attention to some flaws with this picture; although Frank isn't necessarily painted as a pity figure here, I did find him to be somewhat of a martyr and not the most likable of individuals - this is made worse when we learn that he's always been an asshole which sometimes made his character a difficult person to care about. The Kangaroo Court scene at the end of the film was quite enjoyable, but was a little too Hollywood for my liking.Still this film gets a lot more right than wrong and although it isn't the most uplifting of films, it's a film that is funny, chilling, and heartfelt at various stages and is a film that is worthy of your time.</fullReview>

This film shares a glimpse of that part of the human experience and does it in a very unique manner. Two equally matched spirits operating on opposite ends of the spectrum find a balance and symbiosis that is difficult to create. Amid a seemingly one dimensional bucket list formula, this film delivers strong character development, superior acting and several wonderful surprises. Little bits of spice are added throughout to maintain audience engagement. The conclusion is a well written wrap up that pulls it all together in a way that leaves the experience feeling complete.

		<fullReview>Its hard to know what to make of Scent of a Woman. There is a lot of bytes of internet space consumed criticising this movie for its Best Actor Oscar, and I can see some justification for it. But I decided it was vital to watch it with an open mind.Scent of a Woman is a great deal of fun to watch, with fine performances, a witty screenplay and a fun atmosphere permeating the whole thing. As weekend/roadtrip movies go, its right up there. The premise is established from the get-go - Frank Slade is going to have one last good weekend before he commits suicide, and its down to the out-of-his-depth Charles Simms to help him with that battle. Its pretty predictable, but still a heap of fun.It is very difficult to gage Al Pacino in this movie. The first impression that he gives is of an overacted caricature, who behaves like no real person ever would. That will leave a sour taste in your mouth instantly. He shouts every other line and snaps the rest. However, just like the character grows on Charlie, Pacino's performance grows on the viewer. He is effortlessly charming and charismatic and yet completely obnoxious and difficult. He's a burden or a blessing on everyone around him, depending on what he wants. And Pacino is supremely convincing as a blind man - in the scene where he drives the Ferrari, I was almost paralysed in fear. In the end, Pacino has done better work, but I have decided that to call this the least deserving Best Actor of all time is a dramatic overstatement.The rest of the cast slots around Pacino best they can, and a fair few of them get some good moments. O'Donnell is not a bad actor, but he's out of his depth with Pacino, and that suits the film's atmosphere perfectly. Two late acting talents also shine in their smaller roles - James Rebhorn as the uptight and pompous Principal, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman's George Willis Jr gives a superb indicator of the magnificent career to come. The screenplay is great fun, full of wit, insults and memorable moments. The tango scene between Donna and Slade is going down as one of my favourites. There are a few sickly sweet and predictable clichés tucked here and there, but we forgive them through satisfaction with the finished product. The pacing is good for the most part - although I feel 20 minutes could have easily been trimmed from the third act. Ultimately, I feel the worst thing that could ever have happened to Scent of a Woman is that it was the film that finally won Pacino his Oscar. Its eclipsed what should have been remembered as the bombastically fun and good spirited movie that it is.</fullReview>

And the kid has no idea what's in store for him. While all the prep school scenes are great, the rest of the film leaves something to be desired. The problem here, I think, is that this kid is way too calm and laid-back for a character like this to work. And the colonel doesn't fare much better. Sure, he's cold, but not nearly enough. Give them some bite, for crying out loud. I also didn't feel the chemistry either, something crucial to making a movie work.

One day, he witnesses that his friends prepares for a trick and is in a difficult situation. In order to earn the traveling expenses to go back to his house for Christmas, he takes a part-time job during Thanksgiving day. The job is to look after a blind man Frank who is a retired colonel during his family's absence. Unexpectedly, Charlie goes to New York with him. He is often confused because Frank is a very difficult person and quick-temperd. However, as some time passes, he gradually realises that Frank is actually very kind and attentive. The friendship between them comes out on their journey to New York. There are so many memorable scenes in the film which I can never forget is Frank's speech in front of the disciplinary action committee and students to prove Charlie's noble character. The film shows that both of them find hope for their lives again and live their lives positively.</fullReview>

It's gonna make you proud one day, I promise you."For me it was literally a breathtaking journey of 156 minutes only.I wish this journey could last much more longer.Because Scent of a woman changed my vantage point towards life in many aspects . Such an authoritative performance by Al Pacino.P.S. Frank's Tango with the young girl was such a pleasure of mind and so refreshing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scent of a woman : If this is an example of 'popular cinema' than its original version can be called "author cinema".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood film 'Scent of a woman' is about two men who learn some 'fundamental truths' about life. It features nice performances by American actors Al Pacino and Chris O'Donnell. On the one hand, it is the former character who shows viewers how a blind man can be more wise than normal people with eyes despite being treated badly by family members. On the other hand, one learns some bitter truths about school life through an honest boy whose preference for justness conveys that it would not at all be ethical to betray one's friends. As a good part of this film depicts school life without resorting to caricatures, one learns that it is the poor and weak students who are destroyed because of their integrity. This film also features an "American style philosophy" about honesty and integrity in the form of a brilliant speech delivered by Al Pacino who depicts all kinds of emotions ranging from anger, desperation and frustration. His performances are as meaningful and pertinent in 2014 as they were in 1993 when he won best actor Oscar for this film. Lastly, a brief word for intelligent cinéphiles : Italian director Dino Risi made the original film "Profumo Di Donna" in 1974 with actor Vittorio Gassman who played the role of blind army captain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some really good moments..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I merely state the obvious by saying that Al Pacino is a great actor. Over the years he has gained great presence and gravitas, and one can imagine that Chris O'Donnell might have been almost in awe of him.That relationship could have contributed to the movie. Of course Pacino might have overacted slightly, though who am I to say? He certainly played the part of an army officer, a bit too loud, a little too unforgiving both of himself and his 'carer'.But then you see a few absolute jewels of scenes, the main one being the dance with the lovely Gabrielle Anwar -- it almost makes the film worth seeing for that alone; I would argue one of the best dance scenes on the silver screen..And the final part when Frank justifies the boys actions and more-or-less tells the school principal where to get off.. Not too shabby</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We leave aside the Oscar and Al Pacino things. This movie is sublime. This is the kind of drama I wanna watch. I'm saying this because I'm not much of a drama watcher. I mean, drama is all about drama. Most of the time it's pretty boring. No feel, excitement, or passion inside.But this movie here, is entirely different. It brings the actual drama meaning and its capability to amaze audiences. We won't be forced to decide who's the good guy or the bad guy in the end. It's just a simple story which I'm sure happen around us all the time.There is school, student, blind old man (not your average blind old man though), women (this, we never got bored), part time job, conflict in the family and school. Imagine all of those things combine.Even if you're not much of a drama fans, I'll suggest you to watch it. I've known this movie for so many years but only have a desire to watch it some time ago which I regret because at first I think it's just a blah-blah drama movie. Turns out I couldn't be more wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's quite manipulative, but it's impossible not to get sentimental value out of it. Al Pacino is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. I admit it. It does undermine you by trying to manipulate your emotions by having a blind man as a lead character. It's easy to feel sympathy for a blind man, and for that it does manage to be manipulating. But it's so adroit with how it is executed I didn't care in the long run. Despite its manipulative nature, you can't help but feel sympathy for Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino) and Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell) because of their predicaments. I've seen a few reviewers compare this a bit to Dead Poets Society. That is true to a certain extent. It does resemble it a little bit, but like Dead Poets Society, Scent of A Woman manages to trigger major emotions out of you. Despite a couple of gripes, Al Pacino deserved his Oscar. He nails it 95% of the time, and gives a powerful performance, which is unforgettable. His gruff character is very memorable, and his great chemistry with the young Chris O'Donnell was vital. Their journey was a joy to watch. My favorite scene with the two of them was the Ferrari scene. I didn't see the need for the "Hoo-Hah" from Pacino, or some of the incessant yelling he would do at times. Some scenes called for it, and others didn't. His performance as a blind man is thoroughly impressive. He looked like a blind man, and I didn't think it was Al Pacino. He also has some classic monologue in the ending. It's a very powerful speech to say the least. I always felt The Godfather was overrated, so his Oscar here was deserved, and I felt he was better here, which is most likely a very unpopular opinion, but oh well. Chris O'Donnell is pretty good for the most part. He does have too much of a stupid, bewildered look on his face at times, but he has many good scenes that make up for it. I'm not a fan of his at all, ever since he was a nuisance as Robin in Batman, but he was good here. Bradley Whitford does what he does in a lot of roles, play a jerk, whilst Phillip Seymour Hoffman has a vital part in one of his early roles. Final Thoughts: It does play on your emotions, but due to Pacino's fantastic performance, and the enjoyable nature of the film, it's hard not to enjoy. See it8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman! Whoo-ah!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scent of a Woman is a character film study of the very finest. Al Pacino is the ideal man to play Lt. Col. Frank Slade. Pacino's perfect for Slade as Slade's perfect for Pacino. What would this movie have been with any other actor playing the part? Well, not as good, for starters. Al Pacino won his well-earned Oscar for this role. Pacino pours out passion as Col. Slade displaying a deep grief buried beneath his combustible fervor. Pacino exceptionally conveys moods, a master at conjuring emotion only with his presence, no spoken words being necessary. You feel Pacino's all-around performance in Scent of a Woman near as strong as any performance you can think of. Allow me to state that Chris O'Donnell is also perfect to play Charlie; I do believe it to be his only role where this statement is applicable. He stays back, sitting quiet letting Pacino lead, until he is needed and then O'Donnell is brilliant. Chris O'Donnell was impressive and he is a true star. Gabrielle Anwar was very well cast as well. Her role required a lesser known, fresh-faced actress and Anwar is beautiful for the part, she stars, and everybody should be familiar with her name. I love how Scent of a Woman's story is presented. Early on you're made aware that Charlie is to meet in front of the disciplinary committee at his boarding school on whether or not he witnessed his schoolmates pulling a prank on the headmaster who seeks to bribe Charlie with a trip to an Ivy League University for his testimony. But this won't come into play until the very last, thus, allowing us the entire movie to spend focusing on getting to know the blind Col. Slade in he and Charlie's growing relationship. Originally derived and excellently given story. Scent of a Woman messes about in painful drama the whole way through to the end when it then begins hitting heavily with compelling intrigue while during the fabulous courtroom scene. Slade gives a forever memorable, powerful speech on conduct and merit. Scent of a Woman is the lens into a beautiful life, the beautiful life of Lt. Col. Frank Slade. If every movie were as good as Scent of a Woman is, there wouldn't be so many damn bad movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie wasn't just about Al Pacino's brilliant performance; I also liked the conversations and the vocabulary the writer used. You know I used to believe that to know someone you should listen to their silence rather than their words; it's scientific! You see Light is much faster than sound, so to see things for what they really are you should abandon all your senses but the sight. I admit sometimes you hear someone talk and change your mind about the whole idea...The movie reminds me the few times in life when you find yourself standing at a precipice of a decision. When you know there will forever be a before and an after if you designated that moment as your own Prime Meridian from which everything else would be measured; would you get the courage to do the right thing regardless how tough it is?.</fullReview>

To be precise when Al Pacino says "But he's not a snitch". Following that moment, it's one helluva an awesome speech.The movie might have seemed a little stretched but didn't bother me much.P.S. - If you're an Al Pacino fan, you'll love this movie.

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino couldn't have asked for a better role than this and he couldn't have done more justice to it. A blind retired eccentric US Lt. colonel with all the wisdom in the world but an unproductive mindset. This movie takes you through a journey that Lt. Colonel Frank Slade takes with young Charlie (who's 'babysitting' him for the weekend) for a couple of days in New York; much to Charlie's disapproval, but without a choice. As Charlie develops a bond with the handicapped ex-army man, he discovers how entertaining, wise and interestingly instinctive Frank is, but at the same time overtly dominating, stubborn and frustrating to deal with. Charlie senses early on that something is constantly eating away at Frank from the inside and the money that Frank is splurging on a hired limo, expensive wines and hotels is just akin to a final list of 'things to do before you die'. Impossible to get along with, it was only something decisive that could make Frank appreciate the gem of a person Charlie was. That defining moment came when blind Frank, finally fed up of 'living in the dark' turns suicidal, but Charlie refuses to let him kill himself, even putting his own life on the line. What stood out in this scene was how Charlie finally refuses to be 'dismissed' as always by Frank and in an innocent and immature way (young as he is) stands up to Frank for the first time for the blind colonel's own good.But the best is saved for the last, when Frank realising that Charlie pulled him out of the dark, stands by him in Charlie's potentially career-derailing disciplinary committee at his school. Al Pacino delivers one of the best speeches in the history of cinema in this scene. His unconventional but highly moving and firm monologue directed to the headmaster attacks the deep-lying principles the school is built upon and the fallacy in its path of creating leaders for the future and preparing the students for manhood.This is a movie that does not depend on a brilliant plot ( some parts are predictable and could have been shortened), but thrives on a powerful ending and a breathtaking Academy Award winning "Hoo-Ha!" performance by Al Pacino !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first of all,this is warning to anyone whose about to read this review:"This review is biased and unfair since i am a die heart fan of Al Pacino." now lets cut the crap and see why you should watch this movie: 1.Al Pacino did an absolutely outstanding ,incredible and unadulterated performance of a straight forward ,interested ,funny guy who speaks his mind no who he is addressing .No wonder he won his 1st Oscar best actor award after 7 nomination. 2.the basic story line up is amazing ,very interested and entertaining throughout . 3.this movie is about a man who is so tired and tangled up in his life that he wishes to do a few things just before he kills himself. And i believe such a point comes in everyone's life ,so its a movie for everyone .And the way Al Pacino played such a complicated character , you can easily identify with it and fall in love with it. 4. Chris O'Donnell and other actors did a fantastic job too. 5. the movie is very famous for its incredible dialogues and the ending speech that Al Pacino delivers to the committee which is one of my favorite part too. now ,comes the hard part ,why you shouldn't watch this movie and probably the reasons why critics did not like this movie: 1.the story and the fact that a blind retired colonel took a 17 yr old boy on a surprise trip to New York against his interest uses him as a guide , might not sound convincing and reality related to some people(critics i mean). 2.the way Charlie( Chris O'Donnell ) convinced colonel frank(Al Pacino) to not kill himself was not good enough .That i felt too and completely agree with the disappointment of critics. In short , if you want to see well deserving Oscar winning beautiful acting masterpiece of one of the greatest actors of all time Al Pacino ,you would want to watch this movie again and again .... until you die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Whoever created women, must have been a genius", these words rightly describe the womanizer depicted by Al Pacino (Frank) and his ability to sense a beauty from far-way even with a fragile fragrance of her.Well, all this is the subtext. On the surface, Scent of a Woman is a cult classic about a blind man (Frank) who has lost all hope in his life and plans to kill himself but only after fulfilling his last few dreams. The story comes to life when a student Charlie visits Frank seeking a winter job and the voyage they together overtook after that.Al Pacino, a prolific actor, once again gives a commanding performance in this captivating movie with witticism embedded in his serious demeanor and was aptly assisted by Charlie. Both had their own set of problems and were in a dilemma whether to stand their ground or run for cover and give up.The crux of the movie comes at the end (apart from the scene where Charlie saves Frank from killing himself), when Charlie was about to be fired from his B-School on the ground of not being an informer to his Dean, Frank takes the center-stage and gives a scintillating speech which astounded not only the audience inside the scene but outside it as well and the stand out performance of Al Pacino helped him in winning many prestigious awards.The movie emphasize on the integrity and courage a man must possess in order to be leader and he should walk the path of principles and character only if his soul is non-negotiable.</fullReview>

The performance he delivered in Scent of a Woman would have blown his other performances into outer space. That's how good he was in this movie. If it wasn't for Al, this movie would probably not be very good.This film is about a prep school kid who needs money. He decides to get a job that deals with caring for a blind man. But what happens was not the job description the kid had in mind...Of course, Al Pacino is the star of this movie and he essentially carried this movie. His speech at the end of the film certainly got him the Oscar. He really took a risky part and it played off. I didn't like Chris O'Donnell too much. His character is way too wimpy for my taste.Overall, this is a brilliant masterpiece thanks to Al Pacino. The film is not as good as the Godfather trilogy, but Pacino is better than his Corelone portrayal. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1974 original version had Vittorio Gassman as the cantankerous blind army captain assigned an assistant to take him from Turin to Naples Italy. The American remake employs Al Pacino in a rocket propelled Academy Award winning performance as Colonel Frank Slade, a blind alcoholic looking to commit suicide. Slade hires a college student, Charlie Simms, a kid from a working class family who needs money to stay in school, to help him travel. The pair take a trip to the Waldorf Astoria in New York City and while at an exclusive restaurant, Slade tells his companion of his plans to end his life.They next stop at Slade's brother's house for Thanksgiving dinner and the family becomes canon fodder for the abrasive colonel. At another restaurant, they meet a beautiful woman waiting at a table, and Slade convinces her to dance a tango with him. The next day Charlie rents a Ferrari and and guides his blind employer in a test drive. A cop pulls them over but the pair con their way out of the situation.,The two become friends and Slade helps Charlie out with a situation at the college involving fellow students. The new Scent of a Woman is different, but a worthy remake with a towering Al Pacino.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're tangled up, just tangle on. -- Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched Scent of a Woman for a second time, I'm still impressed by the final speech made by Al Pacino, who played the blind Colonel Frank Slade. Frank Slade is a retired lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. army. He lost his eyesight to some stupidities a few years ago as he became cranky and gruff. Although he can't see, he really got a gift in telling the perfume of women's. Chalie Simms played by Chris O' Donnel is a prep school student who comes to Slade's house to earn some extras by "babysitting" him. Slade then takes Charlie to New York city where he plans to kill himself after fulfilling his last few wishes. Hence their adventure begins.Basically, it's a two-man movie centered on Colonel Slade and preppy Charlie. But the two really did a great job in the movie, especially the acting of Al Pacino as Colonel Slade. Al Pacino's interpretation of the cranky but perceptive blind Colonel is totally believable. He looks as natural as a blind man in the movie, and he draws a fine line between well-performing to overacting. People grows on the gruff Colonel quickly, and personally, all that left to me at the end of the movie is an original, funny and respectful man that I wish to make friends with.There are also some funny lines in the movie and Colonel Slade's words are always thought-provoking especially the final speech!! Needless to say, Al Pacino's Oscar of Best Actor is well-deserved for his excellent performance in this movie. Hoo-ha, thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino's Slade is heart-wrenchingly real. Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino's eyes and voice- there's nothing better than that in cinema. At least that's my impression after finally having seen ?Scent of a Woman". Al Pacino's Slade is heartbreaking, there's no embarrassment in saying it. There is a tremendous amount of sadness in his eyes, it's the sheer desperation of a passionate man trapped inside by his disability. He delivers his speeches with such incredible strength, heart-wrenching vulnerability and irresistible charm... And the whole thing will never descend into cheap melodrama. Pacino's eyes, as I was saying, make the entire movie, and it's amazing how he can display such subtle nuances despite not focusing on anything. Slade is a tragic figure and one of the most complex, memorable personalities ever created in film.Chris O'Donnell also deserves credit for his portrayal of another lost soul. It's hard to imagine someone else doing this part, that's how well he inhabits the role. The only problem is with the ?Hollywood style" unrealistically optimistic ending. On the other hand, the entire movie is so emotionally devastating up until the final scene, that I'm actually thankful it ended on a positive note.The moral lesson (Slade's courtroom speech) might be unfashionable these days, but I find it commendable, especially because it has become something of a rarity in cinema. No ending and no flaws in the script could possibly diminish Pacino's performance, which remains amazingly real and touching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pacino's Col. Slade is a portrait of turmoil. Not because he's blind, but because he's never been able to rise above the blindness and still find peace with himself and with the world. One of the great tragic characters of recent years. His story is much like Hickey's in "Iceman Cometh" or Howard Beale's in "Network." They never think they do good in the world with what they have, so they find themselves in this dark hole and they stay there. No one can help them out. No one looks after them. No one feels what they feel. As years go on and opportunities are lost, the dark hole gets filled with a lot anger, sorrow and possibly regret. Can they be healed? Do they want to be healed? In "Scent of a Woman," Pacino presents this dark, gloomy character perfectly in his Oscar winning performance. He overwhelms you with his constant bellowing and ordering of O'Donnell's Charlie. He's a man who never left the Military. My guess is that you can never take the military of out the man, only the man out of the military. He doesn't blame anyone or anything for his blindness. He's man who thinks that somehow, he was destined to "tour the battlefield" this way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacino Finally Wins An Oscar For Scent Of A Woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scent of a Woman is a drama film directed by Martin Brest that tells the story of a preparatory school student who takes a job as an assistant to an irascible, blind, medically retired Army officer. It stars Al Pacino, Chris O'Donnell, James Rebhorn, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Gabrielle Anwar.Driven by an extravagant, tour-de-force performance by Al Pacino, Scent of a Woman is the story of Frank Slade, a blind, retired army colonel who hires Charlie Simms, a poor college student on the verge of expulsion, to take care of him over Thanksgiving weekend. At the beginning of the weekend, Frank takes Charlie to New York, where he reveals to the student that he intends to visit his family, have a few terrific meals, sleep with a beautiful woman and, finally, commit suicide. The film follows the mismatched pair over the course of the weekend, as they learn about life through their series of adventures. By the end of the film, we have arrived at the usual conclusion of the coming-of-age movie, and the usual conclusion of the prep school movie. But rarely have we been taken there with so much intelligence and skill.Also,the story is a little contrived and predictable, it pulls all the right strings, thanks to O'Donnell's sympathetic supporting role and Pacino's powerful lead performance, for which he won his first Academy Award.It might soar on Al Pacino's performance more than the drama itself, but what a performance it is -- big, bold, occasionally over- the-top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacino Gives One of the best performances of all time by a film actor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Extremely Well Acted movie probably fully due to the extraordinary performance from Al Pacino as a retired blind army officer, along with a good performance from Chris O'Donnell and a great script consisting of witty and great dialogues.The Movie is about a retired blind army officer Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade(Pacino), who is taken care of by a Student Charlie Simmers(O'Donnell) as they go to New York for the Thanksgiving Weekend,and how they make a father-son like relationship while on their trip to New York, with Charlie not anticipating the things which Frank would do in their trip,and not expecting the things to happen between them in the trip.Al Pacino does an out of the world type of a performance as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade who is blind but can do no other blind men can do, and his performance is quite simply one of the best i have seen in my life. His expressions, movement, dialogue delivery and acting is flawless in the movie and sometimes you forget that he is actually acting. Chris O'Donnell does a good supporting job as a school student who is need of some money and agrees to take care or babysit of this fiery character.The Director does a good job with the other things of the film. The Screenwriter did a superb job with the screenplay and wrote some excellent dialogues which were perfectly delivered by Pacino. The Background music in the movie is also quite good and is beautifully synchronised with the scenes. Al Pacino gives one of the best performances by a film actor i have seen and makes this movie into a must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hokey and predictable but I enjoyed it. You need a feel good movie once in a while. It's cheaper than Xanax.Pacino won an Oscor for his portrayal of a blind and hopeless retired Army colonel, intent on one last expensive fling in New York before offing himself, and he deserved it. Unlike some other actors of his age who showed equal skill in their careers -- Jack Nicholson, for instance -- he hasn't settled into a well-worn and familiar groove. He seems to bring something a little fresh to every role. I think he was nominated seven times for an Academy Award before finally getting this one, for whatever such an award is worth.His best-known scene is the tango he does in the ballroom of the Pierre Hotel with Gabriel Anwar. She's had dance training but you couldn't tell from this scene. Pacino isn't much of a dancer but he doesn't have to be. Like the other guests in the room, Anwar and Pacino are swept up in the dramatic rhythm of the Argentine tune, which I think is called "Por una cabeza," something about a horse race. Anyone who wants to see the dance done expertly, which is quite a sight, should check out Carlos Saura's "Tango." Gabriel Anwar is beautiful, elegant, exotic -- and she can act too. It's a small but memorable role and a rather complicated one, but she manages it exquisitely. It's the kind of part for which Jane Alexander won a Supporting Actress award for "All the President's Men." Too bad Anwar didn't get more prominence on the screen.The story itself -- preppie in a quandary takes a temporary job as Pacino's guide on his last fling -- is corny and familiar. If it had been made anywhere outside of Hollywood Pacino might have succeeded in blowing his brains out in the Waldorf Astoria. As it is, he is rescued and restored to his spiritual life by Chris O'Donnell as the troubled preppie.Back at the prestigious prep school, in an anticlimax, Pacino gets to save O'Donnell's hide by making the kind of unrelentingly brutal and honest speech about the meaning of "honor" that is usually reserved for the summations of heroic defense counsels. He bellows and waves his hands. The student body gives him a standing ovation and the stern headmaster, James Rebhorn, slumps in frustration. I felt a little sorry for Rebhorn. After all, it was he and his shiny new car that were under the giant balloon full of white paint when it was popped. He hadn't done anything to deserve it, and it was a trick dirty enough to pee off the Pope.O'Donnell hasn't been seen that much since this movie was released. He's the perfect prep school kid though. He looks just right, and wardrobe has given him a big help. And his voice has the high, piping quality of a boy just out of adolescence. As his, squeamish friend, Philip Seymoure Hoffman is inventive, if at times obvious. He's become a fine actor though.In the most tense scene, Pacino dons his dress uniform preparatory to shooting himself. It's a Lieutenant Colonel's uniform. I have a suggestion for the United States Army. Stop handing out so many campaign ribbons, badges, medals, name plates, and the other junk that festoons his chest. It's beginning to look a little Latin American, fellas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Integrity and COURAGE,a Classic to Remember!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine Prep School student,on a scholarship, takes a Thanksgiving 'Baby Sitting' job to look after a retired Army Colonel whose family are away for a vacation-little did he realize the much decorated soldier is blind,depressed and almost welcoming death . The soldier has little left to live for,so with his family away plans a few days living it up with the student as his seeing eye dog in New York.Off they go staying at the Waldorf and having a fine old time,as almost a finale to his life,planning suicide as the final solution to his blind misery.In this touching situation the student copes amazingly well,even though he himself as to decide how to manage a school situation when he might have to 'snitch' on his school chums who have seriously misbehaved - his choice is to stay silent,even though this choice would mean expulsion- then comes Al Pacino to show what makes this movie outstanding-a wonderfully moving speech showing the students COURAGE AND INTEGRITY to remain silent.This is so well done,superb acting and a well deserved Oscar makes this movie a Classic - and one we should remember for its message- Integrity,and Courage to stand up for what one believes in are lessons we all need to practice and live by!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I shouldn't be reviewing this movie in the first place. Every person with a strong love for cinema should have seen this by now. But hey, if you are one of those rare cases that missed out on this movie due to some unforeseeable twist of fate, then by all means, please read on.Translated and re-scripted into English, this is a re-make of the Italian film "Profumo Di Donna" (1974), or Scent of a Woman. Little can be said about the original Italian movie, except that it served as an inspiration for producing one of the greatest movies Hollywood has ever made. In its entirety, the film is a character study of two very different individuals with just one similarity; the virtue of integrity. Having lost his sight during the service, retired Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade is resented by his family due to his profane outspokenness and tongue in cheek sarcasm, amplified by his total disregard for other people's pity. While his family prepares for an out of town Thanksgiving holiday trip, prep school student Charlie Simms answers an advertisement to look after Slade till the latter's family returns. Within minutes of meeting Slade, Charlie is flustered and insulted. As a scholarship hopeful for Harvard, Charlie needs the extra money for his Christmas holidays and reluctantly agrees to "babysit" Slade. Unknown to Charlie, Slade has other plans, including a first class trip to New York. Arriving in the Big Apple, both men confront each other, where Charlie faces a disciplinary procedure that threatens his collage scholarship, while Slade has a few wishes to fulfill before "blowing his brains out". By the end of this review, I will have justified why Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors of all time. For now, let's leave that last statement out of the equation. Out of the staggering eight times Al Pacino has been nominated for an Academy Award, this is the first and only time he has won an Oscar for his leading role as the unbelievably difficult Colonel Slade. This in itself is an indication of Pacino's powerhouse performance in this movie. With absolutely no doubt in my mind, I can confidently say that there isn't any other actor alive today, who could have played Slade like the way Pacino did. To me it doesn't matter if Pacino receives another Academy Award, because if there ever was an actor born to play a particulate role, then there can be no greater example that this. Pacino's greatest achievement in this film is making the audience like his character despite his utter loathsomeness. There is so much depth to his character, yet you can't take your eyes off him because you don't want to miss a second of what he will do or say next. Speaking of which, Al Pacino has to be the single most dialogue savvy actor there is or ever has been. I am not sure if his one-liners are specially written for him or whether he improvises on the script, but some of the greatest lines by an actor has been uttered by this man. If not only for his acting prowess, his one-liners will be his final legacy to the world of motion pictures. Then there are the facial expressions. Besides his excellence in portraying a blind man, Pacino's Slade really comes to life when describing the beauty of a woman; her essence in creation and her distinct perfume. Ooh Ha! In this regard, one of the highpoints of the film is Al Pacino's tango with Gabrielle Anwar; Poignant, everlasting, and with his facial expressions, poetry in motion. Incidentally, Anwar's recognition into mainstream cinema follows this short but memorable tango with Pacino. Another actor who credits this movie as his call to fame is Chris O'Donnell. As the young Charlie Simms, this is O'Donnell in his defining moment as an upcoming actor. Evidently, there is a lot of work put in attempting to measure up to Pacino's on screen presence. Even so, O'Donnell holds his ground and is perfectly cast opposite Pacino. Together, they make a great team, and by the end of the movie, they are almost father-son like. Two other standouts are Philip Seymour Hoffman as Charlie's two-faced friend and James Rebhorn as the headmaster they pull a prank on. While the latter is great as the pompous headmaster, Hoffman is excellent as a rich kid and Charlie's seemingly caring friend.Also nominated for two Academy Awards (Best Director and Best Picture), this is Martin Brest in easily his best directorial feature ever. There isn't a single loose or drab moment in the film's two and half hours of run time. Overall, this is an excellent film with no perceivable flaws. Brest maintains relevance to the plot on hand without giving in to the temptation of speculating Slade's days in the army or what makes him a bitter person. However, Brest's real success is in bringing out messages of courage and integrity as perceived by two very opposite individuals. By the end of the film, Brest's message is loud and clear, irrespective of Charlie's and Slade's perceptions. If you haven't seen this movie, or if you are not a movie person, you have missed out on one of the greatest moments in cinema history. However, it is never too late to treat yourself to one of the greatest movies ever made. Mark this down as a "must see".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "City Lights" of the 90's ... with friendship and integrity as the key messages ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first remembrance of an Academy Award ceremony concurred with my favorite actor winning the Oscar ... but the movie for which he won seemed too serious for the 11-year old boy I was. And with the passing of years, I discovered Al Pacino's glorious filmography, through "Scarface", "The Godfather" trilogy, "Carlito's Way", "Heat", "Dog Day Afternoon", "Serpico" ? and "Scent of a Woman" for a mysterious reason was a movie that I wasn't in a hurry to watch. How wrong I was : as soon as I finally finished the film, I knew I just saw Al Pacino's role that cut straight into my heart the most directly, after Michael Corleone."Scent of a Woman" is a two-hour and half movie that never seems too long because it absolutely knows where it goes. The slow pacing is important as it provides enough time to be familiar with the two main characters : Chris O'Donnell as Charlie Simms, a shy young 17-year old boy who studies on aid in Baird, a prestigious prep school and Al Pacino as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, a flamboyant, crude and rude war veteran blind since an accidental drunk game. They couldn't have been more opposite but as we expect in a script whose intelligence emanates from the first minutes, we'll get to know more beyond these archetypal facades and each character will learn about and from the other. It's a coming of age story lead by one of the most memorable and inspiring characters of the last decade : Colonel Slade, with his priceless onomatopoeic motto : "Hoo-ah!".Charlie Simms is an insecure student whose modest background impacted his personality. He's surrounded by arrogant daddy's boys, among them, George Willis, a young scene-stealing Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Charlie's financial situation makes him an obvious outcast in the prestigious Baird School, forced to accept a weekend job, to earn money. His job would be to nurse a grumpy and totally obnoxious old man, unknowing that he's just about to live the most important days in his life, with New York as the setting. Meanwhile, he and George happen to be the unintentional witnesses of the setting of what would be a humiliating prank. The victim is played by the ultimate character actor of the 90's, James Rebhorn as Trask, the school's headmaster. Charlie and George have all the weekend to think about the eventuality of denouncing their friends under the threat of exclusion, an unbearable ethic dilemma for Charlie. And we quite understand the incertitude and anguish he'll display all through his trip with Colonel Slade.The movie literally takes off when Charlie and Slade move to New York, and we get to know more about the Colonel and understand the fascination he inspires us. He's a man whose blindness developed other sensory powers that target one specific category of persons : women. No other character spoke of women like Colonel Slade, who developed a particular ability to identify any feminine fragrance. The trip to New York will be the opportunity for Charlie to have a small taste of all the pleasures that can govern our lives : eating, drinking, dancing a tango with a beautiful girl like Donna, a name that resonates as a probable homage to the original Italian movie, Dino Risi's "Profumo di Donna" and speaking of Italians, there is also riding a Ferrari, and trying an awkward but sincere reconciliation with the family, and ultimately fighting the inner demons. Beyond the whole mentor-disciple relationship, darker undertones are hidden : Slade's eagerness to seize each hour, each moment of the precious weekend, are the morbid allegory of the last meal before execution. Slade basically savors some last pleasures before shooting himself to death. And then it's time for Charlie to overcome his passive nature before it's too late.This is the aspect that definitely marks the movie's greatness. Slade learns that we never have nothing to lose for suicide is the ultimate failure, and a total waste because nothing is never worth to be enjoyed just because we're blind, crippled, or have no money. Simms mirrors Slade's condition during a heartbreaking climactic moment that will consolidate their friendship, when both of them are in dead-ends. Simms learns that George's father will probably interfere and that he might defend his case alone but how could Slade be in a dead end, with all he taught to Charlie during a memorable weekend. These scenes are realistically handled, avoiding what could have been cinematic stereotypical sappiness. And at these moments, you understand that no other actor could have played the character with such fierce intensity in his lifeless eyes.The movie concludes with the resolution of the Baird case where Slade, as a moral debt, decided to defend his protégé and new friend Charlie. In one hell of a speech like only Al Pacino, with his volcanic voice, could have delivered, he spits on the hypocrisy of a system that condemns the high morality of a boy who refuses to snitch, and spare the one who talked, under the control of daddy. It's Kirkland, Wortzik and Serpico resurrecting in a histrionic virtuosity and metamorphosing a bunch of puppets-students into wannabe men. The movie's inspirational message of integrity rewards two hours of a patient character study as finally, Charlie Simms also opened the eyes of Colonel Slade during that weekend.And as many noticed, there's the beautiful melody of "City lights" that inhabits the film. I think this is also a nice touch that reminded us of the true universal message that I mentioned in my review of Chaplin's masterpiece, quoting the French writer Antoine de Saint Exupery : "it is only with the heart that one can see rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye", that's what Charlie's initiation, a lesson even Colonel Slade was about to forget, but fortunately, did not. Hoo-ah!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people think of Al Pacino, his role in the magnificent Godfather series is the first that comes to mind. I must admit that I always believed that his Oscar reward was actually given to him for that series. As it turned out, I was wrong. Pacino's acting in "Scent of a Woman" is in my belief his all-time best. Playing the role of a blind person seems hard enough- but he plays as though he's actually blind. While that alone may not be too hard, what makes his performance outstanding is, as always, his acting in the dramatic scenes. While Pacino's acting is what makes this movie "work", other factors help as well. The screenwriter did a terrific job, making what seems to be an instant classic. The dialogs are occasionally hilarious, mostly due to the lead character dry wits. To sum things up, this is a fantastic film. There's at least one classic scene here, but I'll not even hint at it due to fears of spoilers.</fullReview>

Movie suggests that blind men should not be treated like blind.They deserved to be treated like just us.If you don't see this for Pacino,then you would miss a lot from his legacy.Highly recommended for motivational purposes.Specially the speech.But if you know how to dance,if you feel the scent of a woman.I have a question can you tango any better than Colonel Slade???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrives on Pacino's iconic Col. Frank Slade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Squarely on the shoulders of Al Pacino rests "Scent of a Woman," a film of unlikely friendship and moral education spanning an epic 187 minutes. It is film built on memorable quotes and moments from Oscar-winning "One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest" adapter Bo Goldman as well as one unforgettable performance.Though its length deflates a lot of its punch, there's a great humor driving "Scent of a Woman." Pacino's portrayal is magnetizing and reckless -- the master of on-camera shouting perfecting his craft. You laugh because he makes you uncomfortable, he's blind and his dialogue is, well, frank. He speaks his mind because he's not afraid of the consequences. He enjoys the pleasures of life, particularly women, he drinks without abandon and yet there's an uncanny wisdom in everything he says or does. Sometimes an exceptional character study can make a movie and Pacino's Col. Slade certainly does.The film is about how a young man at a prestigious east-coast boarding school (Chris O'Donnell) ends up taking a random babysitting job to earn some cash during Thanksgiving break as opposed to forking out for the plane ticket back to Oregon. His assignment is of course Uncle Frank, who flips the weekend upside down when he swoops off with him to New York City where Frank has some plans to live it up -- and teach the young Charlie a thing or two.Unlikely friendships are the stuff of many great films and although "Scent of a Woman" really pushes these two clashing personalities together, it's not without the best of intent. Charlie's subplot is that he's leaving a big scandal behind at school during the break in which he has was interrogated by the headmaster as to who pulled a big prank. (The other witness is his friend George, played by a young Phillip Seymour Hoffman.) The headmaster has hung the threat of rescinding Charlie's recommendation to Harvard over Charlie's head and it his decision of whether to snitch becomes the moral dilemma that Frank will eventually assist him with.There are great scenes in "Scent of a Woman" from the ruckus at Thanksgiving dinner when Frank takes Charlie, both uninvited, to his brother's house where the relatives don't think much of him to Frank teaching a young woman to tango or at one point driving a Ferrari despite being blind. Memorable moments they are, but all relevant and all worthy of every second being drawn out? No. Director Martin Brest ("Beverly Hills Cop") could've cut at least a half hour from this film. Each scene concludes after the audience has already figured out what will happen.The things that Frank teaches Charlie (and of course vice-versa) are lessons of great moral significance. There's no denying you could quote this film over and over again whether it's Frank shouting "Hoo-ah!" or his "there are two kinds of people in this world" speech. At the same time, scripted wisdom is not what makes a film great and that's why greatness eludes "Scent of a Woman." What we learn from the film we do not learn through empathy or in an organic or home-grown manner. It doesn't make the pearls any less valuable or interesting, they're just deprived of a blossoming epiphany.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully moving film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always got interested watching Al Pacino on screen. I got used to his character playing the crime boss thing, but this movie had to be different. I didn't quite fully understand the background of Lt. Frank Slade's (Pacino) character in this movie (I need to watch it one more time), but in any case I appreciated the structure of story. You can see that Charlie Simms' (Chris O'Donnell) character is not that striking. He's a working student in a prestigious school, who got drawn in with his carefree wealthy "friends". Engaging himself in a thanksgiving job, because he "doesn't have home to return", and I meant it differently?his father was dysfunctional (and I surmise no mention of his mother). Nevertheless he's character is still interesting in some matters, especially at the final part of the movie. Though he seems weak and lame, he got integrity and loyalty to his friends (which is a shame because their not even his friends!) that made his character unyielding. Frank Slade on the other hand was more complex. But I learn to understand why he acted the way he had to in the film. He's alone, asserting he has no life because darkness only fills his eyes and dread to wish of dying some other time. But Charlie's character has something to do how Pacino's acted the role. Their characters get into mix and we saw a beautiful relationship build. Frank Slade was more of a true father (or uncle at least) to Chris more than anyone else.I loved the film because of the story itself. It's a good thing that we witness numerous stories with firm construction, got materialized into a movie, and got appreciated by many. I was even misled by the title, where what it was all about was not in the heading at all. I thought Scent of Woman has something to do with explicit portrayal of man to woman relationship, but this film got it different. I've been a keen follower of Al Pacino's career. And this movie has its legacy of showing his greatness in acting. Another one is that it amplified well Pacino's trademark voice, that distinct smoke-burnished voice (which honestly made me squirm because my uncle has the same feature as his).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino makes this movie a delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About a whole day after I saw this movie, I'm under the impression of the absolutely wonderful act of Al Pacino. It actually seems (not Simms!) he is blind, his face are so still, his eyes are so empty. The character of a retired colonel, who's still able to control everybody around him despite his blindness, is played in such a manner, I almost saluted every time he got focus on screen. But the most wonderful moments are the few on the dance floor. The scene of Frank(Al) and Donna(Gabrielle) doesn't get out of my thoughts. From the moment he catches her perfume, through the introduction, till the sweetest tango dance I can remember. Of course, the choice for Donna - Gabrielle Anwar, is perfect, she plays the shy (very) pretty woman very good.The only slightly tiny bad thing here is Simms's (Chris O'Donnell) part. He plays well, but not as good as Pacino. Though it's forgivable, it's one of his first movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al Pacino plays Frank Slade, a former Lieutenant Colonel who lost his career and his sight due to a stupid accident. Living in New Hampshire with tolerant relatives, Frank has become bitter and angry with the world, so much so he plans to peg out of it after one last hurrah in New York City. Enter Charlie Simms {Chris O'Donnell}, a hard up student from Baird College who is trying to earn $300 just to baby-sit the volatile Frank over the Thanksgiving weekend. Originally oblivious to Frank's plans, Charlie unwittingly becomes an accomplice to what Frank has in mind, yet both of them have no idea just how life defining the weekend could prove to be.In the main, Scent Of A Woman survives its obvious creaks because of Pacino's Oscar winning, barn storming show. The film itself is engaging and ever watchable, if perhaps a touch too long. Pacino as Slade is plunged into implausible set pieces, driving a Ferrari, dancing the tango with the petite Donna {Gabrielle Anwar} and bluffing traffic cops with care free abandon. But such is the gusto and conviction that Pacino puts into the role, it scarcely matters about improbability since we are having too much of a good time with him. Ably supported by O'Donnell, who sadly after this film wouldn't go on to a better level of acting, Pacino manages to off set the short comings in the piece.....There is no real drama to speak of in Scent Of A Woman. Some tight coiled spring like moments such as a family dinner and the point of Frank's journey aside, it's a pretty basic and safely written screenplay-with an ending that has divided many across the globe. It's an ending that to me, sits perfectly within the story, in fact it was apparent to me that it would go that way. This is not just Frank's journey, this is Charlie's as well, the ending just brings it all together as regards two polar opposites meeting in the middle at a differing, but crucial, point in their lives. Hell!, I beat my chest and shout Hoo-Hah! upon every viewing, and that's the impact, and the result, that director Martin Brest and his team were hinting at all thru the film.Sometimes safe and ham can be real enjoyable, especially when backed by a certain soft eyed Italian American actor from the Bronx. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Oscar nominated director Martin Brest (Beverly Hills Cop, Meet Joe Black), I had heard and seen bits and pieces of this film and the lead actor, I just had to see it. Basically Charlie Simms (Golden Globe nominated Chris O'Donnell) attending Baird School, and classmate George Willis, Jr. (young Philip Seymour Hoffman) are witnesses to a prank on headmaster Mr. Trask (Independence Day's James Rebhorn), who secretly bribes Charlie for the culprits identities. Charlie, yearning for money to return to his family in Oregon, has accepted a job looking after blind, eccentric and retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Al Pacino) over the Thanksgiving weekend. Slade however plans a trip to New York, to supple all the pleasures, such as luxury hotel comfort, fine eating and drinking (wines), dancing, an escort, and after all this he plans to "blow his brains out". Over the time they spend together, Charlie sees what an interesting character Frank is, but of course it is when he is holding a gun that his conscience truly comes to a head. Thankfully Frank doesn't commit suicide, and they both return to New Hampshire, where Charlie faces his courtroom style assembly to find and punish the prank culprits. Frank surprisingly shows up, in place of Charlie's parents, and he shouts his opinions of all events Charlie has explained to him, and Frank manages to get him off the hook. Also starring Gabrielle Anwar as Donna, Richard Venture as W.R. Slade, Bradley Whitford as Randy, Ron Eldard as Officer Gore, Frances Conroy as Christine Downes, Sally Murphy as Karen Rossi and Nicholas Sadler as Harry Havemeyer. It may be almost two and half hors long, but I can't imagine any of the material being taken out. O'Donnell is very good as the unworldly teenage escort, but it is of course Pacino that steals the entire film with his brilliant eccentricity, avoiding too much sentimentality, he thoroughly deserved his Academy Award. His finest moments include recognising womens' perfumes (as the title suggests), the tango dance with Anwar, driving a rented Ferrari at high speed with a terrified O'Donnell, obviously the assembly, and every time he barks his famous "hoo-ha" cough. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Al Pacino was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Robert De Niro) on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best (if not the best) Al Pacino's performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of Al Pacino's movies, though not all of them, because usually if it's not a crime movie I always afraid that I ain't going too like it, but still watch it sooner or later. Scent of a Woman sounded kinda boring, but it wasn't. It's a great movie. Though without Al Pacino it would be much worse, but still I liked the plot and characters of this movie, so there was no boring moments, even when Al Pacino wasn't on the screen. It quickly became my favorite Al Pacino's performance, it's even better that his performance at Scarface. He as always was very energetic in this film. He won an Oscar for this performance and he really deserves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you think you are going to see a funny and romantic movie then you are wrong .this movie is so much higher than that .it's about principles and ethics. Al Pacino reaches the highest level of being (in the moment).he makes another standard of well acting as Frank Slade (a blind rough man needs company during the holiday )and the elegant Chris O'Donnel as Charlie (a hard-working student needs money ).their characters are completely the opposite but they do have something in common they will never leave in need . after 16 years ,the movie is still that good. this type of movies make you think and revise your deeds. do your self a favor ..and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scent of a Woman tackles life important issues like values, principles and integrity and is done in such a way that it brings power and sensitivity at the same time. Director Martin Brest didn't rely on "tried and tested" Hollywood tearjerker formula but instead takes it deep from the heart and just overwhelms you with great emotions. If this film haven't touched you at the very least, then I don't know what will. What tops off this mesmerizing film is the intensity that the actors brought to the table most especially Al Pacino in one of his career defining roles as Lt. Col. Frank Slade.In what is possibly one of the finest showcase of acting I have ever seen, Al Pacino disappears completely and minute by minute a new sentient being emerges, that of a blind man whose sarcastic wit and rip roaring voice demands attention and believe you me, you cannot help but get carried away by Pacino's superb performance. One shining moment is most definitely the speech that his character gave at the end. It is undoubtedly one of the finest monologues I have ever seen in the history of cinema. Great delivery by Pacino. Nothing more can be said, it is powerful, deep, grand, heart-wrenching and majestic. It is a testament as to why Al Pacino can almost be compared to a god, a living, breathing god. Chris O' Donnell, not to say he underperformed but he delivers as well playing school boy Charlie Simms. One might say he was completely overshadowed by an acting god which is not entirely true. He had some defining moments throughout the film and is overall fantastic.Scent of a Woman is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that I never had big desires to watch it however I do had seen some parts of it before a couple of days when I saw it complete for the very first time. One of the scenes that I had in my memory was when the Colonel (Al Pacino) and Charlie (Chris O'Donnell) spend the Thanksgiving Day in the home of the Colonel's older brother. Scent of a Woman is a very popular film, one of those that often you can watch on TV and that its DVD is at every stone in a very good price but for me there's have been always a better option to buy or to rent. Last week I wet to my local Blockbuster, now I really like to go to Blockbuster because they sale used DVDs that practically are new and there's always a promotion of something and I do have found some gems, for example the Criterion Collection DVD of Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress for only $7. So last week I was at the store and after choosing the films to rent (Takashi Miike's Yakuza Demon and Takeshi Kitano's Kikujiro) I took a look to the used for sale DVDs and I found only two films that I wanted, for $2, (Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow and From Hell) and there was this promotion so I could get another used DVD for free. I choose Scent of a Woman just to finally see if I was missing the chance to watch something really good or if I had just wasted the chance to get another film on DVD for free. Then for me Scent of a Woman was not time wasted but also is not a film I would like to watch again. Certainly the weekend that the Colonel and Charlie spend together delivered great moments but those moments are basically the entertaining parts of the trip, the funny ones. Here we have in Pacino's character a man that is living his last days, better what he had in mind would have been his last days. Then we have O'Donnell's character, a young man with problems with certainly with a promising future. By the end they will understand the other, they will appreciate the other, they lived an unforgettable Thanksgiving weekend and their lives changed for good. I think the most successful scene is the one in the house of the Colonel's older brother. Since the first moment when the Colonel arrives you know how are going to be the things. There you have a broken direct relationship, past and present together, each one of them with someone to defend, a wife and a friend, when Colonel attacks the other guy you feel that the whole "show" was done right and the reaction after the incident of the older bother confirms that. I think a good way to explain my thoughts about this film is by writing my thoughts about one of the last moments of it. The speech was interesting and effective. When they announce that in Charlie's case will be justice watch how the people react, I found it fake. So Scent of a Woman does have interesting things, fun moments and long moments (yes the film is quite long and not in a good way), as the "inspirational" film it doesn't work on me. As for Pacino's performance well I know many found it overrated but I liked it however is not by any chance one of his finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino In Overdrive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colonel Slade has plans. He means to spend a weekend on the town, having just about what the hell he likes from good food and fast cars to loose women. We wants it all; because in the end he means to shoot himself.Al Pacino plays Colonel Slade. Some time in the recent past, in an excess of recklessness, he played a game with hand-grenades and it all went terribly wrong. Now he is blind. And he's in a blind fury. A proud man of action is doomed to creep about with a white stick and he just can't bear it any more. He is still young - late 30's to early 40's - and the prospect of a life of blindness is too much to face.He lives in a kind of annexe to a house in the suburbs with some family. Unaware of his plans, they are going away for the weekend and advertise for a student on the local campus to keep him company for a fee. Luckless Charlie Simms draws the short straw.Pacino delivers a performance of such over-the-top methodology that if you sit too close to the screen you risk being knocked out of your chair. It has all of the explosive unpredictability of 'Goodfellas' or 'Resevoir Dogs'. He is almost a hand-grenade in his own right. Charlie Simms, on the other hand, is his complete opposite. Superbly played by Chris O'Donnell; he's quiet, polite, sensitive and propitiatory - almost a sucker, given the wrong company. Each is a perfect foil for the other, but connect in the one quality that most matters to them both: honour.In other ways Slade has adjusted to blindness very well. He is good at detecting body language. His hearing is extremely acute. And his sense of smell is almost supernatural - especially in regard to women's perfume.Together this odd couple barge through the weekend in a wonderful mutual learning-curve. Most of Slade's family despise him. If he was an arrogant cuss before, blindness has made him a bitter one. Now he's pretty much insufferable. We follow him and his protégé on a series of mostly hilarious adventures during which Slade's terminal intentions gradually become clear.At the same time, Charlie Simms has issues of his own. He witnessed a prank at college of which a despised member of staff was the butt. Those who did the prank have rich fathers who can pull strings. He, on the other hand, has no-one. It seems highly likely that he will be the scapegoat. There's even a chance he might be expelled.That sounds like a job for the colonel.You can hardly fail to like this movie. It's a little disjointed in parts, but from the pleasant theme music, and all of the other technical elements, down to the quality of acting and subtle resolution of the story, it wins you over with its completeness and its human empathy. Some charming little cameos from the likes of Gabrielle Anwar perfectly complement the two lead roles.Though I only give it 8 stars it is still one of my favourites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favourite Al Pacino Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Scarfatchay was boring. I thought the Godfather was very good. I thought Any Given Sunday was boring. I thought The Devil's Advocate was good. I thought Heat was one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. I thought Scent of a Woman was very good. As you can see, I think some of Pacino's films are terrific, and others are mind-numbingly boring.Scent of a Woman is a touching film, with comedic moments, mixed with tragedy. The two protagonists go on a journey (one willing, the other merely dragged along for the ride), and the climax to the film is a conclusion to what they have learned along the course of the weekend (film).I don't want to spoil anything, but the ending to the film is one of my favourite scenes in any film. Pacino deserved the Oscar for his portrayal of Frank Slade, and it is a shame that Chris O'Donnell appears to have fizzled away, because he showed a lot of promise in these early years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time last year on Encore and it's a truly magnificent film with brilliant acting by Pacino &amp; O'Donnell. There are those who believe the movie is too long but after seeing the movie on television and edited down to two and a half hours, I know why Martin Brest disowned those versions. In fact, after viewing the 2minute trailer, I'd love to see the stuff that was left on the cutting room floor - there are some great lines in it that never made it to the movie. After we go through the emotional roller-coaster of the first two hours, the audience is rewarded by one of the best on-screen monologues ever. You also get to see some other actors in minor parts (Brad Whitford for instance). As a native New Yorker, it's also great seeing a movie that was entirely shot in New York (minus the airport scene filmed in Newark, NJ). Whether it's Emma Willard's Academy in Upstate or the Rossi's house on Staten Island to the Oak Room in the famed Plaza Hotel, it's a real NY gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One glance is enough to understand what kind of a man is Lt. Col. Frank Slade. Al Pacino is a great actor who has the way of his own. To make a long story short, this movie describes how to cement friendship between two men who have mutually divergent views. I have actually enjoyed this movie many times over, but I still have many questions. Why did Frank buy the ticket for Charlie? Did he already know Charlie would come back? Did he really think about killing himself, or just testing Charlie? Although I don't know what sort of story the director Martin Brest would like to fabricate in this movie one thing that I can say is precious expressions which causes some consideration, abound in this film. A good movie has a tendency to give people different impressions every time they see. Next time, I might have another impression. Bene! Bene!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Scent of a Woman' is a story centered around two men: one barely at the threshold of adulthood and one teetering on the edge of life itself. The two are almost exact opposites, almost a Yin and a Yang, yet through the movie they learn from each other.Chris O'Donnell plays Charlie, a timid underclassman at a prestigious prep school, well out of his family's limited financial reach. Hoping to obtain a plane ticket across the country so he can be with his blue-collar parents for Christmas, he decides to take a job babysitting a blind man over Thanksgiving break. He begins to have second thoughts when he walks into a barrage of unsolicited abuse from Frank Slade (Pacino), a retired Lt. Colonel with a short fuse and a obsession with Jack Daniels. After taking the job, he finds out he got more than he bargained for. Instead of a quiet weekend as a guest in someone's home, he is being kidnapped and brought along on an illicit excursion to New York City, where he will witness the finest life has to offer: women, food, booze, hotels, and clothing, but will also uncover a plan that could ruin his vacation: his host committing a dramatic suicide. Bound by his own sense of morality, he attempts do dissuade him from his chosen fate. The outcome is some of the most emotionally moving dialogue to come to the big screen in a long time.Pacino shines as retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, whose harsh and offensive personality is only outdone by his charm. He delivers each sarcastic quip with a deadpan expression and impeccable timing as well as an air of wistfulness, which surrounds him for most of the movie. He appears to be a fallen and forgotten hero, who gave his all and was left with nothing, not even his sight, or as he put it, `in the dark'.O'Donnell does a reasonable job playing the awkward Charlie. He realistically portrays the angst that usually accompanies the teenage years. Though there doesn't seem to be much to him at first, as the film progresses the character opens up slowly, and the chemistry between Charlie and Slade is stunning and often times touching.Overall a fantastic movie, well written without glaring plot holes and exceptionally well acted. The climactic ending is one of the most dramatic in Pacino's career, and will surely uplift your spirit and have you on your feet applauding. `Scent of a Woman' is destined to become a classic.</fullReview>

This was truly a difficult character to play and Al Pacino had executed it beautifully and he truly deserved that Oscar. All in all, he played a man that was shut out of vision in the real world but could tell from a person just by the scent of the person and his feelings but most of all, it's a film about hope and how you have to live your life to the fullest. just because you are blind and paralyzed, it does not mean you give up. you go on and on.On a side note, the film had some incredible moments too. The scene were Owen Trask gets the tannish cream in his car was pure hilarious. The tango scene made me feel in awe. This is truly one of those films that would make you bring a smile on your face even after watching it. I suggest to all of you out there. if you haven't seen it, see it. it is a remarkable film. i recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film when it first appeared on video, and I quite clearly remember not feeling too over enthused at the time, that was when I was around 15, I am now 24. I borrowed the film from a friend of mine a few months ago and watched it one Sunday when I had nothing better to do.My! how ones appreciation of good acting and a captivating script changes over the years. This is definitely one of those films that has the ability to push and pull your emotions in so many directions during the course of the film, at least thats how I felt. Chris O'Donnell is perfectly cast as Charlie, a quiet, underpriveledged yet intelligent young man who was awarded a scholarship at Baird. He takes up the offer of a job looking after Lt Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino) left blind after a party trick involving a hand grenade and alcohol went wrong. The job is simple, to look after the Lt while his family go away for thanksgiving, sounds easy well this is where the fun starts. No sooner have the family gone, Frank announces his plan to go away for the weekend and Charlie is along for the ride.From here the fun really starts as Charlies "education" in life begins and Franks intentions become clear. I can't really say too much without spoiling the film but I can say it involves The Tango, fine food, fine wine, a one way ticket and a loaded 45.All in all a wonderful film with great acting and a great script, this is definitely Al Pacino at his best, Hoo Hah.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie that should appeal to just about everyone. The acting is flat-out fantastic and the writing is excellent. Al Pacino plays his role perfectly. The film is also part of a dying breed -- the character story. So many movies these days focus only on how outrageous or hilarious or violent or suspenseful a plot can be; many writers and directors seem to have forgotten how drama works: events happen to provide insight into the characters. Scent of a Woman is a perfect example of a character story. Its portrait of Lt. Col. Frank Slade is a great achievement, and anyone who wants to be actor should see what is probably his best performance ever.There are things I might change about this movie. The ending is a little sentimental for my taste, but then again, the character development is the focus of a movie like this. Chris O'Donnell's performance was a bit bland, but most of the movie's best writing is for Pacino, so maybe its not his fault.With so many gimmicky movies out there, its great to see that people still know how to do straight drama.95/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie once and then a month later bought the movie. Al Pacino's acting was superb. The first time you hear his voice you get a setting of the film as being all genres but thriller and horror."Do you want Tommy in or out?" "Leave him out! He's chasing that Calico cat again.""Hoo aa"His speech in the school was done exceptionally well. That one line:"And if you think you're preparing these minnies for manhood you better think again."The movie is called Scent of A Woman because all he has to do is smell a woman and he knows exactly what she looks like and how old she is. The movie had about three different plots that were mended well together. Slade's woman scents, the school problem, and Slade's psychological decision on whether or not he wants to stay alive.Another line from the school scene."And as for Harry, Trent, and Jimmy wherever you are out there, F**k you, too."That just makes me laugh.That comment that the dean makes about being in school not a barracks I find to be frankly stupid.Now, I don't know where you guys grow up but how I was is that no one listens to you when you're being nice and sweet. They listen to you when you show some sort of authority and you can do that in the way you talk. People always say when you're young: You're too young to be talking like that."Could you stop that, please?" They don't stop. "Stop, or I am going to break you're fucking neck." They tend to listen more.This movie deserves a 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"How do you like my blues Charlie"Scent of a Woman is a work of art on all level. The story line examines life, with ideas about what is important in life and what makes it up. The scenes where beautifully ordered. The camera work was done perfectly. The music was positioned to portray the right mood. The script gave so many memorable one-liners. And the best part was the acting by Oscar-worthy Al Pacino. This was the first movie I have ever seen with him in it, and Hoo-ah. He became my favorite actors of all time. Every scene does its work for the movie. It is my favorite movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Turn for Pacino and O'Donnell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scent of a woman features Al Pacino in his Academy Award winning role as a blind former military man being watched over a weekend by a prep school student. Chris O'Donnell is the student and he has more than enough trouble on his hands before even beginning his weekend job. Seems he must identify the people behind a prank played on a teacher or he will face expulsion from the school. He must do it after the weekend. He starts the job by learning just what Pacino thinks of pretty much everything in life. Embittered by his blindness and having to rely on others, his caustic remarks and rapid fire delivery of them to anyone within hearing distance make the performance an intriguing one to watch. Soon it is off to New York where O'Donnell has learned that Pacino plans to enjoy a nice meal, and a few other items on a list he has made and then he is going to kill himself. The last 20 minutes of the movie are excellent as is the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lt.Col. Slade(played so wonderfully by Al Pacino)is an arrogant, blind ex military who's mad at the world and is taken care of the preppy Charlie(O'Donnel)who grows to love and respect him, the more he starts to actually see who he is and why he's behaving in a certain way. Sometimes the seeing are more blind than those who really are...Charlie just happens to open up his eyes a bit more than many of the colonel's family members. The final scene is well worth of an Oscar/Academy Award which Pacino eventually got(FINALLY), and one of his best performances ever. The movie in itself is slightly too long, but...aren't almost all films over two hours nowadays? It's a trend that isn't showing any tendency to stop, rather the opposite. The story is cute, O'Donnel is pretty good, but when it all comes down to it, what actually lifts the whole film is none other but the great Al Pacino. I gave it a 9 because of him and only him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Scent of a Woman recently with a few of my friends, and ever since we have gone around quoting Al Pacino's Lt.Col.Frank Slade and saying HOO-AH!!! This is my best compliment for this film. I enjoyed watching Al Pacino in his (finally) Oscar winning performance, he captured the essence of blindness wonderfully, and even Chris O'Donnell turned in a nice performance as the college student hired to look after him for Thanksgiving weekend. However the film is slightly overlong, but not to the point of boredom. Scent of a Woman did teach me one thing, and that is that a blind man can tango. HOO-AH!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an amazing movie and everyone should watch it at least once. It depicts a very deep behavior of humans in the form of the irrational behavior depicted by the central character (Al Pacino). Al Pacino is very expressive and demonstrates an extremely fascinating character who has a mix of being a person of strong integrity due to his principles and at the same time a narcicist attitude because of him being a helpless blind man.

		<fullReview>I've heard this criticized for weak structure (culminating with a very-contrived courtroom ending), and I've even heard people criticize Al Pacio's acting, but I really don't care. I love this movie. I love Pacino going nuts on Headmaster Trask. I love Pacino going nuts on his family. I love Pacino going nuts on his idiotic costar (really, Chris O'Donnell is the biggest flaw in this flim--couldn't we have had Matt Damon or someone else for this part? O'Donnell is weak in his performance, lacking the necessary resolve to face off with someone like Lt. Col. Frank Slade).There's joy in this movie, if you want it. There's a wonderful glee that can be obtained from lines such as, "Outta order? I SHOW you outta order! You don't know what outta order IS, Mister Trask. I'd show ya, but I'm too old, I'm too tired, I'm too f------ blind. If I were the man I was five years ago, I'd take a FLAMETHROWER to this place!"And there is case in point of way Pacino deserves the hype he gets. That flamethrower thing--that's a bad line. But Pacino, God that he is, makes it convincing and severely threatening. He has the intensity to turn bad lines like that into good lines. That is genius, and it makes for enjoyable films."How's that for corn ball?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al Pacino deserves the Oscar he got for this movie. Nowhere in the movie does he slip, and the accent he developed was retained till the end. Chris O'Donnell was stale in the earlier part of the movie as a shy, tongue-tied college student, but bloomed from the middle of the movie. Though O'Donnell gave a good supporting performance, but the movie belongs to Al Pacino and Al Pacino alone. The last scene of his speech in the Student Disciplinary Committee session is a master-stroke of a performance. "No, I am not finished, I am just warming up" !!! From this he reached the heights of monologue which other actors just dream of. If you haven't seen this movie, then you sure have wasted your life :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masculinity lessons from a violent drunkard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's curious how deceiving movie titles can be. My sister once told me that she refused to watch Scent of a Woman when her boyfriend suggested it because she expected that movie to be a type of cinema that people jerk off to. Well, can't say i blame her, because the title does seem intriguing and suggesting a deep erotic undertone.But, as it's often the case with sensationalized material, the risqué name is given to something quite irrelevant. And instead of a racy romance Scent of a Woman tells us a story of a blind ex-military man and a prep school student hired for a few days to look after him. But, despite his handicap, the retired colonel still has a lot of vigor within, and what seemed like an easy job for a poor kid turns into a series of life lessons and dramatic revelations.One good thing about this film is Al Pacino's acting. He's more or less the same as usual, always trying to steal every scene he's in, but it's nevertheless entertaining to watch him portray a blind man whose taste for life refuses to be diminished and restricted by his incapabilities.But the problems arise when it turns out that Al Pacino is the only good thing this film has to offer. As his character's guide and partner we are given Charlie Simms, a 17 year old Baird student, a poor kid from Oregon who's struggling to establish his status among the much more privileged peers. Charlie is supposed to be a smart guy, a national scholarship winner, but instead we see a mumbling wide-eyed dumbo with literally no self-respect or brains to behave reasonably in his predicament. The movie tries to show his voyage to New York City with Colonel Slade as some sort of a rite of initiation, a compensation for a lack of a strong male role model in his life. However, it's hard to see Charlie as a man in the making, because, despite being yelled at, tossed around and ridiculed, he fails to make a single defining stand or at least demand to be reckoned with. Instead, he's hardly more than an obedient marionette in Colonel Slade's hands. And when placed against someone so submissive and meek (and weak and bleak), Al Pacino's character, despite all his attempts to be charming and charismatic, looks more like a grumpy old alcoholic, albeit dressed like a dandy, with attitude issues and an ego way beyond his merit.The whole film revolves around a moral dilemma Charlie is forced to face, and, in an inevitable happy ending, Colonel praises the kid for a certain integrity of character, warming up to him and, by some twist of fate, to everyone else who surrounds him. The problem is that despite the movie trying to pass Charlie's position for an integrity tested and hardened by the severe trials resulted from that unlikely bond of two people, the truth is that Charlie is no more self-aware at the end than he was at the beginning, and the only integrity he has is the one that other people want to see in him. A virtue not earned but granted from above. And just as Charlie receives an overwhelming praise for basically doing nothing, this film is more of an exercise in self-admiration than a showcase of the genuinely good things we could appreciate it for.</fullReview>

However I am a cinephile by all standards and a through and through Pacino fan. But I fail to understand how this movie has managed to garner so much acclaim. It is a mid week public holiday and I sit down to watch this movie after having watched Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) and I slept off twice while watching this movie. I am writing this because I feel sequestered and perplexed as to how something as boring as this could manage an 8.0 and so much fanfare, barring one negative review that is.MUST READ before you spend hours(what will seem countless) watching this ill perceived modern "classic".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful Performance by Pacino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scent of a Woman (1992) **** (out of 4) Al Pacino finally picked up the Best Actor Oscar for his performance here as Lt. Frank Slade, a blind man who takes a Thanksgiving trip to New York City taking along a naive young man (Chris O'Donnell) who is going through some drama at school. Over this weekend trip Slade tries to relive some pleasures of life while teaching his friend a few life lessons. SCENT OF A WOMAN often gets singled out for the great performances but I think the film itself has been sadly overlooked throughout the years. Yes, there's no question that the film plays for emotions and there's no doubt that at times it's quite manipulative but at the same time it's about as entertaining as any film can get and it also features some of the most memorable scenes and characters of the decade. There's no doubt that Pacino deserves a lot of credit because the performance is flawless and ranks right up there with some of the greatest of his career and that's saying quite a bit. I can't think of a better performance of someone playing a blind man and even better is the way Pacino can give off emotions without saying a word. Just take a look at the Thanksgiving dinner sequence where we get a wide range of emotions and Pacino has to give them without saying much. The final speech from Pacino is one of the best in the history of cinema and the pure fire and energy given off by the actor is breathtaking. O'Donnell also deserves a lot of credit because he plays the part perfectly and really stands well against Pacino. Gabrielle Anwar is terrific in her brief scene and Philip Seymour Hoffman, even at this early stage of his career, shows how great he is. The music score is another major plus here as it's impossible to forget once you hear it. The movie clocks in at 157-minutes but it's the shortest "long" movie I've ever seen. The story itself contains so much personal drama that you can't help but get sucked in but the movie also works for many laughs as well. SCENT OF A WOMAN often gets overlooked when people discuss the great movies of the 90s but it's certainly deserving of a mention and then you have a legendary actor turning in a brilliant performance.</fullReview>

He's man who thinks that somehow, he was destined to "tour the battlefield" this way...Beautifully Made, Every Dialog, Every Scene, Every Single Moment of the Movie will drive you Crazy, It's Awesome, Beautiful, Greatest Movies Of All Times, I Just have to say It is very under rated movie, I Seriously give this Movie 10 Generous Holy Stars........

The characters were exactly who and what they were supposed to be, especially young Mr. O'Donnell.Pachino delivered his usual superior performance and then took it over the top in the driving scene. He topped that by the most magnificent 'righteous' head on collision with the school over the boy. He's a Marine - "Not on MY watch!"

		<shortDescription>A pleasurable Thanksgiving weekend in New York</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched Scent of a Woman, I was alone in my room and it was nearing around midnight. I had borrowed the DVD from the local library and had very low expectations for it and knew little of the film's plot other than what the DVD box had offered. I was still wide-awake so I popped the DVD into the player just to get some entertainment. Scent of a Woman would then become one of my personal favorites. For the next 2hrs and 37min I will be pleasantly surprised by this dramatic but also lightly comedic film that I felt sad when it ended.Al Pacino, who is one of the prolific actors of his time breaks out of his usual gangster persona to play Lt. Col. Frank Slade, a blind man who meets his complete opposite and most unlikely friend. Prep school student Charlie Simms (a pre-Robin Chris O'Donnell), desperate for a job during the Thanksgiving weekends so he can earn enough money to spend Christmas back at his home in Oregon, is hired to "babysit" Frank while the family goes on a trip that Frank refused to go along with. Little did Charlie know, Frank already has already purchased tickets to New York where he will eventually enjoy himself with expensive restaurants, big hotels, and a beautiful woman. At the end of his trip, he plans to commit suicide because he simply cannot tolerate his blindness anymore.There is a subplot involving Charlie's fiasco at his prep school. After witnessing a prank on the school headmaster's beloved car, Charlie is asked to spill the names of the members behind the prank in order to be bribed for a chance to enter Harvard University, or find himself in great trouble. The other student who also witnessed the prank is a rich-snob-type, George (a pre-Capote Philip Seymour Hoffman), who may have been behind the prank as well. We can think Charlie is ridiculously naive, but Frank takes note of Charlie's integrity and admires him for it, and for some reason, we should too. The subplot is a bit silly if you really think about it, but then again, without this subplot, one of the best speeches I have ever seen in film will never exist -- and that is the speech that earned Pacino his first Oscar, twenty years and seven nominations later.What is so great about Pacino's performance is not just because he plays a blind man, but he makes a very unlikable character into an object of sympathy. We hate him because we can't stand him, but we like him because he respects Charlie's integrity like no one else does. In a way, Pacino IS the film because without his performance, this film wouldn't have the same greatness. And even the "Hoo-ah!" would sound different if it was performed by another actor -- and we won't want that to happen! Another strong point is that Pacino never makes O'Donnell into his walking shadow and this gives a chance for his co-star to shine as well. Maybe O'Donnell didn't deliver a performance as heartbreaking and wonderful as Pacino, but the two actors were able to produce perfect chemistry and their absurd friendship seemed truly believable.There is a scene in this movie where Frank visits his family. We watch as everyone in the house looks at him with their unwelcoming eyes. Frank can sense it, but he tries to make the best of it since he still has his planned suicide in mind. He tries to have a Thanksgiving meal with his family, only to fall into an argument with his nephew (Bradley Whitford). That was the moment that I really sympathized Frank because it felt like he was someone who had finally come to terms with his blindness but regrets his past, but he isn't ready to be nice about it.Even with its long runtime, the film manages to be very entertaining as the audience watches Frank dancing the tango with a young woman (Gabrielle Anwar, in one of the film's most memorable moments) to Frank driving the Ferrari at full-speed. Even in the most dramatic moments, I didn't find one boring second to this film. As Frank shouts to Charlie, "I'm in the dark, here!" I felt a strong chill going through me as if I finally understood Frank.After seeing this film, you would be surprised that this film was directed by Martin Brest, the same guy who gave us -- you guessed it -- Gigli. He does such a superb job in this film even when the script (written by Bo Goldman, who adapted the 1974 Italian film, Profumo di donna) is attached with the standard Hollywood formula. What lead the audience overlook the formula was the marvelous character-driven plot and the lively, humorous, and quotable dialogue. The film is about friendship between two very different people who were able to help each other in their time of need. Scent of a Woman also contains one of the best feel-good endings ever (maybe because it actually felt good) as both men discovers a new purpose to life and a new will to live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific film of 92' with a remarkable performance by Pacino, himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scent of a Woman is about a prep school student named Charlie Simms that needs money to help pay for a trip home for Christmas. He agrees to "babysit" a blind man by the name of Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, but the job is not all what he anticipated. This is an excellent film of 1992 that boosted Chris O' Donnell's career up for his performance of Charlie Simms. But the one actor who stole pretty much every scene in the movie, was that of Al Pacino as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, which later on granted him an Oscar for his role. The screenplay written by Bo Goldman and the direction by Martin Brest were very good and I don't think any other writer or director could've handled this film more carefully than these two. Overall, this a terrific film of 92 and an amazing performance from Pacino that made this one of my favorite films of the 90's. I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10 **** A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank god the Academy finally recognized Pacino in 93, since he was completely snubbed in 75 for Godfather 2. His performance would be on my top 10 best male performances of all time, next to PS Hoffman in Capote since that was a brilliant performance. When an actor plays a blind character, there are ways to tell if he is really looking at things or if he is just faking. With Pacino, you really believed he was blind because he never appears to look at anything, and he is extremely perceptive. Blind people rely on their already heightened other 4 senses anyway.The movie also has some great lines from Pacino as well. It's a serious drama, but there is a lot of comedy too. I would give it my highest rating-10/10. Enjoy it</fullReview>

This movie makes you laugh at Colonel Slade's sarcastic comments, makes you cry because of the sadness of his life story, makes you envious of Charlie's integrity, makes you angry makes you happy about the way it ends, makes you angry at the rich and awful "friends" of Charlie, but in the end makes you happy about how all of those feelings melts together into one big happy ending.The actors are of course brilliant, Pacino probably does his best part ever. Chris O'Donnel makes a debut you won't forget, and Academy Award Winner Philip Seymour Hoffman of course makes a great appearance as 15 years younger. You have got to love this movie.Be amazed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino rocks, Chris O'Donnell flounders and I really enjoyed myself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scent Of Woman starts with us meeting Charlie Simms, a young Baird School attendee, who seeks the affection of his fellow classmates, despite their indifference towards him. He soon finds himself in contact with blind, former army Colonal Frank Slade, heavy drinking and constantly goading his young friend. Charlie has accepted a job to aid Frank as his assistant. Little did he know that this would involve travelling with him to New York on a $24 hamburger-munching, tango-dancing, Ferrari-flashing glamour-fest. Slade also takes him to meet his brother, and then wishes he hadn't. Is Slade a really a basket case, who prays on others to sooth his own pain? Or is he really as proud as he proclaims? The truth is he's both.The film's plot is fairly irrelevant, as the screenplay is almost entirely engaged with it's two leads. At almost three hours long this was obviously a big risk, but the reason it works is because Al Pacino is on absolutely barnstorming form. It's obviously not his best performances. The chances to covet those roles have unfortunately well and truly past. But Colonal Slade is the epitome of his screen persona. He is ferocious, candor and flamboyant. But it is easy to underestimated Pacino. He may be a tower of fire in most of his movies but to dismiss him as a showy character actor is to undermine the breathtaking subtlety (and believe me, he IS a subtle actor) that he adds to his roles. The problem with the film is his young understudy, played by Chris O'Donnell, is about as engaging as a wet towel. The similarly themed "Rain Man" had a wonderfully vivid performance from Dustin Hoffman which was matched by an underplayed turn from Tom Cruise. Chris O'Donell is always unsure of himself. He never reacts the way he's supposed to and constantly looks bored. So the film has the paradoxical effect of benefiting from Al Pacino's scenery chewing.Aside from Pacino, the other thing I loved about this film was it's score. Thomas Newman, who went on to do similar music for American Beauty and Six Feet Under adds real feeling to some of the film's most tender scenes. Whilst Pacino adds true insight into the anguish and loneliness of Colonal Slade, we get this wonderfully quiet and moody chorus that plays whilst Slade bears the truth of his soul to young Charlie Simms. Slade puts on a forthright front of snide sarcasm that cuts in between romantic charm. At his most bare, he is a bitter, self-loathing masochist, who wants to end his life in a blaze of dollar-dispensing glory, with the aid of young Simms. And I think the score is used very neatly wit those scenes.There are other films that deal with these similar themes. The story about two opposites meeting and having a love/hate relationship intertwined with a coming-of-age story about pubescent young boy standing up for what he believes in is certainly touching and affecting, but I don't think it is quite as good as it could have been, largely because of the weakness of casting Chris O'Donnell. At 152 minutes it's a pretty long ride. But aside from this it is very entertaining, and certainly shows what Martin Brest was capable of before he went off and made riffraff like Meet Joe Black (1998) and the infamous Gigli (2003). A treat.</fullReview>

Many may miss the fact that Pacino plays a man (Frank) who loved life and the beauty that is woman, but has had most of it denied to him through his blindness. While the boy, Charlie, is not visually impaired, he IS blind to what Frank can see, until he learns to see with his heart, mind and all of his senses. The scene where Frank dances with Donna (?) could seem contrived, but is a blind man enjoying intimacy not often found anywhere - just smell and touch. Not raunchy sex - intimacy.

		<shortDescription>Depression and John Daniels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A captivating illustration of major depression in action, Scent of a Woman follows one man's last journey through his favorite pleasures in life. It is apparent upon introduction that Frank is not a man content with his situation, but the complexity of his anger makes it difficult to separate personality characteristics from actual symptoms of depression. While alcohol abuse is not a necessary component for depression, it accompanies it well if the individual is looking for a way to distance himself from emotions or thoughts. Indeed, Frank seems to consider Jack Daniels to be his only worthwhile companion. His favorite drink receives more respect than most of his family; even the pet name John is an indication of just how familiar alcohol has become to Frank. "He may be Jack to you son, but when you've known him as long as I have?" is supposed to be a joke, but the truth behind his humor is hard to deny. We are watching a man drink himself into a state of consciousness that he's come to regard as suitably bearable. Any more, he could not function well enough to carry out his plans. Any less and he wouldn't be able to cope with what those plans are really about. The general lack of interest in typical social activities is common in people suffering from depression. In Frank's case it is juxtaposed with his incredible effort to squelch those true emotions with grandiosity and excessive indulgence. While seemingly excited about his grand plan for a last whoo-ah, Frank is very disconnected from his surroundings at home. Impatient with his niece and nephew, and highly critical of his caregivers, Frank makes a point of interacting a little as possible with his family. Indeed part of his aggressive and abusive behavior towards Charlie is an attempt to drive him away. "You back?" Frank says after sensing Charlie has returned a second time. Frank seems impressed to have found someone that would choose to put up with him, even if it is only for the $300. Upon their arrival in New York, it would seem that Frank has lightened up, even found enjoyment. But for all his lavish expenditures, the pleasure is always fleeting and never fully alleviates his sadness, his sense of worthlessness. The days always end the same, with Frank's face fading from a smile into the familiar dull pain and deep loneliness. Overall, this film does an adequate job of portraying major depression but makes it difficult to distinguish characteristics of Frank's personality from concrete symptoms. While anger, tenacity, and fierce independence shape our view of this tragically self-flawed character, they are not offered as a means of explaining his deep depression away. To the contrary, they are the very reasons we are able to see clearly Frank's seemingly lost battle to find a sense of self-worth, to recall the joys of living.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a rather underrated film. I personally believe that if a film sets out to be as unrealistic as possible and achieves it, then it should be praised, and I reckon this film attempts to do this. With that established, you can now give this film all the respect it deserves, which in my opinion is nine stars worth. First of all the acting is brilliant. Al Pacino is fantastic as the arrogant, blind and slightly lovable ex-Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade. Chris O Donnell plays Charlie Simms. A shy somewhat naive student, with a problem at school, and his repulsive friends are played very well, especially George Willis Jr, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The story is totally unbelievable, as at first there is the school dilemma, in which Charlie saw a prank being played on the dean, who insists on expelling him if he doesn't fess up. Of course Charlie is the poor guy who can't afford to be expelled, whereas his other companion (George) who saw it, so we have a battle of classes. Of course by the end of the film, the poor and unfortunate succeeds to beckon the happy ending. Between the starting dilemma and the happy ending is the thanksgiving holiday, in which Charlie takes up the job of caring for 'an old relative' Frank. What starts off as a relationship where Charlie is scared of Frank, and Frank contemptuous of Charlie, but of course they make friends later on. The film watches these two com padres go to New York City, wine and dine in luxury, drive a Ferrari, and yep even the blind man has a go. They dance, and Frank teaches Charlie the facts of life. Yep it's a bag full of totally unbelievable story lines and events, yet the whole thing is well directed, acted and the overall feel-good factor is through the roof. I love this film, and no matter how unrealistic it is, it doesn't harm the viewing pleasure. Honestly this films is not trying to prove anything, it just wants to make you feel good, with its good even mix of great comedy, moving drama and fantastic dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scent of a Woman is one lousy, irritating movie. There is nothing in the feature that comes even close to mediocrity, especially when considering the acting and the screenplay. Al Pacino hams things up so thoroughly that it is surprising that the movie includes a Thanksgiving Day meal rather than an Easter dinner. Chris O'Donnell's performance is nearly as pathetic as Pacino's, and the story is at least as hackneyed as any third rate Godzilla sequel. Like many flash in the pan athletes, Pacino went from an outstanding early performance in "Panic in Needle Park", to a very good acting job in "The Godfather", to consistently worse thespianism, bottoming out with this pile of debris. Unlike "Scarface", which at least looked like it took some movie making effort, giving Pacino the opportunity to foul it up worse than virtually any other actor could, this movie has nothing to distinguish it other than it's tedium and over the top stupidity. How anyone can take this movie seriously, let alone recommend it to anyone short of their worst enemy, is beyond my scope of rationality and viciousness. If you avoid this movie entirely, your life will only be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great story well told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was an excellent film on several levels. First we get an inside look at an old military man about to make a last farewell in a most extravagant way. (This is Mr. Pacino at his best.) We see his disdain for the "green" cadet and his ignorance of the military core values such as honor. We see his compassion for the boy and his attempts to instill in this civilian those deeply rooted values.We also see the same story from the perspective of the young cadet, who begins the film as a rather naive boy but by the end of the movie, has shown he does possess those character traits valued by military men of honor.As the story progresses, we see that the hard shell of the military man hides a very soft inner persona, one who is completely hidden from plain view. You feel a certain sympathy for this blind person once you meet him but by the end of the movie, you no longer feel sympathy, but instead an understanding of his perspective based on critical events in his past.All in all, a great story well told. I'd highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful movie staring Al Pacino as Frank Slade. I'm not going to say "Scent of a woman" is one of Pacino's best movies because he just has made too many great movies (The Godfather Trilogy, Dog Day Afternoon,...), but he certainly is brilliant! Pacino deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role but it's a shame he had to wait such a long time to win his first Academy Award, it shouldn't be his only! I think he should definitely had won for Supporting Role for "The Godfather" and Leading Role for "Dog Day Afternoon".I have seen "Scent of a woman" several times and I just can't say something bad about this movie. The story, based on the novel of the Italian writer Giovanni Arpino is excellent. You really see Frank Slade changing during the movie. If you compare the Frank Slade at the beginning of the movie with the one who gets out of the limo at the very end, you'll see he is a completely different person. In the beginning, Slade had planned the trip to New York as the last highlight of his miserable life. That's why he wanted to commit suicide in his hotel room.Because he was blind, he didn't felt alive anymore. He said it too: "The day we stop looking, is the day we die". Frank Slade had died a long time ago, inside he was already dead for a long time. But in New York, with Chris O'Donnel in his neighbourhood, he started feeling alive again. The ride with the Ferrari, the visit to the prostitute and of course...the wonderful tango with Gabrielle Anwar who gives a touching performance. All this makes Frank Slade start feeling alive again. Although he isn't able to see, he has noticed some light at the end of his blind tunnel.Touching story, amazing acting... All of this makes "Scent of a woman" a must see for everyone. Also the scene where the speech is given by Pacino at O'Donnel's school is breathtaking. Al Pacino gives the performance of he lifetime. I love De Niro but Pacino is definitely the best actor of his generation. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not an ordinary story; big marks for originality. Performances were even and mostly exceptional. Of course Pacino wins the well-earned Oscar, but O'Donnell and Gabrielle Anwar are superb. The whole Slade family cast is as good as could be conceived - Whitford and Eginton especially. Likewise the Baird gang: Rebhorn, Seymour Hoffman, and even Conroy.Memorable scenes include the Ferrari test-drive, the Thanks Giving family event, the final gun scene, and the disciplinary committee hearing. But the film history die was struck hard, with the tango scene. Pacino and Anwar play their roles to the full, a confident blind aficionado dance lead and a young, stunningly beautiful but humble, sophisticated "amateur" follow.Thomas Newman graces the film with an original music score worthy of his reputation par excellance. He should have received much more recognition for this and many other works; maybe someday the "Academy" or the "Globes" will pull out the stops and grant a deep bow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ocar performance by Pacino almost ruined by excruciatingly insipid Hollywood ending. [SPOILER]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[ ** spoilers follow **]This movie is about the Pacino character, and especially the tango scene. It is intense, dark, and will resonate with the 30+ crowd. The movies should end when the kid talks Pacino down, and perhaps could have been at least nominated for P's incredible performance. Until then, the whole cynical-wisdom meets wide-eyed idealism is poignant and bittersweet and works. Then there's the absurd, tacked-on ending which you may inspire you if you're under 20 and in school, but coming after the rest of the movie and all the work they did building up P's exquisitely noble-tragic-raunchy character it is painfully sophomoric and trite. In short, by the time you're been through these intense scenes and dialog (tango, Ferrari, the "two syllables" monologue, and the attempted suicide) you couldn't give a rats *ss about whether the kid gets expelled from school and the hyperbolic, trite, cheesy, gratuitous last scene. See it anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie tonight for probably the tenth time. Like many, I am a fan of the tango scene. Whenever I pass this movie flipping channels, and I haven't missed this scene, I will watch for it. It is one of the most perfect scenes in a movie ever. When "Michael" arrives, the young ladies' date, you can feel the energy sucked out of the room. A real testament to the great acting in "Scent of a Woman".Unlike some, I am not a fan of the final prep school scene. Seems too melodramatic and Hollywood. For me, the movie ends in the final dramatic scene in the hotel room. As I watched this movie tonight and the Colonel said the words "it's dark in here", it finally occurred to me he was not talking about his blindness. He was talking about his soul. It touched something raw and unspoken. How blind are we to the darkness in our own soul? There is such realism in this movie. I hate that the ending veers too much into a formula to be really satisfying. I love Al Pacino's performance and I'm glad this is the movie he won the Oscar for. This is a movie you have to see over and over again to truly appreciate the nuances of his performance. While not a perfect film, it is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite an interesting film with a simple premise. There isn't much in the way of a plot. A blind, ex-army colenel takes thanksgiving weekend to taste the good life, and he needs a guide, a helper, but there's also a sub-plot involving college friends being threatened with explusion. The whole essence of this film is carried solely by Pacino's performance. There are not many other actors who could have done just as well. (Imagine Van damme or Seagal, sorry). Yet, I think Chris O'Donnell is seriously miscast. There are plenty of other actors who could have done a better job. Sometimes he seemed confused, not knowing what to do. I don't think it was scripted. Not a bad film though, but without Pacino to keep it afloat, this simply would have sank.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSOK, how does someone comment on this film? I must admit I must have seen it way over a dozen times and I still love it. Truthfully though, without big Al Pacino, it'd be awful.In "Scent Of A Woman", Chris O'Donnell's Charlie Simms is placed in an awkward situation at school whilst simultaneously agreeing to spend Thanksgiving with an obnoxious bitter blind ex-soldier. The soldier, Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, is played with mouth dropping beauty by Al Pacino. I confess when British TV created their top 100 actors ever and Al Pacino was number one, I felt kinda cheated as for the films they suggested, I didn't feel it was anything special. If you watch the guy in this film though, it must go down as one of the finest performances of all time. At the 1993 Oscars, to give him the best acting award was fair, and truthfully, to not award it best film was equally right. I won't comment on Clint Eastwood gaining most of the awards for "Unforgiven", but irrelevant of what did win, I question if this film deserved the award. You ask me why? It's because it's a bit too variable.The one problem in my view with this film is that aside from Al Pacino, little else is really added to the show. Pacino is God like in his abilities, I cannot speak more highly of him, but the ultimate flaw is that you kinda feel the film runs out of direction and just filters off. I admit to not being an enormous fan of the end. This could possibly be though because probably the best cinematic scene of all time is featured earlier when Pacino tango's with Gabrielle Anwar. The scene is breathtakingly beautiful. Aided with stunning music and spot on execution, you finish that scene with the real physical need to be in that scene yourself. This scene is the films high point, and ultimately the problem. The reasoning is simply, that how do you improve on such a brilliant bit of film? The sad but true answer is that you don't. This film drops towards the end, not as much due to the creators fault, but due to natural inability to keep up a majestic pace.Ultimately, what can be said about "Scent Of A Woman"? Well put it this way. One of my closest friends is ridiculously strict on his film tastes. His favourite films are "American Beauty" and "The Shawshank Redemption". I don't know anybody who adores excellent cinematography and hates average cinematography as much as him. His view ten minutes after the Tango scene? He loved it. Take that as a hint. For the one key scene alone, this film must be watched. However without the beginning, arguably the end and Al Pacino being amazing throughout, this film, and in particular that scene, would not be as good.</fullReview>

I think Al Pacino is my favorite actor of all time because all of his great movies like Serpico, Heat, Dog-Day Afternoon and Insomnia. But the two movies that stand out to me is of course the Godfather Saga and Scent of a Woman.

		<fullReview>College student Chris O'Donnell gets into trouble after being wrongfully accused of a silly prank involving faculty member James Rebhorn. Now O'Donnell is in a bind. He may be expelled and money is tighter than ever. Enter the crazed former military colonel Al Pacino (in his unforgettable Oscar-winning performance). O'Donnell has agreed to watch Pacino as his niece and her family have left for a weekend vacation. Oh did I mention that Pacino is blind, horny and suicidal? What a weekend O'Donnell will have when all is said and done. "Scent of a Woman" is reminiscent of old Hollywood with new flair. Director Martin Brest (Oscar-nominated) had struck gold in 1984 with the highly successful "Beverly Hills Cop" and continued with that wild style here. The substance is a bit better this time around and of course Pacino makes the whole thing worthwhile. His over-the-top performance makes him an amazing three-dimensional character that you love, hate, laugh with and cry with all at the same time. Pacino has been in better films, but this is likely his finest outing. The film does have shortcomings a mile long admittedly, but at the end the magic between Pacino and then-newcomer O'Donnell is impossible to question. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

So it's a couple decades late? Who cares? Pacino is one this generation's very finest. Like Dustin Hoffman in "Rain Man", give 'em a disability to work with..and they start printing your name on the gold guy.Don't get me wrong. This is a quality flick with quality performances. But it's not "Godfather II". So 20 years later, your friends at AMPAS decided to reward a career. No problem. However, I suggest that you go back and take a look at "Scarecrow" to do some comparison shopping on Pacino's approach to a character with heavy duty inner turmoil.Chris O'Donnell gets to reap the benefits of working alongside the master. NOBODY looks bad in a scene with Pacino. He makes you work to HIS level.Just one more standard great performance in the Pacino canon. Collect all in a series of 52.</fullReview>

I never saw this first time round - it seemed like yet another 'big star plays big disability' film, and in a world that we share with Tom Hanks that kind of sensibility is definitely surplus to requirement. However, on watching SCENT OF A WOMAN on a TV release, it's really rather good.Al Pacino is, of course, stunning. His technique of "not focusing on anything" obviously works, although it doesn't quite get him into method acting school! Chris O'Donnell plays his Cruise-like sidekick with impressive skill, and it's nice to see this actor working before the corruption of Robin. Thomas Newman's score is refreshingly catchy (inspired American Beauty anyone..?), and the direction is slick.However the film does seem to run a good half an hour too long. Having said that, though, I cannot follow up this criticism with scenes that should be cut, however once Pacino's intentions are exposed, there is not a lot of storyline left to tell.Finally, I may be missing something blindingly obvious here, but what does this title refer to? All I can think of is a loose plot strand that doesn't really seem to earn a title. Anyone got any ideas...?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly as classic of the last 10 yrs, both in presentation and acting. Al Pacino delivers both dialogue and monologue in an involving method which the viewer will never forget. The first meeting of Charlie and Frank is spellbinding as Frank is "looking for a brain".The flaw in this movie is ironically its finest point, the final scene. It is the resolution of both Charlie's conflict, and Frank's search for a purpose in life, as Frank uses intimidation tactics to trick everyone into forgeting basic ethics. Yes, "snitching" is annoying and lousy, (who can forget the playground tatle-tale of their youth?), but lying is even worse. True integrity would have been to ID the bums to whom he had no true loyalty, but not accept any reward for it. Indeed he should have exposed the Headmaster's bribery attempt. The "prank" would not have been a success without the Headmaster's pride and arrogance. Who pricked the balloon anyway?The movie would have gotten a 9 for presentation, story, and acting, but loses a point for picking a convienient ending and calling it "integrity"8 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A poor but honest Ivy League prep school student (Chris O'Donnell) becomes the reluctant chaperon over a long Thanksgiving weekend to a bitter, blind ex-lieutenant colonel who can guess a woman's name, a little unbelievably, by the perfume she wears. O'Donnell only wants to earn a few extra bucks, but his ward has other ideas, using the boy as a human guide dog for one final fling of high living before falling on his sword, so to speak. The usually reliable Al Pacino gives a disappointing, one-note performance as lieutenant colonel Frank Slade, but there isn't much he could have done with a character whose craving for double whiskeys, tough talk, and (in his words) 'pussy' is meant to be a romantic attachment to wine, women, and song. Bo Goldman's masochistic screenplay is likewise a big letdown, packed full of maudlin self-pity and ending not in suicide, of course, but in a self-congratulatory standing ovation by the entire student body of O'Donnell's school, after which everyone goes home to presumably wait for their Oscar nominations. Martin Brest ('Beverly Hills Cop', 'Midnight Run') directs as if frustrated by the lack of opportunities for a car chase, although he manages to stage one anyway, in a ludicrous scene which stands as a blatant product plug for Ferrari.</fullReview>

There is always something lacking off somewhere. I repeat: if you have seen the original Italian one this US Scent of A Woman will be ridiculous to your eyes. Vision of the original Italian one is strongly recommended. You may have a hard time finding it though... Al Pacino delivers and he is believable, no doubt about it... but it is not enough and his co-fellow O'Donnel reaches level of weakness in his interpretation you would think his coat is actually more expressive than him.

		<shortDescription>Two Too Contrasting Personalities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scent of a Woman is a movie that aims to please all audiences. On the one hand, it satisfies those seeking meaning and heart in a movie, yet on the other, it provides off-kilter humor from a known rough and tough actor, Al Pacino (Godfathers, Devil's Advocate). This film is the tale of a weekend spent between a crass, retired Lt. Col. (Pacino) who because of his individualism and disregard for personal safety was rendered blind late in his life, and a poor and timid prep high school student in O'Donnell, who agrees to "babysit" the retired war hero over Thanksgiving weekend. What Charlie (O'Donnell) doesn't know is that the colonel has planned a rambunctious trip which is set to end rather abruptly. The movie contains funny scenes with a blind Pacino driving a Ferrari and dancing the tango.A subplot exists, where Charlie is grappling with a moral dilemma at school, where he battles between snitching out a classmate, or keeping his "honor." Predictably, Col. Slade gets involved and offers his two cents, which provides for an adequate finish, with a gut-wrenching and heartwarming performance by Pacino securing him his first Best Actor Oscar.Pacino's acting as a blind man, though not perfect, is sufficient given the circumstances in the movie. He offers up kindness and "pearls of wisdom" by barking out orders. Many who saw this movie, had expected a pure mushy drama, and for those who sought this sort of medium, were most likely disappointed. The movie displays great balance in each individual's character, and successfully strays away from either being too mushy, or too crass.Where the film lacks overall balance is in the performance by O'Donnell. I know director Martin Brest wanted to achieve a sense of Pacino's and O'Donnell's being opposites, but this was taken too far it seems. Charlie (O'Donnell) releases too many "duhs" and "aaahs" among other various verbal fumblings to make his character believable. And although he doesn't stand anywhere close to Pacino in the actor's pyramid, this film does not do him justice; because, as his fans know, he does obtain a few nuggets of good acting.Otherwise, the movie is funny, and even at times tear-jerking, long yes, but well worth it. As being one of the "pioneering" DVDs available to the public (released in such form in August of 1997), this DVD contains essentially no extras... but the film itself is a minor gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie spends Thanksgiving weekend taking care of a blind, retired officer to earn money to get home from his all-boy boarding school for Christmas. The latter unexpectedly takes them both to New York to live for one more time, and the two bond and get through to each other, in spite of how different they are. This is about integrity and earning what you get, as opposed to having anything handed to you. While it has moments of Hollywood, it's a timeless message and this ought not to be forgotten... and certainly needs no remaking(and no, I have not watched the original, nor read the novel), lest generations pass and something vital to this changes between then and now. The acting is great for all concerned. O'Donnell goes beyond the naive youthful vibe that comes natural to him and comes off as someone with strength of character. There are no big parts for women in this, and Pacino's role is, ahem, focused on them, and yet he is always respectful towards them(...well, other than the ones he's related to) and there is nothing exploitative in the presentation of them. They are classical beauties, stunning and natural, and they don't invite subjugation, nor do they experience any. This is filmed and edited well. There is tension, and for not manipulating us, this manages to make us empathize with the leads. Because we understand them, and because they are real. They and their actions are not perfect, and they never claim that to be the case. Both of them admit who they are. This is well-paced, and the two and a half hours go by smoothly, with no excess. There is a little strong language in this, none of it gratuitous. I recommend this to everyone mature enough for it(audiences should be at least in their teens). 8/10</fullReview>

I have to really admit ,I didn't understand the movie at the first, but when I saw the movie couple of times I really loved it because of its great screenplay and dialogue's . This is a touching story of two people from different background and how they discover a new life after sharing few days together. Al Pacino gives best performance as blind Ret. Lt. Col. Frank Slade. After watching the movie I thought about the character played by Pacino and it really created an long lasting impact on my mind by its attitude , voice , dialogues and specially the way he does "Who-ah" I think no one else could have played this role as excellent as he did. Along with Pacino you get to see a good supportive performance by Chris O'Donnell who plays a young bright student in prep school, who is going through difficult phase about making certain decision in his life. The "Tango girl" Donna played by Gabrielle Anwar looks gorgeous and sweet in the small role. Also I did notice George Willis Jr. portrayed good by Phillip S. Hoffman in his early days. Bringing them together Martin Breast does a good job as a director and writer. But at last I would mention one thing again Al Pacino steals the show in this movie. I Would give eight for the great performances by actors , and also for good direction and writing a great screenplay</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I a Hopeless Romantic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you want to begin to understand why the Tango, of all possible dances, is the ultimate expression of erotic romanticism? Watch the "Tango Lesson" scene in "Scent of a Woman"! If someone bawls uncontrollably EVERY time he sees this scene, is he a hopeless romantic? Yeah, I guess so... In this case, however, I am proud to admit it. You must watch the entire movie before that scene to get its real impact. But that's a pleasant task, indeed. I will never tire of that scene. It is truly beautiful on every level, from the first sighting of that lovely young woman, through the tour-de-force blind-dancing performance by Al Pacino, until she is spirited away by her boyfriend, the one who thinks the tango is "hilarious". Watch this movie! Watch this scene! There are other scenes which rate close to tops: The Ferrari Test Drive... And, of course, The Pseudo-Courtroom "Speech" by Frank Slade, Lt. Col., U.S. Army (Retired). But, to me, that amazing Tango scene rates absolute first place.The entire movie is wonderfully understated, in the sense that one can so easily imagine neat additional dialog: rejoinders, exposition, wise-cracks, "score-one-for-me" stuff that was so intelligently never added, or perhaps eliminated before the final release. That one characteristic makes the movie excellent, above all else. Kudos for everyone involved in its production. This movie really is one of the great ones. It needs to be on everyone's top-rated list!Ten-out-of-ten. I can't give it any less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Al Pacino Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason this film is so well liked is because of Al Pacino's performance, and the reason his performance is so well liked is because he plays that sort of character that's loud, rude, uninhibited, and crassly funny, the type of person that makes a scene in a place and doesn't seem to realize it. Audiences love this type of character, even when this character is in a supporting role or even a bit part, over the entire rest of the cast, which they will end up almost completely overlooking, because there's something about such a fiery individual with no manners and provokes looks from other tables in fancy restaurants and other things like that that they find upliftingly funny. The problem is that the writers, not to mention Pacino, know this about audiences and almost go a little too far with the likable, rebellious older guy. Making multiple efficient high-speed turns in downtown New York City would be impossible for a blind man to perform without crashing, even with a young man accustomed to the car coaching him. But it's a cool notion that even if Pacino is blind, he can still rock a Ferrari. It would be highly unlikely that Headmaster Trask would need to rely on witness testimony to find out who was responsible for the paint-balloon gag. It would be more efficient to get to the perpetrators by means of the person(s) responsible for the loud speaker. But it's better to have a reason for Pacino showing up and sticking it to the man.Al Pacino is one of the contemporary classic scene stealers, up there with Brando, De Niro, Malkovich, Hoffman, Depp, and Nicholson, and because of his naturally entertaining performance in a two-and-a-half-hour movie playing the likable, rebellious older guy, Scent of a Woman isn't really Scent of a Woman. It's really The Al Pacino Show. Every other actor and actress in the film seems difficult to comment on, because when all we're supposed to focus on is Al, it's as if everyone else is a stick figure.Scent of a Woman is actually a very good film, a good-spirited character piece, a drama with its even sprinkles of wry Pacino humor, and Pacino's character is actually quite a realistic man in a realistic situation. It's really not deeply felt. Martin Brest has never been a good enough director to make something very deep, but he's very good at making highly satisfactory Hollywood schlock entertainment. Scent of a Woman is above average schlock, possibly a fine holiday season film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacino impressive as usual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even the greatest and most prominent actors proceed "over the top" more often than seems appropriate at times. For example, despite the challenged nature of his character in "Forrest Gump," I felt if Tom Hanks said in a whiny, nasal, drawn-out voice, "My Jennnnny," one more time I'd scream. Ditto for Brando's mumbling in "On the Waterfront" and "A Streetcar Named Desire," and Harrison Ford's droll, quiet, dour musings in the Clancy flicks and much of his other work. Hanks and Ford are great actors, Brando one of the great icons, with numerous fine, 8-figure performances among them. But all have been noticeably, and sometimes annoyingly, "over-the top," often.On the other hand, Al Pacino is an actor who can be "over-the-top," and it not only seems natural, but even necessary - and makes his character and performance come to life more effectively, making the film better than it would have been otherwise."Scent of a Woman" is a prime example. The part of the film with him driving the sports car speedily through Manhattan (albeit it on a weekend day with no competing traffic) is positively ludicrous, with no trace of real possibility - yet adds to the proceedings. (Certainly a blind person with a "co-pilot" could drive in some fashion, but never as depicted.)Pacino's mannerisms, speech and entire performance were on the one hand, overdrawn and exaggerated - but on the other, would have suffered with anything less.In real life, Pacino is not tall of stature, but like his predecessor, Alan Ladd, seems like he is 6-feet-tall or more on-screen, both physically and in the magnitude of his performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scent of a Woman" - A movie I would have seen a freaking number of times.. a movie which has one of the strongest of the fictional characters ever created.. Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade played by Al Pacino stands in the same league as that of Terry Malloy played by Marlon Brando in 'On the Waterfront' and Jake La Motta played by Robert De Niro in ' The Raging Bull'.. Its a movie which by name sounds like a soft porno movie but turns out to be a movie about deep insights into the most beautiful thing in this world - life.. how the feeling of being useless drives a person as strong as Colonel Slade into enjoying the materialistic pleasures of life on the thanksgiving weekend and blow his brains out to get done with what has been a life full of ironies, adventures, forbidden pleasures and ultimately being useless. But they say hope is what keeps us alive. Charlie, a high school student, comes into his life drives him to find a purpose in his remaining life as a blind man and the Colonel goes on.. A movie which seals Al Pacino as an impeccable actor and unparalleled in his class... the scene of thanksgiving lunch at his Bro's place, his tango in the restaurant and the high school speech have to be one of the most artistically directed scenes ever.. a wonderful wonderful movie.. watch it and enjoy it.. cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT the best movie ever, but good enough in its own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Retired Lt. Col. Frank Slade (Al Pacino) is blind and lives with his niece's family. When the niece and family decide to take a trip during Thanksgiving weekend, they need a "babysitter" for Uncle Frank. Enter Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a prep school student, with ambitions of going to university; ambitions that are on the verge of collapse when he is summoned to a disciplinary hearing for a prank that he was not part of. Charlie agrees to babysit Col.Slade for the weekend. Unbeknownst to him, the Colonel has grand plans of spending the weekend in New York; and he doesn't plan on returning. Col. Slade takes Charlie along and during the course of the weekend, both men learn a little bit more about life.This is probably not the best movie you will ever see, with the ending quite obvious and plenty of clichés thrown in. But if you watch it just for Al Pacino then you're not going to be disappointed. Pacino delivers another brilliant performance as the blind, retired Lt. Colonel with a brash exterior and a heart of gold, and he rightly won the Best Actor Oscar for this performance. It does make one wonder why he didn't win for his portrayals in other movies such as Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon and The Godfather II where his performances were equally, if not more, powerful. Be that as it may, Pacino is riveting from his first scene to the last. Chris O'Donnell is nowhere near the class of Pacino, but to his credit, he tries hard and manages to deliver a fairly solid performance as the prep school student who is trying to decide on his course of action for the disciplinary hearing.The interaction between Frank and Charlie is very believable, and you can see that they're both teaching each other valuable lessons for their respective lives.There are some slightly far-fetched moments(Ferrari scene) but they are more than balanced out by moments of sheer beauty (tango scene). And the climatic speech by the Colonel at Charlie's disciplinary hearing is something that everybody should really listen to, at least once.All in all, weaknesses included, this movie is a must-see and also a must-own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hoo Ha! This is a great movie! Pacino is at his absolute best as the embittered, blind Colonel, and Chris O'Donnell I thought played it right on as the thoughtful and somewhat unsure student.By the end of the speech Pacino's character gave in defense of Chris's character, I was ready to vote him for President.There are so many wonderful scenes, the tango, the joyride, the uncomfortable family reunion, the speech, etc. I frankly don't understand how some people could have given this movie such a low ranking. It resonates with me on every level.Pacino really and truly deserved the Oscar, and I was glad to see him break out of the gangster typecasting, in much the same way that the movie Awakenings helped DeNiro break out of the gangster mold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He wants to blow his head out but he might as well blow yours first !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>7 ? well 6.5 actually. An entertaining and funny movie about a blind and retired lieutenant who has a plan, and what a plan ! When a college student comes in to assist him for the week-end, he executes his project by picking up the boy to New York, and there he realises some of his dreams in his company, sleeping in the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, driving a Ferrari with his assistance, ... He quickly establishes a close relationship with Charlie Sims, but at the same time he challenges him, because his behaviour contrasts so much with what we expect from a blind man.On Charlie's side, we learn that he witnessed some stupid joke some that some of his pals made on the Dean and that he hesitates to tell what he saw or to shut his mouth.First the flaws : First may be Chris O'Donnell is an improbable mate for Al Pacino, he gives on the emotional level what he misses in character.Then, I don't feel that being such an intransigent and sometimes arrogant person is a real lesson in life and the much debated ending seems to indicate that the Lieutenant has high moral standards. Come on, I know it's only a movie but where have you seen a blind man so interested in women, cigars, and so on... To me it was often like Al Pacino playing his usual nervous and macho male just wearing black glasses, rather than the role of an humble and aging blind man, like the one we imagine living in the backyard of the "Flinstones" house (his niece's).The good : Al Pacino takes so much pleasure in his role, that we enjoy the improbable situations, and that even makes us understand somehow his nasty playing with Charlie's nerves.All the fuss about the joke in the College yard may be an excuse for the Lieutenant to get involve in the process and make his radical but brilliant speech in front of the Disciplinary Comitee. Well, that's OK for me, but my advice is to focus on the moving moments of the interplay between him and the student, and of course all the amusing tricks he pulls and the surprises he creates, and yes, he must be a great Tango dancer in real life too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing bonding tale of blind retired officer and teenage companion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from one objection (noted later), this is an incredible movie, memorable primarily for Al Pacino's brilliant portrayal of a rather nasty, blind retired army colonel, and for the developing relationship between said officer with a teenage boy hired as his temporary companion. Al Pacino is riveting, portraying with equal skill his character's bossy, sarcastic exterior and his hopeless, despairing interior. Not to mention...is Al Pacino blind himself? He plays the part so consistently, it's hard to believe that he's not.The plot revolves around a boarding school student named Charlie (Chris O'Donnell), who is hired (by the officer's niece) as a weekend companion to look after blind ex Colonel Frank Slade, while the niece's family go off on a Thanksgiving vacation. This doesn't turn out to be quite the easy, uneventful money making job the not very affluent young Charlie has anticipated, as he is caught up in Frank's plans for a whirlwind fast and fun trip to New York. And also, alas, in Frank's suicidal intent.The plot moves along quite sprightly, with the New York weekend involving limousines, a ritzy hotel, fancy dining, an assignation with a prostitute (for Frank), a wild Ferrari drive with a blind man at the wheel, and an incredible tango demonstration. Pacino deserved his Best Actor Oscar for that tango alone. Definitely one of the most immortal dance scenes in cinematic history. Enrollment in tango classes must have increased dramatically right after this movie's release. My only complaint is a sexual situation the movie might have done without (though the R rating gives ample warning), in the form of some remarks made by Frank at a relative's dinner table, though I suppose this did serve to dramatically highlight his crude nastiness. As for the hooker, it's made pretty clear that for Frank, this is merely second best sex, not the sort of relationship for which he truly longs but believes to be unattainable.Frank's world weariness is well conveyed, having lost his sight as the result of a stupid accident. The suicide attempt scene is gripping, especially as it highlights the relationship that has emerged in such a short period of time between the blind colonel and his young student companion. By the way, Chris O'Donnell is also excellent in his role here.As a tremendous fan of Dead Poets Society, I especially liked the whole boarding school plot line, which reminds me somewhat of that film. Charlie finds himself in trouble with school officials for not snitching on his rich, snobbish, despicable, cowardly, disloyal classmates. Personally, like many other reviewers, I see no reason why Charlie should not have tattled to start with on these creeps (in truth, no friends of his), but I guess the point is well taken that Charlie refuses to sell out his own ideals, whether we agree with them or not, for the sake of a scholarship.Fabulous movie, especially this unusual relationship between Frank and Charlie, that begins with Frank bellowing orders at his paid escort and ends with such a touching friendship, each party needing the other. And a wonderful ending with Frank going to bat for his young friend at the school's hearing, and putting those creepy classmates in their place with his dramatic speech. Also, a potentially interesting woman for him to pursue! But best of all, Frank's endearing and touching thaw in the closing scene toward the two children, his niece's kids, to whom he has previously acted so bearlike. Some have complained that the end ruined the movie, but sometimes it's nice to see such a moving and hopeful personal transformation. Drama need not necessarily end gloomily to be effective, and Scent of a Woman shows it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very enjoyable film that only drags at the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: *** out of ****. Scent of a Woman was a very successful film when it came out. It was called a "crowd pleaser" and it earned four Oscar Nominations (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay). It took home Best Actor for none other than the masterful Al Pacino. If there is any reason Scent of a Woman will be come a classic it is because it was the only time Pacino won an oscar. That is not to say there is not anything good about the film but Pacino is the commanding force.For the most part, Scent of a Woman is an enjoyable film and even though it is long it will not feel like it. A lot of things are done right in the film. The chemistry between the two main actors is excellent and the pacing is just right. The first time I saw Pacino's performance I was not impressed. I thought he was way over the top. This time I fully appreciated the performance. It was magnificent. Frank Slade is not exactly a subtle character, so Pacino's performance is a bit over the top but that is because it calls for it. Pacino makes Frank Slade into an extremely memorable character. I do not know if I would call this the best performance of his career but it is certainly Oscar Worthy. Chris O'Donnell is excellent a Charlie. He is not as commanding as Pacino but that is because Charlie is a less showy character. O'Donnell's approach is understated but his performance is memorable. The chemistry between him and Pacino is excellent.Unfortunately, the ending for Scent of a Woman is weak. It is over the top and it seems to go on forever. It seems to be for those people who just want a happy ending all the time. However, Scent of a Woman has enough strong points to make it worth seeing. </fullReview>

He is totally convincing as the blind Colonel and definitely deserved his oscar. Worth watching for Pacino himself.The film on the whole rests on Pacino's performance and therefore suffers when other characters are the focus. Still a decent film though.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, it was a great film and Al Pacino's acting was outstanding as always. Congratulations for the Oscar for best actor. The flow of the story was good, especially the Thanksgiving dinner scene was touching and the Tango dancing scene was beautifully shot, however I think the last scene of the school hearing spoils the first good 2 hours. It's too dramatic and the director's intention of moving the emotion of audiences was too obvious. It ends up just another film that pushes us the morality. After all, it was just another well-made Hollywood film. ***/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scent of a Woman may be very lengthy, but it is also a very impressive film. The film looks beautiful, Martin Brest's direction is quite excellent, the script avoids being too melodramatic or soapy it is actually quite poignant when it needs to be and the story while very loosely based on the 1974 Italian film is always believable.The acting is top-drawer. Chris O'Donnell is surprisingly impressive, I've known him to be bland before but he is quiet and understated here, and Gabrielle Anwar is lovely. But it is Al Pacino that makes the film as good as it is, he is just extraordinary. Whether tangoing with Anwar, berating O'Donnell's cowardly schoolmates or uttering his infamous laugh, Pacino whatever he's doing on screen gives one of his greatest performances.In conclusion, very impressive elevated more so by Pacino. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredibly dated in its frightening and reactionary message. So what we learn is that loyalty trumps everything. Maybe when it comes to a stoopid prank. But what if soldiers rape and murder innocent civilians (hullo, it has happened as has even worse); does loyalty trump morality? The film says it does. One line Pacino says during his A FEW GOOD MEN speech was muffled and it may be, "Some cornball crap" or something like that. In that case, I rescind what I wrote. If he said that, then he realized that what he said was bs and it's all a stupid game.Also, the fluctuations in Pacino's accent are unnerving. First, it's pretty much standard speech, often New York-ese and turns to southern dialect in the final scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very impressed with Gasman's performance in the original movie. He is so good that he looks like a real blind person without over- acting. And his anger is credible without having to yell all the time. He is abrasive and vulnerable.As a matter of fact Pacino looks like a blind person in other movies since his eyes don't focus in any object or person. Frank Caliendo in his stand up " All Over the Place" makes a very funny impersonation of Pacino and how he never looks at the other actor's eyes.Don't get me wrong. I think Pacino had good movies, Serpico and other performances that I enjoyed but this movie got 7.8 either because people haven't seen the original or saw this one first and never realized that Gasman made this character real and probably inspired Pacino's performance.One good movie to appreciate Gasman's talent is " The easy life" (Il sorpasso in Italian) and he has many others that I don't remember the title but watched them in Havana and made a lasting impression until today.</fullReview>

Here, the developing relationship between the two, the dialogues, and the forward-moving-action are excellent, pepped up by one of the best dance scenes in movie history (without any expert fancy moves to top). Once the characters fly back, the movie may be stopped, as the entire power it derived from the road trip falls into itself again life a soufflé that has been out of a furnace for more that a minute.</fullReview>

The movie has a poor plot which doesn't allow the story to be taken very seriously.

		<fullReview>There is no denying the excellence of Al Pacino's performance nor the entertainment value of the movie. That said, I'd suggest that readers try finding a copy of the film "Scent of a Woman" was based on: the Italian-made "Profumo di Donna," starring Vittorio Gassman. Gassman's interpretation is much different, and the film -- though a comedy in the universal sense -- more serious. Gassman's character is an unlikeable failure, with little to recommend him. The intrusive prep school subplot in Pacino's version makes no appearance in the Italian.Unfortunately "Profumo di Donna" has yet to be released on DVD, only on VHS. Your search will be more than worth the effort as will your time spent watching the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a Scent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American cinema, in its quest to rip off Foreign classics, re-packages them in neat little heart-shaped boxes containing chocolate bon-bons ready to be eaten by the public in delectable, saccharine-sweet flavors. It's a practice that by the time of this writing has gone past the European sensibility and zeroed in on Asian horror movies. However, it was only time before it would turn its copy machine's sick-green light unto itself and remake everything on the face of the (American) Earth ranging from here-to-fore untouchable classics to the worst television show.SCENT OF A WOMAN is (surprise, surprise) a remake of an Italian film from 1974 called PROFUMO DI DONNA which translates as "The Perfume of a Woman" or basically the same American title. That film was up for the Academy Award for Best Fcreign Language film (it lost to Kurosawa's DERZU UZALA). This film was up for a little more, including acting nods for Al Pacino, into his eighth nomination for Best Actor, and who's best work has been left behind in the Seventies. It promoted the appearance of Gabrielle Anwar, possibly as a way to lure audiences into the theatres, a sure sign a movie by itself can't stand on its own.It sounds like I don't like this movie. I don't, but I don't dislike it either. The problem with such a film as this is that any real essence has been sucked dry and it looks like an exercise in artificiality peppered with an actor's overpowering persona vying one last time for a golden statuette. It's too bad Pacino won for this movie; if the Academy had wanted to honor him they should have been paying more attention to his acting in any film of the Seventies (take your pick) or GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS. Here, it's all perfunctory looking fresh, not a bad film, just too rehearsed to look authentic. Chris O'Donnell has a thankless role and plays it for the paycheck he received and his pretty looks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scent of Al Pacino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino is so good at playing the angry/sad dynamic, and while I don't think Scent of a Women ranks as his best work, it is still a great showcase for his talents, and a very enjoyable movie. Chris O'Donnel plays Charlie Simms, the poor, innocent college student, looking to make a few dollars to pay for plane fare home for Christmas by baby sitting Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Pacino), a difficult blind man. Well, the minute Simms and Slade are alone, Slade is running the show, taking Simms on a wild and luxurious trip to New York that is all about fun, fun, fun.Lieutenant Slade is tremendously proud yet so alone, he shows up uninvited at his brothers house for Thanksgiving, and the family members can only offer a few weak and fake smiles, as Slade begins to dominate through tirade. But these family members do not find him amusing, in fact, one relative tells Simms that the Lieutenant was always an a__hole, long before he went blind.Simms and Slade each have their own compelling dramas unfolding as they battle and bond with each other, and they discover how much they need each other.I really feel Pacino took average dialogue and made it sizzle. Chris O'Donnel sounds a lot like Toby McGuire, and it was fun to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing a young college kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only One Class Act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really, the film is not great; It switches from farcical to impressive. Almost 1-dependent on the scene presence of Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, the grey ghost, Whoo ha!, uncle Al(!) All of the school/family scenes seem to be out-takes from the Goonies or an extension from Gordie Lachance's childhood, childish stories from Stand By Me. If this plot had been equal to the performance of Pacino we would have ourselves a film - Whoo ha!(enough.) "Please. Please don't do that."Anyway, as it is, the script, on the most, is shocking, and generally, the film is riddled with off-putting contradictions running to the full depth of the shallowness of the story. 'Tis too, throughout, wrought with the embarrassing auto-erotic asphyxiation that we're used to from (yuck) Hollywood; the final scene of the American's whooping (at whatever) will send such shivers down your spine you may break a vertebrae. Actually the film is very poor. Aye, a shame.But...Pacino's performance is damn fine. Pretending you're the average blind man seems to be the easy bit. (I tried it in front of the mirror and though i look like Pacino (Gina? :) i couldn't even get close. How can you see yourself in the mirror if you're blind, for example?)Don't watch this if you want to see a good film, watch this if you want to see one of the finest acting performances from an actor of the now -and have a little chuckle along the way.Sorry, this review flowed like mud - like the booze in here.And when in doubt... *%$? :/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler!!! This is a story about desperate situations, and how the 2 character need each other. One facing academic destruction, and the other blindness. One plans to kill himself, and the other will live a shallow life never being able to seek his real potential. Their need for other is based on the strengths the other does not have, which helps both to face their own weaknesses. One realizes he lives a better life then most people, and will adjust and continue on, while the other is helped out of a bad situation. In the end this movie leaves you feeling good, and thankful for the hidden potential we all have inside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Isn't it about time people reassessed this 1992 film and Al Pacino's Oscar winning performance? If they did, I think the academy would ask Al for his Oscar back. He is so way, way over the top as Lt. Col Frank Slade its embarrassing. His performance is just hard to watch as he sucks all the air out of the room.Unfortunately, by giving Pacino an overdue Oscar for this, it only encouraged him to be bigger and broader in his subsequent performances, in my opinion ruining his career. He seems to have lost all touch with subtly and it began right here.Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Chris O'Donnell, at the early part of their careers probably learned a lot by watching Pacino as they co-starred in this--what NOT to do on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Scent of a Woman last night on TV and I've watched this film once before about a decade ago. It's a typical "young man meets older man and he guides him through a coming of age" trial that's in the tradition of Dead Poet's Society, Goodbye Mr. Chips, and Good Will Hunting (although technically Good Will Hunting came after this). It stars Al Pacino as Colonel Slade, the old man who in this version has a pretty nasty exterior to get past, and Chris O'Donnell as the poor prep school student who must look after Pacino's character for a weekend so he can raise enough money to go home for Thanksgiving break.I started out having three main problems with this movie. First of all, Charlie (O'Donnell's character) is pretty asexual. Now, I think you're aloud to be asexual, and I don't think every protagonist in a movie has to be involved with a girl or something, but contrasted with so much talk about sex from the Colonel's character and the fact that Charlie who's in late adolescence when his hormones should be in full bloom, I found it rather curious. I wish he got to at least have danced with that pretty girl, rather than guided Al Pacino to dance with her in the tango scene. Nevertheless, it's still refreshing in the wake of some of the more oversexualized movies of the late 90s like American Pie and Cruel Intentions. My second problem lies in Al Pacino's character arc was from his impossible to get along with stage to his genuine self. I know it's necessary to create a certain progression for him, so he could've been so much more effective in his stubbornly likable personality, but still it was overdone and stretched out. My biggest beef, however, is that the boys who Charlie refuses to squeal on, have absolutely no likable traits whatsoever. They're ugly, uncharismatic, they rub it in how they're richer than him, and they're cowards. The pressure that one guy, George, exerts on him is cruel. It is true that the other headmaster is a jerk too, for picking on him, but I wasn't necessarily sure which was the lesser of two evils. However, these three things were what lingered in my memory about the movie from the last time I saw it 10 years ago, but by the movie's end, I was left exuberated and moved, because those problems are more than cancelled out by what the film has going for it, which is the immeasurable chemistry between Pacino and O'Donnell's characters in this film. O'Donnell plays his part with a wide-eyed innocence and a guarded sense of caution that has the added effect of keeping the movie from being too corny, and Pacino is mesmerizing. The two create magic with every conversation they have. Also, the movie plays out, like a series of short episodes, and some of them like the car driving scene and the tango lesson are a lot of fun. What I also came to appreciate is that the film is a little harder to grasp because it doesn't follow conventional methods of storytelling. True, it would be easier for Charlie's peers to be worth standing up to, but the story never took the easy route.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Until I saw some of the user's negative comments, I thought I was a terrible person, cause I never liked this movie, and it seemed that everyone else did. Every time I mentioned it, people would go into raptures reserved for the culmination of a romantic interlude. (I think I cleaned THAT up, pretty well.) "The tango, how about the tango, they'ed shout at me." "You're nuts. Whaddya mean you didn't like Pacino?"Well, folks, the first time I saw it I pushed "eject" after twenty minutes, and never regretted it. I thought it was an overacted, contrived production that for me didn't work.A friend with secret ties to secret organizations threatened me recently with dire punishments if I failed to see the complete film.I saw the whole overrated complete thing, AND I STILL DON'T LIKE IT.The tango is not a real tango. This would be laughed off the stage in Argentina. However I thought that Pacino and the young lady did it well. I counted the length of the shots in the dance and the camera changed shots every six or seven seconds. This means that they did the dance in very short segments, or they did it complete, and it was edited in short clips. I don't know how it was shot, but if they did it in one take I applaud them.If I heard correctly, Slade's blindness was due to juggling hand grenades. Well don't hand grenades that close tear your head off, or, at the very least, horribly disfigure one. Or maybe Col. Slade "ducked" just in time.The best moments for me, were Bradley Whitford of "The West Wing" telling Slade what a bastard he was at the Thanksgiving dinner and, the then unknown Seymour Phillip Hoffman as the campus wise guy. Hoffman, as befits a great actor, got into the business, to meet a girl in his school drama club. From such mundane things does art rear it's ugly head.A Pacino film that almost no one saw, "Panic In Needle Park", his first starring role, is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drags A Bit ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... Or perhaps I should say drags a big bit The problem I have with SCENT OF A WOMEN is that it resembles a few other feel good movies at the time . Following on from the success of DEAD POETS SOCIETY studio producers only seemed to be interested in making movies that were in danger of giving audiences diabetes , that's when they weren't making movies featuring a cop /a lodger/a babysitter/a flat mate /etc bringing murder and mayhem to an all American couple Despite Al Pacino featuring in every poster and trailer clip SCENT OF A WOMAN revolves around much of its ( Far too long ) running time on the character of Charlie Simms who keeps getting into trouble at his private school and I was so reminded of DEAD POETS SOCIETY that when Charlie takes on a job to look after a blind man I kept expecting Robin Williams to turn up . Fortunately the man who Charlie is to look after Colonel Frank Slade isn't played by Williams but by Al Pacino . When I say " fortunately " I'm not dissing Robin Williams in any way but we get the opportunity to see Pacino cast against type in a blackly comic role . Colonel Slade is something of a pathetic figure and as you expect Pacino plays him with typical intensity and makes the whole movie more enjoyable than it possibly deserves to be , but he only comes to the fore a lengthy way into the movie which as I've stated is too long to be truly successful . Would a Hollywood studio consider an unsolicted script 180 pages long ? Of course not Apart from the overblown running time the other flaw can be summed up by the score by Thomas Newman . As far as film scores go it's very good , but again it resembles work from other movies . The two note piano tune that features on the soundtrack is haunting but it's almost identical to the one that featured in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION where Red leaves prison . But I've already mentioned that SCENT OF A WOMAN reminded me of other movies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Longish, overrated, but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scent of the Woman has a story, but luckily (mainly since it's not the greatest), it sticks to it's dialog and actors. Brief plot summary goes as this: a prep kid needs money so he takes a job looking after a blind old guy who lives in a cottage with his family. If that was it, this movie wouldn't have even gotten off the ground, but then something interesting happens: the old guy is quite the classic (bleep).And this Lieutenant Colonel is played by Al Pacino in the 'bravado' style of his abilities, his abilities being of his instincts, even if it is not at all one of his best performances. Too much of it is over-emphasis, close to being not even a complete person, even in the strongest moments. It's almost as if the Oscar to Pacino was more for his career up till then, not even for this film necessarily. Slade leads the young man (Chris O'Donnel) on a coming of age odyssey in NYC. If you take this part of the film (like taking the entire 90 minutes of Tom Hanks on Cast Away island and sea), you have something quite intriguing at times, but the film also has some un-needed stuff left over from preppie-school message-movie land, and it doesn't work at all. Still, Pacino does what he can, and some supporting actors are good.</fullReview>

I could have envisioned "Robert De Niro" in this role, but I doubt if he could have pull it off as Pacino has done.One can truly appreciate Pacino's acting if one sees "Godfather" and "Scent of a Women" back to back. The story or the plot is simple. This movie goes its length not because of the story or the plot, but its acting and screen presence of Pacino. This movie tries to teach the viewers about life. And it does so in subtle ways; that combined with an outstanding screenplay makes the movie a mind blowing one. A Must Watch!!</fullReview>

Why waste time in emergency rooms and incur costly deductibles and co-payments when Scent Of A Woman is available at the local Blockbuster and provides over two hours of sublime pain that seems to drag on even longer than that. Watching Pacino ham his way through a trite tribute to a wretchedly annoying character is more fun than self-mutilation and far less messy. Only if one perceives this as brilliant self-parody can one not cringe every time Pacino appears on the screen, which thankfully is each and every indescribably revolting scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scent of A Woman, Stinker of A Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Scent of A Woman is a turgid, tedious and wholly predictable piece of formula hack work. Al Pacino gives a masterclass in overacting, while never for a second convincing as a blind man. His accent veers all over the southern United States, and he's in practically every scene in a movie that's easily 45 minutes longer than it should be. Worse, we're meant to believe that he can accurately guess an airline stewardess's name simply from her accent and her perfume. Please.As for Chris O'Donnell, his character Charlie is so nauseatingly anemic, naive and goody- goody that you just want to slap him. Pacino shouts and barks incessantly and interjects 'Hoo-hah!' at the end of O'Donnell's lines throughout. Really, the sheer egotism on display here is staggering: Pacino clearly believes that not only is his obnoxious characterization credible, but that he's also witty, charming and ultimately lovable for his fierce pride, patriotism and independence. The few attempts at humor are toe-curling in their ineptitude. At one point he tells O'Donnell to call room service and order 'a large John Daniels on the rocks'. When O'Donnell says, 'Don't you mean Jack Daniels?' Pacino responds, 'When you've known him as long as me, you call him John... That's a joke.' (Well Al, technically it's not, because a joke is a witty rejoinder that stands some chance of making you laugh.)In fact, Pacino's overbearing, scenery-chewing cartoon character invokes nothing but irritation and revulsion. That he won a Best Actor Oscar for this role demeans every other Oscar winning actor in history. That's how goddamn awful this movie really is. A turd, there's no other word for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the director of "Beverly Hills Cop" and "Midnight Run" comes a slightly more serious film about a young boy who is employed to take care of an invalid war veteran over the thanksgiving weekend.Bo Goldman's screenplay is well crafted, and even though the script borrows "Dead Poet's Society's 'amputated spirit' theme, it fortunately does not focus on this, but rather on the relationship between the two leads. Marty Brest hasn't lost his flair for comedy, and Thomas Newman's score is effective, however the film fails simply because we can't feel compassion for the obnoxious Colonel, rather we end up feeling sorry for young Charlie, who has to put up with him.

		<shortDescription>Very energetic, corny and enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scent of a Woman may well the corniest film ever made. For that reason alone, I should hate it; but I cant because, despite the ever-present layer of cheese; this is just a damn good movie. The film allows it's characters to develop throughout, and through a series of silly and unlikely sequences, we actually see them do that right before our eyes. Scenes that see Al Pacino dance the tango with Gabrielle Anwar, or Pacino visit his long lost brother are priceless and although almost every moment of this film is extremely unlikely and is drenched in corny music; you can forgive it because it's so much fun to watch. We follow a young man named Charlie. Charlie is in trouble at school as he witnessed a prank and, if he doesn't name the perpetrators in public - he'll be expelled. He's also taken a summer job as a babysitter for a blind man, which spirals out of control as this cantankerous old man bungles his babysitter onto a plane and takes him to New York for one final weekend of luxury before ending it all.Al Pacino's character in this film is resoundingly different to any other character I've seen him play in any other film. It must be great for a thespian like Pacino to get a role like this, and he clearly enjoys himself playing it. Maybe even a little bit too much at times, as his constant shouts of 'Hoo-Hah!' would suggest; but the energy and talent that Pacino exudes onto the screen mean that you can forgive even when his mannerisms step over onto the wrong side of annoying. Pacino's co-star is then young Chris O'Donnell, who brilliantly offsets his ham with a restrained and understated performance. He often blends into the background, which isn't normally what you want for a lead; but the way he stands back and lets Pacino do all the work may be the only truly realistic thing in the entire film - as that's clearly how a quiet seventeen year old would react in this situation. The characters are an important element of the film, so it's lucky that director Martin Brest was able to recruit performers of this calibre. Scent of a Woman sometimes loses it's way where reality is concerned, but it's constant stream of entertainment offsets this brilliantly and what we are left with is a highly energetic and enjoyable film that is really hard not to go along with.</fullReview>

Who comes up with this kind of dialogue and who suggested that Pacino portray the character in this ridiculous manner? I expected the kid to interrupt Pacino and blurt out, "Who talks like that?" Remember the Seinfeld episode where Mr. Bookman is the library cop who does a hilarious straight-face parody of a serious Jack Webb of Dragnet? Pacino's character is acted like a smart-ass Lt. Kojak doing a serious impersonation of Mr. Bookman. There were about ten times more "hoo-haw" belches from Pacino that the average viewer should have to endure. And what was the point of this movie?

		<shortDescription>poor movie all around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just a poor movie all across the board, in writing, acting, directing, everything. It starts with a poor plot and poor writing. Don't look for a plot. There isn't one. The best summary would be that a lot of bratty college kids make life miserable for a half way decent one. One of the two leads proclaims about the other (in the finale) "He isn't a snitch!" It's obviously supposed to be some great moment, but it isn't. The moral being not to snitch in any circumstance. In this circumstance, the snitchery would indeed be just unexplainably rotten snitchery, but the proclamation seems to want to justify not telling about any crime. The entire script is concocted as if to make a comraderie, but it doesn't work. And the situation of a blind man driving a car is stupid at best. That leads to the poor acting. Pacino only wants to be a pretty boy (even in "Scarface" he was just a pretty boy). His handling of the proclamation, the blind driving, the other situations where he is always angry, just don't ring true. They don't work. Maybe a great actor could make this work. Maybe Cary Grant, Robert Duvall, Robert de Niro, or others past and present. I doubt it, but they might have made the character at least 10% plausible. Pacino doesn't. He fails miserably. Of course the material is some of the worst. That also shows bad editing and directing. They must have taken the worst cuts from each scene. The characters are mostly stereotypes.</fullReview>
