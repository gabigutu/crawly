		<shortDescription>What movie did those guys watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't understand all the hate this movie gets. Yeah, I get it, it's a reboot of a perfectly good 80s movie that nobody really wanted, but it's a really good one! I expected a mindless Micheal Bayian action movie and what I got was a really smart, interesting and entertaining look at trans-humanism, the freedom of choice, politics and recklessness in corporate leaders.This movie really dives into the question of how a person could live his day to day live with almost all of his body amputated and stuck inside of a machine. So when people complain about the uncomfortable scenes between Murphy and his wife, I can only imagine they mean what happened after his transformation, and that felt exactly the way it was supposed to!So yes, the original is way more graphic and still holds up to this day as a gruesome action flick, but this one is smart and interesting and really is a good movie in it's own right.And by no means is it as bad as people say it is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't compare with the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop from 1987 (which remains iconic) and I usually don't like reboots. But watching the new one I never got rid of the feeling, that the remake is worth it. It is a whole new interpretation, that sets the focus on the topics of our time: robots, drones, the human aspect behind the technology, media critics, war propaganda. I felt, the movie has a mission to enlighten people and I liked that. It became even more obvious how much the RoboCop story exists within the topos of Frankenstein which is the story about the human devilment and the lack of respect of life. That's why Padilha gives Murphy more of a face, a life and feelings.Beside that the pictures, the sound, the music is pretty contemporary. You probably have to make some compromises today to get the millions to get the flick done. It won't become iconic, but it's the right time for the right message in the right movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical of modern Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** I'll start this review by making it clear that the original Robocop is my personal favourite movie and has been since I first saw it 25 years ago. Having felt much trepidation about the direction the remake was going in (PG-13 rating in particular) I went in with fairly low expectations but still something of an open mind as I really wanted this reboot to faithfully kick-start a new, successful Robocop franchise. I was pleasantly surprised by the first hour of the film and how Murphy's quite horrifying physical transformation was depicted (there wasn't much left of him) and the emotional impact upon him. I particularly liked the first few scenes of him coming to grips with his new form and his little meltdown in the Chinese factory in which he was built. Unfortunately the film starts to take a significant nose dive at the point of Robocop's big public unveiling. A stupidly convenient plot device whereby the entire Detroit PD database including 17 years worth of the city's CCTV is uploaded to Murphy merely minutes before he's about to make his big appearance. This causes Robocop to overload requiring a change to Murphy be necessitated resulting in him then becoming more robotic and ultimately making an arrest for murder upon his big unveiling. This was a clumsily handled plot device done for the advancement of the plot but defied logic. Why give him a massive upload at such a crucial time? Others have pointed to a lack of a true antagonist and this is very true. Main criminal Antoine Vallon is utterly woeful compared to Kurtwood Smith's vile Clarence Boddiker and even Micheal Keaton can't hold a candle to Ronny Cox's performance in the original. There is also little chemistry between Alex and Clara Murphy both before and after his transformation. The film is best when it isn't trying to ape and nod towards the original. The use of Basil Poledouris' majestic music in Pedro Bromfman's new score is particularly jarring and poorly orchestrated. When I watched Man of Steel at about the 50 minute mark I realised I hadn't heard John Williams classic Superman theme but also realised that this was a new take on the Superman mythos that didn't need to borrow from it's predecessors. Shame this film didn't follow suit. The effects are generally good but alas the Robocop/ED-209 battle is just a typical modern day CGI fest and has none of the weight of the same scene from the original. The film's biggest issue is undoubtedly caused by the constrictions of the PG-13 rating. Hearing arch criminals talk without any swearing pulls me out if the film and destroys any sense of realism. In one scene as Murphy approaches a drug factory to make a bust images of the classic drug factory shoutout of the original came to mind. Alas this version turns out to be a total anti-climax almost totally devoid of the carnage so required from such a scene. This follows on to Robocop taking down Vallon in a night vision shootout where men are shot but no blood, death or injury are shown in even any mildly satisfying manner. This shows clearly that gritty subject matter is not befitting of a teenage rating and similar target audience. Would something like The Wire work if it was aimed at a teenage audience? No. There aren't any particular standout performances other than Gary Oldman who almost always delivers no matter the role or movie. Kinnaman is somewhat wooden in places but gives a decent enough performance even though at times he looks uncomfortable with the role. One aspect of the film that did nothing for me was Samuel L Jackson's character who opens and closes the film and offers his very one sided views throughout. If this is their replacement of the satire of the original they can keep it. It's ham fisted and provides little more than uninteresting commentary on the power of the media and plot exposition. It tells us nothing interesting that we don't already know and Jackson does his shouty thing to excess, especially at the cringe-worthy end. I wholly embrace the need to make this reboot from a fresh angle to that of Verhoven's original but Sony MGM have played it way too safe with something that would clearly play better if it were aimed at an adult audience. I genuinely believe that an R rated movie, devoid of such tight restrictions would have been a far more satisfying experience. The original Robocop franchise died when they aimed at a younger demographic. Hollywood greed I fear has caused a repeat of this mistake. It's not a bad film per se, it's just painfully average and therefore unable to get out from the vast shadow of its forebear and like the Total Recall remake, it tries too hard too often to remind you of the original whilst offering nothing new to compete with it. I doubt there's even a harder cut tucked away for home release and even if there was there are plot issues that damage the film as much as the tame approach. Other gripes include a lack of clarity as to Omnicorp's role (if any) in Murphy being blown up, and plot threads not being followed through to any satisfying conclusion such as Murphy's relationship with his family. The best bits revolve around Murphy's initial awakening as a cyborg which are very well done indeed. Alas there's not really that much else that's in any way as memorable as the 1987 classic it's based on. As an example of how modern Hollywood has become all about excessive studio control above creativity and maximising ticket sales at the expense of a film's overall artistic quality then this film succeeds. In all other aspects it's a bit of a wasted opportunity really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so very few people were confident about this remake. The original has such a huge fan base that a reboot seems like blasphemy to most.So how does this hold up? Well, it looks like butter, it at times tastes like butter, but brother, it ain't butter. Believe it.The film lacks something and I think I know what it is; there is no real villain. Instead of building up a super-villain for Murphy to fight to the death with, it toys with different characters as his foe, never really committing to one or the other. Kurtwood Smith is an evil son of a gun in the original because he shoots Murphy to pieces. Its up close and personal. In this, well, the guy that car bombs (lame) our robotic cop gets about 2 minutes of screen time with very little back story. Frankly, you just don't care.The plot seems more concerned about Murphy trying to cope with becoming an amputee and him and his family learning to accept his new circumstances, which frankly, when you see what he looks like without the armour, is just disturbing. Instead of being an awesome action flick, you just feel bad for the guy. The reality of the situation is just too harsh in its portrayal and you end up thinking maybe he would be better off dead. Do you want to pay good money to question your ideological values towards quality of life or do you want to see robocop go toe to toe with a man who shot him to s***? I know what I'd buy for a dollar. Also, on a side note: Samuel L. Jackson needs to stop being in films. While his appearance at first is welcome, by the end it feels very cheap and unnatural. The anti-American war effort message starts to get a little forced down your throat and before you start screaming that I'm a flag loving American, I'm a Brit, and even I felt the satire was a bit in your face.The film shouldn't upset people too badly, it could honestly be much worse and it does have some passable moments with a couple of good nods to the original. Just don't get your hopes too high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very decent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 7, it really means a 7.5/10. Not sure what's with the negative reviews, but I enjoyed the movie very much. It's well-executed and the direction was clear and crisp. There's no distinct feel-good actions scenes because the pacing is kept constant throughout and I don't see why there's an issue with the pacing being that way. It's hardly flat, it's just a very honest, straight- flushed story-telling, and it fits the themes that are underscored by the movie. Alex Murphy is a reluctant hero and he's ultimately a father and a husband whose personal agenda serves as his existential core. I like how these themes are teased out and zoomed in upon throughout the movie. Also, there are some absolutely delicious production details and CGIs that are just absolutely feasts to the eye. Not to mention the superb cast and the wonderful performances. I think this is a honest and loyal reboot that will appeal to fans of Robocop who fell in love with the story precisely for the moralistic themes it explores.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent and satisfying remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new RoboCop is a surprisingly good and entertaining sci-fi action thriller that appeals to the human heart by conveying emotions and the humanity side of Murphy, the main character who eventually becomes the titled cyborg law enforcer. The film ultimately wins for not trying to be the original (1987 version). The story of Murphy is similar (since it's a remake) but does its own thing to provide something new instead of retelling the same thing again. The film focuses more on the development of Murphy's character, his initial response to his cyborg body and relationship with his family, making the character more emotional and relatable to the audience. The film delves into the meaning of humanity, family themes, media influence on public opinion, corporate greed (capitalism), authoritarianism and corrupt law enforcement authorities. It provides a brief view of the struggles we might face with machines or digital surveillance of the future. It also briefly raises the question whether it's ethical or legal to eliminate the human factor in law enforcement to reduce crime rates by creating merciless cyborgs or robots to replace humans. The action sequences are updated with a higher body count, with better CGI and sound effects, making them cooler, stylish and more entertaining than the original. The new black tactical design of Robocop is found to be acceptable and nice...the updated Robocop is more agile, flexible and stronger compared to the original. However, I personally find the right human hand to be slightly distracting. (I prefer no human hand at all, entirely machine except the face) There's quite a lot of credible actors in this film: Abbie Cornish, Jay Baruchel, James Earle Haley, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson all providing decent performances to this remake. Although it's hardly a ground-breaking film or a masterpiece, Robocop is a decent and satisfying remake that delivers on many levels. There's currently no plot problems, inconsistencies or plot holes found in this film at this time of writing this review. So, it's good enough for a recommendation to watch it. Rating: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comparing with Paul Verhoeven's 1987 original version is unfair, but the new ROBOCOP here manages to stand on its own as a reasonably engaging effort.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2010, acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky (THE WRESTLER, BLACK SWAN) was originally attached to direct the ROBOCOP reboot. Frankly, I thought he was the right choice to reboot the once-popular franchise back in the late '80s. Unfortunately, he quits the project and Brazilian director Jose Padilha (ELITE SQUAD, ELITE SQUAD: THE ENEMY WITHIN) was brought in as his replacement. WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT? When police detective Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is critically injured during a car explosion in front of his home, CEO of OmniCorp Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) sees him as a golden opportunity to make him feel alive again by turning him into "Robocop" -- a cyborg police officer which is touted as the future of law enforcement in America. However, OmniCorp doesn't realize that Murphy still has a personal vengeance in his mind to pursue the criminals who nearly caused him dead. THE GOOD STUFF Like the first two ELITE SQUAD movies, director Jose Padilha delivers the same raw intensity that gives ROBOCOP a quasi-documentary feel to the action sequences. Even though Padilha utilizes shaky camera-work, at least he doesn't make the scene so wobbly until the viewers unable to see what's really going on. The special effects are spectacular, while the costume design for the all-new Robocop in a black tactical body actually looks quite nifty. Swedish-American actor Joel Kinnaman (best known in the US for TV's The Killing) delivers an emotionally engaging performance as Alex Murphy and Robocop, while Michael Keaton steals most of the spotlight as the slimy CEO of OmniCorp Raymond Sellars and Gary Oldman gives a perfectly restrained performance as the sympathetic Dr. Dennett Norton. Other minor roles -- including Abbie Cornish as Murphy's wife, Clara; Jackie Earle Haley as the military tactician Mattox; and Samuel L. Jackson as the media host Pat Novak -- are all equally impressive. MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S) The brief but intense battle between Robocop and a small army of ED-209 during the climactic finale. THE BAD STUFF The biggest weakness in this ROBOCOP reboot is Joshua Zetumer's captivating but bloated screenplay. First of all, the story drags too much with Murphy's personal family matter with his estranged wife Clara (Abbie Cornish) and son David (John Paul Ruttan). Then there's the underwritten plot involving Murphy's personal vengeance against Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow), who is responsible for the car explosion. Even the so-called social commentary involving the "robo-phobic" issue quoted by Samuel L. Jackson's Pat Novak doesn't really say much that worth a debate. FINAL WORDS While the new ROBOCOP is far from a genre classic by any means, at least Jose Padilha's version isn't as bad as most people might have expected. Just put your mindset of the Paul Verhoeven's original 1987 version aside, and treat this as an entirely new movie altogether.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intellectual, emotion-packed, spectacularly acted Sci Fi is sabotaged by Fanboys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Full disclosure: the original Robocop is among my top 5 favorite films of all time, and I've easily watched it over 200 times. With that being said, I still looked forward to this re-interpretation due to my love of the character (whose legacy had already been profoundly tarnished by the redundant first sequel and catastrophically misguided second sequel) and my admiration of director Jose Padilha's "Elite Squad" films (as well as his documentaries). Suffice to say, I came into the theater with a bias toward wanting the film to succeed.I'm willing to acknowledge that it may be for this reason that I found this film to be a resounding (if slightly flawed) success. Conversely, it is my belief that a large contingent of overzealous "fans" were hellbent on seeing this film fail, therefore had pre-determined that the movie was trash. How could it possibly withstand several years of unwavering hatred during its production and be given a fair shot? Judging by the middling 6.7 IMDb rating and the 50% Rotten Tomatoes score, many people loathed the film just as much as they'd hoped they would.This viewer simply cannot accept that Robocop 2014 is anywhere near as bad as people are rating it. For starters, the film has been bashed mercilessly for idiotically trivial elements such as "His hand is human!", "His suit is black!", or worst of all, "I refuse to support a PG-13 version of Robocop". It is my firm belief that all of these criticisms are merely the ravings of closed-minded fanboys who are (bizarrely) searching for the next movie to "ruin their childhood". It's a phenomenon that is baffling and absurd. Anyway, I rated the film 10/10 on IMDb because I wanted the score to weigh heavier in the positive direction. Truth be told, I think the film is a solid 8 and may even grow to become a 9 over time. Of course it's not as good as Verhoeven's classic, and obviously it's much different in tone. For that I am grateful -- part 2 tried so desperately to ape the original that it felt like a rather soulless carbon copy (albeit a copy salvaged somewhat by spectacular stop-motion effects and a great villain in Tom Noonan's "Cain"). I didn't want another movie trying to mimic the satire of the original, nor did I feel that anyone could ever one-up the hyper-violence of the 1987 version, so why try?There are those that argue that this film should have simply been called something else other than Robocop if it wanted to be so different, and I get that...except the bottom line is few studios will ever greenlight a $120 million dollar film without some kind of name recognition. It's a sad truth. But in utilizing the Robocop brand name, Padilha was given the funding to acquire a brilliant cast and design cutting edge digital effects. In my opinion, a little brand recognition is a fair trade off if it helps the film achieve the look and feel of a high-end sci-fi blockbuster.Anyway, I've already babbled several paragraphs longer than I'd intended. The bottom line is you should abandon your preconceptions and watch the movie for what it is: a genuinely smart, heartfelt and wonderfully acted sci-fi featuring characters we know and love. What's so awful about that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Exposition, Meandering and Bland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Hollywood at a loss to make original movies, it was inevitable that the Robocop franchise would eventually get the reboot. In 1987, the original Robocop became an instant box office hit with its mixture of witty satire and over the top violence as well as top notch acting by Peter Weller, Kurtwood Smith and Ronny Cox; the deciding factor in what made that movie so fresh at the time was the addition of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven who seemed to understand what the audience at the time needed: a high tech cyborg (artfully designed by special effects whiz Rob Bottin and its robotic suit would become a cinema icon) who fought crime in a near future world overwhelmed by greed, hypocrisy, corruption and excessive, almost cartoonish violence.In this reboot, the studios were able to acquire the services of Brazilian director Jose Padiha (who directed Elite Squad and its sequel, two intense police thrillers set in his native Brazil) but unfortunately they forgot to give him a good script to work with (there were rumors during production that Padiha had a lot of ideas that were nixed by studio bosses. Figures.). The other reason why the original movie also worked was because its R rating worked in its favor: the enormous amount of bloodletting added to its satirical view of the future as well as that of American culture which really spoke to the audience. With this reboot aimed at more family friendly crowds, the PG-rated violence is filmed using rapid jump cuts which makes it totally confusing, its like watching a video game on fast forward so that by the time your mind registers what's going on the scene is finished.The movie itself also suffers from pacing problems- just when the narrative is about to steamroll forward, the scenes abruptly change so that any emotional momentum is lost because there just isn't much characterization of the main parts; everything that should have an emotional impact is glossed over by a jump to a new scene with way too much focus on explanations of what the characters are doing so that the audience fails to gain sympathy for anybody.I can't really judge Joel Kinnaman's acting in the title role since there really isn't much for him to do other than walk around in the Robocop suit and utter a few words every now and then- he seems to spend too much time bug eyed and in shock more than anything else. The supporting cast also seems wasted, with Michael Keaton and Jackie Earle Haley's screen time largely limited to trying to explain whats going on rather than actually doing anything. Even Michael K Williams seems lost as Robocop's sidekick. Patrick Garrow as the heavy is pretty much a cardboard villain compared to the 1987 version with the menacing Kurtwood Smith and his gang of killer psychos. Gary Oldman's performance is pretty much average since he's also got nothing much to do.Alas, the biggest disappointment is the movie's absence of any sort of humor: the 1987 film had boatloads of wacky commercials that interrupted the narrative yet provided a great view on how that future world was set up as well as crazy, sadistic villains and a pun on the name of the chief baddie (Dick Jones- best name ever). Instead, we get snippets of a news media show run by Samuel L Jackson whose presence in this movie is also wasted since he spends more time recapping what we already saw and his jokes fall flat.The only good scene happens right at the beginning with a battle between Iranian insurgents and the robot army but soon after the movie quickly loses momentum and never regains it. Better to skip this one and wait for the rental, or better yet, watch the 1987 version- its way better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, this movie probably isn't a 1 out of 10, but when you remake a movie as memorable as the original Robocop, you'd better do something interesting. They didn't.No, I didn't watch the original first, I watched it afterwards and that is the problem. You watch Robocop 2014 and think "Meh, pretty entertaining" and then you watch the original and get taken on a roller coaster ride.I'm not going to re-hash the original movie here, it would be a waste of effort. Just do yourself a favour and don't waste your time on Robo 2014, search out the original Robocop. You won't be disappointed. The flick isn't nearly as dated as you would expect aside from the clothes and the vehicles. The humour is dark, dirty and noir at its best. Detroit looks nasty - the way anyone who has never been to 2014 Detroit would expect it to look. The criminals are drugged out wackos - the type of criminals you expect to see in 2014. The cops are cannon fodder - unlike the cops of 2014, who are far more trigger happy and eager to save their own skins. Clearly Paul Verhoeven didn't understand the magnitude of the police state that America would become - google the number of American's in prison if you doubt me.Really simple here, folks - watch Robocop 1987, not this generic crap.Hollywood, you would have made more money re-releasing the original.</fullReview>

What was great about the original just like Terminator is that it was grimy, dark and although robot cops offcourse aren't that realistic they we're not beyond belief.This pushes everything, RoboCop has to weigh at least a couple of hundred kilo's but it runs like Usain Bolt. The way it jumps could easily make him a star NBA player. If you are a fan and actually wanted to believe this could be real, this alone ruins it completely.Then there are the "let's-make-him-modern-and-cool" errors. Why paint him black, he's not Batman. Why does his visor light up red, he's not Cyclops and he has thermal vision so, he doesn't need a light. Why does he have to recharge at least 10 times during the movie, did Apple make him?The Human Hand Pffff, Why GOD why? Taser The original Robocop had part off his awesomeness because of the automatic Desert Eagle. Everyone wanted that gun. This one has a taser. A taser,... really?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so the trailers for this movie had made me very badly predisposed towards it, being a really big fan of the originals (yes, Robocop 2 and 3 included). But I won an invitation for the first screening in my country so I thought why not.Well, it is much better than I expected and than what the trailers show. I won't go into spoilers, but my biggest issue with the trailer was the fact that Murphy knows from the beginning what they did to him, no memory erase and all. Well, I have to say that they are actually handling this very well in the film and it's not that simple. It actually sets the tone for the impressive second half of the movie.During the first half of the movie I was like "OK, it's a nice film but not near what the first film accomplished". Well, it's like they heard me, because the second half feels pretty much like the old ones!The script uses actually some of the best concepts of the first two films. Joel Kinnaman does a pretty good job as both Alex Murphy and Robocop. He doesn't manage to steal the impression that Peter Weller made of course, but he truly does a good job. I hope we see more of him in the future. All in all, to all those who, like me, had low expectations from this film: give it a chance. It's much better than what the abysmal trailers let you think. By the way, what is it with awful trailers to good films lately? First Pacific Rim and now this...Oh, and there are sequel hooks for a movie that will be even closer to the originals. Here's hoping...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not only a failure as a remake, but fails on its own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would've been fine that RedoCop abandoned the themes of RoboCop, but it didn't even get its own themes right.First, there's Sam Jackson's O'Reilly-esque character who constantly defends the use of robots overseas. The real problem with American media is that it tries to avoid controversial subjects like drone strikes altogether.Secondly, there's the robots' use against foreign civilians. Rather than show Americans the real consequences of drones, like innocent and unarmed women and children being shredded and mutilated, the robots shoot suicide bombers, and even the boy we're supposed to feel sympathy for is trying to attack them with a knife.Third, the stand-ins for drones are actual robots. The most heinous thing about drones is that the trigger is pulled by real humans, and the targets are decided by our leaders with often little information about what they're attacking.Fourth, there's the dehumanization of Murphy. He isn't a dead man brought back as an inhuman monster like the original; he's a burn victim benefiting from already-existing cybernetic prosthetics who transforms with a whirl of the camera and some Sinatra. There's no "lose the arm" moment here. Even as we find out that Murphy has been sapped of his free will, Murphy is mowing down CGI robots to rock music like a superhero. There's no real moment when Murphy turns into RoboCop. He's normal at the beginning and just kind of fades into RoboCop mode inexplicably, then fades out again just as inexplicably later on.Fifth, the drones are supposed to come home, but they don't. RoboCop only attacks two criminals before going on the revenge spree we want him to. Detroit is hardly oppressed by his presence.Finally, Omnicorp builds RoboCop to get around the law that prevents robots from being used on American soil, and spend a lot of money doing so, yet they continue to focus on getting the law repealed. Not only that, but they actually sway public opinion and get the law repealed in spite of the fact that they promoted RoboCop as a human operator and not a robot. Omnicorp furthermore seems preoccupied with making RoboCop popular with the public and as efficient as a robot, but why? Their target market for RoboCop is governmental. It's like Dick Jones said: "Renovation program! Spare parts for 25 years! Who cares if it worked or not?"RedoCop gets much worse when compared to the original film. The original RoboCop looks like a gleaming weapon, but the new one looks like he's wearing a black rubber suit. The Omnicorp of the original is an imposing megacorporation filled with nothing but cut-throat suits, whereas the face of the new Omnicorp is the avuncular and likable Gary Oldman, and leader Michael Keaton, who doesn't wear a suit at all. The dark humor is completely gone from this remake, and there isn't a single memorable line. There's almost no profanity or blood for this thoroughly PG-13 remake, either, and RoboCop doesn't start patrolling the streets until an hour in.There are only two good things about this movie. It tries to establish a relationship between Murphy and his wife (and fails, giving us only two scenes of generic wife-love before he's RoboCopped, and one after, before she spends the rest of the film whining and crying). The other is a scene where we see what's left of Murphy with his robot body removed. He's a head, lungs, and without reason, a dangling hand. Yes, a hand and no arm or shoulder. It's the best scene of the movie, but like every scene, just shows how poorly thought out RedoCop is.Overall, RedoCop is a boring and idiotic CGI explodefest meant for children. Take that $13 of ticket money and spend it on the unrated director's cut of the original instead. You'll get far more enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alex Murphy, damaged in an explosion to the point of death, is the ideal candidate for a new initiative to join human sensibilities to computerised and robotic peace-keeping hardware. But Murphy has his own mind, which leads to conflict with those responsible for the attempt on his life (plus others), which may stretch beyond the criminal fraternity.The 2014 remake of Paul Verhoeven's classic 1987 sci-fi satire includes most of the story beats from the original, but has quite a different heart. This makes it into a different film, and one which I enjoyed as much as the original.Despite being full of action, it is a much gentler film. The violence is not as sadistic, there is no profanity (imagine that!), the relationship between Alex and his family is much more important, and Gary Oldman's conflicted Dr Frankenstein - sorry, Dr Norton - is a fine character: he is the actual heart of the movie.If you loved the 1987 version with a passion then you may hate this. If you merely liked it, you may like this version too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your time with this movie! Watch the original RoboCops!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched the original RoboCop movies. This remake does not come close to any of them! Many reviewers here comment to not compare it with the original RoboCop movies. What kind of nonsense it that!!! This is not a new and original story. It is a REMAKE!!!! Would you not compare the next Titanic movie or the next Batman, Superman movies with the previous versions?!!! Of course you will. You can't just copy something and say it is not the same as original!! If it is supposed to be similar to the original at least they could make this a better movie. But they did not. The whole movie was just about how RoboCop becomes RoboCop and gets his revenge. So much for the storyline. That was just the first 5 minutes of the original RoboCop. Bad acting, bad special effect. What a waste! A disgrace for RoboCop. It is a shame to make a mockery of a classic movie!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what happens when you remake a classic but can't decide if you want to go for a fresh take of the story or if you want to imitate the original. In this case, the director/writer decided that it'd tell original story as well as copying some aspect of the original. Well, it doesn't work.At the start, the film has an interesting original twist: Abbie Cornish's character, Clara Murphy, is revealed to be the main love interest for Joel Kinnaman's character, Alex Murphy. Unfortunately, instead of exploring this new take of the story, the writers decided to also include the robo character to create some kind of love triangle.This is pointless because unlike Peter Weller in the original, the actor who plays RoboCop in this film is completely devoid of any charisma. On top of this, he's also a VERY AWFUL actor. As a result, the audience's sympathy immediately defaults back to Peter Weller's original 80s character, which ultimately is pretty cool.And here's the problem: Robocop's character doesn't get shown that often until the later half of the story. Instead, the story decides to retell the whole encounter of Kinnaman and his bride from the original film. So you are now forced to watch some cringe-worthy scenes of the chemistry-less couple until the end reveals the real pairing of the story.One would also think that since the original is pretty outdated in terms of FX, this one will at least have some good one. Unfortunately that's not the case either. Sure, it's slightly better but it's nothing extraordinary. In fact, most scenes look bland and lack the biting social satire/gut-wrenching action of the original.In summary: disappointing remake of a classic. The only redeeming factor is the introduction of the new character played by Marianne Jean-Baptiste. But since she's not even featured that often in the story, the whole point of a retelling ended up being moot. For audience who are tired of zombies and romances between vampires and werewolves, RoboCop is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start, I'm a Robo fan since I was 3. Have seen the 1987 movie like 30+ times. Have lots of merchandise and even a tattoo. Stop reading reviews, go to a cinema and watch it. If you can get there alone better, girlfriends don't like this movies in valentines weekend, and old Peter Weller fans will talk dirt about it even without watching it.The movie is Perfect. Different than the original but it is not better and it is not worse. I'm not a Marvel super heroes fan but the Avengers movie/IronMan3 are the top 10/10 in the scale to compare with Robocop. And Robo gets a 9/10. Forget it is a remake. Forget it is a PG13. Forget the human hand. Forget it is not Peter Weller. Watch it and you will rate it 8+/10 for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear fellow movie buffs and Robocop fans! Let's make something clear at the beginning: I'm a huge RoboCop fan, absolutely LOVE the original movie and I advice anybody who feel otherwise stop reading this review further because it is gonna be about something you do not care about: the new RoboCop movie! I watched the RoboCop remake Saturday evening with my other half and as usual I came here to IMDb to check on the reviews and what other people thought of it. I do not write a lot of reviews but this time I absolutely felt the need to write one, as I was shocked to see how people bashing this movie into the ground. Of course it is the usual drill: comparing it to the original, what the new one missed out, the new robo design... etc. I just do not understand most of these people. When I heard that there is gonna be a RoboCop remake I was very happy to hear the news. And it is NOT because I dislike the original! It is because there were no RoboCop movies made for over than 2 decades and I love the material. I wanted the story to continue or something. And we finally got to what I wanted to say! This RoboCop movie is by NO mean bad! When I went to the cinema both me and my girlfriend - who also a fan of the original - were ready to be disappointed and we absolutely loved the movie. This is a different "new age" story of the now famous character. When I saw some of the reviews I just cannot believe that those people watched the same movie! Either that or I have low standards... which I don't think so.People I'm not saying that this remake was not created because the studios wanted to make some quick bucks! Most probably it was! What I'm saying is that they did care about the material, and they took the time to create a new and exciting vision. I go even that far that the message of the movie is different slightly from the original, and that is absolutely fine! The acting is amazing, it was great to see Michael Keaton on the big screen again, he is a very underrated and extremely talented actor in my opinion. Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson, and I gotta say Joel Kinnaman was an awesome and very emotional Alex Murphy! The new RoboCop designs were something scared me off a bit at first too when I saw the first on set shots, but do they look awesome in the movie! The action was great and the special efx of course are something have to work in a movie this caliber so no surprises there: fantastic job! There is one thing though other reviewers also mentioned is a little bit dissatisfying: there is no real enemy. But then again, this is a different story. This one is more about a guy who's being thrown around in this crazy futuristic world where he tries everything to maintain his humanity, even though they constantly shut him down, or overload his brain with information. He is us! And finally let me say that much: yes the original is a classic, and it is indeed different, but this new one is not only enjoyable but has the promise of starting the franchise over again with a first class cast, emotional story, and great effects so sit back and enjoy the ride! This is by no means resembles the hollow empty, unoriginal, and completely pointless Totall Recall remake! So just give it a brake and let's hope that there is gonna be a second part!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An annoyingly dull remake which I'd hoped would be much better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the original Robocop but I try to approach films like this with an open mind and I ask both "does it work as a movie on its own merits?" as well as "does it work as a remake". And the reason I'm saying "remake" and not "reboot" is because that's what this film is. It follows the same set up and plot from the original but with a few tweaks whether SONY want to admit that or not. I was really hoping this film would surprise me because I'd started hearing pretty favourable reviews for it so I went into it not really knowing what to expect. I went into this thinking if it's good, rock on, if it's bad, I'll at least get some fun out of it because how can a film about a cyborg super-cop not be fun? But I was personally shocked how dull this was in its execution.Forgetting about comparisons, as an innocent harmless little science fiction action movie on its own, it's really boring. In an attempt to justify remaking the classic, change is made for changes sake which means we've got a really awkwardly put together script and this completely lets the movie down. The most glaring problem is Alex Murphy AKA Robocop. Joel Kinneman, who I'm sure is a good actor, brings no personality, enthusiasm or authority to the character. There's no effort put into his physical performance and he just looks uncomfortable in the role. But the real problem is that the script gives him nothing to work with. Robocop's whole "regaining his humanity" character arc from the original is so sloppily and horribly done here. At one point he's ordinary Alex Murphy in the suit, then he's a robot when in combat and a human every other time, and then they f*ck with his mind so much that he becomes the Robocop that we know from the original - PROBLEM IS they've spent so long wasting time not being able to decide what they want this guy to be that by the time he's finally normal Robocop, we're over half way through the film so he only remains this way for about 10 minutes. Then after one stop at his house, he's back to being human. I was STUNNED how awfully this was done. This film seems so distracted with its own meaning and subtext that instead of trusting the audience to catch on and figure it all out themselves, while giving us a thrilling story with fun characters, it spends its whole run time having Robocop's brain and system being messed around by scientists, while he just stands in a lab not being in control of the situation and every other character around him just explains to the audience what's happening and the philosophical implications of everything they're doing to him. It's SO boring.And instead of exploring these ideas, the film just kinda goes "Oh hey Corporations are bad aren't they? Oh hey they're messing around with his mind that's kinda unethical isn't it?".And the film doesn't even come to a conclusion on what it all means or what Alex Murphy gains from this experience, if anything. After having his brain messed around by a bunch of people, he kind of just snaps back into humanity, kills the bad guy and that's kind of it, the end.In this film Murphy becomes Robocop in a different way and you don't need violence to tell this version of the story so the loss of the R- rating doesn't exactly hurt the film per-say, but the lack of a clear villain really does. Instead of giving us charismatic, memorable bad guys, the film just kind of points fingers at people that MIGHT be bad like the employees of Omnicorp, one guy that seems like a Clarence Boddiker type character but we find out nothing about him and a few thugs that Robocop takes out like it's nothing so I guess they're not important.It's also unclear as to whether Omnicorp are behind Murphy's accident or if it was just some random thug in the street that felt like bombing a car. I'll give credit to the filmmakers for at least ATTEMPTING to recreate the social satire from the original where this time they're going for a more Fox News type of thing, but where in the original they have a sense of humour with it and trust you to catch onto the propaganda yourself, this one just has Samuel L. Jackson yelling at the camera being so obvious and humourless that it misses the entire point of it.The family focus really should have been where the reboot got its feet off the ground, to actually say "this one explores something different from the original, and it's done well" but nothing interesting is done with it.This film is just so unfocused. Without any clear idea of character arcs, story, or themes, and horrible pacing, it doesn't so much play out as it does feel like a list of things that just keep on happening. It lacks those natural story beats that carry an audience through a film. "Robocop" could have excelled as an actual reboot where the concept was taken in a different direction, where someone creative saw an opportunity to tell a fresh story and took it. But as it stands, as a movie on its own it's awkwardly boring and dumb and as remake it pales in comparison to the original. And Considering this is the more serious and humourless version of the original, that's just boring in and of itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How the heck did this film get past funding? Seriously even the spin off TV show from 1994 was better, the animated series had more graphic violence and more in common with the original than this joke.It is only because of the original movie that i am putting the effort in to write this reviewEvery single scene from the original was far superior in every single way to this garbage, everything from the dark humour to the cinematic impact on the viewer is completely absent from this vacuous new offering, acting was limp, a real antagonist was non existent, no Clarence Boddicker, no Dick Jones (2 of the finest yuppy villains to grace our screens in the 80's), no cool bad guy gang, no class or style except from Gary Oldman who was sadly not enough to make this movie anymore enjoyable or worth more than 1 rating, i'd give zero if it was an option.When i first heard they were remaking Robocop i knew they could not ever match the original but i thought it would at least have more credibility than the animated series.The core of the problem is the cgi, it just leaves you devoid of any emotion toward the action, ED-209 is a zero impact character in this movie, as you know in the original ED-209 was legendary and cemented itself into your mind even as it got blown to bits from the Cobra Assault Cannon (state of the art bang bang) with nothing but a pair of legs left and gyroscope element twitching like a dead nerve impulse in a once living creature, original Ed-209 was a beast, new ed-209 didn't even raise a single goosebump, alive or dead. Same goes for every aspect of Robocop himself, by the end i was willing the real Robo to make an appearance spin out his gun and blow this sh!te away off my screen, deliver a classic one liner and walk off, "Thank you for your cooperation, good night"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failed attempt at re-making a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ROBOCOP (2014) is the latest in a LONG list of remakes/reboots that have come in droves in the 21st century. For the most part, modern remakes just simply do not work, and this film is no exception. The first strike against them is the seeming requirement that they have to be PG-13, when the original was most probably R in the 80s, and I can even remember a few PG-13 movies back in the day that pushed the envelope more so than anything now! The original 1987 version of Robocop was a lightning-in-a-bottle classic, a perfect amalgamation of action, sci-fi, horror, satire, and drama. Sometimes, a film works simply because it doesn't TRY to be anything more than entertaining and everything else just comes together. I think that the problem with this 2014 version is that it TRIED to be different to the point that it focused so much on what it was trying to be, that it forgot that movies are meant at their core to simply entertain.In watching this film in the movie theatre, I could not help but be reminded of the relatively recent "The Dark Knight", a monumentally overrated "comic-book" film from 2008 that has unfortunately changed the way that superhero movies are being presented. First there was "Man of Steel from last year, which had way too much pontification, meandering, and dizzying action to be entertaining. Now, with this film, there is a similar tone of characters talking way too much about man-versus-machine, the price of sacrifice, and, similar to TDK, minimal yet confusing action sequences. In this version, the dialog spells everything out to the viewer and it feels like characters are talking directly through the movie screen. In the original, the character actions spoke for themselves and everything felt organic. By the end of the original, I felt uplifted. By the end of this, I felt confused.This re-boot tells a much different tale of Detroit cop Alex Murphy (essayed by a very-underused Joel Kinnaman from AMC's "The Killing"). In this film, Murphy is an undercover detective and is fully entrenched within his department (in the original, he was a uniformed-street cop who had just been transferred). Murphy's partner had just been shot in an arms deal gone wrong and he suspects a couple of his fellow officers of being dirty cops working for the city's biggest arms dealer Antoine Vallon (a literal useless character played by Patrick Garrow).The Murphy-Vallon rivalry is virtually non-existent in this film and acts as a red herring. Turns out the film is not really about revenge, so much as Murphy's subsequent adjustment to living as a machine after one of Vallon's goons sabotages Murphy's car with a bomb, thereby almost killing him and turning him into a vegetable. In steps Omnicorp, run by billionaire Raymond Sellars (brilliantly played by Michael Keaton in the film's standout performance), who repair Murphy by making his body over 90% robotics, only leaving vital organs and his right hand in tact. So in this version, Murphy never really dies. He is actually still "human". I know that this is supposed to be science "fiction", but even this plot point goes way too far over my head! When I saw how Murphy really looked without the suit, I just couldn't wrap my head around how this was even possible.The main scientist tasked with re-building Murphy is Dr. Dennett Norton (played earnestly by a very over-used Gary Oldman). In fact, Oldman actually has the largest role in this film, not Kinnaman, who's barely in it. And I couldn't really buy Oldman as a scientist. It seemed like he was channeling his Commissioner Gordon character too much from TDK.A decent subplot involves how Murphy's wife Clara (well-played by Abbie Cornish) and son David (nicely played by John Paul Ruttan) react to Alex's fate. This is in contrast to the original film where Murphy's family was only ever seen in flashbacks and as far as they knew, he was dead. What worked about this in the original is it added to the tragedy of Murphy's fate. But at least in this one, the family scenes felt like a relief from all the boring corporate and political shenanigans. Most of this movie was like watching a Sunday morning politico show! In particular, Samuel L. Jackson has an odd and thankless role as a conservative talking point host of a national network news show. These scenes were a replacement for the satirical commercials that appeared in the original. But in the original, those commercials were deftly entertaining and funny. In this one, this faux news show is a boring chore to sit through! Jackie Earle Haley also has an annoying role as a military strategist who derides and trashes Murphy-Robocop every chance he gets. I also found the actors playing the respective assistants to Sellars and Denton to be bland and annoying, especially the nasal Jay Baruchel as Omnicorp's top marketing person.Of course, the film throws in obligatory famous quotes from the original, but in a very uninspiring and cheesy way. Every time I would hear this dialog, it just made me cringe because it was so cheesy and didn't even belong in this movie, which is too different from the original for that to work. And, as mentioned above, there is actually very little action, and what there is, it's confusing, unrealistic, and cartoony, as most modern CGI-laden films tend to be. The movie itself doesn't seem to know what it really wants to be. In trying to be something different, it fails at being anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailers &amp; teasers DO NOT do RoboCop 2014 any justice! I grew up with the original RoboCop films and I went into the remake thinking that it would be lousy like previous remakes (Total Recall, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Conan the Barbarian, The Karate Kid, &amp; etc.). But for a PG- 13 movie the new RoboCop is packed with a lot of action!! The shoot-outs are intense. The drama and story were also very well done. YOU the viewer will actually CARE about Murphy and his family. You will want to see the villains get what they deserve. The Special Effects/CGI were AMAZING!! Fantastic job well done. I was not feeling the black suit, but RoboCop does wear the classic armor/ suit in the beginning and at the very end. There's a few references to the 1987 RoboCop film. For example: the ED- 209 robot machines, when Jackie Earle Haley said "I wouldn't buy that for a dollar", the classic RoboCop armor suit, "Dead or Alive - You're Coming With Me", "Thank You For Your Cooperation" &amp; etc. The movie does have its differences and tries to stand on its own.I would recommend RoboCop 2014 to new fans and fans of the original 1987 RoboCop. The ACTION scenes are HARD HITTING and FAST PACED. The bullets fly then RoboCop's targets die!!! Can't Stop RoboCop!!!! The only thing that I did not like was RoboCop riding on a motorcycle instead of in his traditional Police Car. RoboCop on the motorcycle made me think of Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Other than that small blemish, I'd give RoboCop 2014 an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: this film does NOT contain scenes of graphic violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, they've gone and remade another classic. Whether you loved or hated the original Robocop movie in the eighties (and, let's face it... most of us loved it!), you'll find it difficult to deny that it was popular. And one of its major traits was how deliciously over-the-top violent it was. It contained numerous scenes of graphic violence and interlinked them with (no so subtle) social commentary, making it a sheer delight to watch (assuming your cup of tea was watching an indestructible cyborg brutally wiping out scores of scum-bags).Now, twenty-five years later, it gets rebooted (not including the pretty poor showings which made up Robocop's sequels and TV spin-off show). And, the first thing you need to know, is that it's no longer an 'adult' movie. Due to the film-makers wanting to claw back as much of its budget as they could, they've gone and made it a PG-13/12 certificate. So, what we're left with is the cyborg-action equivalent of World War Z (a mainstream big budget zombie film with no violence or gore).This is the major 'flaw' in the film (which most people seem to dwell on). It's fair to say that this reboot hasn't performed as well as the producers would have liked it to (I'll bet they were hoping this would be the springboard to launch a lucrative franchise off of). However, if you get over the die-hard fans and their shouts of disapproval because no one gets melted in a vat of toxic waste, you may actually enjoy it.Yes, the action is greatly reduced, but what's there is still pretty cool. Plus the cast is excellent and what it lacks in fight scenes it makes up for in commentary on today's modern way of life and how much computers (and in this case robots) intrude and may well intrude with our day to day existence.If you ask me which Robocop is better (1987 vs 2014) I would say the original, but simply because it was just that ? the original. Plus I have never ending nostalgia for one of my favourite childhood movies. However, if you can put any bias you have to the back of your mind and look at this one as a completely fresh tale which simply borrows major plot points and situations from its source material, then you may just find an enjoyable movie in there somewhere.Thank you for your cooperation.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

It's has a complex character development that I didn't expect, and the story has many twists and turns that you are feeling concern and worry for the main character. The problem is, there are many people enjoy/used to Michael Bay and many money crapping Hollywood director's Bull S**T that when they are presented with a good movie with good plots, good messages, and talk about real issue in our society, they complain that "the movie has too little action", or "the story is too complicated that it hurts my brain" this kind of s**t talk. And too many people compare this to the original movie, with biased and prejudice that make them cannot look past the differences in the interpretation and presentation of Robocop.

		<shortDescription>Solid new RoboCop for the future. Great effects built on a stronger back story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I'm a bit late to the party; I'm still glad I came. This is a very high quality remake of a movie that never should have been more than a B movie when it came out. Nothing against the original I saw it 6 times the week it came out, it is still the only movie I have ever seen that many times in the theater. This remake however is really clean, and all of the tech is tight, and realistic in it's seamless melding with the near future, with such a perfect cast making sure not to miss any of the Iconic lines, though not being afraid to be a new, and different movie. I don't need to tell you who is in it, I don't need to tell you what it is about, though the back story in this version of the story is far more fleshed out, and there is less emphasis on the partnership, and more on family, but it is stronger this way for sure. I really Enjoyed this movie once I was able to get past that little head on the big ru-but (and the American General saying oot for out) as well there are some flaws in the story that are allowed in order to get through them. MGM's answer to Ironman, and Captain America. I recommend this one to anyone who was a fan of the original, you just have to give in, and accept that this is a new Robocop, and it works, of course if you have never seen a Robocop movie, or TV show (there were a couple) then you most likely will take to this right away. Personally though I am still hoping for the Robocop vs Terminator movie, I would accept animation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really am shocked at how rubbish this was. I had high hopes from the average score here. I was pleased when I heard the original theme tune at the beginning, leading me to expect other loyalties to the original. Then, nothing, no loyalties to the original, or the comics. However, I am good at getting over such things, I can treat new remakes as Individual films. I have to say though that they just didn't do very well here at all. Most of the film was contained to the subject of his development, more so his combat mode, where by his cyborg side killed so many targets in so many seconds. It seemed to me that they made this film to make video games as that is all the story line seemed to revolve around. I am sorry as I really thought it might have been a good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what Hollywood wants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robocop ReviewThis is exactly the kind of movie Hollywood wants: a convoluted mess full of plot-holes, unnecessary subplots, bad direction and little fun to be had.Minor Spoiler, SignaledPlot holesThe most infuriating ones are tied to the RoboCop character who, by the way, only starts actually doing something 50 minutes in the movie.They go too deep in how RoboCop works and how OGP can control him and shut him down whenever they want. But when RoboCop rebels the first time, Gary Oldman's character is asked why and his line is literally 'I have no idea'.In the original RoboCop they don't explain how Murphy starts regaining his memories. It's left to the viewer's imagination, just like the whole process of creating him was. But if you start going into that much detail about something, you can't suddenly go 'I have no idea'. That's called a cop-out.The worst thing is that it happens twice. The most important time RoboCop manages to do something that goes against his programming, they never explain why, nor were any hints given for us to make our own idea. It just comes out of nowhere.SPOILER Another blatant plot-hole is this system that they implant into RoboCop which basically has access to all the digital archives of the police, crosses evidence, and tells him who to arrest. Which begs the question: why didn't they give the police this system to begin with, in a Computer if all they wanted was good PR?On top of it, this system makes makes it appear like RoboCop is only needed because he has that program in his brain. It makes all the other policemen look like idiots, and it makes him even less intimidating than he already is. END SPOILERUnnecessary SubplotsThe most unnecessary is Murphy's family. They have fifteens minutes of screen-time and they add nothing to the plot. You could remove them from the movie, put his colleague in place of his wife in that one scene, and nothing would be lost or change.The one that made me the most angry was the one that was interesting and goes nowhere.The first five minutes of the movie are more interesting than anything else that happens afterwards. Surprisingly, they seem to retain the spirit of the original movie. I would have much preferred to see RoboCop in that contest. But as I said, it goes nowhere. And that's a damn waste.Bad DirectionThere's so much shaky cam in this movie that I almost got nausea.It ruins every single action scene in this movie. In the very first one there are cuts where I couldn't tell what is going on at all. Who got injured, why, how, where did they shoot this guy from!It's even more aggravating when they use it in scenes where people are just standing in front of each other talking! There's no action to make 'more dramatic'. There's no need for shaky cam!And that's not the only questionable directing choice. There's an action scene in the second half of the movie where I literally had no idea what was going on from start to end because on top of the shaky cam, you have another bad directing choice that also makes no sense plot-wiseBut never is the bad direction as evident as it is in Samuel L. Jackson. Michael Keaton gives a great performance, Gary Oldman gives an okay performance, Samuel L. Jackson seems to not give a flying snake about the movie he's starring in.That's half on him, and half on the director who, I guess, was intimidated by his star power and never bothered to correct him.Little FunThe movie is just no fun at all to watch. The fight scenes aren't fun because you can't follow them properly. There are very few jokes, and those that exist are not exactly funny. The plot is a mess.Worst of all, the characters are not entertaining. No bad performances in this movie, but there sure are boring performances. Michael Keaton's character has that potential to entertain, but the script gives him almost nothing to work with.Joel Kinnaman is no joke either. His character is not well written to begin with, but even before transforming into RoboCop, he's so inexpressive! No matter if he's making a weapon deal undercover, playing with his son or making out with his wife, he always has the same expression.When he puts on the suit his face's lack of expression becomes even more evident, and his body language is not intimidating at all. Again, half of this falls on the director's shoulders. If you really wanted to make this RoboCop have emotions, make sure he emotes them well.I know it's not an easy role, but we have lots of examples of people giving a great performance even with some kind of disadvantage. Like Marlee Matlin in Children of a Lesser God, Hugo Weaving in V for Vendetta, and of course, Peter Weller in the original RoboCop.Final ThoughtsI wouldn't suggest going to see this. People who aren't fans of the original will find it boring, and people who are fans of the original will come out of the movie theater infuriated and with their stomachs lurching.If you really want to see a fun movie based on the original RoboCop, I suggest watching 'Our Robocop Remake' at OurRobocopRemake.Com. A joined effort from 50 groups of people to make a fitting homage to the original movie.It's completely free, it's very funny and it's many times more entertaining than this Robot Bore Fest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of the original 'RoboCop' movie ? I find it to be fun, satirical, enjoyably violent and overall very good. Naturally, I wasn't very thrilled when I heard it was getting a remake. I was even less thrilled when I heard the remake will be rated PG-13. I mean ? how can you make a 'RoboCop' movie without excessive violence and blood squibs? Now that I have seen the movie, I can freely say that the PG-13 rating is the least of this movie's problems. Initially, I didn't want to compare the remake to the original, I wanted to view it and review it as a stand-alone movie. Now that I have seen it, I think I'll have to compare the two movies after all, since the remake possesses none of the qualities that made the original such a classic, and by simple comparison I can easily explain why the remake is an utterly flawed and ridiculous movie. The movie opens with a political show, called the Novak Element, led by the host Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson), during which we see a news footage of OmniCorp droids (including the famous ED-209 and the freshly introduced humanoid drones called ED-208) patrolling and inspecting the streets of some Islamic state. Novak compliments the droids and then starts attacking The Dreyfuss Act ? a law that forbids the deployment of such drones in the USA. We are then introduced to Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton), the CEO of OmniCorp, who is trying to find ways of tricking The Dreyfuss Act and start deploying his products in the USA. He gets the idea of incorporating both man and machine into an ultimate law enforcement product. We are then introduced to our protagonist ? Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) ? who is soon heavily injured in an explosion and is used as a guinea pig in this newest OmniCorp program. Like I said before: the 'RoboCop' remake lacks everything that was good in the original movie. First of all, there's no worthy satire in the movie. Society is sometimes mocked through the character of Pat Novak, but the satire isn't very subtle nor intelligent ? actually, I'd say it is very primitive and expeditionary. Second of all, the nature of Robocop's character is very different from the original movie; he's not a robot, but more a man in a robotic suit, and his family plays a fairly big role in the movie. And I would be perfectly fine with these changes if the main actor, Joel Kinnaman, didn't have the charisma of a paper bag and could, as a matter of fact, act (!), and if Abbie Cornish (who plays the role of Alex Murphy's wife ? Clara Murphy) wasn't so irritatingly bland. The revelation of the RoboCop suit and the suit itself were also poorly done. In one scene, Michael Keaton's character criticizes the suit design that appeared in the original movie by saying something along these lines: the original suit wasn't tactical enough. Well, at least the original suit didn't look like a black dildo! The villains in the movie didn't get a much better treatment, either. Among the several villains that appeared in the movie, none was memorable or even remotely interesting. But, to be fair, not everything sucks about the 'RoboCop' remake. Some of the acting was OK (mostly by experienced actors like Jackson, Keaton and Oldman) and the special effects did look really good. But what's the use of awesome special effects when the majority of the movie's boring and tedious? Add to all the aforementioned flaws the PG-13 rating, which destroyed the potential of some scenes, and you'll get one weak and forgettable movie. In the original, one of the most memorable lines goes 'I'd buy that for a dollar'. In addition to butchering everything else, the remake also butchered this line. In one scene, Jackie Earle Haley's character Mattox bashes the concept of Robocop saying he 'wouldn't buy that for a dollar'. As for myself, if I knew upon purchasing my ticket what horrors were awaiting, I wouldn't have bought it for a dollar. Rating: 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually write reviews, but I have to stop and write one for this film.On a whim of nostalgia awhile ago just before the 2014 version was about to premiere, I ordered the blu-ray for the original one. I also picked up an almost free ticket to see the new one ($7.50 off any showing).I kind of regret going tonight to see the new one.It simply doesn't hold a candle to the original. It's bland and empty.It's not that the acting isn't any good. The performances from Abbie Cornish, Gary Oldman, and Michael Keaton were fine. The actor playing Robocop himself was...really bland. There's too many problems with this film. First, it lacks the charm and grittiness of the original film. There's no sense here that this version of Detroit is an urban warzone out of control. The new version tries to pay homage to it by using some of its catchphrases, but they make no sense out of context. Also, the plot structure from the original is almost entirely gutted and an inferior one put in its place. It is cringe-worthy. Moreover, the film also lacks conflicts that are needed for a story to even exist. Kurtwood Smith did an amazing portrayal of a central villain in the original. This one has...Samuel L. Jackson? He's not even the villain, just an annoying host of a show, he's supposed to portray conservative media forces or whatnot. Lastly, Alex, the central character himself...where is his conflict? The original film had him trying to come to grips with who he was, and how he could get back home. Here, in 2014, Alex has none of that to drive the film forward. The new film actually manages to make the hero of the film repulsive.I could go on and on. But the bottom line is that this film is skippable, unless you want to see it for the special affects and PG-13 explosions and gunfire. Otherwise, save your time and watch the old one. In that one, at least the tin man has a heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it was a very bad remake. when i walked into the theater i was expecting it to be bad, but thought deep down it would surprise me, it failed to. this movie only got a 2 because of sam jackson, with out him it would be a 0 (or 1 because IMDb does not have a 0 selection) if you like bad remakes of classic movies like prom night or evil dead then this movie is for you. a classic was butchered here. the original had so much more going for it, it was funny, action packed, thrilling, and yes violent. this movie had none of that, it was predictable, drawn out, and don't even get me started on that stupid human hand and ridiculous retractable visor. the original was made to make a point on the way the 80s were, this movie was made to make money and be generic as possible. if you want to spend the money on this movie i would recommend take the 10 bucks go to the store and by the DVD. the makers of this movie should have kept the b story of the original, were robocop's memory was wiped and he did not know he was murphy until his partner ann lewis (a character which was replace in this movie and was completely unessential in the remake) told him. it made for a better movie when murphy's family thought he was dead.

		<fullReview>Just got from seeing RemakeCop and i think it sucked! Spoilers ahead! Im a fan of the original Robocop and i think Paul Verhoeven did a great parody/satire/Action/Bloodfest of the first Robotic police officer. It had balls! This one not so much. it is poorly written and goes straight by every chance it has to provoke you, entertain you or surprise you. When you have two great actors like Keaton and Oldman discussing the ethics of what they do, they just pass on relevant information that you can easily muster up by yourself and move on to the next scene. The audience is not challenged in any shape form or fashion. Sure its a movie called Robocop and its about a dude being amputated left to right and turned into a robot, but still. Everything that made the first Robocop great is missing from this one. Hollywood needs to grow some balls if they are gonna keep this remake shenanigans up! Come to think of it, Writer and director of God Bless America, Bobcat Goldthwait would have been the ideal director for the remake of Robocop! one other thing i got annoyed with is the complete lack of technology that the unnamed middle eastern country has in this movie. It's like they are forever stuck in the seventies with giant robots harassing them. And as if that is'nt bad enough the good old Omnicorp has a giant factory in China of all places with a rice paddy field five feet from their walls. The Chinese of course don't have any robots or tech to pick rice for them so they do it the old fashioned way with straw hats and everything. To follow up this travesty of how the future world outside of the u.s of a is, the whole movie ends with Sam Jakcson saying the words: U.S.A have and always will be the greatest nation on the face of the planet! American flag in the background and all :) This movie insulted my intelligence and if you are a Verhoeven fan it will insult yours too! Thanks for readingErik F</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails not only as a remake but as its own film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered what Alex Murphy and his machine counter-part Robocop would be like if a film about the him/them became more about his struggle than the fun of actually being a robot? In the 2014 remake of the 1987 science-fiction masterpiece, of the same name, you will get your answer. Unfortunately, the journey to the answer malfunctions like bad wiring.Director Jose Padilha does the impossible. He makes a movie about a walking war machine into one boring mess. How does he accomplish this? In this film Alex, as the original, is a cop, family man, and all around good guy. Michael K. Williams, who people may know from the two HBO series, "Boardwalk Empire" and "The Wire", plays his partner who is shot during a drug bust that is run by the kingpin Antoine Vallon. Meanwhile Omnicrop, a technological corporation, who are building war machines to prevent from more American soldiers dying, run into a slight snag in their plans. The government wants the operation shut down since machines don't have the most important components in war..human instinct and emotions. Once these war machines are engaged they have no second thought or care who is in their way. The CEO of the company Raymond Sellas, who is played by Michael Keaton, is trying to work with the lead scientist Dr. Dennett Norton on a solution. Dennett, has been experimenting on disabled war veterans with technology that can act as limbs. Sellas wants to test the human war machine hybrid out and has several candidates for the job. Dennett's concern is maintaining the human element of the experiment and not choosing someone who isn't mentally capable of being a machine. Gary Oldman gives Dennett the emotional weight this film needs. It isn't surprising that an actor of his caliber accomplishes this feat,even though the script is emotionally stunted and all over the place. His performance is one of the only things redeemable about this pointless film.Joel Kinnaman's Alex Murphy is nearly killed by Vallon's men when a bomb placed under his car ignites one night when he goes to shut the alarm off. It is then where he becomes Robocop. We do get to see what remaining parts were left after the explosion, disconnected from the robot body, in a scene that is quite terrifying. Kinnaman goes through the motions of playing the title character. He provides a bit of depth to a very underwritten character. Outside of recreating emotions from scenes of the older film he doesn't do much more than act like a robot and attempt to draw drama from an empty script. When the corporation gives him a test run against war machines and Rick Mattox, played by Jackie Earl Haley, who is fairly okay as a military type, Dennett and Sellas watch as our hero proves himself. Even though this would have been a chance for the film to come alive it is bogged down by action that doesn't have any jolt and scientific babble from Dennett, who keeps telling us that Alex is still in there. It is as if Pahdila was afraid of turning this into a generic action film. There is a middle between thoughtful and dumb. Pahdila seems to be in a different area, which is the area of boring. None of the modern effects or action feel like they have life in them. Sure, they look good but are hallow. Oldman's job seems to injecting his warm intellect, which worked so well in the "Dark Knight" franchise. He is practically playing Gordon as a scientist. I have a feeling that Oldman may have the role of being a white Morgan Freeman for now on; in the way he will be the older and wiser voice in all the chaos of any action film he is dropped in. Remember the guy who did this to poor Alex? Of course you don't because that was three paragraphs ago. That is basically the same treatment he gets in the film. See, he really isn't the villain. He pops up near the end when Alex gets his chance at redemption. By this point though so many plots have been thrown at us and none have have stuck, which results in his downfall meaning nothing. Wouldn't you want the guy who was responsible for turning Alex into a machine to have an epic send off? Nope, not this film. I understand they were trying something new with the story but placing an non-threatening, and I mean ridiculously bland, Michael Keaton as the villain was a bad mistake. He was supposed to be this powerful and terrifying villain but he is neither played or written like it. The character is possibly the worst CEO type villain I have ever seen. Keaton doesn't add anything to it. He seems to be playing it like a nice guy trying to be bad. As I said, many plots and feelings are thrown at us but none of it sticks. It is a film that tries to do so much but fails miserably. They even throw in Samuel L. Jackson who just seems out of place and there for the sake of giving the film some type of excitement. I will use this one sentence to compare this one to the original: this film wishes it had even a hair of the originality, intellect, satire, violence, and thrills that the original possessed. Instead, it lies there like a beautifully CGI'ed dead fish</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A restyled version. DON'T compare it with the original ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of "Robocop" and we get this debate again.Was this remake necessary?Were we waiting for this ?Does it add any values to the original version?Does it equal the original version or is it just a pale shadow ?In my opinion this is again an unnecessary discussion. Meanwhile we are already at the next "Spiderman"."Superman" also has taken his cape out of the closet a number of times.And another "Godzilla" is ready to hit the theaters.Nobody is making a fuss about that.But oops, they are going to make a reboot of "Robocop".A 27 year old cult movie. A timeless classic that had great impact in all areas.An ultra-hard SF with explicit violent scenes, infused with cynical humor and satire,and a socially critical message that was unprecedented at the time.The critical spirit that haunts the 1987 version was probably quite revolutionary in those days.The TV ads that were displayed in between seemed absurd and a bit exaggerated,but are obvious at the present times.It presented a "Big Brother" society,where everything was screened and monitored and violence and intolerance were a normal thing.A society owned by the private sector and criminals.A materialistic,profligate and uncontrollable society with violent video games,retarded TV games, corruption and deceit.The critics are very harsh about this remake.Superfluous,humorless, too serious and too little gore scenes are terms that are frequently used.In some cases perhaps true, but despite its shortcomings, it's still an enjoyable film.The next question, however, one can ask: Is this remake meant to emulate,to surpass or just to restyle Verhoeven's film? For me there's no doubt that you can't surpass or even emulate the original film.The released film at that time was a revelation and an unexpected commercial success. The combination of sharp wit, clever one-liners and explicit violence was an explosive cocktail. This is practically unfeasible to surpass because the zeitgeist in those days was totally different from the current one. Restyling is the only meaningful answer. And they succeeded brilliantly in doing that.The beginning of the film sets the tone.Situated in Tehran drones and ED -209's control the population and any extremist individual who constitutes a threat is singled out.This seemingly peaceful scene soon degenerates into an explosive confrontation between fanatical rebels and the robotic law enforcement.The coverage is broad-casted live in "The Novak Element" with Pat Novak as a commentator with a stolid, biased attitude and truly supportive for this new law enforcement.A role that seemed to be written specially for Samuel L. Jackson.It's brought with a lot of flair and imagination by Jackson.The way he brings it,is grandiose.His enormous expressive statements and the determination with which he defends his ideas is masterful.He interrupts a debate between the designer of the drones and his political opponent just with a nonchalant wave motion.A tiny gesture showing that contradiction is not tolerated.A practically perfect rendition the whole movie except at the end.The elitist and chauvinistic patriotism which then comes up, I found a little to much.The rest of the story is again in Detroit that doesn't look like a decaying metropolis now,but crime rules again with the help of a corrupt police force.Omnicorp, the developer of robots,would be only too happy to put drones on the streets to combat crime in an efficient manner and also to raise their profits.However, they encounter quite some opposition from the political world,because the drones only take initiatives in a rational way and aren't able to judge with a human feeling of intuition, compassion and sense.When the police officer Alex Murphy,in his battle against a drug gang,is blown by the latter in shreds,Omnicorp sees his chance to solve this problem by developing a robot/human who still has all those human feelings.So much about what's in common with the original film.However,there is a little philosophical difference with the first Robocop. In the first movie,Alex was transformed into a bionic man who gradually regains his human feelings.In the remake it's the other way around.When Alex wakes up,there remains very little from his human body,but he still has his human feelings and consciousness.As this is an obstacle to its effectiveness as a killing machine,these human emotions are suppressed by lowering his dopamine level so he gradually changes into a numb robot, acting on auto-pilot.A subtle difference.The decision to change his suit in mat black and a red stripe as a visor gives it a more menacing appearance and makes it look more like "Judge Dredd". Only it's a softer version.I just didn't get the feeling of it being a hybrid version of Alex,but rather just a guy in a metal casting.The quizzical expression of "Tin Man" used by Mattox was therefore appropriate.That there was significantly more budget for the special effects,was clearly seen.Compared with the old-fashioned looking stop-motion technique used then,it all looks oiled and devilishly realistic.The structure of the Robocop suit,the high-tech devices in the futuristic-looking labs and the action scenes looked sometimes like excerpts from "Call of Duty".It all looks brushed, impressive and convincing. The acting itself varies from excellent to fairly lousy .Michael Keaton fitted perfectly into the role as the conniving and scheming Sellars.Verhoeven thinks it's a sign of creative poverty in Hollywood and Padilha complains about the terrible interference from MGM so he couldn't fully use his creativity.In my opinion,this film is too much compared with the original, which really shouldn't be the intention. This is just a remake, with the foundation of Verhoeven 's film and a groovy new shell.The matches are there, but because of subtle reinterpretations it's not a straightforward remake . The content has stood the test of time well and leans even closer to the current reality than in the original film.It's actually scary how prescient Verhoeven was at that time.Many will not really appreciate this film and this will have more to do with nostalgia than the film per se.For me it was a more than creditable remake and definitely worth watching.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/</fullReview>

I believe Jos Padilha was portraying himself as Dr. Norton in this film just wanting to make a good emotional film but studio executives portrayed as Raymond Sellars kept shooting him down saying no we need a movie everyone can watch so we can gross more money. As Norton made Robocop emotionless with dopamine to please Sellers Padilha did the same to the film with boring CGI scenes to please executives, only difference being Sellers dying in the end for the attempted murder of Alex Murphy, were as the executives got away with the attempted murder of this movie.Also did anyone else just think bet 365 every time Samuel L Jackson was doing his scenes?</fullReview>

It makes sense to me to judge it on it's own merits.Robocop manages to fail on just about every level.The story, which follows Alex Murphy being transformed into a Cyborg after near fatal injuries from a car bomb, is very slow to get going.At no point was I invested in his journey and his wife's character only seemed to be there to where tops that emphasised her breasts.There are unnecessary, boring exposition dumps that explain why he's more like an emotionless robot in this one and his quest to expose corruption and bring down a ruthless corporate executive is played far too lightly.Every action scene felt like a tired Playstation video game.It often had the feel of a Wednesday afternoon TV movie and I would not waste your money on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK.. So me n my friends had nothing to do on a boring Thursday night . Generally we would have gotten drunk out of our mind and watched football and play a Lil snooker and Foosball in our favorite bar but we have this tradition of watching at least 1-2 movies a week so that our non drunkard friends don't feel left out and frankly I like to stay sober couple of nights a week. We had 3 or 4 options. Winters tale , Lone survivor , Robocop and something else I cant remember. Unfortunately we decided to go watch ROBOCOP. We did all the research ( except watch the trailer - should have watched that as it would have convinced us to go to back to the bar and do our regular Thang. Please mind my slang ) on IMDb METARCRITIC and ROTTEN TOMATOES ( all of which gave it horriblereviews ) but against all odds ( and because we already were really close to the theater ) we decided to watch the movie . And oh that was probably the worst decision I made this week. The movie was budgeted at a 100 mil!!! and yet it looked like a highly under budgeted film and I don't think even a 100 more mil could have saved it. They just got everything wrong. The cast was so bad. ( Im a huge fan of Gary Oldman but he screwed up big time ) and I really don't understand what the purpose of Samuel Jackson was in the film. There was only one scene that I liked and thats it . There were a lot of dumb things in the movie which any normal human being is going to notice and I really advice anyone who goes through the trouble of reading all this nonsense to not watch the film. I didn't even sit through to the very end. I just couldn't. I felt like I would have dropped a couple of IQ points if I had. So the moral of the story is if u had 2 options and one of them was watching Robocop blindly choose the other one cos I bet it wont be as bad as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute horrid insult of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sensational feeling I am left with after watching this movie needs to be put into words before I can rest. But before I get into this, let me start by saying that I am a huge sci-fi fan and the original RoboCop (from 1987) was one of my favorite in the genre. I recently watched it again and I was still amazed that as an adult I could still appreciate this movie.Unlike the original, the new RoboCop (remember it is PG-13) had absolutely nothing to offer and it was definitely the worst remake I have ever seen. For the first time ever at a movie theater I found myself wanting to leave in the middle of the movie. It is not that this film tries to be something it is not, it is simply not even trying to be anything. yes, it is just that bad and I am not exaggerating.The story is such garbage that makes you wondering if the director Jose Padilha even understood the original story line and when will these directors understand that such shaky camera work and Call Of Duty FPS view is NOT appreciated?The only thing I can come up with which was not a total failure was the acting of Joel Kinnaman but unfortunately his part in the movie was too brief. Samuel L. Jacksons acting on the other hand, as pathetic as his role in "snake in a plane". Usually in such movies you want to see a villain that is memorable that get you on your toes but none of the villains in this movie had such characteristics.I wish someone takes Jose Padilhas ELITE SQUAD and makes a pink panther like remake of it.To sum up: do not spend any money/time for this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robocop Fails Everywhere...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I was apprehensive of a reboot, remake whatever since the original is still amazing today. However, the trailer looked good and I liked that they had maintained the look of the original. SooooooThat is where the similarities stop. This new Robocop starts out promising, building up who is who and though I think they spent WAY to long on that part, I didn't mind until??.. The way Murphy get hurt.. HUH! How boring, lame, and unrealized. Not violent, not even exciting. Stupid comes to mind. We spent 20 minutes building up the characters, a bit long but knowing the action will come I am still alright, then Murphy goes down in the weakest, most pathetic way. OK, its over, move on, make Robocop and then let him kick arse. Now, we spend the next hour and 15 minutes in a political drama about robots in our community and training Robocop. Nothing of note happens here. NOTHING. So now, we have watched one hour and 35 minutes and still NO ACTION. Just a couple of bad guys get caught very boring like. Then, Robocop goes after the guy that put him down originally. The most ANTICLIMACTIC SCENE in the history of revenge scenes. WAIT FOR IT.. Were not done. Robocop learns that some cops are bad, which of course we knew from the opening scene of the movie. So he goes after them, captures them without a fight. WAIT FOR IT - we learn there is a higher cop calling some shots? Again, no fight, captured..WAIT FOR IT - now, the company wants to terminate Robocop cause he has human within him.. So he goes after the heads of the company, again, NO ACTION? Its over.. This film was only good looking visually, but there is barely ANY ACTION.. Its a SNOOZE FEST? Bring your girl and make out in the back during this film.. That is all it is good for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to lie when this movie came out I thought it looked terrible. I saw the black suit and thought it was going to be another 2 hour long CGI fest with no story and crappy predicable action sequences. This however was not the case. The story was actually quite different than the original, but left enough in tact to give it the same feel in a lot of ways stylistically. However Robocop 2014 I would also compare to something by David Cronenberg. There is a strong element of Body Horror throughout the film. The complete destruction of Muphy's body, though not as graphic as the original when it happens, but after he is put in the suit is far more disturbing in this one. When the suit is removed we're left with nothing more than a brain, hand, synthetic lungs, a face, and some wires and tubes suspended in a laboratory. Murphy's character is far more sad in this one. You can feel his pain and horror as he realizes what has happened to him. Many aspects of the story are changed such as there's no mystery as to who Murphy is right from the beginning. His wife and son are not lied to at first. There's also already Robots being used abroad in "the war on terror" and Robocop is being used as a political trick to sway voters to allow their usage in the US. It's a nice touch how they changed the War On Drugs aspect into The War On Terror. Joel Kinnaman does and excellent job as Murphy and the who rest of the cast of Abbie Cornish, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, and Samuel Jackson all are really great. Great to see Michael Keaton in a villain role. The special FX are completely incredible and one scene in particular where a man with robotic hands his playing guitar is probably one of the slickest CGI renders I've ever seen. Usage of CGI is not Michael Bay over the top action style. It's done very realistically and looks really really good. I'm not going to go on and on, but I was a big fan of the original, and actually would consider myself a big fan of this one too. I hope they make a sequel! Really great film if you like the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly by-the-numbers, but overall a decent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it is fair to compare it to the 1987 original, each of them is able to stand on their own because they have different angles and way of approaching the core concepts. The story has stayed basically the same. Alex Murphy is a cop who is nearly killed, but is brought back as a human/cyborg hybrid. Whereas the original dealt with issues of corporate corruption in an over-the-top satirical way, this "remix" (as I'll call it) raises more philosophical and ethical questions than it does at trying to shock the viewer with graphic violence. Granted, there is violence, but it's mostly clean and tactical. Director Jose Padilha, famous in his native Brazil for ELITE SQUAD and its sequel, has dealt with issues like urban warfare before and he brings that sensibility to this film as well. This particular approach lends a sort-of authenticity and realism to what was presented in a cartoonish (but still sophisticated) fashion in the original. Each of them have their strengths, and the advantage that this one has over the previous installments is this heightened reality which has become the fashion with today's action pictures, post-DARK KNIGHT. There are also vastly improved special effects. Still, the narrative has issues and these include a protracted third act which over-complicates things by trying to use misdirection as to who the real villains are. In the original, there is no question as to who the "bad guys" are intended to be. And while having things in black and white isn't necessarily a good thing, the way in which they reveal things through twists isn't handled as good as it could have been. Still, I got almost as much as enjoyment out of this new version as I did the old one, just for different reasons. Another area that definitely improved was the caliber of acting involved. Joel Kinnaman is serviceable as the title character, but it's Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton who stand out from the rest, as a scientist and the CEO of Omnicorp, respectively. Overall, I think this was a decent movie, and somewhat unfairly maligned by people who desperately cling to the past. Even if you hold the Verhoeven original close to your heart, it wouldn't hurt to give this a shot. And just as a side, there are nods to the original peppered throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining, VERY slick and polished. Perhaps a bit TOO polished... Blu-ray: Excellent A:9 V:9</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm gonna keep this brief. Normally I do NOT bother writing a review when there are over 500 frigg'n reviews already, BUT... I honestly think that this film just has to be looked at as a stand alone film, based upon it's own merits. And NOT compared to the Classic film it is patterned after.First and foremost, the visuals and effects were excellent. And, I hafta admit that the story line's variance from the original's was done pretty well. When you get into the 'Drama' of the family and his 'Feelings', etc. I would think that it would be EXTREMELY easy to overdo it and COMPLETELY screw it up. BUT... the director did not do that. I REALLY liked where in the few 'Family' scenes, especially after his restructuring, the director kept it BRIEF and simple, NOT going on and on with all this syrupy emotion and crap that a lesser director could EASILY have fallen into doing. I was impressed that there really were NO PAINFULLY phony and drawn out scenes between Robo and his wife or son. What was done was actually done quite well in a restrained and believable way. So, THAT was nice!I think the way the story was structured was fine and it was developed in a competent way. I liked the rivalry between Robo and the Techie guy who kept giving him a hard time. Again, something that could have been WAY overblown and ruined, but I feel that it was handled well.About the ONLY thing about the film that I felt detracted from it at all, and this is probably just a personal preference on my part, but afterward I was thinking, 'What was it that is bothering me...? What is it that didn't seem quite right?' Well, I THINK what it was, is that the film, to me anyway, was just a little TOO polished. Everything was just a little TOO smooth and slick. I KNOW that every Sci Fi film can't look like 'BLADE RUNNER' or 'ALIEN' or anything, but to me, his suit particularly and some other things just looked too slick to me. I think perhaps just leaning a TAD more toward a gritty Future Industrial look would have been better. Maybe that is just me...Anyway, the movie is quite good, very entertaining, has NICE eye candy, and appears to be written and directed very well. I wasn't THAT wild about the leading guy as Robo, but he sufficed (He kept reminding me of a young Keith Carradine, which was a bit distracting...) But, overall, I felt that all the elements were in place to present a superiour, fun Science Fiction film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An acceptable enough remake/reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Which is not to say it was necessary.Indeed, of all movies made in the 80s, Robocop would have been considered as a very unlikely candidate to be remade at all. The original was a fantastic, gorefest, schlock-filled action hit and that toxic melt sequence lives long in the memory. To reboot it was nothing more than a money-making exercise, but if we overlook the morality of the affair, is the movie any good? Well, it isn't bad, put it that way. Like the original it's set in a dystopian future, and like the original it features Alex Murphy's remains brought back to life in a robot, but it changes a great deal about the story, not least Lewis' gender (Battlefield 4 players will recognise Irish's voice returning as Murphy's partner).The plot focuses on the Dreyfuss bill which bans the use of robots for law enforcement in the US, because it's felt the absence of emotion makes them unsuitable, despite the success of their deployment everywhere else in the world. Samuel L Jackson's wildly OTT Novak obsesses over that on his night-time soapbox show the Novak Element, and fully supports Omnicorps' Sellers (Keaton) bid to get their product on the streets of the US, Detroit especially.Murphy's Robocop (built by Oldman's Dr Norton) is a way around that, and thereafter it's a case of 'where it all went wrong'. That very clich is used constantly but this isn't necessarily a bad thing.Fans of the original movie should enjoy this, even if it feels slightly pointless. The visual effects are pretty extraordinary in truth, and the action sequences thoroughly enjoyable.The first review on the page does make a good point - there is no one obvious outright bad guy - unlike the original's brilliant Kurtwood Smith, Murphy isn't up against a particular enemy. However the side issue here is that this kind of misses the point - the change in this movie is that a combination of Omnicorp, his killer, and one or two other characters leads Murphy to a pursuit of avengement. There doesn't need to be a big bad guy - just like video games don't always need a boss fight, movies don't always need a nemesis.For me the way it's structured doesn't detract.Fundamentally it's a different movie to the original, a homage which is frankly well made but goes in its own direction.Whether you like that or not is up to you, but I have personally seen far worse movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thinking man's Robocop?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robocop (2014) was a hell of a lot more cerebral than anyone expected, putting more thought into its script than did the gimmicky (but still quite classic) ultra-violent 1987 original. The new film is high- concept science fiction instead of over-the-top satire, touching on everything from drone deployment overseas to free will to domestic surveillance. The movie even gives a nod to the question of the existence of the soul.It's good, but it will never achieve the cult classic status of the original. As much as I liked it, I could have used a few more action scenes. This was a well made movie, but the kid in me wanted just a little more screen time for the ED-209's, more bot-on-bot slugfests, or even a reappearance from one of the original franchise's garish, comic book villains.Still ? this was well done. It was sure better than anyone in the fan community thought it would be. I'd recommend it. And, really ? can any movie come CLOSE to matching one that casts Red Foreman, the Dad from "That 70's Show," as the Big Bad?http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a bit biased when I rented this remake on Amazon Prime in that I thought the original film was barely good for a second viewing. Thus, I thought this one would be worse. But they did a good job of sticking to the story without the over-the-top characters that made the original unbearable at times.Granted, those who love violent movies don't watch this type of film for it's cinematic touches and character development, but for it's genre, it's a closer-to-sane treatment than the Robocop of the 80's.Bolstered by the casting of Gary Oldman, Jennifer Ehle and Joel Kinnamann as the main character Alex Murphy/Robocop, we are asked to believe in a world similar to the one in which we exist today that isn't too far off in the future.Even for a violent movie, it wasn't gratuitous in that respect. Instead, I felt it was a plot- and character-driven movie with graphic (yet, tempered) violence. The special effects were top-notch and the stunts weren't outrageously unbelievable. It wasn't perfect, I could pick it apart, but I am difficult to please entirely by Hollywood fare. But, it's certainly worth the rental.The remainder of this review contains spoilers.The only casting I didn't agree with was that of Michael Keaton. I can see how others would say he was perfect for the role with his brand of physical gesturing, but I felt he was too light for the role.Samuel L. Jackson was perfect for his parody of Bill O'Reilly with a touch of balance. He didn't come off sounding too left or too right. And if anyone can turn a smart-bleeped remark and make it sound like it, Sam is the man.Jennifer Ehle delivered a solid characterization of Keaton's right-hand woman with a cold, unfeeling embodiment of efficiency. Almost a robot herself.Gary Oldman is always dependable (which may be a detriment in a weird sort of way) as the scientist who brings Murphy back to life and struggles with the moral balance of keeping his job, keeping himself alive and keeping Robocop from being scrapped.Finally, Joel Kinnamann delivered his lines well but his role was lost in the balance of the development of the main characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Robocop fan and this is just an insult.As a standalone movie, even if it was called "Cyborg Detective 2014" and had nothing to do with the Robocop universe, it's still a waste of time. Besides the dull, stupid, anticlimactic, boring and predictable script, the visual effects and artistic style are lame and look like they were done for a low budget TV series. The original 1987 version of Robocop is superior in every possible way even with the outdated stopmotion animation.I really don't understand why is this happening, Hollywood is just getting worse and worse these days, remaking everything and calling it the same as the original like it's meant to replace it and it's automatically better. This movie was just a waste of time and money and a big stain on the Robocop franchise, right up there with Robocop 3. If this is the future of Hollywood, I feel bad for every movie buff out there.

		<fullReview>I'm watching "Robocop", witch is not Robocop for the second time. Just to see if it is really as bad as I recall it, watching it the first time. And I stilll don't like it.Despite better effects and a more robot-like Robocop, the original still prevails.Here is why.First of all Joel Kinnaman is no Peter Weller. In the original, despite only 15 minutes or so as a human, Weller created a very likable Alex Murphy. Kinnaman can't create a likable Murphy. He comes off too much like a tough guy and a smart-ass. Murphys death in the real Robocop movie is to the date still a very hard scene to watch. And the evil sadistic Clarence Boddicker (brilliantly played by Kurtwood Smith) and his ditto gang are to this date still awesome bad-guys. And when Robocop remembers its an absolute delight to watch him kill every member of the gang one by one.In this "Robocop" movie Murphy is almost killed by a car-bomb and I still don't like him nor do I care what happens to him either. That is a clear sign that the movie isn't working at all. And of course because "Robocop" is PG13, there is no blood whenever someone dies, no Boddicker, no Dick Jones (awesome Ronny Cox) no Bob Morton(awesome Miguel Ferrer) or any other bad-guys, just a Fallon whats his face and a Dennet Norton (Bob Morton get it?)Fallon (a woman's name)has too little screen time to even be noticed."Robocop" has no drive or motivation to go on living as a machine. In the real Robocop movie he had revenge that pushed him forward. The CGI version of ED-209 that like OCP has a different name moves exactly like the much more menacing stop-motion-robot in the original. So what's the point? Much like the rest of the movie. They spend a lot of time letting "Robocop" go through the motions with his new robot-body and showing he he is made. And running simulation programs where he fights other robots. Again probably the rating. Had it been rated R, he would have been send out on the streets right away killing bad-guys, because that's what the real Robocop does.And what's with all that crap with his wife and son? Who cares. Like he could ever have a life with them again after his transformation. In the real Robocop movie they wiped his memory and he barely remembered them and that worked really well. There was not a single scene with Murhy together with his wife and son. And yet we felt Robocops pain (now that is good acting from Peter Weller) Seeing the new "Robocop" cry as he talks to his wife on a Skype like connection made me wanna puke.And all the satire and humor of the real Robocop movie is gone here. Instead we have a movie that takes it self way too seriously and the action-scenes feels like they were shot and directed by a teenager.Avoid this crap. Even if you've never seen the real Robocop movie from 1987 and you were born later and it seems outdated I guarantee that you will still prefer that to this crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult movie violated as vehicle for US propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will not write too much about this sorry effort to a movie, because I get upset too much. You could write about Murphy being more human as in the original instead of being dead and revitalized as machine, you could write about him not even using his cool gun or about him suddenly being in high speed mode all the time and even riding a bike.Ergo, about everything that lacks from the original, not to mention the critical attitude towards a society in a dystopian future, when companies own not only the police, but complete governments, in the tradition of scifi novels like Lem's "Futurologischer Kongress" or John Brunner's "Stand on Zanzibar". What didn't hinder the movie makers to steal the original music theme and some quotes from it.You don't have to write more about it anyway, because this movie is simply the most primitive, clumsy and obvious attempt of propaganda for US politics. Being presented from start to finish by a styled and more than less hysterical Samuel L. Jackson in the manner of a TV preacher. The message goes: accept drones not only abroad but also on your own soil, euphemistically called "for your safety". As at the beginning of the movie - with further euphemisms - the people of Tehran(!) are brought "peace", these people have to be made peaceful ("may peace be upon you(!)"/" to pacify these people"), what they accept, of course. In fact, this is a major threat to their lives, when US troops bring peace (ask the Vietnamese, or the Iraqis, etc.). How this works is shown, when a young boy "armed" with two knives is shot into pieces. Civilized and peaceful USA shows his true face.Who stands up against this is an enemy, like the senator in the movie, and has to be handled as such, he is a criminal who has to be silenced or even be put away, best would be Guantanamo, cause in fact he is a terrorist. Isn't he?This movie is barely disguised propaganda and brain washing to the masses, that took RoboCop as basis and that eclipses every conspiracy theory. What cannot be missing is the usual "America is now and always will be the greatest country on the face of the earth!" What America? North, Middle, South? Even for this the US seems to be too stupid, and I just cannot throw up that much as I can eat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taking Robocop as a work of science fiction means that it should be interpreted not only as a warning sign of things to come, but as an an allegory of what is happening right now. In this reading, the figure of Alex Murphy as an individual collects together our fears of what we've become collectively: dependent of and controlled by the intricacies of the systems we've created. To this end, the setting up of the movie works well and picks up themes not present in the original. It is chilling to see Murphy in his condition, and think "that's us". However, from here on the directions taken are less than satisfactory. Robocop does not seem to say anything really new or insightful about this human condition. The message is that we can go far, but should not go "too far": a science-fiction clich. Most of the opportunities for true commentary are missed. The irreverent humour of the original is missing, replaced with a tired critique of USA as the world police something-something. Surely an acceptable target by now. Any real religious, philosophical and societal issues that might emerge are instead tactfully ignored or merely hinted at.I did find Robocop to be an enjoyable ride on the whole, but it could have been more. It is hardly the turkey some reviewers have made it seem, though.</fullReview>

However, it was not in the whiny protesting way, but rather the "oh gods, I just saw an animal get hit by a bus" shocked. That image of pulsating guts and organs was rather grisly.The action scenes were a bit too fast for my taste, and I thought that some of the Samuel L. Jackson scenes were hit or miss, but overall, I found this movie to be as entertaining and action-packed as the original and certainly worthy of the name "Robocop".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It stinks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen many people call this movie "smart". It is absolutely not. The writing in this movie is some of the dumbest I have ever seen. One golden exchange between the doctor and his assistant goes: His dopamine levels are coming back to normal! How is that even possible? I haven't the faintest idea... Other memorably stupid details in the film include RoboCop's system referring to an intoxicated suspect as "totally stoned" or a scene where RoboCop scans a suspect who is then listed as "cooperative, non-threat" but RoboCop being the edgy badass he is written as in this film shoots him dead anyway. Even without comparing it to the original, this movie fails on almost every level. The acting is bad for the most part, especially from the leads Joel Kinnaman and Abbie Cornish. The only redeemable performances are from Gary Oldman, Jackie Earle Haley and Samuel Jackson. The writing is very inconsistent and the plot is sloppy as a result of a lack of focus. It almost feels like they tried to have too many plot lines and ideas and couldn't be cut into a concise two hour plot. For example, the first scene is almost ten minutes and has a setting and mood that is unlike the rest of the film, but it serves no purpose other than to show that robots are used in other countries but are not legal in America, which is unnecessary because they tell you that twenty more times over the course of the film. Almost the first entire half of the film is "Murphy was injured, is rebuilt as RoboCop, must train", except this fails because they spend so much time on the melodrama to characterize RoboCop, but it's so poorly written that you cannot care about the character. Other grievances I had with the film do relate to the fact that it's a remake, because that lends itself to comparison. In the original, Murphy is blown apart by a firing squad of gangsters before he is shot in the head. As a result, the only thing saving his life was the surgery turning him into RoboCop. In the remake, he is injured by a car bomb. The doctor says "He has fourth degree burns on 80% of his body, it is unlikely he will survive" despite the fact that the image they show of Murphy is him missing a leg but certainly doesn't have 80% of his body covered in burns and doesn't even look in danger of death. This is compounded by the fact that after the surgery, all that is left of his body is his head and lungs. How did he go from missing a leg to missing his entire body? Did the doctors cut him apart? It makes absolutely no sense. Also, it tries to be like the original in continuously asking "Is he machine or man?" but unlike the original where it is ambiguous if RoboCop retained his personality, in the remake Alex never loses his identity or his memories. He is always himself in the film, except for one point halfway through where they lower his dopamine levels and that turns him into an emotionless robot. This is incredibly stupid because dopamine is the drug in your body that influences emotions, but lowering dopamine in the body would not remove his personality. Then he gets his personality back when his body synthesizes more dopamine, which hilariously perplexes the doctors. Another large issue I had is that the subplot where RoboCop tries to find who blew him up feels incredibly forced, as they were clearly trying to include it due to its importance in the plot of the original. Also, there is no reason given to why they blew him up other than one line that I believe said "He can't be bought off like the other cops" but I'm not sure because it was very quick and it's never brought up again. There is no impact to him finding the people who blew him up because it's a subplot with little and poor build up and rather than being intertwined with the main plot like the original, it is tacked on and irrelevant to the over-arcing story. I could go on for hours about everything this movie did wrong, but in short, it fails to be engaging and exciting like an action movie should and it fails to create likable and sympathetic characters like a good story should. I mention those because it clearly spends a lot of time trying to make RoboCop sympathetic and it fails miserably, and it was marketed as an action flick but the action is forgettable and makes up not even fifteen minutes of the two hour movie. One of the worst movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a good 'un</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting remake.Not as cartoonish as the original, and the satire is more bitter. They changed the hero's dilemma, in that his humanity was present from the beginning of his robotishness. Also they got in the issue of illusion of free will - hot topic for everyone.The action scenes were good - particularly driving a bend on the motorcycle while Robocop steers with one hand and shoots with the other.The CEO was an excellent parody of marketing-as-product (Steve Jobs **cough**), but the TV talking head was not convincing - although that kind of nutty ranting is a good target.Anyone who thinks this was unnecessary, just think - the original was a satire on the corporate take over of political power in the US, but it didn't make a blind bit of difference.This one isn't perfect, but it matches the original at a time when the need to break corporate power is even more urgent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film that people should really stop complaining about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was not anticipated by many people because they love the original Robocop and they were worried about there franchise but I must say that this is indeed a good film but it does have it's problems. This film sees a good cop Murphy critically injured by a car bomb and a corporation decides to combine him with robotics to create Robocop. Now the guy they got to play Murphy was not a decent actor and it really shows when we try to sympathise with the character of Murphy, but he does a pretty good when being the emotionless Robocop and he does a good job with the action scenes that is necessary in a film like this. The supporting cast is also pretty good with Gary Oldman being fantastic in the film as the scientist who puts Robocop together and he seems to be the one who is doing the best with his acting ability. Michele Keaton is in this film as the head of the corporation and he does a really good job in this film as he really plays a few different types of character in this film and he does a great job in it. The head instructor is also good in the film and he looks like he is having fun in his role, the only negative is the woman who plays Murphy's wife isn't that great and she doesn't seem to have the acting chops for the role. The story is alright with the corporate background scenes being cool and a realistic addition to the film that provided a nice backdrop and Murphy's story comes to a good conclusion. However, I thought his story was pretty lacklustre and it didn't show enough Robocop action. The script is alright with Oldman and Keaton's dialogue being good and Jay Baruchel providing some funny moments but Murphy's lines are so basic and stoic it hurts the film. The style is cool in the film with the futuristic warfare backdrop being cool and also the look of Robocop was really good and helped the character. Overall this film is not as terrible as you have heard and it is good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the remake very much and the original.The technical point of a human being only a remnant of biological material mechanically augmented and the brain itself subject to a mechanical survival control that would give the person the conviction of believing decisions were made by the human brain and not the weapons systems was a point worthy of the original's unique quality in 1987. The special effects delivery of the self discovery scene is a work of sci-fi art to my mind.The corporate corruption theme was as socially relevant in the 1980's as the use of drones is for human conflict today. We may be faced with choices about human augmentation. So far we have the Oscar Pistorius "blade runner" trial. His carbon fiber legs are the most globally recognized human augmentation in existence and the legal charges allege his murder of a woman in his home. Not so good.The entire point of robotics is human augmentation. The 2014 Robocop is an excellent telling in a socially relevant setting of that timeless story of the choice and outcome of the use of force. In Robocop 2014, very much as in The Day the Earth Stood Still 1951, the choice is for justice.It's faithful to the original and still unique for today. I like it a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the critics: RoboCop is a worthy reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the year 2028 in futuristic Detroit. Advanced Robot technology is spearheaded by a massive corporation: OmniCorp. Their drones are utilized heavily overseas by law enforcement, but the market is becoming saturated. In order to grow the company and please shareholders, the only option remaining is to utilize their robots at home. But their efforts are met with heavy resistance, as politicians and the American people struggle to accept the idea of robots enforcing the law without any human reasoning. An OmniCorp scientist (Gary Oldman) is left at a standstill; how do you put a man inside a machine? When police officer Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnamon) suffers a horrific accident, it provides OmniCorp with an unprecedented opportunity.What am I missing here? This was panned by the critics, yet to my surprise I enjoyed it. I haven't seen the original RoboCop in some time, so I went in without any biases or expectations; I viewed this as it's own film and didn't compare it to the original. I thought it had a great balance of action, great special effects, meaningful drama and believable characters that made it resonate. Joel Kinnamon (Alex Murphy), Gary Oldman (Dr. Denneth Norton), Michael Keaton (Raymond Sellars) and Abbie Cornish (Clara Murphy) all put in some very good performances; the cast was very strong and they made the film better than it probably should have been. The film takes some time to add some depth to Alex Murphy; his conflict between duty and his family was palpable and effective. The re-imagined soundtrack was very impressive and there were some interesting social commentary on the lengths we're willing to go for security (as did the original film). It's not perfect however. Samuel Jackson's pro-gun Pat Novak was just way over the top and it did have a few plot holes (the script could've also been a bit better). Some things also didn't quite make any sense; even in this futuristic world, the parts of Alex Murphy's body that they were able to be salvaged and reused seemed a bit implausible (to say the least). Having said that, watch it with reasonable expectations and I think you'll enjoy this quite a bit. I thought this was a pretty good reboot and worth watching. I definitely saw enough to be interested in the new franchise going forward. Enjoyed my review? Keep in touch!

		<shortDescription>RoboFlop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My summary basically sums this film up. Remakes are a tough thing to pull off. Fans of the original will immediately feel inclined to point out flaws, scrutinize it to the point of no return, they will damn it before they let any sign of positivity leave their fingertips/mouth; depending on their source of frustration of course. So really when a director steps up to the plate and tries to take on a character as iconic as Robocop then he is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. If he makes a carbon copy, just with updated special effects then he is doomed to unoriginal criticism, a copycat, an mindless money maker. But if he changes it, then he is destined to take flack from the more avid fans of the franchise. Is that the directors main audience? No, sadly it isn't. Their focus is this generation. To delve into what teenagers like and insert it into the remake. In this case it means taking all the violence and obscenities, all the brutality from the 18 certificate original and diluting it to a child friendly film. Because unless you are somehow going to satisfy all the fans of the original, then you have to send a line out for a different type of fish. That is looking at it from both sides, but as a film fan; watching this and hoping it entertains me, well it failed. It wasn't a good film. Plain and simple. It tried so hard to get through the story with as much detail as it could, but by doing so it sacrificed any intensity.It was in desperate need of more action, it is after all supposed to be an action film. Some of the acting was very drab and in comparison to the other there is no room for criticism as the 1987 original didn't exactly have great acting. It was its cheesy, nonchalant approach that made it a classic, but maybe when remaking the film, acting could have been a priority; something that you could do better. Gary Oldman is effortless as usual and has a solid display. There was a likeness to the an older role as Betelgeuse from Micheal Keaton which i enjoyed and Samuel L Jackson is perfect to try and add a sense of legitimacy to the film, but not even his legendary status can save it. Children may enjoy the film, but for a film and a creation that has an incredible amount of potential to prosper which such improved special effects it was a massive let down. Slow, action starved and very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TERRIBLE messages in this film.For all the ham fisted and very mild mocking of the bias of media- cartoony like all TV media has become in real life. Its there only as a copy of the original, not to actually wake anyone up with how unsustainable things have become- corrupt politicians selling every American out as hard as they possibly can.The United States government is working towards Robots on the ground (ground drones if you want). And they want them exactly why the movie says- no way to say no to illegal orders. "Safe and security" -give up all your rights! And killing children is no problem for robots with government orders (look at ATF's history- people who just like to kill).So we are supposed to be comforted that Robocop is able to rewrite his own orders (He was a human changed to act like a robot to please voters). And what does Robocop do? He rewrites his own orders, then he tortures people, and shoots people who have given up. Clearly the movie is saying the humans are the problem, even when you mess with their brains. Sneaky Hollywood- GOOD GUYS don't torture.Even the action is crap. Robocop drives straight into 20 guys with the right kind of bullets to actually harm him. How do they all miss? He has a minor cut on his shoulder afterwards....whoop dee do.This movie is just to get people thinking good thoughts about Robots until the US government can finally make it happen. Some bomb will go off, terrorists will be blamed, and the government will push it all in against the fat cowardly Americans. Just look, Police robots are making it into every futuristic movie. But don't worry, either they are the good guys (Robocop), or they are really weak (like the Matt Damon movie recently, or I, Robot).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Robocop to like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only seen the original Robocop twice, maybe three times, with that said I was never a huge fan and never saw the sequels. I enjoyed the original for what it was but never thought it elevated past another good action movie. The new remake is more of a reboot than anything. At heart it is paying homage to the original, and does not shy away from certain aspects of the original, but at the end of the day it is making a different statement. It is not trying to imitate or do a shot for shot remake, and for me this works to make one solid and fun movie. The acting in this movie is one of the highlights. There are no Oscar winning performances, but in no way is that a criticism. This is not a movie made for the Oscars. The key and best performance is by, you guessed it, Gary Oldman. He has a great character here that changes and is dynamic throughout the movie, and feels as if he grows with Alex. He fires up when it is appropriate and has small nuance when called for, just Oldman being great at his craft. Michael Keaton here plays the capitalistic and, "will do anything to make all the money" type president of OmniCorp. He does great in this role. I loved watching him on screen and he carries himself very well. The main thing I liked is that he is the "villain" of the film but never felt like a campy or out of place evil villain. Joel Kinnaman nails it as Alex Murphy/Robocop. He has the voice, look, and presence down to a science. He gets extra points for being able to handle the direction the movie chooses to take his character. He also has the benefit of Abbie Cornish as his wife, who was good, but I wanted to see more interaction between her and her husband given the tone of the film. I only wish I had been able to see just a little more of her. The whole direction and tone of the movie is a bit different than the original. There is a large focus on the mental and emotional toil of a man's soul and consciousness being joined into a machine. I thoroughly enjoyed exploring this part of the world. Alex is tortured fighting to maintain his humanity and the robotics are exactly that. I will stop there because this is some of the best stuff in the movie and where it shines bright as being its own entity. The last thing is the violence. The original had the reputation of being needlessly violent. I won't go so far as to say that, but I will say certain scenes seemed over the top. Here the violence exists, but due to the world that is established in the movie the main brawls are between Robocop and machines, and his encounters with humans are justifiably one sided. With modern special effects Robocop is more super human than ever so humans are not much of a challenge; hence the battle being between other robots and the robot part of himself. So it is less a violent action movie and more a political drama of sorts with lots of action. All in all I enjoyed the hell out of Robocop and much more than the original. The only thing that I was not 100% on board with was the politics of the movie. The political aspects of the movie fit and work well in the world established and Samuel L Jackson is in his element as a political talk show host; however a part of me could not help but feel this was all a bit secondary. I could have done entirely without his character and had a greater focus on Alex and Clara. I will definitely see this movie again and recommend it to others, however if you are a hardcore fan of the original this may not be what you were hoping for. Go to see a side of Robocop you have never seen before, some amazing performances, and one specific astounding fight scene. This is a new, sharper, and more personal Robocop and, "I'd buy that for a dollar!" For more see, http://chrisancarrow.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up front I'll confess. I'm one of those curmudgeony dinosaurs who takes it as a personal affront to my long gone adolescence whenever anyone dares to remake an 80s flick. I mean, heck, movies aside, NOTHING can compare to how stylin' I was in my parachute pants &amp; moussed up hair as I strutted in that movie theater with my gallon of Fresca, pop rocks &amp; Fruit Stripe gum back in '87 to watch the cinematic event of the decade, Robocop. That alone, plus the fact that they don't make gum with real sugar anymore (communists!), makes me want to thumbs-down every remake of today.But you know what? This movie sorta rocks. I'll tell you why.First of all, the story is COMPLETELY different, so it can't even be considered a remake. I'm a firm believer that, much like Jimi Hendrix did when he covered "Hey Joe", if you're going to revisit someone else's work then do it completely differently. That's what the director did here. Only the basic premise remains: a lone, half-computerized "Everyman" decides to take on a criminal/corporate colossus while simultaneously struggling with his lost humanity.First off, Robocop 2014 is a much broader, more family-friendly film. Gone is the extreme, in-your-face violence and criminal depravity that worked so well in the original which was intended to disturb viewers on an emotional level (Veerhoven is king of cinematic satire). Whereas the old Robocop was known to pump lead into perpetrators' private parts, in this version Robocop uses a taser gun to take down most threats. Granted, it's a taser gun that packs enough juice to take down the jolly green giant, but the point is we don't see quite as much blood &amp; guts.Instead of disturbing violence and hard-hitting satire, we get some very interesting political and philosophical spins. The idea of a robot police force is cleverly tied in with military drones and smart-warfare technology that's already in use today. The question being posed is: when we turn this same technology on ourselves (America) to police our own people, suddenly it seems bone-chillingly sick.Another new &amp; interesting spin is the idea that Robocop is the personification of the existentialist debate. Do we have free will? Or is there some governing force that has written out our lives and "choices" already, and we are merely as Shakespeare said, a bunch of actors playing out roles? Robocop 2014 touches on this with the idea that Robo is actually hard-coded to behave as a machine with only the illusion that he has conscious will. THAT was a great philosophical angle which I actually wish the movie had spent another hour exploring. But I guess that would've taxed a lot of viewers' attention spans, so it was kept under the surface. Still it's something to ponder heavily as the movie unfolds.Special effects, action, costumes &amp; gizmos are eye poppingly great. And I don't mean over-the-top cartoonish, either. They're great because the film does a nice job of keeping things real enough to make you think this scenario could actually happen. In the "Behind the scenes" bonus, a point is brought up that the director nixed a bunch of really cool scifi ideas (such as a motorcycle that transforms into a shell around Robo) because he didn't want the viewer to get lost in too much fantasy. The result is more of a straightforward crime drama or even political thriller than it is scifi.The acting. OK, for real, how can anyone fail with Michael Keaton (the first movie Batman) and Gary Oldman (Dracula) and, in a peripheral but awesomely hilarious parody role Samuel L Jackson (Pulp Fiction!) as the rabid fascist foul-mouthed host of a cable "news" show called The Novak Element. Oh gawd, fans of Veerhoven's satirical skewerings will LOVE this character. Relative newcomer Joel Kinnaman (Robo) does a great job, and old Robocop fans might notice some deliberate homages he makes to the original Peter Weller performance such as the way he always turns with his head first, then shoulders, then feet.I also must add a quick note about the music used in this film. There are several great homages to us aging fans with selections such as The Clash "I Fought the Law" and a great shoot-em-up scene that uses "Hocus Pocus" by Focus. And I think that approach sums up what this film is all about. It's not attempting to trample on our memories of the original Robocop, but rather, it acknowledges old fans while presenting something completely different and, in my opinion, worthwhile. Now if someone would only acknowledge my cool parachute pants I be flying high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original "RoboCop", while revered by many, was a dreadful chore to watch. It's an overindulging film that thinks it's saying something about the world we're in, but is too dumb to know better. The message, if there was any, was lost soon after the first limb was shredded. Director Paul Verhoeven has often believed with his films that he's ahead of the curve- I can't deny that his films have been innovative, and even groundbreaking at times, but always for silly reasons. The first "RoboCop" had unprecedented and copious amounts of violence, "Total Recall" left us with a new 'mammary arrangement' as the most memorable scene, and "Basic Instinct" wore out multiple VCRs as a result of one leg-crossing moment. Verhoeven's "cynicism as satire" angle never quite hit, and his "RoboCop" fails as a result. This isn't a review of the 1987 version, however- Jose Padilha's remake is a sleeker, smarter, and overall better film than the predecessor, hitting the marks that the original missed.Joel Kinnaman (TV's "The Killing") is well-cast as Alex Murphy, an undercover detective for the Detroit PD who's hot on the trail of Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow), a known drug lord. Conveniently, Murphy "gets too close" and becomes a target. Vallon and two corrupt officers then plot to eliminate Alex by planting a 'device' in his car- right in front of his home. It's a devious action- for it clearly could have taken out his wife and child (although it does neither, nor does it seen to damage the house).Alex is not so lucky- with burns all over his body and amputated limbs, he has no quality of life. Luckily for him, OmniCorp founder Raymond Sellers (Keaton- remember him?) wants to 'help'. They've been looking to win over public opinion to put their robots in harm's way and not people. Of course, public opinion contends that because robots don't have emotion, they can't operate with the difficult discernment required of soldiers and/or cops. This means they need Alex. With his wife's (Cornish) reluctant permission, Sellers and Dr. Dennett Norton (Oldman, in another film-grounding performance) advance the company's cybernetics technology to merge Alex's conscience with a robot suit, thus making him the world's first 'cyborg'.What could have turned out silly (like the original) is actually given some resonance with this new film. Although we aren't given much screen time with Alex and his family pre-explosion, I loved that the filmmakers decided to flesh out the scenes introducing him as RoboCop. We get glimpses of blood-cleansing and cranial-computer chip fusion that are both difficult to watch but also plausible. Padilha wisely allows these first scenes upon Alex's re-awakening to 'walk' a bit, and it gives the entire process a depth we don't expect from this 'type' of film. It encourages us to explore this whole concept and ask interesting questions, which is what good science-fiction should do.What questions are these, you ask? For beginners, Clara's decision is a would-be first; millions upon millions have had to make end-of- life decisions for their spouses, but she's the first one that has to consider allowing her spouse to become something else- a cyborg. Could we accept our loved ones in a state like RoboCop Alex? Is it really enough just to have someone exist, or do you need all of them, including their personality, to love them? Also, where would the society in "RoboCop" draw the line? Like all technologies, it would likely become more accessible to people, including in the home. Could a dying Fido last longer in a 'RoboDog' apparatus? Should Fido last longer?Intentionally or not, "RoboCop" explored the willingness of our brains to accept outside, or 'robotic' influences. Alex is 'controlled' by OmniCorp, but his brain spends plenty of time trying to override the programming. Is it possible that the electrical and chemical activity in our wildly complex brains would be able to accept another system, or would it continue to stay its' staunchly autonomic self?On top of that, Samuel L. Jackson's fanatic talk-show host of a character throws out words like 'pacify' and 'safe'. These catchy, focus-group tested words, used to encourage viewers, support Sellers and OmniCorp's push to remove government restrictions. Jackson's portrayal may remind you of the various talking head blow-hards on TV now. These personalities are not interested in journalism; instead they push a veiled, business-oriented agenda, which shines through in the character's final screen moments.Do you see what I mean? "RoboCop" is supposed to be a dumb remake of a dumb movie, right? We should never expect to take ideas from this, or think about it at all more than five minutes after the credits roll, right? I suspect the difference this time around involved bright, creative people like Padilha and the writer (writers?) seeing something deeper within the framework of the original film, then deciding to extrapolate. The result is a surprisingly thoughtful, smart, and almost prescient science-fiction movie- not at all a dumb action film. It's the type of film that should be remade- the original is bad, and they made it better. If only all remakes cared to be so thoughtful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a remake or a stand-alone film, RoboCop has the potential to be a great movie, but unfortunately, it just didn't quite take off for me. Where's all the fun and excitement? The action scenes are pleasant enough, but the story, or the characters, are not quite on the same level. The characters, are two-dimensional at best, and the story is just filler. There's not much reason to care about anything that's going on, or anyone, because these people don't exhibit any personality. Just think what this movie could have been had it gone into "Terminator", or even "Death Wish" territory. Or maybe if the film had pushed the envelope, at least. Strange to see Jackie Earle Haley here, cause he doesn't look like an actor who is suited for action roles.** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eventually the hollow superficiality of it all gets tiresome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw that Robocop had been remade (or rebooted maybe?) my feeling was one of apathy. I have seen the original film quite some time ago now and for sure I wondered why they would remake something that is a shade over 25 years old, but I certainly wasn't up in arms as if it was blasphemy ? ultimately it is just another product to be sold and brand recognition is going to give you a good base to your marketing. This is also the reason it appears to have been remade ? because the target audience really isn't anyone over 25 years old.The plot will be familiar to anyone who has seen the original film (and if you haven't, you should) as we have a cop, near death, selected for a program of integrating robot drones with organic (human) material to make it more acceptable to be on the streets of the US as law enforcement. As a basic plot it has lots of opportunity for commentary, color, fun and excitement, because this is what the original had in spades. It starts well and it looks good enough to win me over early on and I did think "this is actually okay" ? for a while. As the film went on, I was surprised by how little of everything there was below the surface. There was no commentary or satire in here, despite it being a massive open goal in terms of relevance today. However, this wasn't as big a problem as the fact that there seemed to be no heart or spark to the film either; the plot felt flat, there was almost no sense of fun to it and for all the gun play, there was really no tension or excitement to it. Ignore the original, even on its own terms as a generic sci-fi action movie, it still didn't work.The effects and the production standards are high as one would expect, but director Padilha really doesn't bring much grit or energy to the film. The focus seems to be all about making a safe product with no rough edges ? and in this regard it achieves its goal, just making it bland as a result. The lead actor fits that mould and Kinnaman doesn't make too much of an impression. This is perhaps not a huge surprise but it is a surprise to find that Oldman, Keaton and Jackson all are pretty much by the numbers too. Keaton in particular is no Ronny Cox and he never convinces. Oldman is at least reliable while Jackson is fun but has too little time and context to make it impact the wider film. Supporting turns from faces such as Jean-Baptiste, Williams and Dexter's Garcia all provide distraction but are not used much beyond that. Haley is a good presence but not given the space to have real teeth.Generally the film is bland and quite dull. It ticks its way through the plot checkboxes without ever really having much in the way impact, fun, thrills, satire or anything really. It is a product designed to sell, primarily off the back of the famous established brand, but also off the fact that there is really nothing in here that would offend any potential customers ? the downside of this is of course that there is really nothing to be excited about either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gets a 1 for neat fx.Subtracted for:No character development, with a long boring training to be Robocop.No dark humor like the original.A lead actor who is white but acts like he is black. I guess it works in The Killing. Not as a brain and cardiovascular.No bad guy.Pg13... it takes itself too seriously. What teenager would enjoy this garbage? I am enjoy more worried that people rated this movie so high with no good reasons.The story is horrible. Why would they bother letting him think he is still Alex when they clearly don't want that. Then they take that away and for some reason emotions ruin robotics?? What retard wrote this?? No neat Robocop voice. No believable emotionless Peter Weller. Did the same guy who wrote the new awful Star Trek movies write the character too? Spock has emotions, Robocop has emotions... wayyy too much. In fact he's a complete whiner.They kept his hand? Why? So he could use Michael Jackson's style in 2028?? Nothing ever happens that's really exciting. Its a whole lot of walking and riding a motorcycle and being propped up on medical equipment. A lot of whining and you never care.After awhile of watching the dialogue no longer matters and all you wanna see is the action. I personally muted it and added my own.The most annoying use of Samuel L Jackson. What a waste!! Everyone in the movie complains in almost every scene.There is nothing else good about this movie except the fx. That's why it bombed and I hope forgotten quickly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a cast! Leave it up to Oldman, Haley and Keaton to drive the story, while letting Robocop do his thing. Joel Kinnaman was simply brilliant in The Killing and after watching this movie, I cannot imagine any actor more suitable for this role.The action sequences are believable and the suit is fantastic. The bike is definitely one above what Judge Dredd had to settle for, and while Dredd was more violent, Robocop is more efficient.The story builds on the present-day concerns over the use of drones in warfare and draws the viewer into the possibility of controlled armed robot soldiers being used to prevent loss of human lives. Though efficient, these machines would be prone to problems such as shooting juveniles.The novel method to counter this issue is arrived at by a defense giant Omnicorp-Put a man inside the suit. From here the movie is predictable, but the sequences and the acting, gave me every bit of that entertainment I could not derive from I Frankenstein.It is a great movie. Definitely worth watching on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robocop remake boring as heck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to add my 2 cents to the mix, this movie sucks. It is so boring I started playing with my phone within 10 minutes. Why does Hollywood keep putting out this crap. This movie has no suspense, like many others have said, there is no villain, Elmer fudd made a better villain. The plot holes are ridiculous. Why take the better parts of the movie and trash them and replace with boring, no nonsense story line. The original had a way better plot and story, this movie is just silly. Part of the story that helped you came about the character was he didn't remember his family, they thought he was dead. Part of the plot was Murphy gaining control through out the movie, it moved the plot along. The evil corporation is not evil, it's boring. Where is the gritty, dirty city that was over run with corruption? Pg13 rating, really, what was the point.</fullReview>

I know it's for money and just in hopes that people recognize the name, but this movie may as well have NOT been about the Robocop we know.But even without comparing it to the original...WHERE IS THE HEART or SUBSTANCE in this movie? Name it. It's nothing different than the other 100 drama/action/comedy films that have some basic evil vs. bad story. Nothing original.Anyways: It is The same old by-the-numbers clich garbage. Laughable script and unoriginal but worst of all: Just boring.How many times are we going to see the same plot devices and laughable clich characters in a movie? And even preaching to us, how about giving us something to actually think about or discuss. Hollywood has only one move these days: Making 1-dimensional characters (innocent good guy, evil for no reason bad guy)-- Wash, rinse, repeat.</fullReview>

You might as well have had Uwe Boll direct this movie as soon as you decided to cripple it with a PG rating and other terrible compromises. There were some reasonable action sequences but on the whole it just didn't flow. It wasn't edgy and therefore will be forgettable. There are a million great unused ideas out there, yet Hollywood seems to be fascinated with trotting out the violated corpses of achievements past because they are just to frightened these days to have an original thought. Strangely, despite "playing it safe" the number of movies that flop seems to be on the rise.</fullReview>

At the end guys Robocop (2014) is an amazing reboot that focuses more on Murphy trying to find his humanity back instead of killing guys and blowing them up i really hope they make a sequel to this film with the same cast.

The original movie is a Cult classic and should have been left alone in my humble opinion. In this Robocop Universe I got the feeling that Robocop wasn't needed as it was for instance in the original movies. In the original version the cops are out maned, out gunned and overburdened with bureaucracy and legal tape to fight crime. In this I agree the special effects are awesome but the plot in lacking something substantial in the script. The were so many wasted opportunities in this movie and the right actors were playing the wrong parts. I think they concentrated too much on the special effects that they forgot about telling us a good story .</fullReview>

Nevertheless, I had absolutely no intentions to see the remakes of Godzilla or RoboCop. I personally thought the originals were just fine. But I guess therein, my friend, lies the problem."Just fine" isn't good enough. Still haven't seen the new Godzilla though, but what did I think of the new RoboCop? Can't fault it. Not at all - I'd be lying. The whole team was really on top of things: from the set designs, story lines, cinematography, direction, everything! Every bit of it was well thought out and beautifully executed. This is definitely one I'll be seeing more times than one should see any given movie, and I'll definitely be studying it very closely.But even with that being said, I really hope there isn't a sequel waiting to peer over the horizon.

		<fullReview>When it came out in 1987, RoboCop was quite an event... I watched the original series and liked it a lot, except for the fact that it contained unnecessary graphic violence, and it was somehow dark... Then came the new remake of RoboCop (2014), and I didn't watch it in the movies because it originally had somehow low reviews... But then I got it on Blu-ray and watched it... Amazingly, this movie was so good I wondered whether in our days a movie has to be R-rated for violence to take high ratings... as far as I'm concerned, this film was able to convey the whole idea and action without much blood-splattering and limb-cutting... I was comfortable and yet thrilled while watching it... I was even able to relate to the present Alex Murphy turned half-machine than the past one... The story line is quite good also, and I'm not discussing any details here. I just wanted to relate my experience in watching the new RoboCop, and I hope we're going to see a sequel related to this series. Yes, this film was quite underrated as far as I'm concerned.</fullReview>

Not to mention the technological advancements that made this version a much better visual treat. It's not just a shoot em up action flick but also an emotional film that shows much more of Robocop's family than we ever knew before. Gary Oldman was fantastic and Joel Kinnaman held his own as the half man half machine Robocop. While it may seem to start off a little slow the second half of the movie rocks and the last 20 minutes is an adrenaline rush with terrific action. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and look forward to another installment of this version of Robocop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very inferior compared to the original 1987 classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Robocop which was released in 1987 is still a classic movie and still remains as one of my top 10 favourite movies of all time. It's sequel Robocop 2 was good but not great, but the spirit of the original movie was sorely lacking. Robocop 3 was an absolute insult, which reduced the movie from an R rated ultra violent film to a children's movie fitting for 10 year olds. Although the 2014 remake of Robocop resurrected the franchise with promising results, ultimately the end result was very mediocre and inferior.Joel Kinnaman takes over from Peter Weller and Robert John Burke as Alex Murphy/Robocop. In this 2014 version, Alex Murphy appears to be more of a maverick, hard edged cop compared to Peter Weller's version who was more of an ordinary, honest, hard working, and idealistic police officer. Michael Kenneth Williams (The Wire, Boardwalk Empire) is Murphy's partner Jack Lewis (this time Murphy's partner is a male compared to his previous partner Anne Lewis who was portrayed by Nancy Allen). After Murphy is critically injured following a car bomb blast, OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) tasks his team, including lead scientist Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) to create of a product which combines man and machine for civilian law enforcement purposes following their success with providing mechanized models for the US Military. Murphy's wife Clara Murphy (Abbie Cornish) also gives consent for her critically injured husband to be kept alive via the new creation to be known as RoboCop.Compared to the previous Robocop movies in which he is more bulky and robotic, this version of RoboCop is more sleek, agile, and lethal. Crime and corruption is still rife in Detroit, and unlike the previous movies, Omni Consumer Products runs the Detroit Police Department as well as supplies military style products whereas in the 2014 remake, OmniCorp has successfully supplied the military with their products but has unable to successfully sell their products to the civilian market. Corruption is still present in both corporations, in particular both CEO's (Ronny Cox's Dick Jones and Michael Keaton's Raymond Sellars) are immoral. Also it was good to see the ED-209 resurrected for the 2014 remake from the previous movies.While I had no problems with the cast (Joel Kinnaman, Michael Kenneth Williams, Michael Keaton, Gary Oldman, Jackie Earle Haley, Abbie Cornish and Samuel L. Jackson), the story itself was far too sentimental. RoboCop could have cut away the soppy drama, and concentrated more on the sci-fi action. Robocop is meant to be a movie that shows Alex Murphy/Robocop kicking butt and taking names. That's what I didn't like about this version of RoboCop. Much of the satirical humour was sorely missed (the News reports which were true to life, the satirical ads, and dark humour also strongly influenced by the Reagan-era politics). That's what made the original 1987 version of Robocop so popular, was the satirical humour that was also introduced by Paul Verhoeven. Also, a central villain such as Kurtwood Smith's Clarence Boddicker was sorely lacking. Patrick Garrow's Antoine Vallon was a poor substitute and later Jackie Earle Haley's Rick Mattox was nothing special.RoboCop certainly could have been a LOT better. I felt very disappointed with the inferior remake. It certainly doesn't hold a candle to the 1987 original classic. At least the 2014 remake of RoboCop was better than Robocop 3.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright. No one wanted a remake of the 1987 original, but you know what? It happened and it wasn't a total disaster. In my opinion, it made some improvement over the original. Gory , R-Rating? Non- existent in the 2014 remake. The Verhoeven signature violence isn't what always makes a good movie.I liked the 1987 Robocop. But after watching it a couple of times. It's really just an action movie with little bits of political/social satire as well as some character development of Alex Murphy. In the 2014 remake, the screenwriter clearly wanted to explore the idea of putting a man in a machine. If you paid attention to the dialogue between the scientists and executives of OmniCorp, they were talking about some important stuff about human consciousness and the difference between a human and a robot. There's also satire in the movie as well. We get a few scenes of Samuel L. Jackson playing the host of a talk show called The Novak Element which seems to have a Pro-Robot bias, favoring the OmniCorp CEO than the anti-machine politicians. The political satire vexed into the script made me think about now. How Americans are against the use of drones and surveillance technology in our home but are okay when used abroad to look for terrorist. It does raise questions on using advanced technology to stop crime. The remake definitely made Robocop a little more relevant today.Robocop 2014 is not a perfect film though. There are a couple of downsides. I felt that there were not a lot of scenes of the bad guy that almost killed Murphy. We don't know too much about him but he was part of a conspiracy. I also thought they should have developed the character of Alex Murphy a little more.So let me get this straight. We don't want remakes of old films that were considered good. But hey, this one did it's best. Robocop 2014 is much better than the Total Recall 2012 remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First up, I have to admit, although this is a Remake of a very well known 80s movie (one I like very much), I was still somewhat excited to watch this. And it all came down to the director. If you haven't seen his "Tropa de Elite" movies (both of them, in the right order, because they do build up), then please do so.Now after watching it, I wasn't too sure. I was hoping to see something different I think. But the more I thought about the movie and even though he had to make it a PG-13 movie (still hoping there will be an extended cut), the themes are there. It's not a Jesus analogy anymore, but the movie does acknowledge the Paul Verhoeven classic. We still get more than a few new notions. Samuell L. Jacksons "news" reporter being one of them. The biggest propaganda since ... well another "news" channel in America that tells us it is fair and balanced (even if wasn't meant as a direct assault on that station, it's easy to make that comparison, because it's true).You also get Michael Keaton in superb form, having as much fun as he can. Gary Oldman gives his best too, though I guess some will have some issues with the main actor. It would be unfair to do so, but you could see their point. Whatever the case, this is not a waste of time, even if you know the original. Though I doubt you will find it better if you do know it</fullReview>

The raving about the original made me watch this revamp when it came out on Netflix in the same year of release.I found this film to be a high budget movie with a script that doesn't really have as much depth as I'm sure the original has. As a newbie, I was somewhat confused why the doctor acted by Gary Oldman was so sympathetic, why they had to choose a 'disabled person' to enter the robot and the reasoning behind the anger portrayed toward the end of the film for Robocop. Yes, I understand there was some sort of dark behind the books work by the cops to get the character to be Robocop, but this storyline just falls a bit flat for me. Overall, I was left somewhat confused by this film. The storyline was too much on a whim and didn't offer the depth I'd expect from such a big name. Entertaining none the less, the big budget Robocop gets a 7 from me.</fullReview>

The new look for Robocop is really cool as it looks futuristic.. This film has a lot of action and outstanding scenes where he opens fire at will to those that do harm... You do not need to be funny to make a great movie...It was good to see Michael Keaton back in the screen again... Same thing cam be said for Jackie Haley.. Most people know Michael from Mr Mom and Jackie from Bad News Bears In Breaking Training... it is good seeing these 2 really showing what they can do outside of their known classics..Samuel L Jackson is perfect for the role as the host of that news show..

This "reboot" is a very entertaining movie on its own. It feels like a more "grown up" version of the original film. The original ROBOCOP was very much like a comic book hero kind of movie made for adults: pitch black humor, over the top violence, clearly defined characters (good and bad guys)and a very fast paced story, even by today's standards. This one takes more time to introduce the characters, their motives. It's a bit more "thought out", which is nice, but it renders the film at a slower moving pace. The pitch black humor and the gory violence are gone. There's little blood in this new ROBOCOP; the gore and violence are more implied than shoved in tour face like the first one. The good and bad guys are more difficult to discern this time around. They're not as clearly cut as on the 1st one. Alex Murphy's story is more "humane" this time and not as violent and tragic as in the 1987 original. The FX are superb, one of the few areas a movie can beg to be remade. I was glad to hear the ROBO theme by late composer Basil Poledouris incorporated in the film and I think it shows the filmmaker's respect for the original Paul Verhoeven classic, but other than that, the music score passes by without being memorable at all. The acting is more grounded this time, since it tries to be more serious. Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton were really great in their flawed characters.All in all, ROBOCOP is a nice reboot. It's not as extreme as the original and this time it also plays like a drama. When the action hits it's well done but it's sparse, yet it serves its purpose well. I guess it's OK to reboot a franchise after more than 25 years, unlike the uncalled for reboot of SPIDERMAN. I have no plans to see that (yet)!What can I tell fans of the original? I'm one of them, and a huge one at that. I can tell them that I really enjoyed ROBOCOP 2014 but I take it like all those re-recorded heavy metal albums: an interesting version, but I'll stick with the original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>doesn't deserve a TEN, but..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK giving it a 10 is pushing it, but i cant understand why people are hating this movie just because it is not similar to the 1987 RoboCop.it wasn't violent enough, it was a lot of CGI, his suit is lighter and BLACK, the lack of a proper villain, ED-209 being a useless piece of equipment etc etc. well i do agree with the last point but other than that there is nothing wrong with the movie. The lack of a proper villain is blurs the line between good and evil and it adds to the already confused persona of RoboCop, CGI was decent and didn't look extremely far fetched which is again not a bad thing. As for the movie not being violent enough, i guess i was expecting more from a Jose Padilha but it isn't as bad.its a decent action flick deserving a 6.5 - 7 My 10 rating is just a result of all unreasonable 1's and 2's in the reviews</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining, Moving and Daring Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people who trash this movie hate it for the following reasons 1. Franchise fan boys Very Upset things are not done their way.2. Not enough blood spilled. Angry children crying in protest.3. How dare Weller criticizes Unmanned War Machines. Might makes right. Suck it up.4. Joel Kinnaman is simply too hot to handle. Beta boys cannot take it.But most people I know enjoyed this movie because 1. We are not fan boys or girls. We just want to watch a good movie.2. No angry-vampire-feeding with excessive blood spilling. Just pure adrenaline-pumping action and rush.3. Sane people understand the urgency of facing up to the Unmanned War Machines Situation we've been trained to avoid.4. Joel Kinnaman is hot alright, but also one emotionally DEEP actor.10 out of 10 for entertainment value, and public education value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic. this should be the beginning of the franchise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best of the franchise by a long shot. Joel Kinnaman is an amazing actor and brings such emotion to the role of this film. This should really be the beginning of this franchise. the first movie was a cult classic and had all the humor, and great action for the time it was released , but there is no comparison to what the new release brings to the table. Robocop the original set a bar for being the most violent and shocking movie of that time. this new start is so much more. There is real human emotion involved and the action is still there in spades. No need for the shock value of the first. this one has it all. This guy is perfect for the role and i hope they continue the franchise from here with some good writing. I will buy every one. Haters gonna hate,but they are WRONG on this one. Simon</fullReview>

Just liked the special effects ,the colors and lights. And also I liked Garry Oldman, but this movie, phew, pity! I hope I could see better movies of him.

		<shortDescription>OK not as good as the original, but still a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was sceptical about going to see this film. There are far too many remakes and majority of the time they are dreadful (Total Recall for one). Actually I was quite impressed with this film. OK it is a bit slow at the beginning but after about 30 minutes it takes off and doesn't stop. Their is plenty of decent action and the story isn't too bad neither.Samuel L Jackson is fantastic. Although he doesn't have much screen time, he certainly steals the show. Gary Oldman is also brilliant and Michael Keaton is pretty good. Joel Kinnerman who plays Murphy/ Robocop isn't nothing special (anybody could have played that part. (Weller was the best at playing Robocop end off!(OK so it's not as good as the original. However if this wasn't a remake it would be a very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, ignore the haters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in to see this movie with low expectations but in the end, I was pleasantly surprised, as it outdoes the original in certain material aspects. Regardless, some viewers will exhibit strong resentment towards it, seeing its inherently 'flawed' conception as a remake, as a fatal handicap, warranting that they casually write it off for that reason alone. Another set of viewers would expectedly come from a place where they would tend to take this sort of movie way too seriously and will, understandably, view it as being incredulously stupid and vapid. The truth though, is that the 1987 Robocop was never a serious movie, there was always a comedic campiness about it, laced with huge doses of gratuitous violence thrown in the mix. This quality accounts for its endearing and enduring allure, and the movie has therefore attained a well deserved cult following status; and there are no apologies for this.This 2014 incarnation similarly delivers on these qualities, and much more. It gives us welcome the bonus of attempting a believable back story for the Robocop franchise, a service many remakes seem to be designed for. The action scenes as well as the art production, were more than adequate, the cast was organic and delivered superb performances, the movie was well paced, and the overall theme was cleverly adapted to reflect modern current political sensibilities. The production team deftly handled the nuanced idea of the place of robots in modern society. The movie also explored the role of news anchors in tomorrow's world, seeing how much license journalists wield in todays world, somewhat recalling the back and forth diatribes of the likes of Hannity, or Jon Stewert with a bit of Fallon thrown in. The plot explored the medical dilemma that could arise regarding multiple bionic appendages, thereby asking a very important question: At what point does a man become, arguably, a machine? Is it an 'It' or a 'He', eliciting a tacit homage to Tinman from The Wizard of Oz, asking this question: Does it have a heart? The movie also covers the validity of the exercise of power over life and death: Being that you consider a bionic robot your asset, can you simply kill him, or switch him off? Another question this movie explores is the future of privacy laws in general.I remember watching a promotional interview given by Peter Weller (a legend), comparing the role of Robocop to that of Gort (The Day The Earth Stood Still), basically asking the question: Can the world, innately corrupt as it is, handle the full, one glove fits all, authority of a super quasi omniscient cop? I also appreciate that this movie attempts an age old theme in that it locates the resilience of the human spirit, to overcome pervasive, manipulative chemical and electrical activity on the brain, thereby recalling the themes explored in Johnny Mnemonic and The Matrix. These are smart things added to a movie which would ordinarily have survived on campiness and violence alone, as did the earlier version. This movie, a stellar cast, great visuals and sound, and brilliant but not overdone CGI, actually works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of Course You're Gonna Compare It To The Original....But.....It's Not Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was part of the generation who remembers those 80s movies that are becoming re-made, re-fashioned, and re-booted. There was no need to remake Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, or Friday The !3th. So, I was skeptical and had my mind made up to skip this movie because the original is already a good movie. I'm glad I didn't skip this one because it does something rare you don't really see in movies, it actually entertains and keeps your attention. The story is the same, a cop is shot and left for dead, then rebuilt into a cyborg law man. I found this to actually stand on it's own two feet with some clever special effects and action. Joe Kinnaman makes Robocop human and his performance is compatible to Peter Weller. In my opinion, had there not been an original film made in 1987, this movie would be okay on it's own. There are some pokes at today's politicians, American credit, and consumerism too. This was a fun ride of a movie and before you judge a book by it's cover, you might be surprised at your self for liking this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprised by how much I enjoyed this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not going to lie, when I saw the first teaser I wanted to hate this movie. The original is just such a classic. One of the few movies from the 80's I can still watch and genuinely enjoy without relying on nostalgia.That said, I really enjoyed this remake. While I love everything about the first one; the effects, the one liners, the violence,and the campiness, I didn't find myself comparing the new one to the old one when I watched it. In my opinion, the new additions to the story really help make it more of a complete story, one based closer to our current reality than the original movie was. Nothing felt forced and there was a much better explanation for why everything was happening and certain key players motivations.It's definitely not the fun campy movie it once was, but it throws out a few fun nods to the classic. I found this movie to have more heart, and for a man to truly control his robot side I think still having a soul defines his humanity.The action was top notch. Most of the CGI looked very natural, and the fight scenes were intense. I really liked what they did with his suit this time around. I know on these boards a lot of people have said they missed how Robocop moved in the original, saying it seemed more robotic, I would say they have very outdated ideas of how robots function these days. I personally work for an engineering company that specializes in motion control systems, and have taken Uni level robotics courses. In my opinion they did a fantastic job with making Robocop walk and function like a modern day robot/machine. There was a certain mechanical fluidity that just looked right.I wouldn't go in expecting the old Robocop, but I found this new Robocop to be one the most enjoyable action movies I've seen in a while. I look forward to a possible sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 Reasons Why This Remake Tops Its Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1)In the 1987 flick, only Clarence the bad guy knew the first thing about Detroit (he never missed a Tigers' game). In the new and improved ROBOCOP, title character Alex Murphy and his son David are fervent Red Wings fans (like most "Hockey Town" residents). 2)The remake has many exteriors shot in Detroit, USA. The original Dutch director shot 99.9% of his flick in foreign lands. To paraphrase Psalms, "a minute in Michigan is worth two hours in Canada." 3)Murphy's chick partner from 1987 "didn't know Jack" about saving Alex, the way his current partner Jack has his back now. 4)Murphy's wife "moves on" to new guys ASAP in director Paul Verhoeven's outing; she's loyal no matter what may come in director Jose Padilha's improved offering. 5)This ROBOCOP has a nifty ROBOBIKE. 6)This ROBOCOP can FLY when he needs to. 7)This ROBOCOP has more outfits. 8)Samuel L. Jackson goes from SNAKES ON A PLANE to snakes in his brain here, which is very entertaining to watch. 9)Though Michigan's current governor, famous for being "Omni Corp.'s Nerd in Lansing," pushed Padilha to Toronto's bigger tax break, Padilha plasters the 2014 film with Red Wing decals and Michigan state flags. 10)The new ROBOCOP has far more heroes, particularly feisty scientist Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless Forgettable Hollywood Cannon Fodder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried to watch this on 3 separate occasions and fell asleep each time - and, being a big sci fi / film fan, that's a very rare occurrence.This film lacks any of the raw impact of the original, there is no character development and no Detroit violence as in the original. In fact, "Robocop" spends most of the time shooting people with a tazer gun in this bloodless, non violent version, dumbed down for our (un)reality TV generation.There is no crime in this film, no policing, no criminal acts. If you watch the trailer there is stock footage of riots etc, even this isn't in the film.Michael Keaton plays the corrupt corporate CEO but comes across more like a happy Steve Jobs. There is very little screen time given to anyone but the key cast members. In the original Robocop films they really developed every character from the corrupt detectives (which in this film might receive a total 3 minutes if that), to the fellow police officers, even the background actors like the baseball team that ransacks the tech store. But here all focus is on the primary 3-4 characters - it's like Enders Game with a few more extras.The story and writing are weak. Murphys female partner Lewis has been replaced with by a man - but it's OK, they made sure Lewis remained a "minority" by using a black guy. Again, Lewis gets little screen time and there is no obvious bond between Lewis and Murphy.Perhaps in some kind of poor homage to Paul Verhoven, Samuel L Jackson appears as some strange TV presenter or... youtube channel maker or... I don't know what he's supposed to be. He stands in front of a CG talking at us, reminiscent of the TV spots in Starship Troopers.As for Robocop himself. He's not. You spend half the time watching him as a man in a suit - much like Iron Man and the other half releasing that he's just a head on robot body... oh, plus a hand, they kept his head and just one random detached hand, that doesn't have a glove, for some reason.In summary, this is just another Hollywood money grabber that will win no awards, no cult status and no appreciation through the annals of film.Where Robocop 1987 built a film on morals, ideas, social fears, and a story, Robocop 2014 was built merely as a quick buck for Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 1980s RoboCop was more bleak and devious, this suffers from too much PC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe this goes into the pile of "not so bad, but could have been great" remakes. Much of this could have been settled in the editing room for me, story second, as the story was there - why move so fr from it? There was too much PC and government, not enough deviousness and big business.The main problem I had is with the addition of the 'family' story line, as it is an "always used" device in films to "get the women" interested in a film, which tells me this production thinks little of women and their advancement even 26 years later. In the 80s version, I loved seeing women fight right along side of men (Murphy's partner in the 80s version vs. Murphy's partner in this one), equal to men, not dragging their children around sobbing about their husbands, etc. That was a downer for me.They could have ditched the sappy family line story, and they should have left in the heartbreaking one where his wife and family didn't know, that this took so long that the family was gone when Murphy started recalling his human side. More importantly, that began to show the human side was "still" there for Murphy. Murphy had NO idea what they did to him, did not authorize it, and that made the story even more sad and horrific.Another storyline in the 80s version that I thought should have stayed, the New Detroit police department was not liking a "Robocop" and had to "warm up" to the idea. They never really did, but the animosity towards this 'machine against the human' police force was an underlying current that helped drive the film back then. RoboCop was a cop and they were cops in a violent society and they knew they were all there for the common good. The problem was not with the police department and never should have been.This one 'threw in' the family of Murphy and the force knowing and that dragged down all the better updated elements of this film which happened to be in the update of politics vs. humanity. The film was much kinder to the greed and money aspect of why there was a RoboCop. In the 80s version the mash-up of big business-corporation (employees vs board of directors)-money-reed-street hustlers all becoming one is not very apparent in this version. The 80s version mash-up of all of this was the villain(s). This one was all over the place trying to make a villain (A weak attempt with Washington politics, RoboCop technology makers, police department) but never connecting it like the 80s one did.The 80s RoboCop really focused on greed, senseless violence and had one heck of an ideal of a bleak future of gangs and street gang leaders working with Corporate business America in "New Detroit". RoboCop was no longer in question, but a need.This, while a good effort in technology and CGI, (and the warehouse scene looking just like a FPS video game) was more milquetoast -- like the studio was "scared" for this to be even more bleak and violent, put women as equals, and underhanded as the original. The elements of change were there, and it should have been presented.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is much better than the trailer makes you expect. The story really is well made and realistic. The film shows the problem that companies (like now Google)can become very powerful and develop a danger to the democratic system. The reason is the financial interest of such companies: They have no human/emotional interest. Thats why people should always remember not to believe everything which is advertised and shouldn't give them to much power/control. On the other side I like the fact, that robots aren't the leaders in this movie. People in America still prioritize real humans for important jobs (police,...). Of course its kinda boring that this movie is a typical American movie. Why wasn't it made in Russia or Europe?At first the film seems to be a very basic and simple super hero thing, but then you realize its content ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robocop is now the remake of the first classic movie that we all remember since we were kids or young ones, i have to say that i liked a lot the idea of robocop in the past but i though the movie could be better having an incredible core concept but bad developed that was like 10 years ago.Now watching the new remake i can vastly recommend it. Robocop contain the same core idea of the first one but with a more developed sci fi world and technology also for the hardcore fans the humor and many elements had been conserved for good like the unpleasant news reporter now portrayed by samuel.l jackson which add some humor to the movie, the politics also play a role in the story and though they're not full developed they acomplish their job portraying corrupt politics, cops and bussinesman in this beautiful sci fi world.The remake is basically an action movie and it contains plenty of shootouts, explosions and combat that make the viewer feel tense in every battle that robocop is into.The story is impressive at the beginning and in the middle of the movie, it describes very well how traumatic feels to not have a body of its own, and the pain the family has to endure, the director achieves that by having an arrange of impressive visual effects, descent acting (except for that retard kid son of robocop) and screen play, it makes you feel sad and in the shoes of the poor alex murphy; the middle part gives the viewer a real taste of robocop power filled with tense, fast and thrilling shootouts around the city with also unveiling the conspirational and dark plot planned since the beginning of the movie.However the only bad point i see in the movie is the epilogue which transition feel to fast from the middle part of the movie the epilogue its disappointing, simple and bad developed with no real main villain or giving them a disappointing ending,that give us the feeling that the movie needed more time to finish the ending.Honestly i hope there is a sequel :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having not seen the original 80's version, I can't say the 2014 remake is better or worse than it's predecessor. However I will say that the new film brings an interesting and emotional take on a concept, that in the 80's would have been pure science fiction. Yet in 2014, is certainly a possibility with advancements in prosthesis and the ever increasing impact from drones in today's military. At the very least I found myself questioning whether or not I would feel more safe or threatened by a RoboCop patrolling the streets. As for the film Itself I found it very slow for the first 45 minutes with very little action aside from training simulations. The film did certainly pick up the pace in the second half of the film, with RoboCop quickly racking up arrests. Yet still I was left wanting more excitement with a adversary who could challenge RoboCop. Spoilers, My hopes were then answered in the final half hour of the film during the infiltration of OmniCorp in which our protagonist goes toe to toes with multiple militarised drones and seemed to be in genuine danger as he fought his way to the rooftop. All in all I felt despite the slow start and lack of worthy opponents, RoboCop was a well balances film, not only between man and machine but also with the tone of the film. With well timed comedic scenes from Samuel L. Jackson and a genuinely moving performance by Gary Oldman. This film also managed to leave me thinking and discussing about the concept for over an hour after seeing it, which is not a common occurrence.If only for this reason, I would certainly recommend people to this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake or new film with the same lead character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am always wary of remakes of classic films but at the same time try and keep a clear mind in that just one day they might get it right.I question if this is actually remake of Robocop or a new film with Robocop as our lead. Are there comparisons, well there is Murphy (Robocop) , Lewis (now male) and the bad guy. The role of the owner of the business is much different to that of the original.The storyline is excellent and the transformation of Murphy to Robocop is explored much more deeply than in the original, however (and this is not a spoiler) you can guess which bit will be included in the conclusion. The emotional transformations are excellent as Robocop evolves . The scenes where the action kick in have kept the violence levels down compared to the original , which still has one of the best scenes ever with our melting man, but I still think this film has been lucky to achieve a 12a . A good watch , is it better than the original said my 12 year old ? Genuinely I don't know , the original is great as it set the benchmark, this new version has more modern special effects and the telling of the story is better. Whatever watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's so much going on with the new Robocop movie I don't even know where to begin! I am really excited right now the movie was a tremendous success in my perception. To my surprise I really am thoroughly satisfied by what was presented in the film. After watching the trailers for the film I wasn't sure if the remake would become a hit or bomb. In actuality I had major concerns as well as many other people I had heard from, but when it came time to deliver they knocked it out of the park! (for more cool reviews and content please visit thefunnynerd.com)I had a major bias coming in to watch the movie Jose Padilha is by far one of my favorite directors and as expected he did a tremendous job. This new remake is so much superior than the previous bloodbaths Robocops that I shouldn't have even mentioned them in this post, but here it went anyway. There's definitely a great deal of action throughout the movie, good battle scenes, a great deal of gunfire, and exceptional computer graphics' work for the machines, and weapons. In its entirety the robots where remarkably well designed. The best aspect of the movie though, is not the action. There are great philosophical questions played with through the whole movie, there are ethical dilemmas that surface, religious, spiritual, and scientific issues being touched upon the whole time; but everything in such a subtle tone that it engages the audience and brings the movie to a whole new level. Padilha is well known for his portrayals of current issues regarding politics, corruption, and money in his movies. This time it wasn't different and you can see his deft hands at work as one is experiencing the film. The characters are well presented and developed which is an incredible accomplishment being that it's a standalone movie that 's not leading up to its next continuous installment. One is able to engage the characters, empathize with their situation and with more than a smidgen of suspension of reality believe the scientific feats observed in the film. I was able to glimpse the issues through the characters frame of mind and reference. One is able to comprehend the situations brought to surface, and accept the resolution for the conflicts. All while being constantly left to think about a moral, philosophical, or ethical issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'ROBOCOP': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Remake of the 1987 classic science fiction film directed by Paul Verhoeven (which spawned 2 sequels, a TV series, cartoons, comics, toys and other merchandise). This reboot to the franchise was directed by Jos Padilha (who's already directed some popular and violent Brazilian cop movies) and written by first time film writer Joshua Zetumer. It stars Joel Kinnaman in the title role and co-stars Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson, Jackie Earle Haley, Abbie Cornish, Michael K. Williams and Jay Baruchel. It's set in future Detroit and has the multinational conglomerate OmniCorp turning injured police officer Alex Murphy into a part-man/part-machine weapon of the law (once again). The studios are hoping it will revitalize the dormant franchise and lead to many more sequels. While I don't think it's nearly as classic as the original sci-fi masterpiece it's still a pretty good updated reboot.The movie begins in 2028 when OmniCorp is revolutionizing the world by providing the US military with super-efficient robot soldiers. They're used overseas but a law (passed by Congress), called the Dreyfus Act (which is backed by a wide majority of the public) prevents these mechanical weapons from being used on US soil. There's nothing the CEO of OminCorp, Raymond Sellars (Keaton), would like more than to expand his business into law enforcement. So he comes up with a plan of making a half-man/half-robot police officer that will bypass the law and win over public opinion (on the idea of mechanical police officers). Sellars convinces his top scientist, Dr. Dennett Norton (Oldman), to go to work on the idea. They find the perfect specimen (for their science project) in Officer Alex Murphy (Kinnaman) when he's nearly blown to pieces by crooked cops, working for crime lord Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow). The project becomes much more difficult than Sellars or Norton expected when Murphy refuses to give up his humanity and become the perfect machine/weapon they want him to be.The film ditches most of the dark humor and dry wit that fans have grown to love about the original movie in exchange for real-life politics (or at least something very similar to them). While the body count is extremely high it does tone down the blood and gore (like the third film in the series did as well) in order to get a more bankable PG-13 rating. Don't let that fool you, it's not a kids' flick; it's definitely an adult film that's hard to watch and is pretty disturbing at times. I do miss the distasteful jokes and graphic violence that made the first movie so unique (at the time) but I also enjoy seeing the new direction this installment is taking with the series. While part of me just wanted to see the original 'ROBOCOP' again (which is one of my all time favorite films) another part of me really enjoyed seeing something completely different too (and if I want to see the original again I can just watch the original movie). The social commentary and politics are great and a much more detailed (and realistic) origins story is interesting to see as well. I love the performances of all of the cast in it; especially Keaton (and this might be his best performance since 'BEETLEJUICE'). The one exception in the cast is Kinnaman; who's OK in the lead but he's no Peter Weller and a better actor could have possibly turned the movie into a five star film! Padilha is a great director for this material though and Zetumer's script (while flawed in minor ways) is brilliant. It's a near masterpiece that doesn't quite live up to Verhoeven's classic but it beats the hell out of 'ROBOCOP 3' and I look forward to more chapters in the series!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny7Y7pgmZpA</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointed. The same feeling that made &#x200b;&#x200b;me feel Great Gatsby , and Ender's game , produced me Robocop . It's amazing, to see how producers flushed down the toilet millions. There are hundreds of young filmmakers who would like to obtain a fraction of the budgets of these movies for a chance to make a film work and not get support.While the film remained at the level of the police that Murphy was missing an eye , part of an arm and a leg after the explosion , the film maintained an acceptable level of tolerance. But then, they jumped to a scene where Murphy presented where what little remains of his face and a hand, miraculously preserved without the body. Since then the script seemed to be written by someone else.Robocop is the kind of movie that can wait patiently until it comes out on DVD and rent it if there is nothing better in the Red Box . Excepting for a few action scenes the movie does not return the money to the viewer. I do not recommend spending money to see it in film, wait for it on a rental. I gave 4 stars out of 10, because some of the effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly disappointing remake of Robocop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid of the 80's I grew up with the awesome movie that was Robocop. Part man, part machine and all police officer. I still remember that harrowing scene where Alex Murphy gets decimated by criminals leading up to him becoming Robocop. That movie was grittier with a bleak look into out future.Cue Robocop 2014 and as every minute of the movie ticked by I wished it would get better or just end. Make no mistake, there was no expense spared on its A-list cast and huge budget for CGI and action shots however, the heart of the story was totally out of whackFor the first bit of the movie you get a sense they were trying to relay a message to the audience about violence which I didn't get. Then they spend an eternity trying to make you bond emotionally with Alex Murphy and his family but it takes too long and you loose interest.Whether is a remake or a reboot it falls way short of what it should have been. Throughout the entire movie I was constantly saying to myself "That's wrong", "Why they do it like that", "That doesn't make sense".I left the cinema wishing I hadn't seen this movie. But then that's just my opinion</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robocop Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robocop(2014) Starring:Joel,Killnman,Gary Oldman,Michael Keaton,Abbie Cornish,and Jay Burchael. Directed By: Jos Padilha Review Movie dead or alive your coming with me,but I prefer dead. So Robocop a movie that was utterly remade for absolutely no reason other then to make a couple hundred bucks. I have never seen the original but just the name of the character Robocop sounds fascinating. So basically you've got detective Alex Murphy who is this honest cop in this normal clich area that doesn't like honest cops for some reason.What grinds my gutters the most is when scifi films like this use to have atmosphere and other-worldly sense to them,none of this now tiring and annoying trend of realism. Realism isn't a bad thing but when your reintroducing a nostalgic icon like Robocop,batman,or even the freaking ninja turtles you have to step up your game and get creative with the worlds they inhabit. Cause I do not want to see a character named Robocop in freaking suburbia! This is not atmosphere,this is not an environment people see Robocop inhabit,this is pure laziness! This is lame,this is a freaking Joke! Have some dang passion! Anyway being the honest cop that he is Alex Murphy is blown by a car bomb. But lucky for him Dr.Norton and Raymond Sellars are developing a procedure that could potentially save his life.Later Alex Murphy becomes Robocop and after forty five minutes actually starts to do things relevant the plot. Now let's talk about the good even though there isn't much. Joel KIllnman is a stellar choice for Robocop, Keaton is incredible good in some scenes but in others he can become incredibly generic because the script really doesn't know what to do with him half the time.Gary Oldman does a good job as playing Dr.Norton who creates the Robocop suit to bring Murphy back from the dead and the scnes with him Killnman and Keaton he has chemistry between them drawing the line between him being a protagonist or antagonist even though you can already guess he's going to be a protagonist, which takes away the mystery. And the pacing feels a little nice. Now let's get on the bad side,I did like the idea of his family being in the movie but they come as plot devices instead of characters.It was like they said hey let's add a family for this character so we can act like we have an emotional attachment to this character when in reality we have no idea what were going to do with them.They weren't bad they were just really cheap.The action scenes are completely hit and miss,this film has action scenes are action scenes that bring nothing new to the table,it's every generic action scene you have seen a million times before. Nothing of it stands out. For example there is a scene that is completely shot in the dark so we can't see a dang thing. Kind of like that scene in Alone in the dark where the monsters are coming to attack and everyone comes in shooting in the dark and we can't tell what there shooting at. It could have worked for this film but just doesn't if you factor in that Murphy's suit is entirely black! I don't hate this movie but I don't like it that much either and trust me you won't either.It has a decent pace,good performances and some entertaining although unimaginative action scenes. I'm giving this new Robocop a two and a half out of five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never seen any of the previous movies or TV series and known the bare essentials about the character, but I did enjoy this movie.I've seen Joel Kinnaman in The Killing and his character annoyed the absolute crap out of me, so much that it was part of the reason I stopped watching the show, but I thought he was really good for the role both with and without his face covered. I really liked the futuristic look of 2028 mainly because it's a future that you could see happening rather than the writers trying to over-do it by shoving the fact that it's the future in your face in every scene.It has an amazing cast, awesome fx and a really good story. Worth a watch, maybe even more than once and would probably be something I would buy on day one.</fullReview>

The major hole in this movie is Robocop's back story. The movie is about a man that is being stripped of his emotion, yet the director does little to establish why he is connected to his family. Overall it is a good rainy day watch. I would watch a sequel if it came out. I do not agree with the harsh reviews I read on this site.

		<shortDescription>New age RoboCop for the new millennium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay; RoboCop was a pretty popular movie when I was younger; it represented the best cyberpunk had to offer out of the 80s and then some. I mean, who wouldn't want a robot cop protecting them? One movie answers that question after a horrific murder consumes one of the cops on the police force and otherwise gets rebuilt into such a protector. The movie spawned two more movies and I believe an animated series.Fast forward nearly thirty years and it gets a reboot. This time cyberpunk that is associated with futuristic technology and holographic displays appears before us; the movie follows a similar feel and theme. The movie has little to do with pop culture, but rather decides to set the feel and pacing with recent events in Iraq and Afghanistan. The movie escalates a fantasy world in the form of robotic police enforcement around the world except in the US; one corporation, Omnicorp, wants to bring these robots to US soil and a law is preventing them from doing so. There solution? Find a cop that is permanently disabled and turn him into a robotic cyborg (with the proper consent forms of course).After typical stuff more closely associated with television police drama, the cyborg is found and is none other than the reincarnation of Alex Murphey. The theme is the same ? he is rebuilt into a cop; this time with more theatrical fare and cinema magic. The technology looks real, and looks highly developed and futuristic from a more modern lab. It is just disappointing that we don't have this kind of technology (yet). The special effects and feel so far is better than that in Prometheus. Everything from character acting, plot, theme, etc; feels like a four part television pilot for a television series. This movie does leave all of this open, but a sequel and television series was never spawned.The movie escalates situation to keep those that are attention deficit from wandering away; typical of television right before or after a commercial. The movie is hardly what I call lackluster, but given the passage of time it may not age so gracefully. The visuals and robots in the movies might have a futuristic feel; but they seem to capture most of what is going on. Outside of this, many of the characters feel more like generic cookie cutter archetypes with synthetic personalities. This is a bit harsh of a statement to make, but the movie focuses more on theme and theatrics than actual characters. This is about the only thing bad about the movie, at least that I found. The movie surprisingly did not do so well and many others disagree with my opinion.Should you watch the movie? It is a reboot, like many Hollywood reboots; you will either like it or not ? but if you want your fix, this movie is the ticket.Originally posted to Orion Age (http://www.orionphysics.com/?p=8240).</fullReview>

You can feel the emotion, and also compassion with RoboCop.Unlike other RoboCop movies, this movie has great performances. Keaton portrayed the heart of a crook politician that is ready to deceive and bury you just to achieve his goals.Oldman is great as a scientist, and "Pat" is totally crazy and scary if you go deeper with the analysis what he is trying to say.There is no bullshit with kids using guns and rifles, no girls hacking robots, no cheesy dialog lines - this is the most realistic RoboCop movie. It's like you can imagine that this scenario may really happen in the future.This is really refreshing for me, and I enjoyed this movie a lot, every single second of it.Way to go! 10/10 from me!

		<shortDescription>Nice slice of Cyberpunk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailers for this movie made it look like a generic reboot to a beloved action movie. So I avoided RoboCop 2014 for a long time, missing it's theatrical release. I finally got to see it on Netflix and I gotta say, not only did I prefer it to the original, but it's one of the most pleasant surprises Hollywood's given me in years.This movie isn't a pointless remake as I was lead to believe. It's an update done right. Instead of focusing on redoing the story of the original with updated special effects the new RoboCop goes deeper into the psyche of a man who's essentially had most of his body replaced by machinery. It makes you question what makes a man human. Is there a soul in the machine? POTENTIAL SPOILERSAnd the answer comes in the form of Murphy's family, whether he can break free of his corporately controlled body and use his human mind to save those dear to him. It also brings up important political issues concerning robots in the middle east (a metaphor for the U.S. drone striking that part of the world), and your usual anti-corporate slant that's so prevalent in the cyberpunk sub genre of science fiction.The amount of action feels just right. The cgi isn't overdone. Overall it isn't a full on action movie like the original, it's a true science fiction movie that explores themes relevant to our times. It goes above and beyond the common blockbuster. And for that it deserves some attention for what it's accomplished. I'd like to see more science fiction in modern cinema since the future is looking more and more like science fiction with each passing day but for now this is a good start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not comparable to 1987 RoboCop, but that doesn't excuse it. **SPOILERS**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this announced, I immediately rolled my eyes. The original is one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time, and the sequels are guilty pleasures, even though they are awful in comparison.From the start, Alex Murphy is a tough cop, willing to do what it takes to get the perpetrator. In the original, he was a hotshot from the better area of Detroit, and requested a transfer to see more action. Here, he's just a "tough cop". Kinda clich to be honest. While both actors do portray the role well, I'd have to give a point to Peter Weller, because the tough cop character is overdone. It was nice to see the hotshot, trying to prove his worth.The differences start from here. The original had Murphy and his partner Lewis (Nancy Allen) responding to a call. They get into a chase and follow the trail to an abandoned steel mill. They call for backup, but can't wait much longer, so they decide to go in ahead to try to get them right there. In the following events, Murphy is caught, tortured and gets gunned down (surviving a hail of bullets from 4-6 shotguns). In the Remake, Murphy is on an undercover job with his partner Lewis (Michael Williams), and the job goes south, but they still bust the baddies. Later after that, we see Murphy at home with his family. He leaves the house, and gets killed by a car bomb. Again, very clichd use of bad guy gets mad, uses hidden bomb to kill the good guy. Weller again get the point here because his Murphy was a tough hotshot, and was dedicated to being a cop, going until the last breath to get the arrest. He gets gunned down at point blank, limbs blown off, and still keeps breathing until the bad guy shoots him in the head.The transition to RoboCop couldn't be more different, The original he was announced K.I.A. and his body was given to OCP to try out their latest program. It turns out to be a huge success, but then some strange things start to happen. Robo starts to have dreams, and remember things. He remembers flashes of his family, and starts to try and find them. This causes alarm, and everyone then tries to pull his plug before his whole system is compromised, because they fear his emotions would get in the way of their programs. He find out the truth, and goes after the OCP executive Dick Jones, who tried to get rid of him. This triggers a hidden 4th directive, which shuts down his operating system for trying to arrest a senior OCP employee. However, he manages to evade the company that created him, and he goes into hiding. OCP hires Boddicker and his goons (the guys who killed Murphy) to hunt him down and finish the job. From here it's tons of action, and plenty of violence to satiate the blood-thirst of anyone. After barely surviving the incident, Murphy goes back to OCP headquarters and shows the board of directors video footage proving Dick Jones' corruption. Only after he is fired by the President of OCP, Robo is able to finally take him out. The movie then ends on an awesome delivery of Robo saying that his name is Murphy, and the credits roll.The Remake on the other hand goes completely opposite of what the original had set in place. This time around, the family is aware of the program, and knows what is going on during each step. On top of that, they allowed Murphy to maintain full memory of himself and his family. This can play out well, but the delivery is just Murphy in shock, and denial about everything going on. There really is no inner turmoil like in the original. He's upset about it, then just accepts it for no real reason. this time around though, he does go through training exercises, and it shows him adapting to the new cybernetics. This was actually a nice scene. I really enjoyed Murphy basically going from his normal self to a crime fighting machine with no effort. Kudos to this. However, it starts to slope down after this. RoboCop is no longer the shoot first guy anymore. He relies on other tools. The chain of events are basically the same. Corporate bigwig hires thugs to take Robo out because he has become aware of shady workings, and he runs from the police in an attempt to find out how to stop them. However, this time around there is no big showdown that has Robo barely scraping by. The new RoboCop has enough stuff to get him through anything. This one ends with the OCP guy behind everything holding his family hostage on the roof, not being able to be shot because he was programmed as a "Red Asset", and thinking he's in the clear. The biggest fault in this scene is the fact that Murphy's emotions allow him to essentially "override" his programming, and kill the bad guy. This was such a weak ending to the movie. There have been WAY too many "Deus Ex Machina" scenes in movies, and even this one falls victim.Was the remake a horrible movie? No. If you have no idea about the lore that made the name RoboCop synonymous with the film industry, then you'd see an average action movie that's pretty formulaic. As a fan of the originals, I wasn't expecting much, and I got just that. It ignores almost everything about the characters, and tries to modernize a timeless classic. That is where this one failed. If it had been a 1:1 remake, people would have criticized that probably less, but it still would have been scrutinized nonetheless. Not a masterpiece like the one that started it all, but not abysmal like everyone calls it. Check it out. You may actually be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review of RoboCop(2014)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday,I watched RoboCop.RoboCop is an action film directed by Jos Padilha.The film stars Joel Kinnaman(Charles Joel Nordstrm) in the title role ,with Gary Oldman ,Michael Keaton ,Abbie Cornish ,Samuel L. Jackson ,Jackie Haley ,Patrick Garrow ,Michael K. Williams and John Ruttan in supporting roles.The story is about future of America.Raymon Sellars(Michael Keaton) is American entrepreneur,he is owner of the robot company.Led by CEO Raymond Sellars, the company moves to market , but the passage of the Dreyfus Act, forbidding deployment of drones on U.S. soil, prevents this.Sellars asks Dr. Dennett Norton(Gary Oldman) and his research team to create an alternative.They decided to make a RoboCop(man-robot).A Detroit police detective, Alex Murphy, is chosen for the job after he is critically injured in a car bomb explosion arranged by crime boss Antoine Vallon.The character of James Murphy(RoboCop) is really interesting because we have different types of him.At the start we have him as policeman with family and they were living happy life and then he became a robot(because of explosion) ,that was shocking for his family,but his wife and son accepted him as robot(that was only way to keep him alive).In my opinion the film is gripping and moving in some parts.The special effects are spectacular,but the best thing about film is story.The acting is good, but not as good as story.I reckon the film is successful.I recommend the film for all lovers of action films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the metaphysical paradox of the reviewer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is the reviewer writing the review the IMDb member is reading -- or is the member reading the review he was looking for, regardless of the text actually used? I ask because clearly that sort of thinking, that sort of dialog, was near and dear to the writer of this oddball film, yet, paradoxically, it is this very strangeness that gives the film historical worth, and the chance (however slim) that it may be remembered fondly by viewers of the the far future.We will skip the metaphysical question as to why a remake was done of a perfectly serviceable and timeless classic? What the original may have have lacked in CGI, it made up for in heart, and in its almost unique satirical POV on modern corporation communications (which led to a series spin off on Canadian TV, BTW) But Hollywood likes reimagining stuff. Even Vincent Price as THE FLY was reborn as the forever self-aware Jeff Goldbloom, and we sense this was what was intended here too.Reviewers notes: 1. Strange casting. A-List supporting cast (including the under-used Jackie Earle Haley) yet the lead himself seems uncomfortable in the role.2. The references to Wizard of Oz are doubly ironic since the movie itself suffers as much of an identity crisis as the main character. Since this is clearly no longer an action film with embedded satire (the "origins" go for a full hour!) then what is it? Sci-fi? Horror? Fantasy? The viewer is left to decide.Bottom line: not entertainment as we know it. More of a film school essay topic, along the lines of what was intended ... and why was this greenlighted?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This reboot of 'Robocop' is worth seeing. Is it better than the original? Probably not, but it is one hell of a fine-made film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this 'Robocop' is PG-13, it is unrelentingly violent and explores some plot points that the original did not, which made this a deeper film than the original. That's not to say this doesn't have its faults, but the good outweighs the bad here, and I'm happy to report that this rebooted 'Robocop' is worth seeing. Now you might question yourself to whether or not this is going to be a good movie.Well, he doesn't roar, but rather makes a silly sound, and you'll think you're gonna be in for a painful ride, but we are suddenly introduced to Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Pat Novak, a political commentator who has his own TV show and is mostly biased toward the democratic side. He explains that the American military has deployed new drones and a robot army to help with the conflicts overseas, and eventually these machines will replace human soldiers so that no more lives will be lost. Among these machines are the ED-209's. This scene, where Novak has his film crew overseas to investigate them in action is highly intense with a good but of comedy, as we saw in the original film with their interrupted TV programs and commercials. Jackson pops up from time to time on his TV show to further the advancement that the American people need to get on board with these robots wiping out crime not only overseas but in the states.But the American people want to connect with someone, not something, so Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton, excellent), the CEO of OmniCorp, decides to put a human inside one of these machines. Enter Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman), a police detective who goes undercover to stop the big bad guys of Detroit (Sorry, Dallas is not the backdrop of Detroit this time around). Of course, Murphy suffers a tragic accident and becomes Robocop. But here is where the story takes a different path than the original. Murphy's wife and son play a significant role in this remake, and receive quite a bit of screen-time. And of course, the studio is betting on this having a few sequels, so this is mostly a big set-up for future films. Sure Robocop dons the suit, which they, for most of the film make it a black tactical armor more than the silver bulky suit, but don't fret it does show up.But the bad villains that were so iconic and merciless in the first film, take a backseat in this remake. This is more about Murphy struggling with being part human and part machine and the free-will that exists inside all of us, no matter how forced we are to follow the rules or programs. And Padilha does this quite effortlessly. Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), is the leading doctor in replacing amputated limbs with robotic limbs with artificial intelligence in wounded soldiers and civilians. And he is assigned to Murphy's case with OmniCorp. His performance is of course, excellent and we genuinely root for him, even though he does some questionable things. I have a feeling he will be playing a much bigger role in the coming sequels.But his interactions with Murphy becomes more or less a father/son relationship, and it works. The action sequences are intense and loud, especially seeing this in IMAX, which I highly recommend. The gun shots are robust and make you feel you are in the center of the action. Although, there is never one point in the film where you will really feel that Robocop is in any real danger. No matter if he is fighting off 60 robots or 60 humans with large guns and explosives, he easily takes them out with minimal damage to himself. They changed up Murphy's partner from a female to a male with Michael K. Williams (Omar from 'The Wire'), who plays Jack Lewis. He is great in this role, but there isn't the chemistry there yet, and he felt underused.Then there is the great Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach from 'Watchmen'), who plays the weapons expert for OmniCorp and does not take a liking to Robocop. He taunts him during training exercises with some hilarious pieces of music and a familiar piece of dialogue. There isn't a great showdown with Robocop and ED-209 like in the original. Instead, we have a scene where several ED-209's are attacking Robocop as he flies through the air in his motorcycle. That being said, the ED's are still very menacing and might serve as a great battle in a future film. Kinnaman takes Robocop in a different direction than Weller did in the original. He has more emotion and we can relate to him more. He is a great actor and dons the suit well.Also, Jay Baruchel ('This is The End') shows up as a marketing executive for OmniCorp and provides some good laughs. Pedro Bromfman provides an okay score at bet, but he does give us that iconic score from the original, which was great to hear. If you are expecting tons of blood and guts in this film, like there was in the original, you won't find it here. However, there are some scenes that might just be on par with the high level of gore from the first film when we see Murphy transforming into Robocop.It's a different take, and one that is well made and thought out. It actually works better than the original here, and gives us more of a back story and connection with our hero. This reboot of 'Robocop' is worth seeing. Is it better than the original? Probably not, but it is one hell of a fine-made film, and I can't wait to see the next one, as I imagine it will deal mostly with Robocop in the original suit on the dangerous streets of Detroit. Hell, we may even get Clarence Boddicker in the next one. Here's hoping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as "experts" or "critics" claim that it is - Entertaining even if it is a reboot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so it's a reboot. There are people who are going to hate reboots/remakes no matter if they see the film or not. Even if the reboot/remake is better than the original, there are those who will hate with their closed minds. There's no point in stressing yourself out - no matter what anyone says or thinks, they (the studios) will always put out remakes/reboots due to lack of original ideas or to make a quick buck.I am by no means an IMDb troll or wannabe "expert" like several on this site seem to think they are. I'm a movie fan who has seen more than 10 movies and can objectively state whether a movie is good or not good. Yes at the end, it's all opinion and no one is correct - but there are some opinions that are as crappy as they claim the movie is and they are usually mistaken. Movies are meant to entertain, not to be taken so seriously.Anyway.I wanted to hate this movie. I hated the idea of a remake/reboot like so many others do and upon first hearing about this, I was already not happy about it - but in a way, sort of expected this to come out in a reboot/remake form eventually. When I first saw the picture or what this version of Robocop looked like, I didn't care. The first trailer I saw, made me think it was garbage (some trailers are just poor). Of course being a fan of the first and even the second original Robocop movies, I didn't care for it even before it came out - but resigned to the fact that I love movies and would eventually see this out of curiosity sometime down the line. And I did.The film does look better than the original as far special effects go and whatnot, and that's expected when comparing a 1987 movie to a 2014 movie. Joel Kinnaman wasn't a great casting choice here. I know they wanted to cast a fresh face to the role similarly how Peter Weller was cast in the 1987 version, but unlike Weller, Kinnaman just didn't take to the role. He did fine and nothing against the actor, but it would have been better with a different actor. I didn't feel sorry for him like I did with Weller's Alex Murphy character.The Lewis character is now a male and the captain is now a female. Gary Oldman does an excellent job as always and Michael Keaton is always welcome as a bad guy. Samuel L Jackson plays an interesting character.There's more focus on Alex Murphy's family unlike in the original where you never saw them really aside from flashbacks. This movie gives you their perspective a bit and that was a decent change. Future Detroit is not nearly the hellhole it was in the 1987 version, though there is of course the element of crime. In this movie, Robocop does have the silver but it's eventually changed to a sleeker black - though it probably wasn't the best idea in a marketing aspect. This movie also gives you a bit more with Murphy's emotions when first waking up and realizing he's barely human anymore - the 1987 original had him slowly realize this, so there is the differences there. This version certainly lacked the campy quality and humor of the original, but that isn't a bad thing and separates the movies. This version doesn't have memorable characters as the original had (Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith...etc). Aside from other minor details that is pretty much where differences between the 1987 version and this version end.The fight/shootout action sequences are better in this version naturally. There isn't the gore or level of violence as the original, but this movie is PG-13 as most studios like to do these days to cash in as much as possible with a wider audience.Really, if you take out anything RoboCop prior to 2014, this isn't a bad movie at all and is quite entertaining on it's own. I doubt they'll do a sequel at this point, but if they do and it's on the same level as this one, I'll surely see it. Movies are not supposed to be taken seriously and they're there to entertain - and this movie does that.There are some bad remakes granted (Total Recall) and some really good ones (The Thing 1982), but while this one is sort of in the middle, it's arrow is point towards good. If you have an open mind and don't take movies so seriously and just watch them to be entertained, then give this a shot. If you like the idea of the original, give this a shot. If you are one of those couch "experts" who only watch movies to dissect them and generally hate everything but the same 5 movies you compare everything to, then don't watch this. If you think every other movies that comes out is "the worst of all time" (meaning you haven't seen nearly enough to know what worst actually is), then don't watch.Honestly, I wanted to not like this movie. But I gave it a chance and was pleasantly surprised. I think most with an open mind will be too. While not the best movie to come down the pike, it certainly not as bad as people say and worth a watch for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film but was left under nourished and simply felt a bit "meh" after watching it. As expected the special FX/cgi were impressive and generally a viewable reboot of Robocop but without the genius of Paul Verhoeven at the helm all the humour, social digs and general "this is friggin cool" was totally lacking and it ended up being just another sci-fi film that will fade into the "oh yeah I saw that...once" category. I loved the first two movies (3 sucked) and, as I said earlier, had high hopes.I can only say watch it if you have never seen the original - but if you have you may not want to taint your mind with this reboot in the attempt to relive past glories of the Robocop ethos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the quintessential shoot 'em up of the modern age with a hefty dose of stealthy reverse-moralizing. Strong right-wing 'news' style pathos and false intellectualism is interspersed with patriotic fervor in the news segments given by Novak (Samuel L. Jackson). This is that reverse-moralizing I was talking about - a carefully crafted anti- drone movie. This movie is the "logical" extension of the use of warfare drones abroad making it onto the streets of America. The case made against corporate corruption and graft, interwoven with ineffectual or pocket politicians, is strong here. But if you're just looking for a shoot 'em up - this should work well for you. And if that isn't enough, at the very end we get to watch Samuel L. Jackson screaming bleeped out obscenities at the camera. All in all, the perfect end to a movie like this. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a remake, and given modern CG's, I thought this film was going to be an extravaganza of the programmers skills, IE, Avengers, X-men etc. No, this film is a let down in that department. There are great moments of graphic wizardry, but not enough to make this film as good as it could have been. The actors do there best with a mediocre script, and the premise is a rehash, (though slightly reworked) of the 80's blockbuster. In the 80's the idea was new, and made great viewing, but this 'copy' is a let down. The lead is played by a relative unknown, who doesn't really act well, or inspire me to either; check out his previous films, or look forward to the future ones. I enjoyed watching Samuel L Jackson and Gary Goldman, as they lifted this film, but their great acting wasn't enough to make this film anything more than a poor remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember very vividly going to see the 1987 original starring Peter Weller, directed by Paul Verhoeven. Like Verhoeven's other films, such as "Basic Instinct" and "Total Recall", the orig. "RoboCop" had a very menacing feel to it- but in the best possible way!- just sorta hits you over the head and says - LOOK AT THIS AWESOME STUFF!! LOLWith this 2014 remake, I'll actually have to say I think this version is even a little better than the original- goes into more the scientific end of things, as well as the corporate involvement in an enterprise such as this- incorporating drones, human choice, etc... I really liked this movie, especially for the performances by Gary Oldman and recent Oscar nominee Michael Keaton (damn!- I really wished he had won for "Birdman"! :( ). Okay, my only one drawback with the remake is it's lead actor, a relatively unknown Swede named Joel Kinnaman ("The Killing" &amp; the just released Liam Neeson thriller "Run All Night"). He's not a bad actor by any means- adequate in the role. My issue isn't with his casting, but the mere casting of an unknown. I honestly think with a role like RoboCop you need a somewhat known presence, like Peter Weller was in the first film- not a household name by any means when that film came out, but had been a rising star in films like "Firstborn" by then. You need someone who has a personality that can transcend the suit- look at Robert Downey Jr. in "Iron Man"--perfect example.But other than that, I'll definitely give this remake a recommend, whether you've seen the '87 original or not--overall a slick, well-made sci-fi action/thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the overall graphics was very awesome but there were a lot of flaws. First, it would have been good if the robocop has some catchphrases or a good sense of humour. Secondly,the robocop was not seen taking down bad guys and showing how awesome he really is. Thirdly, there was no actual bad guy that could match him, no real villain. Fourthly, by the time, the robocop had hit the streets, more then half the movie was already gone and the robocop just had a dull environment surrounding him. The makers could have done better but however the movie still gets a six because there was some cool action. The robocop movie is still a good ones but don't keep your hopes up. compared to some other summer movies, they are still above them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To serious for it's own good, but better than it should of been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many scoffed at the thought of Paul Verhoeven's beloved 80's classic Robocop getting the modern day makeover, for what form of sacrilege would be committed to a tale that embraced violence and political satire and drenched it in a synth filled tale of man meeting machine? Without wishing to talk up director Jose Padhilla's updated take too much there is no need to put your visors down as the film is a lot more enjoyable than it really had a right to be.Not possessing any of the originals wit and satire this Robocop is a more forlorn affair more concerned with the issues a man becoming a machine may possess. Our robotic justice bringer this time around is Joel Kinnaman as barely human Alex Murphy and Kinnaman while not particularly bad is also not much of a screen presence whereas in the original we had Peter Weller on fine angry man form. Alex gets lost in a tale that starts off on a strange side note with Samuel L. Jackson's TV presenter Pat Novak then picks it up again once we are introduced to our new officer of the law only to lose it once more in a final 30 ? 40 minutes, in which all becomes highly uninteresting and detrimentally dull. It's strange that a story so ripe for not only questions on what it is to be human but popcorn munching action takes such a route that it does.Padilha has shown great action chops in the past with his foreign film Elite Squad and it's amped up sequel in particular showing a great sense for nerve wracking action scenes. Robocop would seem the perfect venture for him to translate this ability to an English language blockbuster and with a budget well and truly into the triple digits there is a sense that Robocop just doesn't pack enough punch into its run time to justify the claim that this is indeed a blockbuster. Moments within the film showcase some fantastic one offs, with an eerie scene in which Alex looks at what is left of his human form or a training sequence set to a Wizard of Oz song an insight as to what could have been in a film far too caught up in being serious where it needed to mould it into fun.Wasting the talents of Jackie Earle Haley and Michael Kenneth Williams in lame supporting turns is just part of Robocop's problems in a film that at times threatens to do the impossible and live alongside its original master copy. Without giving itself a real heart, with a lack of action and with a Robocop we don't really get to love, it's a film that's not necessary yet is a venture that still is more than acceptable and in no way sullies the original's name. Justice in one form or another has therefore been served.2 and a half yelling Gary Oldman's out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw the first Robocop when I was just 9 years old back in 1987</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the first Robocop when I was just 9 years old back in 1987. At the time, this was one of the most amazing movies I had ever seen at my young, impressionable age. Peter Weller was, and IS fantastic. Robocop was the perfect combination of police drama meets science fiction mastery. Any young boy, even into their teens, aw hell even the adults, thought this was awesome. Now 27 years later, Robocop gets redone to the max. I'm not gonna lie, I was extremely skeptical, there have been far too many movies that get redone/rebooted/remade that end up destroying the legacy of the original. Granted, there are some that truly pay homage to the original and turn out amazing. Robocop (2014) is pretty solid, I wouldn't call it amazing, I certainly wouldn't call it bad, it was solid and I'd say above average.What I Like About ItI liked that this got an impressively technical upgrade from the original. Obviously with today's special effects technology, it is to be expected that the visuals would be more impressive, action more intense, and robots looking more ominous. Gary Oldman is great, he has his hokey moments, but I really like him and I'm very glad he was cast as the primary doctor who made Robocop what he is. "The human element will always be present! Compassion, fear, instinct, they will always interfere with the system!"The storyline held close to the original and I think that was important and frankly I'm very happy that the production team stuck close to the original story. There were some very obvious deviations, but that's perfectly OK. I am very much happy to see Michael Keaton as well, he has and will always be one of my favorite actors. In this he takes a more mellow role, no real intensity or craziness, but instead a leader role as the chief of OmniCorp. "What would happen if I shot a taser round into a metal exoskeleton... with a little asshole inside?"I really like Jackie Earle Haley, you may remember him from the Nightmare on Elm Street remake. He is a little guy but packed with talent and attitude. Least I not forget, Samuel L Jackson is in this too, and he gets to do what he does best, SWEAR... but not till the end.What I Didn't Like About ItMy biggest peeve about this Robocop redux is this skittering image thing they do variously throughout the movie. I get that it's an attempt to be like a glitch in the system, skitter skitter image, skitter. FEH! STOP IT! It's annoying no matter how you slice it. When it first happens in the very beginning, I thought maybe my copy was damaged, but then it kept happening variously throughout the movie. Very, very annoying, bad choice on that guys!"Forget the machines. They want a product with a conscience. Something that knows what it feels like to be human. We gonna put a man inside a machine."Some of the visuals felt overly computer generated, like when Robocop drives his cycle into the OmniCorp lobby. The reason I say that is because other scenes, it's a physical bike that gets hurled, such as a scene where he barrels into this hallway, clearly real. That mixture of CGI and real just made some scenes feel inconsistent.I'm not a big fan of Joel Kinnaman, I have never seen him before until this, and as much as he has a good look for the face beneath the shield, I just felt that he wasn't the best choice. Apparently Micheal Fassbender, Matthias Schoenaerts, and Russell Crowe were all options to play Robocop, of the three, Fassbender would have been pretty awesome. All in AllRobocop (2014) is pretty solid, it had great visual effects, a good mix of action and story and most of all it greatly explored the human psyche which was very nice. I suggest this for anyone into scifi flicks, it's worth your time. I'd love to hear your thoughts to my review, post comments at facebook.com/BooRadleyMoments</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's get this out of the way: I expect to be thoroughly entertained, in one way or another, by every film I see. Unless it directly states an ulterior motive at the onset, I want to be moved on my way out of the theater or after ejecting the DVD in a way I wasn't before I watched the film.Now, in regards to RoboCop, I expected to at least be as happy with the results as I was with the first two, Peter Weller installations. The trailers for this film made this look unlikely, but I wasn't going to be deterred. I'm glad I wasn't.This film is far from bad. But it is disappointing. With a strong cast (and one of Gary Oldman's best roles in recent memory), more might have been done. That would have necessitated some fleshing out of the script, more intensive relationships between Murphy and those close to him, etc. As it ended up, I enjoyed myself, but was left wanting something else. A weird combination, but an all too common one with major Hollywood productions.Those who saw and enjoyed the WellerCop films, you'll enjoy this. You might end up wanting more, as I did, but enjoy it you will. You already know the bar wasn't set terribly high to begin with. Those who are virgins to the franchise, start from the beginning and then compare and contrast the old and the new. You don't want to start here. You almost need the plot of the originals to understand how today's technology could lead to that of this film. That, and to understand some of the clever homages to the originals, little treats that definitely made for enjoyable moments.</fullReview>

The absurdity of the claims and complete ignorance how history not matching with their fantasy of their history putting aside, the movie subtly depicts eastern Europeans as terrorists, Asians as intelligent working slaves of US and Black people as all criminals. The protagonist is of course a white heterosexual slim American who has a gorgeous wife that he can have sex with anytime he wants because his wife his head over heels for him, a young son who sees his father as a superhero, a money crazy antagonist CEO and a side kick black coworker who gets shot in the end. All in all, Robocop introduces absolutely NOTHING NEW on the table and even has the audacity to praise America's chaotic justice on earth to be the "future" The only thing that's worthwhile seeing in this movie is the spectacular performance of Abbie Cornish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, please don't ask me where I would cut it. A first-class production that makes Paul Verhoeven's 1987 version and all the sequels look like cheap claptrap. Far better special effects, better photography, more style, but a bit too long. Well, there's not much left of poor Alex Murphy, after he gets blown apart. Just a face, brain and a really big pair of lungs. Kind of like an "Iron Man" feel to it! Again, The Robocop steals the show, showing far more humanity than his demented boss (Michael Keaton) and his "red-team trainer". Samuel L. Jackson does a great "Al Sharpton" impression-quite Republican in nature! "Robo" acts almost like Batman-and-his-Batcycle at times. Great use of bluescreen process. The "Tin Man" costume is entirely "matted in"! This version has a morality to it: You can't take the humanity out of the man, as hard as you try. Nature will find a way. Garry Oldman plays brilliant scientist Dennett Norton, and as usual, he's terrific. The supporting cast (relatively unknown Canadians) is quite competent. The special effects start out great, but the mechanical "Robocops" look like men in rubber suits at the climax, which I suspect they are. (Way over budget?) Detroit, of course, looks just like Toronto and Vancouver! A stellar remake!</fullReview>

This is a different interpretation of the story and even if it can't completely live up to the original it certainly is a very good try.This film has a good story, really keeping up the futuristic and cool sci-fi appearance. I would have liked a bit more humor, but other then that the hard strict tone and the characteristics of the actors really fit.I was entertained, even though I like the original better, this is really a good remake, but it is kind of like Dredd, you can only do so much to make a good classic as good in the remake, at least they don't ruin the childhood memories :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RoboCop is a 2014 American cyberpunk action film directed by Jos Padilha. It is a remake of the 1987 film of the same name and reboot of the RoboCop franchise. The film stars Joel Kinnaman in the title role, with Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson, Abbie Cornish and Jackie Earle Haley in supporting roles.In 2028, OmniCorp is at the center of robot technology. While its drones have long been used by the military overseas, their use is forbidden in American law enforcement. However, OmniCorp gets a golden opportunity to crack that market when Detroit cop Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is critically injured in the line of duty. By transforming Murphy into a cyborg, OmniCorp executives hope to rake in billions for their shareholders, but they forget one thing: There's still a man inside the machine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't compare! The movie has it's own merit!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised with this film. After having heard the criticisms, I expected this movie to be bad. Know why I expected it to be bad?? Because I saw the original and the original was bad! I mean, come on folks! OG Robocop was a revolutionary film, but it wasn't a great movie. And it's sequels were even worse. The over-saturated violence and profanity. The unbelievable villains. It was a poor film. And don't tell me you feel the graphics in that film hold up today! No way. This movie, however, completely rebooted the story, sticking true to its essence, but telling it in a new way. As honestly a reboot should! Different man, different tragedy, different suit, different experiences, updated to reflect our modern day technological advances. The movie is a GOOD movie! Sheesh!And let me say, I thought the actor Finnaman gave an awesome performance. His most dramatic scene, I thought, was just bone-chilling. I could completely empathize. Gary Oldman wins always...liked the wife-didn't have any issues with the casting.My reasons for a 7-star rating was because I did feel that the climax, or finale, if you will, was just a tad lackluster. Just a tad though! I think I would have preferred the villain to be a little more villainous throughout the film than in just those last few minutes. Villain was more of a d-bag than anything, so it just didn't flow for me all that well.But overall, good cast, fun action, great graphics, loved the new suit-it was good! Let the original die! Lol...Or don't. No film reboot should be too similar to the original anyway!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated remake to an overrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the 1987 favorite, about a critically injured police officer, whose only chance of survival is to become a part-man/part-robot being that is used to uphold the law. It's easy to nip at the movie for being for more tame in terms of violence (considering the original's R-rating), but it wasn't for a lack of trying by director Padilha and star Kinnaman?and the remake actually seems far more action-packed despite the lack of bloodshed. Another plus are themes of consciousness/mind and free will, which is worked in very fittingly. Keaton and Oldman are excellent, and the film is even further heightened by many homages to the original, especially with snippets of Basil Poledouris' 1987 score. While Jackson is also a pleasure as Novak, a television host and supporter of RoboCop, the film's major downfall is the out-of-place humor in the first and last scenes of the film?the latter of which is followed by The Clash's "I Fought the Law", which is just too distractingly strange to let it go unmentioned.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robocop tells the story of an injured man then declared that would be need to go through a series of surgeries to recover from his critical condition. RoboCop proves itself sharper than many studio reboot, remake, or sequel in recent memory. Setting in 2028 and society has become so advanced, even though mechanized peacekeepers have proved effective in the Middle East. Robotics manufacturer Omnicorp stands to make billions in the homeland security market if CEO Raymond Sellers (an oily Michael Keaton) can sell the government and the American people on the idea of a non-human police force. Captivating throughout, the film definitely brings a sense of urgency and imagination throughout. Although the idea is great, the film could have been better than its final product.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original when I was about 8 or 9 years old and really liked it. I held off seeing this remake because the remake of Total Recall may have been the worst movie I've seen of the past 10 years. But I thought this remake was pretty good. Whether it's Robocop, A.I, I, Robot, Terminator or the just released Chappie we know how the story will unfold. A machine that must obey it's commands overrides its protocol or learns how to be "human." We all know that and we shouldn't downgrade a movie because we were able to guess the overarching theme or storyline. I really enjoyed the logic Robocop used to solve the crimes in this movie, Robocop's demeanor when he was human and when he was programmed to be more robot like as well as the portrayal of media bias in the film. Overall I thought the film was very engaging and couldn't stop watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was This Film Truly Necessary? Let's Find Out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robocop is the remake of the 1987 sci-fi classic and in my opinion, one that did not need to be remade. I guess the studio wanted money and a fresher version of the source material. For the most part, I liked the film. In the past, I would have wanted the gore and stylish action to remain intact, but I was interested in this character study. The film makes the wife and the kid more front-and-center and I actually liked that. There are some good action scenes, but I liked the film more of a character study. This film is about a detective named Alex Murphy who was severely injured in an explosion. The only way he can survive is if he becomes part-man, part-machine. Now Robocop can patrol the streets reducing crime in the dangerous city of Detroit by a vast amount. I thought the acting was good enough. Joel Kinnaman made an interesting Robocop and he's at his best during the family scenes. Gary Oldman was effective as the doctor in charge of building Robocop. Michael Keaton was fantastic as the leader of Omnicorp, Raymond Sellars. Finally, I liked Samuel L. Jackson in his media satire role as the host of the Novak Element, a political news show. Overall, Robocop is an effective remake although both films were different. I liked this character study, though I feel there could have been more character development. There are fewer and less-violent action scenes, but I seem to be the only one okay with that. Then again, I'm extremely easy to please. I thought this was a good sci-fi film. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Decent Reboot Of The RoboCop Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know the backstory to RoboCop so it's a waste of time in going into this. I'll admit that I was skeptical about this remake because I had seen early production pictures and something about it just didn't look right. Also rebooting an R rating into a PG-13 brought some dread because I felt they were dumbing it down just to get a bigger audience.Even with all this, though, I still decided to watch it and I was very pleasantly surprised, and as long as you don't sit there thinking "No, this never happened in the original; no, that never happened" then you will be fine because this is like Batman and Superman...it's an updated/rebooted version of an older film. Personally I think they went the right way by actually giving it a fresh, new story rather than trying to copy the original.Anyway, right from the off, this film is full-on action and the visual effects are very impressive (as we'd expect from a 2014 big budget Sci-Fi/Action movie). Also, you can see that the storyline combines elements from both RoboCop and RoboCop 2 (and thankfully none from RoboCop 3), especially with the emotional side being taken out from Murphy's "programming".There are a few good nods to the original as well with the multi-views we see from RoboCop's POV, and the catchphrases used in the original are here too. One of my only real complaints is the way the head piece is done for RoboCop (and the rest of the body actually when it's done black, even though it does look very cool) just makes it look a bit too much like a suit rather than a machine, whereas in the original it was done so well Murphy DID look like a machine.This version doesn't have the same hard-hitting impact the original had obviously because of the PG-13 rating, but overall, the film is still a really good action flick.Ignore the trolls, the haters and the "critics" of the film and judge it for yourself...you may find yourself actually enjoying it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In come the spin doctors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite literally the high number of Hollywood remakes of other contemporary Hollywood movies is like watching an army of spin doctors trying to 'reshape peoples perceptions of the past' by redoing period classics like Robocop in that Robocop is one of the movies that best represents SF films from 1987-along with the well known SF film Predator. A good comment regarding this spate of remakes might be 'if there's money to be made doing something people will be doing it.' This version of Robo is a lot less gritty than the original 1987 film its based on and in the remake the criminals are a lot less severe than the ones in the original 1987 film, and of course- the OCP execs are now a less dangerous bunch. In a way its a laughable effort given that Robo wasn't exactly made in the 1940's or anything like that. This version is slick as you can get but in being such a slick effort it doesn't carry the same power that the 1987 film does. The shots of a ruined Detroit in the original movie gave credibility to the idea that Detroit was truly a city on the brink of total destruction. None of those feelings are present in this remake. You might call it "a candy coated version" of Robocop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Average' as a term was made for this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance, RoboCop (2014) is a remake of the original, but in reality it bisects the drug war story in the 1987 version and goes right for a morality argument.When movie executives get their grubby little hands on a cult classic like the original RoboCop, there is little anyone can do about it. Once the idea is planted for a remake, it's a done deal and so audiences can thank Sony MGM and Columbia pictures for 2014's RoboCop.With any remake, the film is going to have a bigger budget. Surprisingly though, that does not necessarily mean more fight scenes an bigger explosions. The movie instead looks at the narrative from a different angle, the moral implications of the blending between robotic and humanity to combat warfare and the blending of corporations in politics.In the 2014 version of RoboCop, Murphy is not the first robot integrated into the police force. The robotic implementation to combat crime is shown on more of a global scale: as peace keepers in Tehran and as cutting edge prosthetic providing musicians the ability to play again. The problem is that the population does not trust the machines so OmniCorp decides hybridize machine and human to increase acceptance of their product. Further RoboCop as a movie delves deeper into Alex Murphy's life and the emotional and familial ramifications of being turned into a corporate killing machine.Audiences should try to clear their mind of the original before watching the modern version of RoboCop. The Detroit we see is not nearly as permeated by a dystopic and crime-ridden society as the original, though crime is a problem. If the film had simply had been a remake, albeit a good one, in a few months the film definitely would have been swiftly forgotten. In an effort to be remembered the filmmakers try to have the film be more of an analytical argument, similar to that for cloning. After 30 minutes of the film, Alex Murphy has only just undergone the robotic transformation at OmniCorp and after an hour Murphy is only just introduced into the Detroit PD. During this time the movie brings up compelling and thought provoking questions about the illusion of free will, propaganda sold by the media but paid for by corporations, etcetera. Unfortunately, RoboCop is poorly paced for this deep thought within the context of the film and it is far too easy to just zone out and miss this part. As an original idea I find the screenplay premise written by Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier, interestingly the same screenwriters for the 1987 film, intriguing enough but not under the guise of "RoboCop." Most of RoboCop is a plebeian effort at filmmaking and a basic exhibition story-telling by Jose Padilha. Samuel L. Jackson plays news reporter Pat Novak who is a narrator device for the film, which is lazy and unforgivably the only way the plot progresses. We see the relationship between Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) and his wife Clara (Abbie Cornish) and we are told of their love, but the acting leaves much to be desired with no innate chemistry or connection inherently transcending the screen. Further Kinnaman's accent is laughably atrocious as a police officer and promptly disappears once he becomes RoboCop.Though the CGI and effects in RoboCop are creepy and fantastic, there really isn't much of anything that can make it anything but average. At least RoboCop tries to have a new and decisive perspective for the remake. But the intent of the film and its overall message is unsteady, so movie falls incredible short of its profound intent.Please check out our website for more full reviews of all the recent releases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sad to say that we actually turned this off about a half hour in. It was just so boring. The guy they chose to be the new Robocop is completely uninteresting. He's so stone-faced, with the dead eyes of a shark, that the scenes of him trying to relate to his family made me wonder if he wasn't holding them hostage in some fashion. There was no sense of connection to his family, his partner, or his job, if they wanted a machine that could feel they chose the wrong guy. The global police bit had potential, but there was no real through-line or reason to care about any of these characters. Almost kept watching just because Michael Keaton is awesome, but everything surrounding him in this movie was lifeless and dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than once feared</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(56%) The best this could ever be is a successful failure, and with help from Oldman, Jackson, Keaton and a decent director it just about gets there. The original was a brilliant bold, brash action satire, and much more than just a movie about a cyborg cop, whilst this is a pretty standard sci-fi actioner that feels the need to be satirical from time to time out of obligation more than anything else. Overall this is an entertaining, somewhat clever time passer, but the very limited use of the fantastic score is a crime, and most unlike the original, this needed a much better central villain. This did an okay job, but Robocop should really be left off duty from now on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this film. What a concept. In 2028 Detroit, when Alex Murphy - a loving husband, father and good cop - is critically injured in the line of duty, the multinational conglomerate OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer. Fortunately the director lets the actors breathe and the music lets the atmosphere live. This film was nearly perfect, but sadly still not made for everyone. We know from the start that there is no way for it to really end well. It is a powerful film, but I doubt I will ever want to watch it again. The characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times, so 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robocop is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a very talented cast.Its a remake of the 1987 classic,and it is of course not as good,because movies don't get remade unless they were originally great,and a remake is just trying to strike the same goal the original movie did,and I'm pretty sure Hollywood has not succeeded in a critical stand point with that yet,but this movie is certainly one of the most enjoyable ones I've seen in a while,it helps that it isn't just a shot to shot remake of the original Robocop,and it is certainly better than the brutal sequels that followed the original.The best performances were certainly Samuel L. Jackson and Gary Oldman,Jackson probably had fifteen minutes of screen time altogether but every scene he had was terrific,I also really liked seeing Oldman's personality change throughout the movie.I wasn't very fond of Joel Kinnaman as RoboCop but I did like that they gave a relatively unknown actor a chance to play the part.Robocop is nothing outstanding,but as far as remakes go it is very enjoyable and I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action or sci-fi and fans of the original should check it out. After a police officer is critically injured,a company named OmniCorp turn him in to a half man,half robot to fight crime. Best Performance: Samuel L. Jackson Worst Performance: Jay Baruchel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great to see Robocop back on screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give Robocop a generous rating because Robocop is about a police officer that fights against nasty criminal gangs. The original movies were great films too, however I found them to be extremely dark and disturbing. This film continued in that vain. In terms of the story it was good as OCP were done just as corruptible and we would expect them to be. I liked the idea of having the propaganda news which was similar to the original which also had propaganda news reporting all the sordid and immoral not to mention violent events occurring in the city.The real problem I have with this movie is that it is not like the TV series which ran back in the olden days. That was a Robocop I could get into and was interested in seeing. Not even the old movie could replicate the series. I realise it was aimed at a younger audience but the senseless violence and glorification of guns which you see in the movies is not what I liked about Robocop. For me at least the regular Robocop as envisage in the series was the real deal.A bit like Superman this Robocop is way to realistic for its own good and unlike the Dark Knight trilogy it does not reimagine the old series. Having said all that I still thought the fine performances of the stars such as Gary Oldman, Samuel Jackson and Michael Keaton kept me watching it. Without them in it I probably would lower my rating of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alex Murphy, police officer of Detroit, is fatally injured in a car bomb explosion and is remade as a cybernetic law enforcement robot. The company who made him, OMNICORP, create military robots to battle in the Middle East, but cannot bring such faceless enforcement into American cities without causing panic. RoboCop is their solution. But Alex's humanity starts to get in the way of their perfect designs...If you follow Cinema Cocoa you already know how I feel about remakes, but I went to see this one in a hope that the character gets a bit more conviction than in previous instalments (the original's sequels, to be exact.) What I get however is still a watered down, play-it-safe and emotionally depleted money spinner.Let's get technical, shall we? In the original film Alex dies, and is rebuilt as a machine with human reflexes. The corporation who built him, built him to a specific standard, as a product, as an implement to be used for their purposes. But the film's theme is the power of human spirit to break free of corporate shackles; its a testament to human loyalty and inner strength. In the reboot, Alex doesn't die, but is 99% replaced with robotic parts (I find this a little severe, bordering on laughable, considering he was burned and not shot to ribbons this time...) He is a man in a metal body first, he has all of his humanity. The conflict starts when OMNICORP realises having a human in combat isn't as efficient as a robot, and they slowly modify him with stricter coding. Wouldn't a corporation perhaps appreciate the human element before committing to a multi-million dollar project? This narrative makes OMNICORP not so much evil as just a bit... stupid.I won't lie, having Alex's family involved here is a good move; the original films needed to play this up and have those emotional bonds, and this film finally does that. But the execution is so drab and dull in terms of characterisation. I didn't feel for any of the characters, not even Murphy himself, even before he becomes RoboCop his personality was wooden. His son doesn't react at all when he sees his dad come home as a towering superhero!A lot of the film is talking. Dark Knight'ing it up big time. Want to know the pseudo-science behind RoboCop, want to know the business plans and corporate backlash from RoboCop's actions? I hope you do little under-twelve-year-old kiddie, or you're gonna be boooooooooooooored. Seriously studios, you make this a 12A so you can get the family/kiddie cash, then pad your movie with millions of boardroom chat scenes and science jargon? What? Or is this your panicked way of making a longer film without any of Paul Verhoeven's violence, satire or wit?Oh yeah, there's no satire or wit. I was in a cinema full of mid-twenties to thirties men, I think there were two chuckles throughout the entire film. This isn't just my opinion, the film has nothing of the original's theatricality, brutality or satire. If you aren't twelve, you'll probably get bored fairly quickly.How about the action? I've not touched on that A lot of it is decent; the tech involved shows how RoboCop is so effective in combat; we see from his eyes enemies weaknesses etc, which does make it engaging. But unfortunately... for some reason... they made the final gun battle take place in the dark. Oh, great. So lots of strobe lighting and not being able to see what the hell is happening. SMELLS LIKE A 12A ACTION SEQUENCE!Ugh. I had some hope too. Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton are great but even their combined efforts cannot save their monotonous scripts. I don't even mind the redesign of RoboCop or ED-209, the aesthetics are good, the CG isn't bad either, and the family aspect is good. But gah, its such a... such a safe, boring and money-grubbing remake of something that exists already!You want a final good statement on this film?It is better than RoboCop 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally new re-imagining of the Robocop story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I usually do I went into watching this movie with little knowledge of the story, letting my mind go where the movie takes it, and it worked out well that way. The last half-hour or so gets a but muddled but overall it is a very entertaining futuristic sci-fi take on crime fighting.Joel Kinnaman is Detroit cop Alex Murphy. This is a time when a company has been developing crime-fighting robots being used all over the world, but not in the USA, congress has prohibited it. As Alex he seems to be getting close to one of the biggest local crooks they try to kill him with explosives in his car at home. He only barely survives, but loses most of his body. Seems the only things that work as intended are his lungs and his brain. Fortunately for him Gary Oldman as Dr. Dennett Norton has been working on cutting edge research that will allow them to install a heavily shielded robotic body to go with his brain and lungs, plus some software that allows him to instantly scan the eyes of people and know their criminal background, if any. When this is fitted and working, Alex becomes the first RoboCop, a robot with a real person's brain.This doesn't go completely without hitches. There are some issues with his wife and young son, and with the corrupt cops. But in the end he proves to be a promising prototype Robocop for future crime-fighting. I really liked his cool motorcycle!</fullReview>

Officer Alex Murphy is killed, and resurrected as a cyborg. OCP sees him as a product while he tries to regain his humanity. Been there, done that.Some of the supporting characters- Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton and Jackie Haley vanish into their roles pretty well. Jackson doesn't.Some of the action scenes are good, others are chewy CGI goodness.Maybe if they hadn't called this "RoboCop", it might have been a better movie.Maybe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Another Sorry Remake!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor, poor Robocop! What started off back in the mid-80s as an enjoyable sci-fi/ action flick has gone through the gamut of lousy sequels. When ROBOCOP 3 came out, it was a bad sign that Peter Weller didn't reprise his role. For 20 years, the Robocop franchise has been laid to rest. But just like Alex Murphy, along came some hotshots looking to make a quick buck. And presto, out of nowhere ROBOCOP is re-envisioned for a modern day audience. Believe it or not, I actually found it WORSE than ROBOCOP 3. Why? Please read on. 1) The most notable thing missing is the great acid wit that made the original film so enjoyable. Where's the jabs at TV advertising and the News? Sure, in 2014's ROBOCOP you get Samuel L. Jackson. But he's not in it enough. And his material is, frankly, not that funny or enjoyable to sit through. 2) Where are the great villains? In the original, you had two sneeringly-evil bad guys played by Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith. In 2014's version, you get some nameless Eastern European thugs. Michael Keaton is sort of a villain. But his acting is dull as a beige room. The best role is given to Gary Oldman as Robocop's top scientist (and sympathizer). 3) The film spends way too much time with Alex Murphy before he becomes the Robocop. In the original, Murphy has at most twenty minutes before he's turned into mince-meat. Plus, in 2014's version, there are too many unnecessary gunfights. After awhile, I shook my head and proclaimed "That's not Alex Murphy. It's Max Payne!" Another lousy film, I might add. 4) The film spends way too much time once Murphy's turned into the Robocop. In the original, we get those neat little flashes of time passing as the Robocop's put together. In 2014, it comes across as very dull. 5) The plot meanders from one confusing situation to another, without much of a story to really hold it all together. 6) Don't waste your time with 2014's ROBOCOP, hunt down the original and enjoy... I certainly did!</fullReview>

I couldn't help myself in comparing it to the original one from '87 that I grew up with and I admit it, it was one of my favourites... but still.Why was I disappointed? The story was totally different. Something pretty common these days. Look at Snow White, Jack the Giant Slayer, Spider-man and so on. Now, the main reason is that they didn't make me connect with the character at all.Let me explain it in plain English: the writers didn't do their job. Why? In the old one you had the main character being introduced gradually and even that you knew that the movie it's about a robot, you didn't know who and what until he opened he's eyes after the tragical end he suffered. I remember how after each shot I was hurting with the character. In this one... they just planted a car bomb. Really?Then, the story of his family, the connection, the love, the passion, the bond with his son... it's all so plain and so dull. In the old one it was a strong connection with the son. They even had the cool cowboy gun trick that let some people know that Robocop is Murphy. Even his son gets it through that simple, favourite, gesture.And so on...I am not saying: the entire cast and crew did a beautiful job on the technical part of the movie, but the story was not there.They improved a lot on the suit, on the design. They brought it more to the present where we love sleek shiny things, but again: not a good story.I don't know how many time I will have to say it. In my books, because I wasn't enticed with a good story to keep me at the edge of my seat, I would've give it a 1. But because I know a lot of people worked day and night on it... it's a 4.Sorry. Once again: Disappointed. Sorry...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rushed ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first half of the film they set up the circumstances of how Alex Murphy became Robocop, and it's rather well done too. With the assistance of Samuel L. Jackson's character it's described how, in the world in which Robocop is set, robots are banned within the USA's borders, and therefore the idea of Robocop is born. A human inside a robot. It's done fairly well, although perhaps more emotion form Kinnaman and Cornish would have helped.There's then the amount of "badies". There's three main foes which Robocop faces, but so little links the three of them. In fact, there's only a link between two of them and the third only becomes a foe in the closing of the film. You have the feeling that the writers lacked the imagination to create a strong foe, or even a plot connecting those foes.Comparisons of the original are easy to make, but dangerous too; it's a different film. For example, this Robocop is more athletic. The original had stronger foes, this film they're almost sidelined; an inconvenience to the plot of Robocop's creation. There was a sharpness with the ED-209s but in this film again they're like an after thought. In this film the ED-209 battle was rushed to the point where it's just machines fighting machines in a blur of special effects. That fight is rushed so that finally Robocop could face his final foe in what really was an anticlimax against Michael Keaton, who's character has absolutely no menace to him at all.Gary Oldman plays Dr Dennott Norton and when you look back it could almost be described as a film about his character. How he created Robocop, and his regrets when his boss changes direction of the Robocop program. Certainly himself and Jackson are the stars in this film.Ultimately the third part of Robocop feels rushed and weak. Overall it lacks the wit, sharpness and intelligence of the original, but Oldman's character added a more human element. Ignoring the original film, it's really a lack of a strong intelligent plot and rushed end which takes from what could have been an 8* film to 6*.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little better than what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Hollywood takes a classic movie and decides to remake it for a new generation. Since the original "Robocop" was perfect, there was no way that a remake could surpass it, which is why I avoided this remake when it was in theaters. But I was curious about how they'd screw it up, which is why I rented the Blu-ray.Though my expectations were low, I have to admit that to a (small) degree the movie wasn't as bad as I thought. The production values are strong, with some good special effects and a generally slick look. The screenplay does have some interesting ideas here and there, such as how the hero's family reacts to the hero's transformation, as well as how the hero treats his transformation.But there are more misses than hits in the end. The hero isn't given much chance to do stuff before his transformation, so it's hard to see how he was really changed by it. The movie really takes a LONG time to really get going and get its hero out in the field and doing his thing. The various bad guys in the movie aren't given enough to make them strong and memorable characters. The action sequences, what there are, are sometimes confusing and hard to follow. While I wouldn't call this an awful movie, remake or not, it is definitely a disappointment. You'll see the potential that was there but was ignored for the most part. If you must see this movie, wait until it comes on television so you don't have to pay anything to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robocop '87 v. Robocop '14</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! I can't believe it's been 27 years since the first Robocop. Time flies. OK, enough nostalgia.Robocop '14 was a decent remake. They kept the main theme and the main players, to a certain degree, but changed the story somewhat. One of the main things they did was soften the movie to a PG-13 rating from an R rating. Robocop '87 was far bloodier and more sinister. '87 Detroit was depicted as a more derelict and hopeless city than 2014 Detroit. Another big change was the depth of the story. Robocop '87 was a far simpler story without delving much into politics or Detective Murphy's family life. In the 2014 version we are dragged into a more somber reality of Murphy's transformation with the deep impact it has upon his wife and son. Robocop '87 didn't give much background or detailed information of the decision making for creating Robocop. 2014 goes heavily into the different parties that helped materialize Robocop and what they're motives were.The net result was a very good remake. Of course this Robocop was given a serious makeover and benefited a lot from 21st century movie making. The movie was far from perfect but held its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad movie if it had been called something besides RoboCop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally had no intention of watching this because I'm sick to death of seeing my favorite movies remade (usually somewhat badly). But my husband talked me into watching it tonight so I did, and tried to do so with an open mind.As a remake, this movie spits in the face of pretty much everything that made the original RoboCop a classic that has held its appeal for almost thirty years. As I suspected. But overall, it actually wasn't... half bad. Not great by any stretch of the imagination. But not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. TPTB really should have just removed all ties to the original and called it something else. Had they done that, I suspect the film would have been better received. I certainly could have appreciated it more that way.And for those of you who honestly think that this was better than the original... what the &amp;^%$ are you smoking?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly above average remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Rock n Reel Reviews was first starting up back in 2012 and we were at the very beginning of our podcasts, rumours of a push to get Robocop remade had started to surface. The full force geek-rage we had at this news was palpable to say the least and I declared that this film would be Doomed to Failure!! Two years on and after countless hours of articles and conversations about the going-ons in and around the set of the film just added fuel to the fire of my blunt statement and was very much at the back of my mind when I entered the cinema last month. And let me say right from the start that this film is not a patch on the original Robocop?.however I have to admit that I was wrong with my "Doomed to Failure" statement as this remake actually has a lot to be happy about and isn't the train-wreck I was expecting!!The below synopsis is taken from IMDb:In 2028 Detroit, when Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) ? a loving husband, father and good cop ? is critically injured in the line of duty, the multinational conglomerate OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer.I think the biggest issue you will have in watching this film is disassociating yourself from the fact that you've seen the original more awesome film. However, like I said above, there is actually a great deal of good in this remake. Joel Kinnaman is actually a decent Alex Murphy, Gary Oldman is a interesting character who is dealing with some of the more interesting morality issues raised in the plot, Michael Keaton is in fine form as the billionaire CEO trying to overturn public perception to his product by using marketing manipulation while Samuel L. Jackson is his pawn as the almost FOX NEWS type news anchor.The film looks beautiful and the attention taken in the use of CGI is actually really well done and should hopefully stunt the years of ageing in repeat viewing. The action is never over the top and actually more placed in appropriate places, they even take the time to update how things like the Prime Directive works etc.The plot as well has been updated along with some of the original social commentary. Where the original focused on a lot of the corporate corruption of the 1980's and the disparaging differences between those that have and those that have not, the remake takes a far more current stance. The pros and cons of America's drone wars, the mass media manipulations and the culture of lobbying government are all in this films cross-hairs. And for the most part it attempts to look at these issues as the back drop to a film aimed to entertain the, 12A certificate in the UK, PG13 in the USA, audience.The film fails on one major vital story telling plot? the lack of any actual clearly defined main villain. There is no Clarence Boddicker? that's not to say there isn't a crime lord in this film because there is, however there is little story arc for this character and it's wrapped up a little too quick for my liking. It's more about the nasty corporation of OmiCorp and it's pristine looking CEO and the levels he is willing to go to have his way. Like I said above, Michael Keaton is great in this role however I was left a bit deflated at the final showdown. Another possible villain could be the former solider-turned military trainer for OmiCorp played by Jackie Earle Haley who has, from the start, a massive disliking to the idea or premise of Robocop. With a trio of lacklustre villains it was a bit difficult to rally up the support for Robocop.Overall the film isn't a train-wreck, moreover it's actually a decent little popcorn action film that tries to at least play out a bit of social commentary alongside the moderate violence. Robocop (1987)?this film is definitely not but I can say that when I left the cinema Robocop (2014) had put a smile on my face?a sentence I never thought I would ever type.RocknReelReviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing compared to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For this to even share the same name as the original is an outright insult. I will discuss my main issue with this film. It will contain spoilers for both movies. Frankly, the transition from Murphy to Robocop was executed abysmally. Not only was his "death" not a death at all, it was reduced to being severely burned over 90% of his body with an amputation and ruined sight in one eye from a car bomb. The most glaring oversight however was the removal of the psychological revulsion and horror to the audience of being ruthlessly and unmercifully murdered. That trauma from the first was absent here entirely, and a car bomb does NOT cut it. In the original, the manner of Murphy's death and the presence of the villains was absolutely vital to the plot. It lent more weight to his motivation later on to investigate it and those responsible, as well as helped define the antagonists (Boddicker remains among one of the most memorable villains in cinematic history), which in this movie were consequentially as cookie cutter and forgettable as you can possibly get. As for the transformation itself, it was wholly implausible. The reason it worked in the original was because Murphy was, for all intents and purposes, dead. When he awoke as Robocop, he wasn't Murphy, he was a reanimated corpse/cyborg. He didn't come to and have to suddenly confront the weight of the ramifications of his situation all at once because he wasn't alive. The ability for him to feel and process emotions was, while I wouldn't argue destroyed completely, largely diminished when he was killed, and the reanimation of his corpse into a cyborg only brought back his mental facilities in their strictest, most binary form. Hence, throughout, we never really get to see Murphy come to terms with the loss of his humanity as we were witnesses to him becoming cognizant that it even existed in the first place. This is triggered first by his dream, then by Lewis asking him his name, and finally him confronting one of his murderers (Emil) at the gas station. This brought to light dormant memories, a direct link to that humanity and previous existence he wasn't aware happened, and a subsequent quest of self-discovery ensues that he sadly is only really half able to realize. This is the tragedy that defines the original and has made it such a beloved classic, and is what the remake lacks. There's a single line in the original that encapsulates what made Robocop Robocop, when he's speaking to Lewis in the factory about his family: "I can feel them......but I cannot remember them". This wonderful piece of concision explained all that needed to be known about Alex Murphy as Robocop. He was a biological machine, yet he also had the residual fragments of a shattered soul that he could sense in a detached, analytical manner yet was unable to fully understand. That's what made the film so brilliant. Murphy's destruction and subsequent resurrection severed the tie between him being alive, and him being human. It not only raised questions as to what makes people who they are, but you could very easily buy into it. In the new film this is absent. Murphy is Murphy throughout. He wakes up, and for all he knows, he's just been K.O.'d by Tyson (hey, a Sinatra dream! How considerate of them). Nothing has changed for him aside from the fact he now has a suit for a body, and this is the fundamental distinction that elevates the first film miles above this one. This remake completely misses the mark of what defines the first film as an all-time great. There is no striving for identity or humanism present. No soul. The filmmakers obviously took the stance of: "Let's find the quickest way to turn Murphy into a cyborg, get his acceptance out of the way, then we're free to flood the screen with overly intrusive HUD elements, have lots of shootouts, and show how cool a cyborg with his super bike really can be!!". It does not demand the audience to confront any real significant underlying themes or undertakes any responsibility to explore them. It instead chooses to view them as an obstacle or at best a necessity to be overcome instead of a central focus to be pondered and discussed. That is why this remake is an objectively worse film than its predecessor. And while the portrayal of Murphy struggling to embrace his new identity is ultimately this film's greatest failing, it is by far not its only one. If I went into how Omnicorp wasn't portrayed as in any way evil (until the very end), the antagonists were not developed nor any of the characters remarkable (Dick Jones, Bob Morton, Lewis, Boddicker...nothing even close), the ridiculous overkill of the HUD and Robocop's unbelievable abilities, the emotional vacancy of the familial relationship, the falling flat attempts at mimicking Verhoven's tone and humor, what's the point of being a red asset if your product can still ****ing shoot you (sorry, the "emotions override the system" is a cop out), and on and on, this would turn into a thesis instead of an essay. But before I depart, I don't wish to be completely mean spirited, so let me just lend some credit and say that at least they didn't neglect to include Samuel Jackson looking at the screen, bug-eyed, and scream his trademark, rage induced "MOTHER****ER!!!" before the end credits rolled. I suspected as much when he opened the film, and I wasn't left disappointed. Hey, if you're going to hire Jackson, get what you pay for, right directors? Oh yea, and I especially got a good chuckle out of Robo's HUD readout upon scanning that druggie: "Totally stoned". Like....TOTALLY, dude.Absolutely awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the future, machines replace soldiers on the battlefield. Embedded media, as always, act as cheerleaders for the military industrial complex. The US has invaded Tehran and we learn all the "virtues" of having machines patrol the street. On one such patrol a robot soldier kills a boy who's just holding a knife.Omnicorp, which builds these robots, is trying to introduce robot law enforcement to the one country that has banned them--the US. It would be a huge market for their product, but a law specifically prohibits drones and robots on US soil. So Omnicorp's boss, Sellars, figures out if they put a man in a machine the American people will accept their product. The neocon media is of course fully on board, chief among them a TV personality named Novak (!) who's all for the warfare state and the police state--in the name of the security of Americans, of course.Meanwhile two honest Detroit cops, Murphy and Jack, are looking for a crime boss named Vallon. They meet with two dirty cops who set them up. Jack ends up in the hospital, Murphy survives the attack. But when Murphy gets home his car explodes leaving him without legs, and without an arm.Omnicorp decides this would be the perfect candidate to become Robocop. Murphy's wife agrees with the procedure. When he wakes up it turns out that all that's left of him are his chest contents, neck, head, and a single hand. Initially he wants to be killed but eventually accepts his role as Robocop thanks to the understanding scientist named Norton. Murphy has enough emotions, but he's not quite as efficient as the machine soldiers. So they tinker a bit more with what's left of his brain and get him up to machine speed. They also provide him with the entire law enforcement database on crimes. What interests him is solving the crime against him. He becomes too emotional so Norton has to reduce his hormones. Now he's completely unemotional just as he's introduced to the public.He solves crimes briskly, US Congress repeals he law banning military/law enforcement machines on US soil, Omnicorp is happy. Not happy is Murphy's wife who doesn't recognize her zombified husband and is not even allowed to see him. When he confronts Murphy and when he sees his son, he starts producing hormones again and develops emotions. He again looks into the crime against him and his investigation leads him to some pretty big fish. Omnicorp can't have that so they shut him down and take over Norton's lab. Norton reboots Murphy who now has to go after Sellars.I wasn't expecting much of Robocop but once I saw Jose Padilha's name attached to it, I became more optimistic. Direction is excellent and so are the performances by the cast. Cinematography is also good, the movie is bright and crisp. Kinnaman's Robocop has some charisma even in robot-model. Problem is that for a good part of the movie he doesn't get to say a whole lot. Action is good without being overdone and without frying your brain. But it's the story that shines and how it addresses relevant issues today. After having been on life support for more than a decade enthusiastically selling everything the establishment wanted, Hollywood's brains (and morals) are starting to show signs of life. In Robocop we get to see the rotten marriage between the corporate military industrial complex and government and how usually the most damaging decisions for the country (and the world) are sold as being for the sake of "safety and security", for "our children" and all the usual cheap propaganda, when in fact it's all about money all the time and about creating war everywhere and a militarized police state at home. Together with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Robocop is the second movie that touches upon civil liberty issues in an era of total media subservience to out-of-control power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The big dumb action movie is an integral piece of the cinema world. Everything about it is larger than life and it provides audiences with an escape that is far more unbelievable and fantastical than, say dramatic masterpieces like The Godfather or critically acclaimed comedies like Annie Hall. The best big dumb action movies give us an invincible hero to root for, a super villain to hate, and enormous stakes at hand. Die Hard, Terminator, Aliens? these are all big dumb action movies that people dissect, discuss and debate over. Robocop tries to stumble its way into the lineup of big dumb action movies but the end result is just dumb. There's nothing truly big about this movie, save for the ED-209 robots that appear once in the very beginning of the film and then of course once again at the very end in the only actually exciting sequence of the entire movie. This film takes place in Detroit, a major American city, and yet it doesn't feel like we're in a city. In fact, I don't really know where we are half the time. Most of the film takes place in small places (The Murphy home, police headquarters, a lab in OmniCorp that nearly every single character somehow has access to??!!) It's a very claustrophobic experience for no discernible reason.Robocop is also very short on action. There are a few explosions throughout, but short of a training sequence set to the tune of "If I Only Had a Heart" from The Wizard of Oz (get it? Don't worry, if the joke flew over your head you'll get the chance to hear it again 376 more times before the credits roll) and the final confrontation at OmniCorp headquarters, this movie is a bore. Of course I'm speaking for myself here. You might find footage of Robocop riding his motorcycle exciting. If so, great news! There are no less than 5 different instances of Detective Murphy cruising around on his hog. Remember when I said there were several explosions? At least 3 of them are the exact same scene of Murphy's death. It's as if director Jose Padilha thought we forgot what happened in the first 15 minutes of the movie so he threw us a bone and reminded us at various intervals throughout.What Robocop excels at is DUMB. This movie is dumb right down to its core which, like Alex Murphy's, is just barely holding on to life and sure to die without the assistance of modern technology. Let's touch on what's left of Murphy after the first time they show him explode. His face, heart and lungs are all kept going by some kind of respirator and then for some bullshit fan-service pandering reason? one hand is kept alive? It looks ridiculous just floating there by itself, truly a sight to behold, and for what? Just to say to the fans, "Hey remember his hand from the first movie? Am I right? Movies, huh guys?" This film does a lot of fan-service nods to the original that tend to take you right out of it entirely. That would normally be a bad thing, but since the original Robocop is far superior to this turd, any and all distractions are welcome.Speaking of distractions, Samuel L. Jackson puts on his Frederick Douglass wig and pops up every once in a while to do a Bill O'Reilly impression. He's a right wing pundit who hosts his own show where apparently all he talks about is how America needs robots on its own soil to keep crime down. I get that they're going for satire here because the original movie is satire. The original Robocop is not a big dumb action movie. It's a smart, biting satire of crime, violence, urban decay and our overreactions to them as a fearful society. That this movie even attempts the satire of the original is at worst insulting to the audience and at best laughable.Let's talk about pacing for a minute because the filmmakers never bothered to. At no point during this movie did I have any sense of when or where. We jump forward weeks and months at a time. I know this because it says so on the screen but I don't feel like we've gone anywhere. For a film that moves forward in time as often as it does, maybe you should have had more than two outfits for Michael Keaton to wear? It honestly feels like you're watching SNL jump from one sketch to another. There are no segues, no lead-ins, no dramatic lingering shots. It's just here's a scene, here's another scene, here's another scene. And it goes on and on like that the entire time. At one point I wrote the following in my notes: "What is going on??"In the end Robocop utterly fails to draw you into its world because it doesn't even know what world it wants to live in. It's kind of an action movie but not really. It's kind of doing satire but you should totally take it seriously. It's got a little sci-fi but then completely bails on explaining any of the mysteries that angle proposes (emotions interfere with the software, no one knows why). It feels like the director saw a picture of Robocop, looked it up on Wikipedia and read the first paragraph then got distracted by an ad for the new season of Cougar Town and outsourced the screenplay to the Youtube comment section.Your prime directive is to stay away from Robocop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely different movie than 1987 RoboCop - Thank God!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this. Thankfully, they kept the premise but not the story line of the first movie, making a completely original film. That works in their favor, since the 1987 film did NOT need to be remade! This one was entertaining throughout and featured some fine performances and effects.Whereas the 1987 film was overtly satirical, this one has some satirical elements, but they are more subtle. And the first one was a film about losing one's humanity and then finding it again, while in this one the protagonist pretty much retains his humanity throughout and faces a different struggle: figuring out how to cope with his condition and consciously overcome obstacles. There is also more focus on secondary characters.I would recommend this to ANYONE who likes action or sci-fi movies. 4/5 stars.</fullReview>

And I said oh boy! Iran. Samuel Jackson plays the conservative TV host. Here we go! Machines have no soul and a patriot should support the war somewhere. I was ready to step outside and ask for my money back.Only that the new look looks good. The sound is good.In the end, this turned out to be a different movie from the original. The original was about Murphy. This one is about you and me, the viewer. How do you feel about certain issues of today.The new Robocop (the movie) is not perfect. But it is well over the regular superhero story. Maybe changing the name would have helped. This is not the same movie and from I have read people expected a simple remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the original Robocop when I was a kid. The original movie had humor and political satire, and it was trying to tell some important thing, other than "there is a cop who is a cyborg". It span some sequels a cartoon and a TV series most of them of questionable quality.I did not had high hopes for the reboot but I was gonna watch it because I like SF stuff. And when I don't have high hopes usually I get a little satisfied (considering I wait worst).This movie is even worst than expected! Yes, there is action, special effects and some interesting actors, and somewhere maybe some good ideas by the director, but if you are interesting in the story of a movie, just don't see this. The story has serious holes, or stupid plots that have no meaning. I find it very boring to point the bad stuff.And let's just not consider the original... This movie has nothing to say, except maybe some pointless stuff and the story does not make any sense if you think about it. The changes made in the origin of Robocop are pointless and feel just for the sake of change. The is no real reason to happen almost any of the stuff happening in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cracking film, wish I hadn't listened to the naysayers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I like and own the 1987 version but was intrigued by the prospect of a reboot after 27 years. I heard about the lower age rating and all the negativity and decided against seeing at the cinema.I wish I hadn't.I watched it last night on DVD and thought it was a fabulously entertaining film. I'm not really sure what people were expecting. I don't want a carbon copy of the original film otherwise I'd simply watch that. I don't want something that promises to be a reboot (Spiderman) but contains the exact same failings as the originals or promises to be a reboot (Star Trek) and then does everything it can to weave a twisting story to keep in a character from the old series.Yes I like gore and violence but is that really what made the film Robocop? Can the themes of putting a man in a machine only be explained through the vision of claret and exploding limbs? The simple answer is no.What we have here is a film that pays respect to its former film but is still trying to be its own film and I respect that. I found Murphy's character was well played and I didn't find his wife and child sickly and annoying. Keaton and Oldman were excellent turning in great performances. The evolution of the story was well handled with a satisfying and entertaining run through of his near fatal wounding and then return as Robocop.The thought that has gone behind his suit and his operating systems were very clever and his look was so badass. I loved how you could see how he was processing crime scene data and visualing it together.All the tech on display was first rate, had weight and presence and I found the action scenes, even the shoot out at the beginning, to be really well handled. There was little shaky cam (a trick I can't abide) and the scenes were not diminished by a lack of blood everywhere. You were invested enough in the characters and the reason for the scene to not be concerned that I wasn't seeing a head torn apart.I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was entertaining, clever, action packed, intelligent and funny. After seeing it I knew I had to buy it on DVD both to own it and also because the makers deserve recognition for their impressive efforts in this film.To put my opinion in context (so that others can judge whether it has validity) my top three films are District 9, Forrest Gump and The Last samurai.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too sleek, even for a robot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a mixed bag. While having an interesting premise and a good ensemble of actors, it lacks in execution, and RoboCop never really takes off. As an action movie, it's scenes are neither flashy nor gritty, and just ends up too sleek. As a sci-fi, it fails to create a sense of awe or stir imagination.Even from the first scene, the pacing and feel of the movies seems off. It is like the director was borrowing from different sources rather than using his own sense of style, and the result is a lack of "oomph". The scenes that are made to stir emotions fail at it, as both acting and soundtrack seem unengaged. I have seen Padilha's (the director) Tropa de Elite movies, and I enjoyed both very much, as the naturalistic telling of the story still had some style and definite emotion. Here, everything is left lacking, and the end product just feels unpolished, or even worse, too sleek. It could be because it was not Padilha's kind of movie to begin with, or possibly because the studio exec's forced his hand. The end product is, either way, somewhat lackluster.And that is a shame, as the underlying themes deserve better treatment. The movie could have made better use of the questions it raises, such as free will ("consciousness is just information processing"), the difference between man and machine, and the human need to have a being capable of moral judgment having its finger on the trigger. It also touches other themes such as corruption, corporate greed, and the spin and influence of media. Despite touching these themes, it delivers no insights or even worthy quotes.Having seen the original, though many years ago, I have my suspicions on where this remake falls short. First, it waters down the emotional connection to the main character (RoboCop) by making the family scenes too clich, without any individual flavour, and by making his death scene too sudden and too "clean". Children that managed to see the original RoboCop had nightmares about Murphy's death, and this car bomb pales in every comparison. Second, the societal commentary and criticism of the original was delivered with more intelligence and emotion, by humour and wit. Here, any societal commentary seems too heavy-handed. And third, the original had Murphy starting his RoboCop days as a machine, which then slowly becomes human. This created a progression and an interesting narrative. To have Murphy wake up as his own human self, and then later become "dehumanized", robs us of that progression to a large degree.To me, the fact that I saw the original RoboCop back in the days as a kid is actually what got me both interested and through this movie. So I nostalgia can also have a positive effect. With that said, I welcome reboots, this just was not the right one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, with some strange reviews and opinions, that make me really doubt the actual reasons of some of the reviewers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll just come by to say that I watched this movie with the lowest expectations possible, all I really wanted was to watch something like the first movie of the "Iron Man" franchise, starred by Robert Downey Jr. And I was wrong. That's not what I've got when I watched it. I've got a movie that comes with a story that has a lot more depth than any super-hero movie. This is NOT a super hero movie - let's be clear about that. So I hear a lot of comparisons between this and "Iron Man". "Robocop" has nothing to do with "Iron Man","Spider Man", "Captain America", "The Avengers"... And the original movie didn't and this one doesn't as well.The transformation of Alex Murphy into a machine while also being manipulated for private corporate interests that have only interest in winning a political battle that will lead to increased profits it's the main storyline of this movie and it's a nice premise, full of potential.It's true that none of the actors have actually delivered anything close to a standout performance. It seems to me that the idea was for Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton, in their supporting roles, to be the standouts, since Joel Kinnaman's role needed him to be emotionless and act like a machine sometimes. I think that was a mistake. Padilha should have focused on the situation of his family, his own identity crisis and also that of his son having trouble to recognize his own father and not seeing him as some type of artificial replacement, a situation also endured by his wife that now has a husband made of steel instead of flesh. But I don't know if they WANTED "Robocop" to go that deep.In a way I think Padilha wanted to make this movie more meaningful than the normal movie of this type, but he couldn't go too deep, so the movie stands somewhere in between, an action flick that you can turn your brain off and just enjoy like "Captain America and The Winter Soldier" or a movie that tells a more meaningful story, like for example the original Robocop from 1987. In the end he might have failed to be either and that is the biggest criticism that I have about this movie.Now what I find interesting is the reviews in general, in this website and everywhere else. There is something strange about them, people tell the reasons why they didn't like this movie, but somehow I am 100% sure that those reasons aren't their actual reasons. The only question to me is, which are the actual reasons? Because I can't really find why.This movie is not a masterpiece and honestly, the original movie is much better in every aspect. But what I'm doing here is judging the movie as it is by itself, not comparing it with the original and maybe most people couldn't do that. I think that maybe this movie would be better accepted by some people if it wasn't named "Robocop".Even with that, most of the opinions that I hear and read about this movie are very confusing. Things like the lack of an antagonist, the battle against ED-209 being underwhelming, they all seem to be made by super-hero fans that wanted a super hero movie and a comic book-like movie, which aren't lacking nowadays, honestly and anyway not what Robocop ever was.In a way I watched this movie without thinking about the original Robocop, because I wasn't expecting it to be similar (and honestly... Who was expecting that, with a PG-13?). The original and this one are so different from each other that I never actually could relate them.But it has some merits of his own and I think they can be appreciated. It's not a masterpiece, like I said before, but it's definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part Action, Part Drama, All Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a remake of an '80s action movie about a robot with a human brain shooting up drug dealers, Robocop is surprisingly low-key at times. In fact, it's almost too restrained. Directed by Jos Padilha and set in a near-future United States, the film follows the travails of Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman), a Detroit police officer so dreadfully injured by an explosion that he must be reborn with a mechanical body.Once you get past trying to say the title Robocop with a straight face, there's actually a lot of potential here. What makes someone human? Memories and emotions, or flesh and blood? How much freedom must be sacrificed in the name of peace? Which is more corruptible, human beings or machines made by human beings? How trustworthy is something without free will? What is free will, anyway? All of these questions are glanced at in the film, but none are dealt with directly. It's hard to tell whether the movie is leaving the audience to form their own decisions, or whether its creators simply lacked the desire to explore the philosophical issues in any depth.For those unconcerned with the peripheral treatment of ethical dilemmas, Robocop is comfortably paced and offers some respectable but unspectacular action sequences. Much of the original film's grim whimsey is absent, but some subtle humour is provided by Samuel Jackson as the highly opinionated TV personality Pat Novak. There are a few nice touches in the musical score, including an all-too-brief appearance of Basil Poledouris' theme for the 1987 film, and a caustically amusing use of "if I only had a heart" from The Wizard of Oz. The cast is uninspired but solid and would serve the film admirably if the leading man were only a bit more compelling.Given that the dramatic core of the movie consists of a human mind trapped in a mechanical body, it would help tremendously if Alex Murphy actually had a distinctive human personality to contrast with the robot. Unfortunately, he's utterly bland and two-dimensional even before the metal limbs are attached and the corporate-sponsored doctor (played by Gary Oldman) starts messing with his emotional responses. There isn't a twitch or a quirk of speech to distinguish him from the hoard of other generic "decent guys" in movies. While the script and director must shoulder a large part of the blame, little good can be said of Kinnaman. His performance isn't wooden, exactly, but it lacks most of the little details that would have made Murphy a likable and interesting character.A flat hero might be more forgivable if Robocop were just another mindless action movie, but it's clearly trying to be a good deal more. A respectable amount of screen time is devoted to Murphy's family (played by Abbie Cornish and a pleasantly understated John Paul Ruttan) and to the people responsible for his transformation. The movie wants to have an emotional arc keeping pace with the flying bullets, but it doesn't quite manage. It seems that Padilha set himself the ambitious and admirable task of combining mechanized crime-busting action with a futuristic drama. The resulting hybrid is ? like the title character ? a bit of both worlds, but far from the best of either.http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/robocop-action-mediocre</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did everything have to be the opposite of the original?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I refused to watch this at the cinema, as far as I was concerned, it was a remake too far. The original is rightly held in high esteem by a lot of people, I loved the original, its sequel wasn't anywhere near as strong but still had redeeming features, and RoboCop 3 was just a sad descent for a once decent character.This move is quite simply a by the numbers "what can we do to make it different from the original?", there's no rhyme or reason for wanting to change stuff, but its almost like some bean counters listed all of the stuff that made the original memorable and then just arbitrarily changed each item to the opposite.Lewis? Lets make Lewis a man, and black. Alex Murphy? Lets change it from not knowing who he is to knowing who he is right from the off. Mode of transport? The original had a car, lets give him a bike. The original RoboCop was silver, lets make him black. Etc, etc, etc.I wouldn't mind the changes if they served a real point in change, but mostly they were just pointless.What about the bad guys? Well Vallon is for the most part the bad guy, but he's so poorly developed, he is literally a tiny shadow of Clarence Boddicker in the original. In fact, some of the minor characters in the original were better developed than this ones supposed main bad guy.The thing is, the movie has some hints of not greatness, but certainly "thats not bad!". The start where OCP's ED-209's and other drones and robots are patrolling in the Middle East, those were some pretty good scenes, the movie was trying to say something, but later on just decided to not bother.Samuel L Jackson... too much of him for the part he played, but hey, at least he got some character development, if only Vallon got the same treatment! In all honesty, its not a terrible movie, but I see no point in taking a well liked movie, and then going out of your way to fundamentally change what made it so great in the first place.The original RoboCop didn't rely on great VFX, they didn't have the budget for it, and yes, for some modern audiences, they'll think some of the VFX are clunky, but for a lot of us, we treat it as a stylistic choice that just kinda works.The action setpieces for the most part other than the ED-209 fight was pretty slack in comparison to the original as well.Certainly the remakes VFX were far superior in every way that mattered except the most important...... the look of RoboCop itself.At no point did I feel that Joel Kinnaman was in anything other than an amped up SWAT suit with body armour. The original..... Peter Weller looked and moved like a robot, the original suit is so damned iconic, its as ridiculous as someone proposing a change to the look of the Predator or Alien or Terminator, the original suit just looked and felt better.I don't hate the remake, but I feel vindicated that I didn't goto the cinema to see it, its the only kind of protest I can make that is worth a damn.What I will say is that the film makers were damned no matter what they did. If they did a straight up remake of the original RoboCop, people would be berating them for an unnecessary remake, if the go in their own direction, then they will be criticised for taking it too far away from the original.Frankly, they should have just left well alone, they knew the kind of uphill battle they were going to face in taking on such a movie as RoboCop, and still had the nerve to do it, and failed.Everyone knew this would be the case except MGM and Sony.If they are prepared to take on a sacred cow like RoboCop, and one of Paul Verhoevens best, what else is destined for a remake no-one wants? Sad times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very smart movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost 30 years ago, Paul Verhoeven gave us a Robocop hampered by Asimov like rules that prohibited him to harm its creators. Other than that it was just a man in an armor, feeling, loving, hating and making decisions based on his conscience. The bad guys were psychotic anarchists who cared only about violence and drugs, a proper reflection of the money grabbing owners of OCP. For the 80's it was a classic revenge movie, with Robocop destroying his enemies and good defeating evil.Here comes the remake, the one that was supposed to be a standard Hollywood movie filled with special effects and with no much else to talk about. But it is not. Instead it may be the best exploration of human machine interaction this year, far beyond The Machine and, I suspect, Transcendence. Joel Kinnaman is not Peter Weller, though, and that is what hurt the film most, in my view. But I understand it, even if probably it was not the intention of the movie makers. It is much more interesting to discuss the possibilities of the human/machine hybrid and the topics addressed by the 2014 remake are well above anything in the 1987 original.I loved the part where the tactical abilities of Robocop are all software based. The scientist "fixes" his human hesitation by creating a "battle mode" in which the computer runs the game but sends to the brain the illusion that it is in control. Bravo for that! Even if the movie would have sucked, this bit alone made it worth it. It is all scientifically correct and I applaud the courage to show it in a film. The script then proceeds to show us how changes in the hormonal balance of Robocop alter behavior, how media rhetoric alters public opinion and political decisions and even touches on the effects that robotization would have on international politics and warfare. I also loved the bit about "remember, we don't want to kill them, we just need to die on TV". Brilliant!I felt that the minimal design of the non-robotic part of Robocop was a bit too much and quite unnecessary, but I loved the idea that there is a kernel that stays the same and then gets plugged in whatever body they build. I really would like to see different body templates for the second part.Bottom line: my definition of science fiction is something that makes you think about it and the possibilities it opens well after watching the film or reading the book. Robocop 2014 delivers on that and that is why I rate it well above average. The technical aspects, the ethical aspects and the political aspects have been explored to a level unexpected in a Hollywood film and I am really curious if they can keep this up, or maybe even surpass it, in the sequels. Well done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved all the original Robocop movies. All single one of them. If you are like me, and compare the remakes with the originals, you are not going to like this flick. With so many FX, CGI and other endless possibilities of special effects, how come the FX from the original movies were much entertaining than these? I'm not saying that they were better, just more appropriated to the movie and to the scenes. Someone thought about Jos Padilha to direct this movie because someone remember the "favela storming police attacking scenes" from Tropa de Elite. It's reminds you when you watch some action scenes, multi targeting and shooting, bullets flying sequences. A little disappointing. A weak, non original enough, remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Bland, but Kevin Hart is great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In January, studios normally release crap. Most critics will spend this month catching up on the prestigious Academy-recognized films. When a film like "Ride Along" gets released Jan. 17 and stays number one consecutively at the box office for three weeks, it draws attention. However, its box-office triumphs are not due to the film's success in comedy and action, but rather its secret weapon in casting: Kevin Hart. While advertised as another buddy-cop comedy, audiences will remember Hart's character, Ben, above all else. Rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube does a fine job as the angry, straight cop James who wants to deter Ben from joining the police squad, as well as the disapproving older brother for Ben's fiance. The setup is interesting, and at 99 minutes, teases an episodic adventure on this horrific ride along devised by James. The film instead tries to incorporate the subplot into the main story- line through Hart's character, which is fine, only if the film had an interesting central mystery. The action is fair, including standard car chases, shootouts and fights in between the jokes, all equally bland as the next. But the true star of the film is Hart. His antics make the film worth watching. It's hard not to appreciate the man for his physicality on top of rapid-fire delivery. It's the same manic delivery that's present in his other comedies. There's a moment partway through the film where Hart pretends to be someone else, and you see why it's his film. It's a scene that's equally tense and fun to watch, all due to Hart's talent and charisma. His co-star, Ice Cube, can pretty much play this role in his sleep at this point, repeating essentially what he did in films such as "All About the Benjamins" or "21 Jump Street." But he does it well plays off of Hart. Seeing the two together is actually reminiscent of his pairing with Chris Tucker on "Friday," with Hart bringing his own comedic sensibility. Despite the fun performances, "Ride Along" can't shake its mediocre procedural. The reveal is predictable and the plot relies heavily on luck and coincidence to make an attempt at really keeping its main characters on screen together. A sequel is already being written, so fans should expect to see these characters back in action again. Overall: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different take on the story but on par with the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, don't go to the theater expecting to see the 1987 classic with new visuals. It is a different movie with the same core story (cop killed, cop turned Robocop, Robocop solves crime) and core elements but with new face. At the higher layer, it is a big social/political commentary on corporate and media manipulation and politics. At the middle layer, it is a good story about instrumentalization of humanity and science by corporations. At the lower layer, it is about the transformation of a man into a thing and the family broken by this process.I thought this movie would be bad but it is pretty good. 9 just because it has a few minutes when the pace slows down a bit but it comes back with guns blazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet Another Listless, Unnecessary Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robocop (2014) begins with Samuel L. Jackson yelling through the television set for what I'm assuming is an editorial news broadcast. He presents a world where warzones are under surveillance and "protection" of complex unmanned drones. These drones vary in size and function yet its clear from the get-go the people who deal with them daily aren't exactly happy about it. We cut back to Jackson and his insistence that a Federal Law outlawing the use of drones for domestic policing and surveillance is a load of horse-pucky.This is the backdrop behind Robocop which informs the rest of the story. The corporate giant Omnicorp and its CEO (Michael Keaton) wants the law repealed and sees putting a human face on a machine as the winning ticket. That's when we're introduced to beleaguered Detroit PD detective Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman), the victim of a car explosion set in motion by a ruthless capo and a group of corrupt cops.The original 1987 movie directed by Paul Verhoeven didn't focus too much on the technology and its implications opting to make a stylized, ultra-violent opus that wore it's satire on its sleeve. This new rendering however decides satire should take a backseat to semi-serious discussions on what it means to be truly human. Both Alex and his salvager Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) lose pieces of themselves as Alex's body is exploited for the sake of profit. Norton explains that during combat Alex is given the illusion of freewill but in reality has no control of non-hesitant robotic husk.All this quasi-philosophical stuff would be interesting if it weren't plopped on such a featureless film. First off Dr. Norton's musings are apportioned not to give context but to fill in plot holes; never a good sign when you're trying to make a larger social point. Secondly, the main driving point of the film is continually undermined by scenes involving Keaton and his ilk fastidiously problem solving for the sake of their corporation's survival. Placed in a context, what they do plays out as understandable not deplorable.Thirdly, the Detroit of the original movie was a dystopian nightmare and Omnicorp was a downright villainous entity, gentrifying neighborhoods, dismantling public unions, covering up problems with boldfaced lies. In Robocop 2.14, the city is said to be violent but you can never tell by the various aerial shots of downtown all clean and nice looking (now we know where the special effects budget went). Not once was I convinced of Omnicorp's evilness, instead I almost sympathized with their venture, though I fail to see how public opinion about drones would change when putting organics in the system. They're in the market to produce robotics not make a bunch of Robocops.If this movie is supposed to be anti-authoritarian, anti-big business and pro-human it missed its mark by a wide margin. Robocop is an efficient crime-fighter when not bogged down with pesky human emotions. When his human side does takes over he's not only inhibited by his emotions, he becomes unjustifiably violent. The drones that Omnicorp builds are likewise efficient and safe as evidenced not only by the first scene involving a "red target" reporter but near the end when Alex's former partner (Michael K. Williams) puts himself in the line of fire and remains unharmed. If I had to choose between having Robocop or a drone protecting me, within the context of the film, I'd choose the drone.Not even the violence in this film is done right! The original had enough bloodletting to start a butcher shop. Joe Padilha was a laudable choice to direct given his experience with ultra-violence in his Elite Squad (2007-2010) films yet here everything seems sanitized and boring. I should have been tipped off by the PG-13 rating.Not violent enough, not thoughtful enough, not anti-authoritarian enough, not satirical enough; that should be the tagline to this listless remake. It only serves to be a temporary respite for action-junkies long-awaiting summer blockbuster season and can't possibly be the best Hollywood has to offer. There was a time not too long ago when the City of Detroit seriously considered erecting a statue downtown to commemorate the movie. While even I admit that idea is ridiculous, the fact that some found it plausible should give the studio responsible for this boring adaptation reason to pause. Have respect for the source material, it's all Detroit has left for godsake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had this immediately marked down as ROBOFLOP . Hollywood has the temerity to remake Paul Verhoeven's original , one of the most brutal , bloody and oh so enjoyable films of the 1980s ! That comes close to sacrilege and the very lukewarm reviews this remake received on its release meant that if I wasn't going to literally burn the film I should at the very least put it on the backburner . By chance I came upon it and watched through terminal boredom I wasn't expecting much and at least it wasn't as terrible as I was expecting but by the same token it's not some instant classic that surpasses the original and falls very short . It does get off to a good start with Samuel L Jackson as an anchorman hosting a broadcast that is obviously based on Fox News . The good start continues with Alex Murphy aand his partner going undercover trying to infiltrate a street gang and find out what corrupt cops have been supplying them with weapons . This is one of the better aspects of the film since director Jose Padilha first came to my attention with the ELITE SQUAD films where a pair of incorruptible supercops try to clean up corruption in their own precinct in the slums of Rio This early promise proved to be a bit too premature and the story quickly turns in to a typical Hollywood movie of its era . To be fair to Padilha I wasn't constantly thinking I was watching a travesty of the original ROBOCOP but was aware I was watching something similar to a superhero movie , a sub-genre that usually leaves me cold . As cyborg Murphy races through the streets of Detroit on a high powered motorbike I was often reminded of Spiderman swinging through New York or Batman in the Batmobile . There's also another aspect all too painfully shoehorned in to Hollywood movies and that is the mawkish nuclear family A little kid "Oh dad" A little kid "Oh mommy and daddy" Looking on the bright side there's no family dog but when you've got a pretty blond wife with tears streaming down her face that her husband has been turned in to a Cyberman there's probably little reason to throw Fido in to the mix All in all a rather average and generic commercial action thriller for those not expecting much</fullReview>

In the Infinite Wisdom of Brain-Dead Hollywood Billionaires those Things are Removed and in its Place is this Tepid, PG-13, Lifeless, Boring, Reboot that is Insufferable.The Character is a Pop-Culture Icon and just will Not Stand for this Type of a Corporate Chicken-Out. On the Blu-ray the Movie is Prefaced with an Ad for the Video Game Based on this Movie.That is Kinda Laughable since this is a Movie Based on a Movie that Looks just like a Video Game Minus the Cool Violence of a Video Game. In Other Words this Movie has No Clue. Oh Yea, and let's make His Body Suit BLACK. Sheesh. It is so Shallow and Witless that the Result can be Nothing More than an Insult. Fans and Critics saw through this from the Get-Go.The Film was Universally Panned for its Unwise Geo-Political Propaganda and its Soulless Demeanor and for just being an Awful Movie. This Action Movie's Action is Seen Through a Computer Screen Most of the Time and Guess What? There is Not a Drop of Blood to be Seen in All this Chaos, World War, and Gang Related Stuff. The Kicker is the Scene where Policeman Alex Murphy is Put Out of Action by a Car Bomb that (get this) Shoves Him to Ground a Few Feet Away and is Shown sort of just Knocked Out. The Next Thing We Know he is a Torso on Life Support. This Anemic and Critical Scene was Thought to be so Impressive that it is Shown Repeatedly in this Reprehensible Remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than I expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the original Robocop, but I like this one much more. Good story, much less violent and well directed. It is very unlike the first movie, much more emotional elements in this one. Did not feel like watching a remake at all. Stop reading the review from hereon. The following is just a filler to pass IMDb review requirements. This viewer simply cannot accept that Robocop 2014 is anywhere near as bad as people are rating it. For starters, the film has been bashed mercilessly for idiotically trivial elements such as "His hand is human!", "His suit is black!", or worst of all, "I refuse to support a PG-13 version of Robocop". It is my firm belief that all of these criticisms are merely the ravings of closed-minded fanboys who are (bizarrely) searching for the next movie to "ruin their childhood". It's a phenomenon that is baffling and absurd. Anyway, I rated the film 10/10 on IMDb because I wanted the score to weigh heavier in the positive direction. Truth be told, I think the film is a solid 8 and may even grow to become a 9 over time. Of course it's not as good as Verhoeven's classic, and obviously it's much different in tone. For that I am grateful -- part 2 tried so desperately to ape the original that it felt like a rather soulless carbon copy (albeit a copy salvaged somewhat by spectacular stop-motion effects and a great villain in Tom Noonan's "Cain"). I didn't want another movie trying to mimic the satire of the original, nor did I feel that anyone could ever one-up the hyper-violence of the 1987 version, so why try?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inoffensive, but very ordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the industry's recent penchant for mediocre remakes, I was ready to hate "RoboCop". Truth is, it's not a bad movie, but it is what you'd expect from something like this: very safe, bland. And also fairly lifeless, even with such an emphasis placed on Murphy's humanity.Easily the movie's best feature is its cast. Michael Keaton is your usual generic corporate sleaze, but the role comes with Keaton's natural charisma. Gary Oldman's performance is the high point (as usual). And easily the worst feature is Samuel L Jackson in his Fox News media segments. I like Jackson, but talk about belaboring the point.It's really all just execution with this movie. Something like this deserves R-rated bite, and the action is chroreographed like a video game. There's no real villain here (Vallon never registers as a threat, and you're much better off not comparing him to Clarence Boddicker). It just seems like such a wasted opportunity to not do something cool with this. I mean, why set the bar so low and just meet it? And as an action movie, there's nothing here that "Dredd" hasn't already done. And better.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought this movie was going to be terrible based on a lot of what I had read...I was wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will keep this simple. Is it much like the original? No. Robocop 2014 is a creative re-imagining of its original concept it has echos of its original blueprint and thats about it.The other thing to keep in mind if your a fan of the original franchise this movie is not the R rated thrill fest of sex and violence that the 1984 version is.Having said that, unlike a lot of pictures in this type of SciFi genre I never once found myself saying "yeah right" or having to suspend my understanding of reality to make the picture work. In that respect this picture is a cut above a lot of other picture in this genre in recent years. In that way it is better than the first Robocop. The acting is good and the players all do their jobs serviceably well.The plot while not super is reasonable and moves along. The action is fun and peppy, some of it even bordered on original. Robocop 2014s biggest issue as a film is probably that it suffers from a case of anti- climax. The filmmakers decided to stick with the quasi-realistic tone the film had taken from the start being true to this meant the films events could not realistically be resolved quickly or cleanly. It really was a pleasant surprise. The film even had a mildly thoughtful social commentary buried in there if you choose to look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Human than Machine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review may contain some spoilers. Please don't read if you don't want to know. I found that this film focused more on the human element than the machine. The original had only a couple of moments when it seemed that he was at odds with what had happened to him and his family. Such as when he was at his house and had flashbacks of his son and wife and when he was sitting with Lewis in the factory and was talking about his family. This film gives us a much deeper and more human hero. He goes through the emotions and depression that any of us would given the circumstances. Then he has to try to reconnect with his family feeling as though he is no longer the man they loved. The older movie had him a robot finding his humanity. This film is about a man being used by the corporation that made him. His mind is toyed with to the point where he is a literal zombie robot just like the EM208. Then he finds his way out of the maze to become Murphy once again. Though the older one gave us action and blood galore it is nice to see a film focus on the more realistic situation a man like this would go through. Let's not forget how many men now and in the past and future will know how he feels. To feel like you are less of a human being and yet having to try to find a way to live on and put things back together. Accept the humanity of this film and it will show you a great emotional roller-coaster of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead or Alive, You Shouldn't See This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard they're remaking RoboCop, I was not pleased. Because there's really no need to remake RoboCop. It was a smart, clever film that had a surprising amount of nuance while having kick-a$$ action. So I didn't care for the idea behind it and after seeing the trailer, nothing changed my mind. But is the remake as bad as I thought it was gonna be? Let's find out!This RoboCop follows Detriot policeman Alex Murphy who gets critically-injured after a criminal implants a bomb on his car. He survives, but just barely, so a multinational conglomerate named OmniCorp steps in by putting what's left of him in a robot body to continue serving the force as RoboCop. However, Murphy is challenged by the fact that he's still part-man as he still has all the emotions of a normal human being. So OmniCorp resorts to shutting off his emotions to get him to function the way they want.I am gonna get this right out of the way, I fwcking HATED this movie. This really wasn't good at all. But before I tear it apart, what's good about it? Well, most of the actors outside of Joel Kinnaman as RoboCop, give decent performances. Gary Oldman has empathy and compassion as Dr. Norton, a scientist with a good heart working under a ruthless corporation. Michael Keaton does well as the heartless CEO of OmniCorp, Raymond Sellers. And Jackie Earle Haley offers some nice comic relief in a mostly humorless film as the military trainer, Rick. Not all the characters(such as Murphy's wife, who just cries the whole film or Murphy's partner in the force, Jack Lewis, who barely gets anything to do after the first 10 minutes) were written well, but none of the actors outside of Joel were bad, they all did fine enough jobs.Some of the designs were good. I liked ED-209's redesign and RoboCop's grey suit, was a nice update. Not a fan of the black suit, though. The CGI was well-done throughout and the fight at the end with RoboCop facing off against the ED-209s was kinda cool. And... that's about it.What bothered me about this film, was how little credit the script gave to the audience. There is absolutely no subtlety at all to this film. All the themes and messages the filmmakers want you to walk away with after seeing this are constantly shoved to your face and down your throat. For example, the film touches on how using automated military forces to oppress foreign countries is barbaric and uncivilized in a sub-plot, and this wouldn't be necessarily a bad topic to discuss, except for the fact that they LITERALLY spell out the whole message behind this sub-plot towards the end with Sam Jackson saying "Some of you may even think that using these military robots makes us the same, bullying imperialists that our forefathers were trying to escape." And most of the dialogue from the Omnicorp folks is about the moral implications of what they've done to Murphy. It's like the writers thought their script was so deep and nuanced that... they have to outright EXPLAIN it to the audience. Here's an advice for any aspiring filmmaker, don't have all your dialogue be ABOUT the themes and messages you're trying to get across. It doesn't make your writing sophisticated, it just makes you look pretentious and distrusting on your audience's IQ.The drama was just poorly handled. Murphy's arc is a mess. He goes from being a normal guy with a cyborg body, to an emotionless drone, and then back to human. What's the point of having him change like this? Why not just have him go from robotic to human? Kinda like that OTHER film? And every time there's a dramatic scene, the score goes all sappy and the actors make it feel like a soap opera. I mean, come on, this is RoboCop! I know you need drama in it but did it have to be done like this?This movie wasn't even entertaining. It takes an HOUR for him to become RoboCop and even when he does, there's barely any action going on and the little we get is so banal and forgettable. In this version, Murphy can actually run and jump which you'd think would make for some cool action scenes, right? Wrong! 90% of the action were just boring shootouts with no tension, no suspense, and no impact because of the lack of violence. I never worried for RoboCop's life because even though that they mentioned he CAN be killed if the enemy has enough heavy firepower, there's never a moment where he SERIOUSLY gets his a$$ kicked to the point where he looks like he could die. Why can't they have him fight the ED-209s a little longer and have them bust him up bad? 'Cause then, I might actually care. And there's no impact to the fights because there's no violence. The reason the original's action was memorable was not because of the masterful staging, but because it was gory and brutal. It made up for his lack of speed and agility perfectly. There's no excuse for the action being so forgettable in this when they have a budget of $100 million and a RoboCop who can run and jump.Lastly, Joel Kinnaman was just bad in the title role. As Murphy, he was boring and dull and as RoboCop, he's either just as boring, or he's trying too hard to act sad and tortured. He has to shout his balls off every time there's a dramatic scene, leaving no subtlety to his performance. He wasn't even very authoritative. In short, he sucks and comparing him to Peter Weller from the original is like comparing a pistol to a tank. No comparison.Overall, RoboCop is terrible. The script has no subtlety, character development is poor, the direction's melodramatic, the action was forgettable, and Kinnaman just sucks. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joel Kinnaman Can Act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I totally enjoyed the ride of this Robocop. The fact that I'm not a die-hard franchise fan probably helped.What this movie promised - high concept, action, quality special effects, classic good vs evil story, suspense, sensory bombardment, big name actors, emotional engagement, good old entertainment, it delivered all of these. And more. The "manned robot or not" theme is particularly timely too.I also didn't expect any actor to shine through a veiled - as in helmet-ed superhero character, and a cold, disembodied, metallic one at that. Joel Kinnaman delivered not only physical action, but more depth and emotional content than Ryan Reynold will deliver in a thousand years.I would give this Robocop an 8 for overall entertainment value, but add 2 to counter all the bashing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ROBOCOP Reboot Missing A Few Upgrades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my youth, a new ROBOCOP movie is exactly the kind of release I would rush to on the first night it was available to the public-at-large. I just knew it had the kind of big-budget goodness that was best preserved in my memory by viewing it with a crowd: big laughs always mean more when shared with an audience; exciting, frenetic action sequences usually draw collective astonishment from the crowd; and who doesn't love applauding the hero when others are present and listening? Now that I'm a bit older (if not a bit more jaded or cynical), I tend to take a week or two before watching such theatrical releases, and I try to get to a showing that's fairly light on people. Why? I'd rather not risk any undue influence in order to serve up what I feel is a much more honest and more clinical valuation of the film, definitely one not inspired by what the yuckster sitting next to me thought.I guess I'm getting' old, fans. But if I can age as nicely as the ROBOCOP franchise can, then I'm in good company. (NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters. If you're the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment. If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at 'things to come,' then read on ?)In the city of Detroit circa 2028 (seriously? Detroit is still around after its financial collapse?), police detective Alex Murphy (played with conviction by Joel Kinnaman) uncovers a criminal conspiracy that looks to implicate some high-ranking officers on his squad. At the same time, the multinational, war-mongering conglomerate OmniCorp is seeking the right candidate to put inside one of their latest creations ? an urban combat suit ? in order to expand their domestic sales and corner the market on profits. When those in Detroit decide Murphy needs to go, billionaire businessman Raymond Sellars (a greedy Michael Keaton) seizes the opportunity to put a part-man, part-robot police officer on the streets. But what happens when the former cop turned machine decides to investigate his own attempted murder?Where the original ROBOCOP (1987) was smart, smart, and smart, this new version is dumb, dumb, anddumb. It comes compliments of director Jose Padilha, relatively still fresh from acclaim rightful earned from his ELITE SQUAD 2: THE ENEMY WITHIN (which, incidentally, is a vastly better film than this is). 1987's script ? penned by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner ? was crafted almost with a winking acknowledgement to the audience: don't take any of this any more seriously as you need to, and you're likely to have great fun with it. The violence was gory and (I'll admit it) gloriously gratuitous because that kind of visual flair lent itself nicely to their intended message. Structurally, it had similarities to the great American Western ? a lone gunman seeks to clean up a corrupt town ? though there were some obvious swipes at capitalism, the ultimate 'bad guy' in anything churned out by Hollyweird in the past half century.While still being vastly superior to the ROBOCOP sequels that followed in the footsteps of the original, this 2014 reboot suffers largely from the singular distinction of being completely unnecessary. It echoes back most of the major points of the original ? OmniCorp's suits are still the villains, though with vastly bloated emphasis on corporate villainy, while Murphy's family (Abbie Cornish as Clara Murphy, along with young John Paul Ruttan as son David) get real screen time in order to ground the film in stronger 'humanity.' However, gone is that constantly winking eye; in its place is some forced histrionics dished out by everyone's favorite foul-mouthed screamer Samuel Jackson as some futuristic Fox News wannabe talking head who rarely makes logical arguments. (He does get a great laugh, though, by casting the U.S. Senate as "pro-crime.") I'm guessing filmmakers thought they were aping Bill O'Reilly, but Jackson comes off more like watered down and occasionally cocaine-fueled Stephen Colbert.Also, the first ROBOCOP distinguished itself with clever moments of newsroom satire, peppering the screen with visually exciting news stories and interviews that helped lampoon the crime-ridden world of tomorrow. Unfortunately, scripter Joshua Zetumer's story never quite figured out how to contemporize that aspect; instead, Zetumer begins throwing things at the wall hoping something might strike the same cord with audiences. At one point, he even crafts a narrator describing the action taking place on the screen (a device that goes on for far too long and desperately needed a better sound mix than the one provided if producers wanted it to be understood); instead of complementing the film, it ends up creating probably one of the most alarming 'WTF?' moments in recent film memory.The new ROBOCOP isn't a failure. Rather, I see it as a reboot missing more than a few upgrades.RECOMMENDED. Like most critics, I suspect the overwhelming question ? "Was ROBOCOP really in need of such a flavorless reboot?" ? truly kept me from enjoying this version as a legitimate sci-fi offering when director Jose Padilha served up only a competent, CGI-laden action film, one largely intended for our video-game-friendly culture. Performances work only so far as they're needed for a video game (doting wife, loyal partner, crooked cop, corporate sleaze, etc.), and the real weakness here was a deeply flawed script that could've quite figure out what it wanted to be when it grew up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not quite there......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still not sure sure why I felt the need to write a review on a film. I've never done it before, nor am I qualified or educated in the mechanics of film making or acting to be able to exact my opinions on the general public. But then neither are most film critics. So here's my review of Robocop 2014 (Contains minor spoilers)My overriding feedback on the movie is how fast it moves. I am forever reading review of movies that complain about 'how slow it is', or the first half 'dragged along'. But don't assume I mean this is a good thing, because it's not. It's too fast. Things just happen, you are left to try and catch your thoughts and just assume that the story will catch itself up. Example? on the plot summary released with the film, we are given this line ? "When Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) ? a loving husband, father and good cop doing his best to stem the tide of crime and corruption in Detroit"Now maybe I was dreaming, but I certainly didn't see any character development to show the struggles of facing corruption in the Detroit Police Force. I saw a gunfight, and a chase, that involved some bent cops. Maybe I'm a touch harsh, but as I get older, I like to see some of the background, some of the reasons why things are happening when they are.I know some people are leaving the cinemas disappointed, and many reviews from viewers seem to complain that it's nothing like the original. Let's be honest, it's impossible that was ever going to happen. The original is a dark violent comedy with an almost relentless approach to showing you how corruption is rife in large companies and the police force (we are led to believe). This movie takes a different slant, trying to somehow show us the pros and cons of allowing machines to do what humans do, while also flitting to and from his quest for revenge. It tries to be dark, but it just isn't. It tries to be funny, with one liners and nod's to the original ('buy that for a dollar') but it just isn't. It also tries to be too clever, but as I said before, the pace of the film doesn't allow you time to reflect and get under the skin of the characters.Action wise, it's good. Very good in fact. But then with an estimated $100m dollar budget, it should be. I'd challenge anybody to have that much budget and not come up with good action sequences. On the subject of action, the 12A certificate does it no favours. I completely understand why they have done it, and that kids will hopefully be running around the streets with Robocop masks on, but for the good of the film it simply doesn't work. Robocop should not be using a Taser gun. Fact. Even more frustrating, is he uses it alongside a real gun to limit the number of deaths. One of the biggest gunfights in the film, when Robo tracks down the main villain and takes out his henchmen is one of the biggest victims of the 12A cert. The screen swaps to a thermal imaging camera (so you can't see blood), and the whole thing becomes more like COD game than a film scene.I sound like I have nothing good to say about this film, I do. I genuinely like the look of Robocop, I think he looks menacing, with good movement. The fact that the voice doesn't really change gives him a human element that actually makes the character better than the script allows. But again, things just move to quickly to allow you to have a good look at him.Oldman, Keaton and Jackson are left with parts that have you screaming at the screen, wishing that there was more to them.My summary and humble opinion?. This could and should have been a revenge movie. Forget the 'man v machine' message. If the director had spent more time looking at Christopher Nolan's portrayal of Batman, then we could have had a dark, thoughtful and interesting crime thriller with amazing action. Instead, we get a rather damp, rushed and somewhat lackluster action film that's trying to be more intelligent than it really is.Thanks for readingwww.gregnewtonblog.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In some ways better than the first movie, in some ways worse. Altogether this is quite a satisfying remake, which keeps fairly close to the plot of the original, but with a few acceptable changes. This is Robocop and still quite a violent film, but to be honest I felt that the violence was toned down in comparison, which I was pleased about since it can stand up without it.If you take younger members, the bit where you see what is left of Murphy outside of his suit can be quite disturbing, so I would advise not taking the more squeamish.If people are genuinely marking this done just because it is a remake, they are being ridiculous. I enjoyed the original movie, but it was in no means perfect and this is an reasonable remake and worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review reboot directive?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2014 Robocop, like all reboot attempts, faces an uphill struggle before it is even viewed for the first time, and this bias, rightly or wrongly, will likely affect your opinion of the film beyond its own particular merits and failures. I was certainly amongst those full of dread at the mere announcement of this new Robocop venture, fuelled for the most part by some unconvincing pre-production and on-set stills and a handful of suggestions of how it would be different not sitting right in my head (Lewis is a dude?). The trailers, likewise, did not do much to settle my already upset film-stomach (if there is such a thing ? yes there is, I just made it up).Its forebear - the original 1987 sleeper hit - is an astoundingly well- made piece of science-fiction. It is iconic for its visceral body-shock- horror and is memorable for so many reasons beside - from catchy one- liners to its perfect blend of animatronics and stop-motion animation. I am one of the many who saw it at an incredibly inappropriate age, and have re-watched and re-enjoyed it many times since. Following the reveal that such a classic is to have another version that it can be compared to, the most important question initially seemed to be 'will it live up to the original?'. However, even though my expectations were still markedly low right up to witnessing this particular reboot for the first time, a timely revelation came upon me that may have assisted the transition from cemented scepticism to the objective critique that followed ? this is not 1987. Further, this is not a Paul Verhoeven film. This is 2014, and this is Jose Padilha.So to the unintentional pun of 'rebooting' Robocop. As 'Operation send a shed load of ED-209s to the Middle East' is shown to be well underway, Samuel L. 'Motherfucking' Jackson's Pat Novak eases us into the new focus on national security as the main satirical swipe as opposed to the all-consuming consumerism of America that is the linchpin, theme-wise, in the original. His topical news debate programme, ever so slightly biased in favour of the abolition of an act that prevents robotic law enforcement on U.S. soil, becomes the recurring visual narration for the film and replaces, in a sense, the fake-smiling news anchors from before. The black comedy has survived the reboot in this and other examples, then, though at times, like the re-hash of the original score, does feel a little shoe-horned in. Thankfully, though, Padilha is not too interested in satisfying fan-boys and very quickly sets about producing his Robocop for the 21st century.If there is one thing that is very different this time around, it is the focus on family and the arc upon which Alex Murphy's character travels along. Murphy's wife and son take on much more important roles here, even to the point of Mrs. Murphy being the one who sanctions (under intense emotional pressure) the Robocop programme in the first place. Murphy himself does not simply wake up and go into full-on Robocop mode:- he frenetically traverses a traumatic range of control and awareness. One moment OmniCorp want his human side to shine through, the next they're messing with his brain chemistry and making him think he is control when he is not. The massively increased attention to detail of the physical and emotional anatomy of the transformation of a human to becoming part robot is highly laudable. In fact, for all of the uber- violence in the original, it is actually one particular scene in this new Robocop that I found the most shocking of both versions.Joel Kinnaman deserves a lot of credit in taking on and delivering his Murphy, inevitably, as he is, in the shadow of Peter Weller who certainly still owns the role and will for all time. It was always time to move on from the slow-moving behemoth that was necessary before, as Robocop can now Six Million Dollar Man it all over town, but Kinnaman still embellishes his performance with much of the body acting needed to make Robocop what he is. He is tasked with a large scope of emotional states to portray, sometimes all within the same scene, and earns a pass in my books for embracing the potentially ridiculous concept of being a cybernetic cop, highlighting it as a role which actually has quite an emotional depth to it. The first scene of Robocop being awoken is astonishing, and is the catalyst for an immensely enjoyable middle third where we follow Murphy on his extraordinary journey from the sublime to the ridiculous in terms of how one could even attempt to come to terms with this kind of existence.Towards the end is where some wheels start to fall off, however. The confidence that Padilha exemplifies in tackling the relative themes and tones becomes off-balance as the film becomes indecisive over what direction it wants to take you in. It also seems strange to say that there could have been some more action, possibly in place of yet more dialogue in an office between interested parties, and it is certainly missing an iconic main villain ? instead of a delicious Clarence Boddicker we get . . well, I can't even remember his name.Overall, this is a reboot which I thought I would hate but didn't. If you approach with low expectations, there is a good chance you will be pleasantly surprised. I certainly would rather have seen what a Darren Aronofsky 'remake' would have been like (originally tasked with the project a few years ago), but I am impressed with the resolute and entertaining new vision put into place by Padilha who has done himself no harm at all for big studio projects of the future. File this one in the 'acceptable reboot' pile . . and thank you for your co-operation.SCORE: 7.3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RoboCop Repurposed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd buy a ticket to this movie for a dollar. I'd even buy it at normal price. Certainly, the new RoboCop is different than the original, but it is by no means the worst installment in the franchise. Paul Verhoeven created a hyper-violent satire, and many fans of the original believe it can never be duplicated. But the remake, far from losing the spirit of the original, finds a way to make a story about cyborgs, robotic drones, and naked greed relevant for our day. Who knew?The new Alex Murphy does a great job of embodying the central theme of this movie: how much of a man can you remove before he loses his soul? It's a legitimate question, and a relevant one in this age of artificial limbs. Face it, if you wanted to make a movie about a man who fights to stay "human" as his body is replaced with robotics, then RoboCop is the character you'd eventually create. And Joel Kinnaman seems perfect for the role. Even after most of his body is replaced, Officer Murphy returns to his family and friends with his personality more or less intact. It's only later that "complications" arise, ensuring his creators take drastic steps to keep their "monster" from running wild.The mad scientist of this particular tale, Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), is perhaps more of a schizophrenic scientist, as he can't seem to decide whether he's on the side of the angels or not. In the beginning, he wants to help Murphy retain his humanity; but he still manages to help kill it by degrees, first by making his tactical responses more computer-driven and later by dulling his emotions in general so he can cope with the new sensory inputs. Both of these fly in the face of the purpose of "putting a man inside a machine". The people of these great United States don't want machines making decisions, after all; they want a human mind making decisions, and a human hand pulling the trigger when necessary.Ironically, Oldman would have been the perfect "mad scientist" in a Verhoeven-style satire; one who only cares about advancing his research, proving his theories, conducting more experiments, and ultimately being justified by his creation. Science fiction needs more of that type of mad scientist to explore the extreme scenarios of man versus machine; but, of course, Murphy needs an ally if he's going to some day take down the real "villain" of the piece.That villain, of course, is Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton), purveyor of robotic drones across the globe who can't seem to find a market for his products in the states. "Americans want a product with a conscious," he laments to his marketing team, "something that knows what it feels like to be human." He isn't as overtly evil as Ronny Cox's Dick Jones, but his cool head and easygoing style makes him more insidious. He manipulates Norton into slicing just a little more of Murphy's soul away with every opportunity to make him more "efficient", more marketable to the American people.And, of course, he has his team to back up his plays. Jay Baruchel is his marketing whiz-kid who comes up with various iterations of RoboCop's "armor" for various tasks (though Sellars himself ultimately decides on the black tactical shell). And Jackie Earle Haley is Richard Mattox, the mercenary who puts Murphy through his paces, while delightfully taunting him with the epithet "Tin Man". We see quite a bit of action in this movie, despite the much bemoaned PG-13 rating, and while most of Murphy's violence is directed towards robot drones (including multiple ED-209&#x2032;s), he gets the chance to confront both Mattox and Sellars in several pulse-pounding scenes.Of course, if you just can't survive without serious satire, then Samuel L. Jackson has you covered, starting, ending, and peppering the movie with his Pat Novak persona. Novak loves robots, and isn't afraid to use his popular cable news show to accuse America of being "robophobic". He'll cut off U.S. senators as quickly as he'll cut off scenes of robots shooting children a world away just to promote his profanity-punctuated viewpoint. While we see Murphy struggle with being a cyborg, we see the country struggle with the question of whether it's right to ask anyone to bear that burden; and we see it through the lens of an over-the-top political commentator with a weird hairpiece.In the end, this movie owes its unique style to a Brazilian director in his first Hollywood outing. Jose Padilha, a big fan of Paul Verhoeven's style and aesthetics, sees no point in even trying to emulate him. And while most fans of the original would go further and say there's no point in rebooting RoboCop at all, Padilha sees a future, our future, that includes "autonomous drones, smart robots that will decide life over death"."It's going to be a real important decision in the future, both politically and philosophically. When you have a robot that's pulling the trigger, but making the decision itself, our culpability gets thrown out the window. In the new film, set in 2028 Detroit, OmniCorp have these drones in other countries, but not in America. So they want to get them into the American market and needed a product that had a consciousness, therefore they put a man inside a machine, and that's the premise for the movie."It's a great premise, too. Do we want machines making those kinds of decisions? Other sci-fi movies have tackled this question. Why not RoboCop, the one movie character who may be the most perfect for the job? Both Padilha and Verhoeven are noted for blending action and social commentary, which may make this not only the perfect time but also the perfect team for repurposing the world's most famous robotic police officer.- Review originally posted at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports/2014/02/robocop-repurposed/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Robocop for the modern world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't know which movie you all saw, because i saw a very entertaining retelling of a classic movie that was not even as close to being bad as some of you claim. There is absolutely no reason to compare this movie to the original, in fact by doing so you are completely undermining your own critique of the film, because you are not seeing this as the stand-alone film it is. In fact, Robocop has not had a good film since the original more than 25 years ago. This new, updated version touches on different subjects than the original one did. This film focuses on the modern themes of privacy, drones, machines, and technology that was not present in the late 80's. The film has a nice pace to it, we dwell very little into the personal life of Murphy, just enough to get the idea that he is a good man both at home and at work. The action sequences, which weren't many, we very well shot, shaky cam but nothing dizzying. The film has a bit of a hard time choosing a villain but in the end you do settle on one. Finally, the acting is spot-on, the only complaint being Mrs. Murphy with some dull and, ironically, robotic acting, even their son is better. Mr. Oldman and Mr. Keaton deliver great performances in their respective roles, and Mr. Kinnaman has been chosen wisely as the new law enforcer of the future.In the end, the film delivers in the entertainment department, the acting department, and only lacks in the story department where at times the story is not clear, and the villain is not pointed out until the last act. I would not complain if a sequel was made, as it would give the chance to finally show Robocop fighting crime without the need to any introductions to the character, or his surroundings. Do not pay attention to the critics who gave this a "bomb" rating, if you want to be entertained and finally see a Robocop film that doesn't destroy our beloved cyborgs reputation, Robocop is a good film and you will not be disappointed. A 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ermmm I went to see Robocop's last Saturday and I've really enjoyed the movie. I don't understand what's the whole wining around that. It's a different movie, a reboot not a remake. Get over it! We cannot compare this one with the old one. I really love the old Robocop but I also think that the new Robocop is a good movie. Lacks violence and more blood but it's not a kiddy movie. I bet if Jose Pandilha got to choose to include violence he would, that outcome is probably due to some pressures from the studios in order to have a more "comercial" version. Resuming: go and see Robocop without having to compare with the old one. Go and see like it was a new movie. And I wonder if there's anyone here that's brave enough to say that this movie is better than Robocop 2 or 3? Those yes... are shitty movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a great experience. I was waiting for this one for quite some time and it almost definitely didn't disappoint. The movie is the remake of the original RoboCop series, and proved to be every bit as entertaining as the old one.The plot is on the lines of the original movie. Based in the year 2028 where a cop Alex Murphy, played by Joel Kinnaman (from "The Killing" fame), is investigating an illegal arms racket that goes real deep, and in this process gets hacked. In the interim Omni- Corp (part of OCP), a robotics organization which has successfully launched robots &amp; droids all over the world except the US is planning to launch in America as well. And in this process are looking for a human volunteer to build a cyborg; And officer Murphy turns out to be the final choice.The movie is more or less the old story but with an exciting new packaging. The highlight is the new black-suit. The agility level of this Robo is also much better along with the bike.The action is superb.Well done team.</fullReview>

The course of the movie is so boring and out of ideas you do not feel exited for the next bit or even for the end of the movie. it kind obvious what is going go and what killed the movie is when he killed the one who planed for his murder. after that i start believing, OK that was a fast revenge. they killed the excitement out of the movie. the conspiracy theory in the movie could have been much bigger and more exciting. and lets be honest, the guy does not have genitals or even skin how could he have a relationship after all of that that part makes me angry the guy is 90% machine he is not humane anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robocop didn't live up to my expectation. I was hoping for lots of good action and some thrilling story but unfortunately title in review lacks both. Movie starts well but loose it all in 20 minutes. Story has lot of holes and pace is also slow as compare to other movies of same genre. Normally action movies don't have complex stories but Robocop story it too shallow. Direction is OK but nothing special.Acting wise, this is OK film but Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman is standing out in this department. Rest look like just to fill space. Action stunt wise, there was nothing special at all, although I was hoping for something good because budget of film is 130 Mil. I don't know where they have spent all this money.Its a very mediocre film. Nothing memorable in it. Its OK for one time watch but its absolutely OK if you let it pass. You will miss nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice, since you don't compare to Verhoeven's RoboCop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I know, I'm kinda suspicious to write down a positive review, as I'm from Brazil, just like the movie's director. But I'm being impartial here. I'm a huuuge Verhoeven's fan, and even a bigger fan from 1987 RoboCop. It has the true violence you find out in the streets because, at the time, making movies was totally different from now. Nowadays, it's rather important to a movie achieve a lower PG rate, to hit younger audience (thus, making more money), than to truly show the gritty reality. I watched Elite Troop and its sequel, and I noticed that 2014's Alex Murphy is more like Captain Nascimento than 1987's Alex Murphy. What is not a bad thing. 1987's Alex was a decent cop, brave, courageous but in no way was he investigating crime, trying to put behind bars a high criminal/bad cops. OK, he went after that gang in a old and dark abandoned warehouse. It tooks a man balls to do that. It was a mere lack of luck he got caught by them and turned into grinded meat. As he was a nice cop, a family man, loving husband and caring father, he turned into a nice RoboCop 2014's Murphy is fighting against all odds, aware that his life is truly under high risk, going after his dirty cop "colleagues". what is pretty much what Elite Troop's Captain Nascimento does. Perhaps this is not intentional. Actually, I think it's very unlikely Padilha did that on purpose, but the true is that his RoboCop has a lot in common to his previous cop. Anyway, like I said, that is not a bad thing. In whole world, honest, decent people long for good cops, a man/woman who intends to arrest bad people and turn the world a better place to live. By building his Alex Murphy character after this premise, Padilha created something that we get easily attached to. Unfortunately, due to producers, the movie is not a big hit. It's not getting as much money as it should. I guess a higher PG rate, though decreasing an audience extent, would had drove more people into watching the movie. I just hope Padilha can keep with his US career. Not because he's Brazilian and I'm Brazilian too. That's because he is a truly gifted and talented director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the theater and watched this movie. Considering I never watched Robocop before because I never really wanted to, I decided to give the remake a shot. I fancy the story surrounding his injury was well done. The part of the story of him being built into Robocop was outstretched. I think that part could have been cut down a little. The end with the guy of the Corporation becoming the villain was not disappointing just perhaps a little misplaced because his character didn't seem like he would shoot the family just like that. I think that could have been done better. The fraction with Samuel Jackson talking that smack was funny and ridiculous. I gave it a B because the family drama was good, the reason for his injury was good, the political drama was good but I guess nothing was excellent or just sterling. Thanks for reading</fullReview>

It's a good and talented cast and I think that helped this movie be better. I recently read that the director wanted an "R" rating for this movie and I kinda wish I saw it.

		<fullReview>(No spoilers) I really don't understand those whom complains about this film. It's a remake, made almost 30 years later than the original. Can't be the same. It isn't intended to be the same. It's more mature, since the 80s had been more "innocent", even if more innovative for sure.So that's Robocop, again, and it has been filmed to get a more precise, more modern, filming of a cyborg who has been hurt maintaining and is asked to maintain the law. Even Detroit has changed, and this is damn a news. So, I did appreciate this movie for what it has intended to offer to the spectators.Criticism? Lot of. Since the theme it's more actual(military drones and such looks more realistic today than they were thirty years ago, right?) Then I had to expect something even more cruel and realistic than this, that somehow still is romantic and utopic.But, as a product, the new Robocop movie offers very good (science) fiction material to watch and enjoy. A must see for all the fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the haters. As a huge Robocop fan of the original, the new one is NOT bad at all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edit: I take back what I said, this film is forgettable. The worst generic villains ever makes the film uninteresting.First of all, I am a huge Robocop fan, film graduate, and movie fanatic and I have now become a fan of the 2014 Robocop. (even the new suit grew on me) Although the new 2014 doesn't have the gritty, raw, realistic feeling and memorable villains... so on and so on... of course it doesn't come anywhere near the level of the original - NOTHING WILL - it is STILL a solid, fresh new take/experience, and enjoyable, engaging film on its own. NOBODY can touch the ORIGINAL 1987 Robocop.This film totally blows away Robocop 3! Haha OK, that's not saying much... anything is better than that Jetpack Ninja mess... No matter how many lame sequels like Robocop 3 (Sorry, nobody should even really mention that garbage... And honestly, Robocop 2 was NOT that bad) and really cheesy TV show version about Robocop, and now the 2014 version of Robocop being made, the original Robocop will never be taken away from us; the original is perfect... the suit, Weller's Robocop movements, design, violence, stop motion ED-209, cast, memorable one-liners, best villain gangs, acting, music, story, satire, emotions... NOTHING CAN TOP THE ORIGINAL. It is a masterpiece. No arguments there. A fresh take on Robocop is a great welcome, especially to bring the new generation to go out and see the original too, as well as bringing back buzz about it -- even for us Robocop fans -- but ONLY if it's done well... and let me say, again, as a die-hard 1987 Robocop fan, the 2014 version of Robocop is a nice, fresh new modern take and experience that is a great ADDITION to the Robocop line (Please trash Robocop 3!) The 2014 version is OBVIOUSLY not even close to the original's level. If anyone were to compare it to the original, anything was destined to fail. HOWEVER, it was without a doubt, surprisingly, an ENJOYABLE and well done film on its own. Of course all films, even the original, have its flaws, but the pacing was great and it really kept me entertained, surprises and kept the intensity and interest going the whole time. At first, I was one of those people complaining "WHAT IS WRONG WITH Hollywood. THEY RUN OUT OF IDEAS THEY CAN'T MAKE ANYTHING GOOD ANYMORE THAT THEY HAVE TO REMAKE A GOLDEN CLASSIC FLAWLESS FILM!?!! WHAT'S WITH THE UGLY SUIT AND BARE HAND?!?!"Well, I went into the theater with an open mind and I have to say I really ENJOYED it.If it tried to copy everything that the original had, then it would absolutely be pointless because NOTHING will top the original and every scene/character would lose in comparison. Not to mention, it wouldn't be that interesting to watch...A fresh take on Robocop with new ideas is the only way to go. Let me just say, when I first saw the leaked photos for the new Robocop suit, I jumped right away on thinking the whole idea for a remake, reboot, whatever you want to call it, looked awfully bad. While I was watching the film, the black and silver version of the suit really grew on me and didn't look too bad. When I finally saw the trailers released, I still didn't expect it to be good at all. It just looked so wrong... just looked like a typical super hero or Iron Man fighting CG robots and not the "Robocop" we loved. It just didn't look like it had a deeper layer and the trailers really made it look like power ranger. Well, having an international director, Jos Padilha, and the big names like Michael Keaton, Gary Oldman, Samuel L Jackson, etc. to be on board, it seemed like there might be more to it than that... I really knew nothing about the guy who played Robocop, Joel Kinnaman. In the beginning, I wondered why he was chosen, but after watching his performance in the film, I have to say he was a great choice (besides having a great jawline - as that's a must to be Robocop!). I saw him being interviewed on Jimmy Kimmel Live and he seemed like a cool guy in real life too. He definitely had the best performance in the movie. You can really feel for him when he's having a video conference call with his wife. Just like the new Total Recall remake, the new Robocop looks REALLY beautiful. Everything is just too clean... everyone and everything including the city and police department.The original, besides being shot on an more grainier film, I loved the raw feeling and the city, steel mill, and people just had a really gritty look. Everything in that film was pretty dirty, and then you have a sleek looking shining armor Robocop as a great contrast to clean up the city.The new Robocop really takes it a different direction and focuses more on the wife/kids and the doctor (Gary Oldman) has a lot of screen time. GOOD: Great intense opening; I really liked the Chinese Factory scene. It looked great! Best performance in the film definitely goes to Joel Kinnaman (playing as Robocop). Although I felt the car explosion scene seemed tame compared to the original of the gangs blasting Murphy, the scene where they show Murphy's body in the facility was VERY effective. BAD: The Robocop marching theme song just didn't seem to fit right; it just sounded all wrong like a cheaper mocking version of the original. They really should have recreated a whole new marching theme song for the new Robocop. The bad guys were pretty generic.Ignore the haters. Go see it! I will be buying it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robocop (2014) is more of a re-imagining of the original story, rather than a simple remake of basically the same script. Here the focus is on the emotional and psychological stakes as much as the physical stakes for our lead character. There is more time taken to build a world and characters that live and breathe, which in turn makes for a better-rounded film. The effects of Murphy's transformation on both his family and his mind, make for a really interesting and less straight forward action flick.The direction feels tight as does the script and cinematography. The actors really give their all in their respective rolls; there's not one performance that is dialed in. I liked Joel Kinnaman (who I hadn't seen previously) as Alex Murphy. He brought a gravity to the character I didn't expect. Gary Oldman is my personal favorite, as a doctor who finds himself sacrificing personal ethic for funding. Lastly, Michael Keeton plays the slimy CEO of Omnicorp Raymond Sellars, with relish. I was really happy to see him back in a larger roll again and he fits into this quite well.I didn't even notice the lack of gore in this film and honestly didn't consider it until afterwards. There is action violence here and for me the PG-13 rating didn't really hurt it. However I doubt there's much here to appeal to a thirteen year old crowd?yes there's action?but the dialogue, character development and the underlying ethical questions the film raises are all geared toward more of an adult audience.I went into Robocop expecting disappointment, but in spite of being at odds with it at the start I found myself swept up in what turned out to be a pretty engaging story. All-in-all (and I can't believe I'm saying this) I liked this film as much as the original. From the director on down to the actors you can tell they cared about this movie and gave their best. The film aims pretty high and for the most part succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scourge of the internet is that hatred travels faster than anything and that kind of puts you off. I watched Robocop after having read scathing reviews and watched it without any expectations and you know what, I liked it. The majority of people have been hating on this movie even before its release. Trashing the cast, the suit, comparing it with the original series . Its a remake, but its a new movie. I love watching movies and I appreciate the effort, scale and technology that goes into making them. I appreciate Jose Padilha for making that effort. Overall the movie is a good watch, what it lacks is layers and development of other characters. Robocop 2014 is all about Alex Murphy. Joel Kinnaman looks fantastic in the suit and looks like he was meant for it. I would have liked a more deeper insight into his character both before and after he turned into Robocop and that's the part where I guess the director lost the opportunity to add more value to Alex Murphy. None of the other characters had enough screen time to be developed. The CGI and tech shown are great and the bike is a welcome addition. Watch the movie for what it is. Give it a chance. There is a lot of work ahead to develop a sequel that covers its characters more deeply. Joel Kinnaman's is worthy of reprising this role and for him and him alone along with the promise of coming sequels, this movie is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch the first Robocop series back in the days. The curiosity mix with the fantasy, the new, the adventure, create a great impression. Any person with curiosity and imagination, that would like to relax and pause the stress and problems would like the story of Robocop.But that was back in the days, today is different, time is different so, don't compare the old Robocop with the reboot one. I believe that the difference between that time and now, we have seen a lot of hypes in movies, a lot of stories. Is not easy to impress people our days, are you able to as a writer of a movie? Lots of people live by high rush of emotions so they enjoy the action more then the story itself and I believe these are factors that add up and make some of us unwilling, doubtful and close minded towards the rebootGiving it more thoughts, I feel right to say, in relation to what I said before, that people failed to place themselves in the same state of mind that they did back in the days.Remove all expectations and have the curiosity that we had in the first place...I liked the movie and I would recommend it."Bon Cinema"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never liked the original Robocop films. That probably marks me as a heretic or something, but I always saw the films as mindless action, with none of the draw of the clever asides of other sci-fi actioners (though I do love the sun screen 4000, or whatever it was - made me laugh).This one, however, was smart, at times touching, and ultimately rewarding. It touches on the use of robotics in modern warfare, American imperialism, and the role of the person in a corporate world. It never goes too deep, and has some lovely action sequences (the shoot-out in the dark was great, if completely stupid) but still manages to be reasonably thought provoking. I really liked the framing of a modern Fox-News-Alike as the main narrative drive, and Samuel L. was as fiery as ever. This was an entertaining movie that provided a lot more food for thought than I anticipated - I enjoyed it, and what more can you ask?</fullReview>

Kind of fails on both fronts. The original movie, though deemed classic by some with retro rainbow glasses, really isn't that great either but it does make a very strong statement about society and violence and the lead actor had way more screen charisma.The movie gets better when Michael Keaton or Jackie Haley are on screen and you get some glimpses of what this could have been but those moments are few and far between.This comes across as a paint by numbers focus grouped affair that at the end of the day has very little to say and not enough spectacle.Save your money and skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A damn good reboot, It's not Verhoeven's classic, it's something new.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first sat down in the theatre for Jos Padilha's 'RoboCop' remake, I was considering making myself dislike it ? but then I realised that was daft considering I just spent ten dollars to get in here, so I decided to at least try to enjoy it. A large issue I keep seeing is everybody is needlessly comparing it against Paul Verhoeven's 1987 Robocop, a film that I consider close to perfect on a technical level, but the comparison is not necessary. Both films tell a story very effectively, and have differences and similarities that I largely enjoyed. It wasn't a bad movie by any means, I actually sat through and (god forbid) enjoyed it quite a lot. It's not on the same level as the original, but it manages to showcase some extremely enjoyable performances, great visual design, a rich storyline and surprisingly enjoyable satire. RoboCop 2014 doesn't just tear out features from the original, it tells a story with critique on transhumanism, the use of robots in moral protection and even political critique involving America's heavy-handedness in the Iraq war. It does all these things extremely well, and a few scenes were incredibly effective and chilling, it actually surprised me that it managed to get an M rating in Australia, it was certainly bordering an MA (R in America, I think). I was originally complaining about the use of a PG-13 rating in America (M for us), especially in contrast with the original, but the original uses ultra-violence to convey the use of institutionalised violence encouraged by the big corporations. The remake tells a new story, in a new fashion.However, my first main criticism involves some of the casting and character choices, which is a rather fundamental issue in places. Joel Kinnaman plays a rather effective Alex Murphy/RoboCop, but he comes off as a bit clunky and heavyhanded at times but the film honestly didn't suffer as a consequence. His character was merely a vessel for the other characters to act around, and he didn't perform badly at all. Michael Keaton's antagonist is probably one of the weaker performances of the movie ? he has some great moments, but it appeared he needed more screen time and more space to show his acting skills. Michael Keaton is one of those actors who if you confine his skill set, he will appear one-dimensional and dull to watch, but if you give him some creative freedom, you get some wonderful performances. I have heard that the studio was extremely limiting and pushy on RoboCop 2014, and that definitely shines through his performance, and the rest of the film. Now for the character that shouldn't have been in the film as much as he was ? Jackie Earle Haleys' Rick Mattox, the mercenary gunman that acted as a one-dimensional, boring McGuffin to force tension into the final act. He was okay in the beginning of the film, appearing as the annoying mentor to Alex Murphy once he is in his RoboCop armour, but he is shoehorned into the finale as a setback to force some kind of tension, and build the character of his partner, Michael K. Williams' Jack Lewis. However, he just got annoying. Mattox was unnecessary and I believe the film should have focused on internal conflicts between Murphy and the RoboCop persona, allowing more of his humanity to shine through. They attempted to do just this with the wife/son storyline, but it was rather flat.Gary Oldman's Dr. Dennett Norton completely steals the show, per usual. He plays an extremely effective humanitarian yet somewhat corrupt scientist, but is of course redeemed towards the end. His character pumped so much emotion and humanity into the film, he made it completely worth watching. Another tiny character who I enjoyed was Jay Baruchel's Tom Pope, a greedy public relations assistant. His character had a few great moments that didn't receive nearly enough credit, and I would have liked the film to showcase more of his character. Another standout performance was Samuel L. Jackson's Pat Novak, a fox news-esque news show host, who delivers some very punchy and enjoyable satire, and allows the storyline to be told in an enjoyable fashion. Naturally, it doesn't match the satire provided in Verhoeven's original, but provides an entertaining supplement while not abandoning the original elements that made the satire of the original so entertaining. Overall, the film gives an all-rounder cast, some brilliant performances, some mediocre, with some great delivery from many accomplished actors while others are not given the space they need to flourish.The film is largely well written, it has some comedic elements, some rich satire, a storyline that doesn't hinge on the story of the original and injects its own unique and entertaining elements, critique and allegory in true science fiction fashion. It provides some great performances, and has a great visual style. However, I felt the world they were building had so much more to give, like the original RoboCop, the Detroit it was set in felt corrupt, it felt sick and twisted and crime ridden, Detroit in RoboCop 2014 felt absolutely fine. I also hold the opinion that there wasn't enough RoboCop ? I liked the moments where he was fighting crime, it was building a great world, but they finished that segment quicker than I expected, and instead invested so much time into developing the wife/son plot line, that I didn't hate to begin with, but it fell flat on its face towards the finale. Overall, RoboCop manages to bring life back to the RoboCop franchise with an overall entertaining remake, one that I was not at all expecting. Fans of the original may compare it to the Verhoeven's masterpiece, but RoboCop 2014 is its own film, and deserves independent critique. It provides entertaining satire through Samuel L. Jackson's Pat Novak, Gary Oldman gives an excellent performance, Joel Kinnaman plays a decent Murphy/RoboCop, and background characters aren't too bad either.More at perksandpeeves.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great RoboCop film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You cant see this movie expecting to see the same as the original with new technology... This is a fresh view of Robocop and is intended to use today's social problems to create a sarcastic one in the films. Detroit isn't in the same place it was when the first Robocop was made.For me this films get more in the man vs machine fight, we see a struggling fight from Murphy's side but also the wife and kid. We see Murphy struggling to accept that he is just 10% human on his new body. Like others I wanted a bit of more action but the one it had was nice and made Robocop a nice movie for young people, unlike the first film that was a bit of too violent for kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead or alive, you're gonna be a little bit disappointed. Redo-Cop was just alright.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2014's Robocop is far from being good. Directed by Jose Padilha, the movie is a loose remake of the 1987 film of the same name. It was an alright film, that supposedly satire many of the major issues the world faces today; much like the original did back in the 80s. Both films, really reflective of times, they were made. The original Robocop satire was about American society's consumer culture, urban decay, and economic disparity. This remake satirized globalization, corporate government, infotainment and the Imperial like state of the American military. The film also tackles trans-humanism, the freedom of choice, and the question whether it's ethical or legal to eliminate the human factor in law enforcement by making RoboCops. Both movies had a lot of character development. The different between them is that this movie is much slowly on producing it. Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) really doesn't become Robocop until nearly the end of the film. When you think about it, there's no real moment when Murphy turns into RoboCop. He's normal at the beginning and just kind of fades into RoboCop mode for a small bit, then fades out again just as inexplicably later on. There's a small chuck of the film of the just Det. Alex Murphy doing police work, until he was severely injured by a car bomb planted on orders from the crime boss, he was chasing. Then from then, on, the action dies to a slow, slow, pace as people from the multinational conglomerate that supply the US military with mechanical soldiers that are used overseas, OmniCorp debate on how to sell robot soldier technology to civilian law enforcement in US. OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) and scientist Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), spend ? of the film creating a new law enforcement product by combining human and machine that he believes can be sold to the American public. Truly, like the audience, people wasn't buying this for a dollar. I still turned off by the black armor tactical redesign even by the end of the film, but I do understand why they did it. Makes sense to wear black, into battle. Alex Murphy becoming RoboCop is way too slow. Don't get me wrong, I like Alex Murphy transporting from a human into more machine until he finds his humanity in the end. I love how it really dives into the question of how a person is to cope with being an amputee. Also, how his family and him are to learn to accept his new circumstances. Still, I wanted an action film. This movie is not action pack at all. I don't want mindless Michael Bayism action, but I wanted some realistic depth action. The whole 2028 Detroit, looks way too clean to believe that it's going through a huge crime wave. The violence is way too tame to believe that the police needs to create a RoboCop to hunt these criminals. When we get a fighting scene, its CGI moves in such an unrealistic shaky cam way, that its hurts to watch. It goes way too fast, and it ends way too quickly. The original movie use the over the top, slow action violent that bring the horror out in the violence. In this movie, it give audiences an unrealistic interpretation of violence. The movie was way playing it too safe in the satire. Samuel L. Jackson as an O'Reilly-esque character, Pat Novak who constantly defends the use of robots overseas was interesting. His outbursts took enormous amount of screening time and completely irrelevant to the story. Most could ended up on the cutting floor. This would have made for a much tighter and more focused movie. For most of the film, the biased media propaganda approach was just bit annoying and pointless. It was really unclear what the film is trying to say. It look like it had this Anti- war message with the robots supposedly representing drones in this film. Rather then tackling the real consequences of drones, like spying and killing innocent and unarmed women/ children. The robots shoot suicide bombers, and even the boy we're supposed to feel sympathy for. The boy was trying to attack them with a knife. How are you supposed to make an anti-war argument, if you show the reasons why the drone program is needed? In this film, the villains are disappointing. There is no Clarence J. Boddicker type villain in this film. The villains that cause Alex's injures, are quickly taken out ? in the film, and the movie is left to make a new antagonist for the last few minutes of the film. It comes out of left field and it seems forced. Instead of building up an arch-enemy for Murphy to fight to the death with, it toys with different characters as his foe, never really committing to one or the other. The only one that could seem menacing is Jackie Earle Haley's character, Rick Mattox, but both times, Robo Cop get the best out of him and quickly end the conflict. The acting is pretty good in the film. The best is Gary Oldman, whom is outstanding in the role of a good intentioned man whose ambitions lead him too far down the wrong path was great. I like how the movie use the original music, character development, and how it update it. I genuinely believe that an edger PG-13 rated movie might do better. The original Robocop franchise died when they aimed at a younger demographic. It can work with the right director. The original has such a huge fan base that a reboot seems like blasphemy to most. I went in with fairly low expectations but still somewhat open minded. Still, after seeing it. I can only recommend this as a rental to interested sci-fi fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie takes some elements of the old Robocop and creates a whole new story.The city is still Detroit, the cop is still Alex Murphy, but the movie is based in the world we live today, not the 70's. It approaches subjects such as illegal vigilance by the state, the impact of machines over our lives, police corruption, etc.In a sense, I feel this movie is way more adapted to our reality than the old one. It is not meant to be overly violent. It is not meant to be overly goofy. It IS meant to have a storyline that makes sense.The only ones that are bitching about this movie are the hipster "fanboys" that wanted to see everything as the original one.

		<shortDescription>Surprising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*I strongly recommend that you skip the reviews and watch it then come back* Having watched the Robocop trilogy many years ago, I remember it being an amusing film all those years ago. As Hollywood remakes had taken a dump on cinematic legacies for a quick buck by having watered down the remakes so people can avoid blushing if they do not grasp what was happening, take a chick with lots of cleavage, a guy who can grate cheese with his abs, nudity, big booms, social clichs and deliberately blatant ABC type plotting. So I felt disappointed before it came out, however, I had a good feeling about it later.Lets be clear, this is a remake and different from the original. This version of Robocop animates, plays and philosophises by contrasting mechanising and humanising for protecting people as does for policing, governing, reporting and enterprising. The cinematography planned it's camera angling very well since it tends to engross and this includes the action scenes too. Its set in a period of surveilling en mass by Omnicorp and the USA is the last nation on Earth that forbids and rejects drones by law which Omnicorp seeks to repeal to, what Omnicorp reps say, enter the most valuable market on the Earth, or something to that effect.The scenes tend to be intense so much that one can sympathise with what is happening. I think this tends to complement the humanising aspect of the movie as well as the more graphic parts. This happens in such a way that one watching it can support and appreciate Alex Murphy in his heroics.Its refreshing to see a supportive and loving family, being Alex Murphy's, in movies instead of a tomboy wife who would have seemed like someone who would have argued, complained and exaggerated at the drop of a hat. There also appears to be a strong sense of morality, friendship and of course love, family love. These make for positive messages and until recently, considering the state of movies, a very bold and defiant decision by the Robocop team. The acting seemed quite clear who was involved in the setting and portrayed the mood, I can say that most of the characters did.This movie is not an action movie ala Arnold Swartzenagger (except Total Recall), Sylvester Stallone and the like this is more sci-fi with refined police movie elements. As philosophical as it may appear there are grounded moments in the movie, and yes it was exciting, for me anyway.Enjoy and give it a chance!</fullReview>

And i don't honestly don't think that even a Terminator reboot could do justice to the original unlike what Jose Padilha has done. I, come from the engineering field and couple that with the gritty reality makes this movie on of the best sci-fi movies since Ridley's Alien and the original Star Trek.I don't know what politicking or hollywoodism is doing to real content based films like these, trying to pan them down when a A level star is not there. This movie did not even last a F****** week in the theaters where i live, compared to the crock of s***(a film like gravity) that lasted 8 weeks !!Nobody knew who Peter Weller was back then, i mean sure he did Buckaroo Banzai but that was just prelude for his career. Nobody knows who Joel Kinnaman is but he makes his mark just like Arnie, Jcvd, sly but someone who can keep the subtlety without excitement--- something that the young Weller was but unfortunately it wasn't good for pulling in the crowd.I thoroughly enjoyed Elite Squad and rawness of it. Jose Padilha being a younger gen of movie makers has a tumultuous journey ahead...phasing out the aged Scott, Cameron etc.I wanted to watch this film the second time coming the next Monday but its not there anymore!Really a sad state of affairs when talent and content comes by after over decades and it gets panned down.....sheep and puppet culture of people deadened by urban pacification.I hate films and don't watch 'em on TV either, so its really hard to BS me(i wont buy it, like ever.)....and once in a while a film like this comes along...... I hope they make enough dough for a sequel, yes i will definitely watch it twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather genius movie with bold moves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with this, it's a remake, people will hate it, people are emotionally connected to the original and won't accept any "replacement" to their beloved original movie.The film does a good job of differing from the original yet not going too far. I believe this is meant to be a first movie of a series, seeing as it focuses on Alex Murphy and how he becomes Robocop.There is not ultimate bad guy in this, which is great, every movie is based on the same concept, One Good Guy and his Ultimate enemy. Not this one, this one focuses on how bad-ass Robocop is and doesn't waste time on some irrelevant bad guy that couldn't be a match to him anyway, instead he has several "enemies". It's much more plausible, if you are a cop, you are going to have a lot of enemies, not just one.The science behind how he works is explained, though it was kind of lost in the translation to my native tongue so I didn't really understand what's with all the software brain situation which is a shame, but they gave explanations. I'm a sci-fi junkie I adore explanations.One big problem I had with the film is that a car explodes in front of a house yet, no window breaks, and the garage door in the immediate vicinity remain intact. I mean, come on.The film is introducing some moral questions that with the rapid advancement of our technology, might become relevant pretty soon, but does this not to the detriment of the action we all want to see.On the other hand after a long time here was a film I couldn't just predict what was gonna happen, I had some guesses yet I was wrong with all of them, I can't empathize how good it is to be watching a movie and now knowing exactly what was gonna happen next. I hate movies that are easily predictable collections of clich.Furthermore Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal of Novak is brilliant and I can't help myself but see it as a critique of our present day media. The sensationalism, taking things out of context, telling half-truths all to support a not so hidden agenda.I found the rest of acting excellent too, looking at the cast it's not really a surprise. I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but it surprised me in a good way. I'd say this the second best remake after Dredd from the recent flood of remakes.I give it a 8/10. Enjoyable movie, that remains true to it's origins and doesn't take dump on it, while manages to stay original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In future the world's crime is being fought not by man but robots. Only USA, the world's greatest supplier of police robots, remains "robophobic". OMNI CORP, the supplier of robot technology for the world, will do anything to win the American market. Even if this requires to make their robots more human? When cop named Murphy is critically injured OMNICORP brings him back to life, turning him into the weapon of propaganda to change the law and allow robots to patrol American streets. But Murphy still loves his wife and son. With every fibre of his remaining soul he will be clutching to the slipping away pieces of his humanity.It's a recent fashion in Hollywood to entrust the remakes of great old action films to art house directors who can give a new flavour to the old story. Brazilian director Jose Padilha, whose most successful film Elite Squad: The Enemy Within (have been nominated to Oscars but did not quite made it) examines the influence of media, police and politicians on society so it is no great surprise that he was chosen as the next ROBOCOP director. The original ROBOCOP in its time was labeled as "FACIST MOVIE FOR LIBERALS" by it's own producer. The modern ROBOCOP is a less political story of a good man trapped in an impossible circumstances and his fight for remaining human being inside him.The good news is that ROBOCOP delivers on its promise of a modern remake with believable characters and interesting conflict. But is it an entertaining film? At least the final act of it is.Instead of filling the film with action the writers focused on the inner conflict of ROBOCOP, the part that was completely missing from the original. How does a man react when he realizes that his previous life is over and now he is nothing but a machine designed to hunt down criminals? I do not mind a human conflict, but the structure and functioning of this ROBOCOP's body was over explained. We do not need to know what vitamins he is taking, how do they put him into sleep, and what makes him such a good soldier. Show don't tell - this is the rule of every writer, and ROBOCOP writers just told us too much. All the details we are given are designed to make the technology more believable. It is annoying instead.Forget brain surgeries and fighting simulators. Give me something real! I missed more scenes of Robocop bonding with his family. I wanted a least one decent car chase (ROBOCOP has a fabulous bike, why not to put it to some use!) Give me at least one great villain to hate!The idea of Murphy solving his own murder is cool, but this is a puzzle for a three year old.On the bright side the new ROBOCOP is a thinking person's action movie. We do have a chance to place ourselves in Murphy's shoes. We don't just sympathize, but identify with him. Gary Oldman is outstanding in the role of a good intentioned man whose ambitions lead him too far down the dark path. Michael Keaton is a very likable villain. What he does make perfect sense. But he is the real robot in this story, without compassion and only dollars shining in his eyes.The ongoing theme of the movie is how a living person cannot achieve great heights without putting his soul and a heart into it, and that having a human soul is much more important than a human body.In the end I would like to mention the Samuel L. Jackson cameo as a talk show pro-robot presenter. His outbursts in the beginning , middle and the end of the film took enormous amount of screening time and completely irrelevant to the story. Here is something that should have ended up on the cutting floor. This would have made for a much tighter and more focused movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's actually... an adequate remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is actually not terrible... It's fairly well acted, has a decent plot, and for PG-13, it managed to still have decent enough action sequences. That said, it's by no means a great film either. It's nowhere near the film Verhoven's was, and it lacked many of the things that made the original great, including a sense of humor. Verhoven knew how ludicrous his film was, and he owned it. This film missed that memo. They grounded it more in reality, and in essence, did manage to make it a satire of sorts, just not in the way Verhoven did. With drones becoming such a hot button issue this day in age, it's actually conceivable that one day, machines will be policing our streets, and that allowed the filmmakers to present it as a sort-of cautionary tale. While what's happening around us gave them a reason to update RoboCop, it was by no means an improvement.All things aside, if RoboCop "had" to be remade, this would be as good of a film as we'd possibly hope for, because a straightforward remake would be unnecessary, and a total departure would upset fans of the original even more . The film is actually better than the last attempt at a Verhoven update, Total Recall, and is a great deal better than A Good Day To Die Hard, so fans of shoot'em up action won't be too disappointed. If, however, you were a big fan of the original, do yourself a favor and skip it. You'll most likely despise everything about it, and best case scenario, you'll find it to be just another studio butchering everything you once knew and loved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'RoboCop' rises above the remake curse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing fanboys and girls hate more than remakes of classic properties deemed untouchable. I can think of several reboots which were greeted with disdain when they were released. "A Nightmare on Elm Street," "Clash of the Titans," "Dark Shadows," and "Friday the 13th" are just a few that come to mind right away. However, I've rarely heard more condemnation and anger than what's been targeted at the reboot of "RoboCop." After seeing the film, I can tell you it's completely unjustifiable.Director Jos Padilha and screenwriter Joshua Zetumer have successfully delivered a "RoboCop" for a new generation. The movie is packed with violence and truckloads of action, but doesn't falter by watering down the meat of the message and the questions it asks. "What makes a man?" "Does man have a soul; and if so, where?" "Do we have free will?" In between all the gunfire, pyrotechnics, and CGI, we get asked some philosophical questions that might leave you thinking after the credits roll.Is the biting satire of the original "RoboCop" present in the remake? No, it isn't. I don't think it was the intentions of Director Padilha to mimic the style of the first movie. That would come across as a sad attempt at trying to be as good as the 1987 version. I choose to look at this "RoboCop" as a completely different animal. It's not trying to be as good as the original. It's trying to be its own thing and rest on its own merits.I really enjoyed how they delved more into the personal life and emotional damage done to Alex Murphy's family when he's transformed into "RoboCop." It's heart wrenching when he sees his wife and child for the first time after his rehabilitation and conversion. I couldn't help but be shocked at the sight of how much of his actual body is left when they show it in graphic nature.None of the actors are just walking through their roles in "RoboCop." You can tell each one was personally invested in proving to the world that this new version had something to add to the franchise. Joel Kinnaman portrays Alex Murphy as a man trying desperately to find a balance between maintaining the tough ways of being a street cop with the gentle and loving attitude it takes to be a father and husband. Michael Keaton is just as flailing and kooky as he's ever been. Gary Oldman perfectly captures the role of a doctor torn between doing right and wrong while dancing in a gray area becoming more and more dark.The movie is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action including frenetic gun violence throughout, brief strong language, sensuality, and some drug material. Is there as much gore as the original movie? To be honest, no there isn't. The graphic nature of the 1987 version is toned down. I don't think it affects the quality of the movie, though."RoboCop" is a perfect blend of action movie mayhem, sci-fi excitement, and emotional drama. It's proof that people can use their heads and evaluate social issues while watching things blow up. I have to say that the CGI work was some of the best I've seen as well. This is one remake worth taking the time to see, but with an open mind not expecting a carbon-copy of the look and feel of the 1987 original.</fullReview>

It's like they were so concerned with making the concept feasible and believable that they forgot to have fun. It's science fiction, why does it have to be grim and dark to the point of tedium? So many technical scenes involving brain surgery and unsettling depictions of Murphy as a head and lungs added to enough technogabblygook to glaze the eyes choked a lot of the fun out of the film for me. Add really bad ham-fisted attempts at political commentary and this movie strayed all over the landscape. There are no great action sequences and absolutely no laughs in sight.

This version of the title character was a refreshing take on said character. Joel Kinnaman did a great job as Alex Murphy/Robocop. What really sold this film for me was how much heart it has. The filmmakers never take the audience for granted. You feel Alex Murphy's pain and you sympathize with him. Unlike in the 1987 film, you don't really find out how his family is affected. In here, it's the opposite. I'm very glad the filmmakers did not go over the top with the violence. Most importantly, I was most appreciative of the time the filmmakers took to establish the characters. That's what will make me want to see this film a second time. I think Paul Verhoeven would be proud of what the filmmakers did here. I can imagine that the filmmakers will want to consider a sequel at some point. If they stick with the formula that made this film work, they'll be just fine. Robocop Lives!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the original Robocop and after I read the reviews for this one was a little disappointed. I guess many of the reviewers were hoping the 2014 version would be an exact remake of the original. I decided to go watch it with an opened mind determined not to compare it to the original, and I loved it. I really loved what the movie stood for. The portrayal of Murphy's family did seem a little insignificant but it tied into the bigger picture. I liked the progression of Murphy's decline from a cyborg with a conscience to basically a robot with human tissue. What can a billionaire with everything want? More billions of course, and he will stop at nothing to get it. Omnicorp did about everything they could to try to convince the American people that they should have androids patrolling the streets and they pretty much destroyed Murphy and his family's life to reach their goal.The movie's main goal is not about action or things blowing up it's about the insatiable greed of corporate America. Oh and Samuel Jackson brought his usual flair to this movie as well.</fullReview>

Visually this movie does look very good, save for a few CGI moments that looked kinda fake. I'm not saying that all CGI looks fake. There's good CGI and there's bad CGI just like there's good practical effects and bad practical effects. Though the movie drags at points, the action scenes are fun. Frenetic, partially due to the shaky cam. I don't understand why so many movies are still doing that. I don't know anyone who looks at shaky cam and says: "Wow that was great cinematography!" Still, you do care about the protagonist enough, and you want him to win. It doesn't ruin the original character or movie. They work well with the PG-13 rating, and manage to make it exciting, even one or two scary moments. The movie doesn't take many risks, but that also means that it's pretty harmless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did everything I could to like RoboCop, the latest in a long line of recent 80s reboots. However, the movie just did nothing to meet me halfway. Not that it's a totally offensive disaster, it's just a mess?an (at times) entertaining and ethically interesting mess. Yeah, it's refreshingly self-aware, but not funny enough. Sure, it makes compelling points on self and autonomy, but in a childish manner. It just doesn't nail its tone. So while it's ALMOST a purely silly and effecting sci-fi movie, it bogs down in bad storytelling and lazy filmmaking. It's the story of a cop on the edge of death, only to be kept alive within the suit of a super-robot. It was a silly premise in 87, it's a silly premise now, but that's not the problem. The problem is the sloppy editing, leading to complete emotional detachment. This could be forgivable if it wasn't so clichd, riding every tired beat from every other action movie. However, even clumsy filmmaking could be overlooked if the performances weren't also so awful. Other than Keaton and Oldman, who are always welcome screen presences, everyone else is completely robotic. Kinnaman in particular is atrocious, delivering lines like a model-turned-actor. But again, RoboCop isn't completely without merit. The sci-fi and body horror elements are fun and even really cool at times (especially when you see what is actually left of the guy under the robot suit), and the suit will bring out the ten year old in anyone. Unfortunately, these few high points aren't quite enough to justify the rebooting of this franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from the 4:00pm first show of the new ROBOCOP.The original 1987 film is one of the seminal films of my youth. It still stands today in my top 5 favourite films of all-time. I was never much of a fan of its sequels. Robocop 2 and Robocop 3 were pretty terrible films, especially given the classic status of the original.I must admit I wasn't particularly thrilled with the news of this remake, but they won me over with the cast-list. Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, Samuel L Jackson, Michael K. Williams, Jackie Earle Haley, Jay Baruchel. That is one heck of a cool group of actors!After having sat through it, i have to say i didn't hate it. It was easily superior to any of the ROBOCOP SEQUELS, and a decent action film in its own right. The classic tale of corporate greed is decently updated for the modern militarized world, and i thought it took a fresh take on its look at the humanity of Robocop.Abbie Cornish was a surprise to me here. I really liked her performance as Clara Murphy. I wasn't such a huge fan of Joel Kinnaman in the Alex Murphy role, but was satisfied with his performance once he becomes Robocop. This had some decent action sequences, and some terrific visuals and effects. I thought the ending was kind of rushed/abrupt and could have been played out better, a-la the wild west showdown of the finale, but still.....I didn't hate this film. In fact, I kinda liked it. Its not the original, but its a good action movie that stands on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must watch for emotions by a machine!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new RoboCop is a surprisingly good and entertaining sci-fi action thriller that appeals to the human heart by conveying emotions and the humanity side of Murphy, the main character who eventually becomes the titled cyborg law enforcer, ROBOCOP. Though the story will take expected turns and even if you know how the movie is going to end, Robocop is a must watch for some amazing graphics. Though once can easily tag this an action or sci-fi movie, one can not neglect emotional aspects of the film. Joel Kinnaman has played the Robocop nicely, balancing between human 'strength' and machine's 'emotions'. Yeah, I get it, it's a reboot of a perfectly good 80s movie that nobody really wanted, but it's a really good one! Though there is no suggestion towards end about Robocop2, I'm sure there will a sequel soon!! My rating - 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An respectable remake that elevates itself by being smarter than anticipated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood's ever-increasing propensity for remakes, reboots, and reimaginings has led to a cornucopia of mixed results, but for the most part, I tend to give new versions of old films the benefit of the doubt, if for no other reason than genuine curiosity to see what new life might be breathed into classic (and not-so-classic) fare. I'll admit to being skeptical of the Robocop remake, my enthusiasm for the Comic-Con footage long since derailed by the film's marketing, but I still hoped for the best - and was pleasantly rewarded.The year is 2028, and Omnicorp CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) has made billions by supplying the American military with an elite force of peacekeeping robots, whose usage in US-occupied countries has eliminated the need for soldiers to risk their lives in order to maintain order. While Sellars views the domestic market as an untapped goldmine, the American public is still a bit "robophobic," and a Senate bill has blocked the machines from being used here at home.The solution: give the people a product they can trust, an efficient combat machine with a human face, whose emotions and instincts are not a hindrance, but an asset. A prime candidate emerges in Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman), a Detroit detective whose recent run-in with a weapons dealer has left him comatose and near death. Under the expert guidance of Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), a brilliant scientist who specializes in creating advanced robotic limbs for amputees, Alex is rebuilt to become the world's first robotic police officer: Robocop.Alex is an instant hit with the public, solving cold cases and taking down criminals in record numbers, but as his memories and emotions slowly begin to override his programming, he begins to veer off course, ignoring orders from his superiors in favor of trying to solve his own attempted murder. While this echoes the events of the original film, there are a few more layers to sift through this time around, most notably Alex's struggle to reconnect with his wife (Abbie Cornish) and son, who Omnicorp regard as little more than a liability.Robocop also retains the sharp, satirical wit of its predecessor, conveyed in recurring segments featuring Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson), a futuristic Rush Limbaugh sort that spews propaganda and vitriol via his Fox News-like talk show. These interludes provide the bulk of the film's humor, but some of Novak's speeches could just as easily be applied to current affairs, rather than futuristic politics.Director Jos Padilha, working from a surprisingly intelligent script by Joshua Zetumer, has done a respectable job of updating Robocop for a modern audience. It's a very different film from Paul Verhoeven's original, yet manages to keep the spirit of the 1987 flick alive and well, with more than a few references that fans will appreciate. The production design combined with Padilha's direction result in some impressive action sequences, but it's the film's more intimate moments that elevate Robocop above the typical remake schlock.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com</fullReview>

The start has no clear story about the cop. Big part of the movie especially in the middle of it was very boring! The end of the movie was so bad. You get out of the theatre feeling something was very missing,something wasn't right. The movie will be making a very good profit for sure only because of its name and people got tricked thinking they are going to watch an interesting entertaining remake. Also most of the people that they are going to watch it are the fans of the original movie and they will for sure be very disappointed. Be sure all of the good reviews are from people that do not know who is Peter weller and have not seen the great performance in the original robocop.not only the performance but the directing skills and the scenes sequence.

		<fullReview>I tried, I really tried to get into this movie. I go with what I call a crap sandwich, the outside looks decent but the filler is crap.Acting : To be fair the acting was decent, the chemistry however simply does not exist. You never get emotionally invested in the characters, hence the lack of chemistry.Robocop : The redesign,why? They basically took everything that made the first (two) movies work and flushed that down the toilet. They saved his right hand, why? How the heck would it even properly function with no muscles attached to it (that I could see)? Why would you even give his vulnerabilities like that?The Story : Can't put robots on the street because the people don't want them, we have to trick them into allowing it. Seriously, did the writers just defecate on paper and hand it to some brain-damaged monkeys?Samuel L. Jacksons scenes.. Okay first off, I love the actor so nothing personal against him. For this movie though, the biased media propaganda approach was just irritating.The part about whatever Middle Eastern country the ED-209s were in, was pointless. The part about the red VIPs, also pointless. Robocop had directive 4 for that, as well as extensive files, some stupid wristband that anyone could have slapped on really doesn't make any sense. Especially with the amount of recognition software he was CONSTATNLY using.You could have easily cut out 30 minutes of crap scenes, and put in what was needed to make people like this movie. Character building, so you actually felt something when someone was injured or killed. Instead we get, well he died, oh well. About the only person who does die that you are okay with is the Rick Mattox character. As for Raymond Sellars, the guy who is supposed to be the main villain (I guess, it was never really clear who the exact bad guy was), his death didn't bring any real closure..In short this is the 6th best in the Robocop franchise. If I could somehow place it lower on the list I would.1. Robocop (1987) 2. Robocop 2 3. Robocop T.V. series 4. Robocop Cartoon 5. Robocop 3 6. Robocop (2014)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fast-moving version of a highly-charged blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RoboCop ? is it more "Robo" or "Cop"? Do you remember the plot of the last movie you watched? It probably had lots of digital imaging, right? If it did not something must be off beam! In a technological world where cinema is a highly esteemed synonym of entertainment, it is expected technology to help us create fiction, which makes us reflect on special effects ? are they really essential or distracting nowadays? It was 1985 when it was released, set in a crime-ridden Detroit, somewhere in the near future, RoboCop centers on the model officer Alex Murphy, father and friend who is harshly murdered by a gang and then brought back to life, now with no previous memories, as a cyborg designed and shaped by a malicious organization called OCP which believes that is what the city needs in order to fight crime more effectively.Although flooded in up-to-the-minute and striking visual effects from the beginning to the end, this groundbreaking blockbuster is actually a highly-charged, bloody and slow-moving picture, which contrasts the speed of movements of cinema nowadays; Robocop takes intentionally a step at a time constantly pondering if he is actually a man or a machine and this mental conflict creates a spine-chilling and gripping atmosphere letting us uncertain if time is enough to accomplish his mission or whether he will be able to carry it out or not.Finally, Robocop is a case in point to consider when discussing about the importance of visual effects in a picture. Are they really distracting or essential? As I mull over this issue it has just crossed my mind that they are actually things that get along when built-in correctly and in right amounts. The breathtaking tone of this movie, in particular, was only created by the thought-provoking moments of the plot which was carefully administrated along with the visual impact of the special effects throughout the motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."RoboCop" (2014) is enjoyable action flick which is nice while it lasts but after its over you will quickly forget it. Michael Keaton steals every scene he is in, playing a billionaire behind a company who creates RoboCop. Joel Kinnaman is very forgettable here - he was "wooden" as a human, and even more "wooden" as a RoboCop - a very forgettable role. I do enjoyed Samuel L. Jackson's character and his show, and the movie has a nice spin on today's worldwide politics. Special effects aren't special but the scene in which RoboCop is seen in "full flesh" is a breathtaking.Overall, "RoboCop" is nice action flick while it lasts, but after its quickly forgettable, and that is because a poor editing and poor cinematography, script also don't shine in here. Nevertheless i'm giving this movie 8/10 simply because of nostalgia - it's a remake and stays close to superb material. It's worth seeing once, but there is nothing special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As soon as I heard about this at it's conceptual phase I emailed Jos Padilha and asked him not to redo Robocop 1 as the first movie had very few flaws to improve on.I suggested instead redoing the third movie in the series as most people felt it was the worst of the three and would have been easy to make a remake that exceeded the original while continuing to capitalize on the success of the first two Robocop movies without alienating the fans of that original series.Sadly, Jos Padilha never got my email/never read it/saw it/didn't care and continued ahead with this movie. Here we are a year after release and this reboot didn't reboot anything. There are no new robocop comics, no robocop toy lines, cartoons, video-games, nothing.As a franchise reboot this has failed because it ignored one very important basic thing! It alienated fans of the original trilogy. And if you are going to alienate the fans from the parts of a trilogy they already like then why bother acquiring the license to that franchise?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of original series I will say. The first one was the best, others were getting worse. This one is approximately at the level of the second. But for the time right, it is a little bit above it now.Pretty stilted scenario with some strange moves. Do not those businessmen and politicians see the difference between an android and a robot? Why to attack an almost invincible thing alone? How to try to hide of obscure the obvious in the Informational Era? What for to try to kill (by a man who seemed to be a sound (or at least not too "un-sound") politician) a HUMAN Alex Murphy (even in an android form) ? just for convenience?? But it has some moral conflicts also. Not too huge, but still. I would put the Freedom and Speed of Information now at the first place. And the power of will to overcome your "machine self" (as in the original movie) at the second. And, of course, omnipresent and actual "everybody lies" is in its very special place in that movie.At a conclusion, I would recommend to feel free to look at this movie to the fans of original series or to everyone for one time watch.

		<fullReview>Starts well, ends badly.The remake of Robocop had potential to be a good movie, and better than the original. From the set up there were opportunities for political commentary as well as a Blade Runner-like examination of what it means to be human. The updating of the plot made for an interesting background.There was even an initial attempt at creating an engaging human drama, through involving the wife and son of the cop who becomes Robocop.However, none of these opportunities are exploited and none of these potential strands go anywhere. From the point it just becomes like Judge Dredd and a fairly generic action movie. The human drama is very superficial.Plot is so unoriginal, predictable and one-dimensional I ended up supporting the bad guys, almost out of spite.None of this is helped by Joel Kinnaman's performance in the lead role. Very wooden. Ideal for a robot, you might think, but the idea was that Robocop would show warmth and emotion. Unfortunately, he's not good at that, coming across as very superficial.Michael Keaton, Gary Oldman and Abbie Cornish deserve a lot better movie than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard that a PG-13 remake of RoboCop was being made, I thought that was pretty lame, and I usually never care about that (the PG-13 rating didn't slightly phase me for Live Free or Die Hard), but in this case the violence was really important to the original's story, tone, and themes. It didn't occur to me that only the basic concept of the original would be used in the remake, and as a result, the extreme violence wasn't needed after all.Joel Kinnaman is good when Murphy has self-control and a real personality, but he doesn't deliver his robotic, static lines very well. Gary Oldman does well in his role as a completely new character to the series, the morally conflicted creator of RoboCop. Sam Jackson just plays Sam Jackson at his most generic, and the media satire centering around him is the sole attempt to cling onto a major theme in the original, but it's not handled well at all.What this film really lacks is a strong villain. While I'm a really big fan of Michael Keaton and he does a decent job with what he's given here, the film doesn't even really make it clear that he's the actual main antagonist until about two thirds of the way through, up until then he's more just a cold businessman. And when it becomes more obvious, it's just not really a very threatening or interesting character. If you're not a fan of the original film, you might enjoy this as really only the premise is the same, and if you are, you might enjoy a new take on RoboCop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: mild spoilers (it's hard to really spoil this blandness).Take a clich, couple it with ham-fisted messages, couple it with a clean, actor-model style cinema, take it way too seriously, and you got Robocop.Robocop isn't a terrible movie, and it's reasonably interesting, but it fails to deliver on its promise, to provide any manner of emotional engagement with its characters, or to provide any enjoyable action scenes.The disappointing thing about it is that it feels that it has potential. Robocop's character starts interesting, but quickly turns into zombie-robo, and once he magically starts "regaining his humanity" he immediately goes off to kill his killer, then gets deactivated. Nothing anywhere has any real consequences. Wiring his brain to give him the illusion of control is an interesting idea, but has no effect whatsoever on anything. Zombifying him -- life carries on as usual. His never-a-hair-out-of-place wife makes some noises, that's about it. Where are the emotions, from anyone?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now when it comes to remakes one always falls into the comparison conundrum. It's a stand alone movie but you can't help sizing it up to the original. The thing is I'm really not sure it the filmmakers didn't want us to especially with the iconic references thrown in there (in some cases really poorly) but if start comparing, the remake unsurprisingly falls flat. OK so what do you get? Lots and lots of polish, for starters. The police precinct, robotics and world itself all look futuristic ala CGI. Robocop himself, played by Joel Kinnanmin (from "the killing") was slicker, and more agile than his predecessor. It's tracking system, software and visor HUD is visually and conceptually appealing but not original especially if you've played any of the Batman Arkham games. Detective mode, anyone? The man (or remainder of) in the machine brings his flavor of fast talk and street smart police attitude which he's known for in" the killing" into the mix which didn't work as well in this role. Murphys family featured a lot more in this movie (albeit picture perfect) , I suppose to give it more depth but it really didn't.See, my problem with this movie in general is what it's touts a lot of. The polish. It's almost too polished to the point of being synthetic and fake. Let's flashback to the original; there was this ever present layer of "grime" over everything. The police precinct was dirty and over crowded with every police officer looking sweaty, tired and at breaking point. The world itself like it was dying from over industrialization and crime. Mankind's progression wasn't orderly or streamlined but it grew like a cancerous tumor. The machines didn't like shiny like something out of a toy store and Robocop looked, felt and moved like a robot. The remake just feels like a man in a suit. The satirical newscast was replaced by Samuel L Jackson not even feigning non bias, fair journalism. The remake lacks depth and character and tries to fill the void with CG and cheap thrills which only serves to widen it. If you haven't watched the original, it's a mediocre film at best but if you have, then it's just a poor redo. I suggest watching them both; the fresh comparison will make you appreciate the have and have not of either offering.</fullReview>

Does it do that? Not quite.Though Robocop is given a brand new change and different persona to the bulkier and less human version in the 80's I felt that this was trying to expand on the characters too much and Murphy's relationship with his family which though had potential to be interesting dragged on for too long and felt slow and bloated. This adaptation was also much more political which is probably is a strong point for those into all that public relations.I was one of those interested in a robocop remake from the start and though it did a very good job at that it was a poor script and pacing that did ultimately bring the film down for me which included his relationship with his family which was an interesting character arc missing from the original did go on for too long and parts of it were unnecessary.Rating: C Comments: A very interesting and original take on the original classic had potential but missed the mark in it's pacing, script and character development</fullReview>

But it lacks a concise plot.. was the movie about a man learning to control his emotion? was it about a corporation selling an image of safety? Gangsters doing business with dirty cops? I don't understand...My brain hurts trying to get it.This is not the fault of the director, he stated in a few interviews that for every 10 ideas he put in 9 were turned down. Not being allowed to have creative freedom was the downfall of this film.The acting, CGI, and color of the film were good, but the lack of rampant violent crime and clean aspect of an American city leave me stunned!

		<fullReview>If you watch the original Robocop, you'll find within the first 3 minutes, the movie has set the tone, and nearly defined the entire intention of the film.The first three minutes are simply a news cast of the future, intermixed with commercials, and it's worth gold. The script is funny, jabbing a future filled with crime and disorder, chaos around the globe, and a heavy hand of law enforcement, sound familiar? Oh yeah I guess that part of the movie kinda turned out spot on. Then we're treated throughout the film with commercial breaks each and every one of them more awesome than the last. No wonder the modern Robocop left out commercials of the future, since the ones from the original are so spot on for seeing in to the future of what we have today, to tempt fate and guess what's to come further down the road might have been too much even for the hearty, things like body replacement commercials (something just reported in The Guardian News in two years to come for real, yeah for real) can anyone say not so funny nightmare?If there was no original, the movie might have gotten a 4-5, except it lacked any value on the intention of the series, which is to examine morals of robots in our society, how cybernetics will effect that conversation, and above all what is it to be human. And this is where the original shined, and the newer one not only fell flat, it sends a completely opposite message, or not really any message. What I did most certainly get a sense of and I'm sure will become a money maker is that I was in a video game. Mind numbing, shoot em up, plot less, pointless video game. The shoot em up scenes were about the most entertaining part of the movie, and to see the bad guys die with little fan fair, in one shot to the head kind of way, they express the movie in totality, as if to say Kill it, kill it quick and put it out of it's misery. The acting was decent, and I'm only sorry the actors were put to such a poor script. At least the dialog was half believable, but it never got above Luke warm. The actors did their best with the lines they had, but the movie never really took me anywhere.Yeah it was loud, yeah it was fast paced, and yeah there kind of was a message, but I felt the message was what the original was exactly making fun of and pointing to it's insanity, where the new one attempts to pitch it as a genuine great direction to go for humanity.I really did want to like this film, and it was tempting fate by following a great film hands down, but it failed in the script, and so no matter the acting, or exciting CGI, it failed as a film which was disappointing, for I'd heard beforehand it was rough and edgy, when it was anything but.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the remakes, reboots, sequels, and prequels seemingly being released every weekend these days, I just groaned and rolled my eyes at the thought of a RoboCop remake. Coming into this movie, I wanted to hate this movie. First, cause I'm tired of all the Hollywood remakes, and second, cause I loved the original RoboCop. My expectations couldn't be lower. How could they do the original justice, or make it any better? Just another cash grab I thought. So I began watching the RoboCop 2014 with my arms crossed. After watching the movie, however, I found myself to be surprisingly surprised that the movie didn't completely suck. Not that it was a good movie. There were plenty of things that were wrong with it, but as far as remakes go, it was fairly competent. What made the original movie great was the over-the-top satirizing of American culture and ultra-violence without delving too much into the aspects of humanity and technology. It had its own charm about it. With the remake, Jose Padilha approached the material from a different direction: focus on RoboCop's human identity in relation to technology. What really make man a man? I appreciated the attempt to approach RoboCop from a different perspective. Despite the attempt at presenting a fresh take on the character, the interesting concepts of technology and humanity get lost and muddled in the film as the plot develops. Much of the action feels flat and tension free thanks in part to bad CGI. Several of the characters are poorly developed such as Murphy's family and the villains. I found myself not really caring for the wife and son. There isn't much happy family interaction that tells me the Murphys are a happy family. I didn't really feel like I had any reason to hate the villains other than the fact they were either money loving corporate scum or total jerks. All these things seem to drown out the good things the movie had going for it until I'm left watching the credits roll thinking, "Eh. Wasn't terrible. Could've been worse, but it could've been awesome too. I guess it's just whatever." In the end, if I had to recommend the movie to someone, I think I would. I didn't really care for the movie. In fact, I was kind of bored by the end. However, I can't deny that it is a decent remake thanks to new concepts, solid performances from Oldman and Keaton, and I guess a good performance from Kinnaman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, look on the bright side. It could have been a lot worse...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to start this review by saying I love Robocop. By that, of course, I'm referring to Paul Verhoeven's 1987 classic starring Peter Weller. It was a lot of fun, and there were enough blood-squibs to keep me satisfied. It was campy, bloody, goofy, and, like I said, a whole lot of fun. These great things cannot be said about the remake, unfortunately. After hollow action remakes like Total Recall, Planet of the Apes, and The Italian Job, expectations were low for this flick. In fact, I'm pretty sure most wrote it off from the get-go. People expected it to be terrible, which, as it turns out, wasn't the result. Robocop, directed by Jose Padilha, is the near definition of an "okay" movie. I understand why they can't make this funny and satirical. Back in the late 80's, DVD players weren't even invented yet. The whole concept of drones was futuristic, so having it be a satire works. It's 2014, the concept of putting a man inside a machine doesn't seem so ludicrous now, in fact, it is a possibility if not a probability. You can't make the story a satire anymore, you have to play it more straight; which is the direction the filmmakers took, and maybe a little too far. You don't have to make it extremely funny or goofy, but that doesn't mean it has to be humorless. The fact is, as a huge Robocop fan, I find the premise to be funny. Here this guy is walking around like a Robot, squeaking every time he turns his robotic head- it puts a smile on my face. Here the writers and director are trying to shove pathos in my face, with this new family storyline that I'm suppose to just start caring about for some reason. You can't have an emotional scene between a young boy and his robotic father and have your audience take it seriously. That being said, if one tries to ignore the conflicting feelings throughout the film, some enjoyment can be found. The action scenes are generally well-choreographed. Specifically the training scenes, which a lot of people didn't like for some reason. It was a cool new take on the concept of a robotic police officer to show the training, and I didn't mind the somewhat cheesy rock music playing throughout. It felt like a nice little callback to 80's action flicks. A flattering callback, unlike the shoe-horned in score from the original. Which leads me to another complaint- all the callbacks. I really hoped to walk into this movie and leave not constantly comparing it to the original, which is sort of the case. I only compared it a few times, particularly the few times it reminded me that I am watching a remake. "I'll buy that for a dollar" and scenes like that didn't sit right with me. I wanted the similarities between the remake and the original to begin and end with 'policeman is a robot'. I don't like talking in theaters, I don't even like laughing or whispering during a movie but that "dollar" scene made me yell "come on!" to the screen. I didn't want to, but Hollywood made me. In the end, the thing I recommend most is to never compare this to the original. Seriously, just don't- it will crumble in comparison. It's not the goofy Robocop we've all come to love, but it's not terrible like Robocop 3. The film is played very straight, which does diminish some enjoyment. But the action is great, it tried to do something new with the premise which is admirable. If you go into this movie thinking it will suck, then you are in for a pleasant surprise. If you go in thinking it'll reign superior to the work of Verhoveen, then you will leave disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever a remake is announced, people like to claim that Hollywood has run out of ideas and say their childhoods are being destroyed or that remakes cause Ebola or remakes are Obama's way of taking away our guns and freedom?or whatever butthurt that comes with remakes?but we're quick to forget that we don't have to watch them if we don't want to and that because a remake exists, it doesn't delete the existence of the original from all time and space. Remakes don't really bother me and I'm usually too interested in seeing how the remake will be handled than worry about how Hollywood ran out of ideas.This newly reimagined "RoboCop" has some great stuff working in its favor but it also has some terrible stuff that is truly awful and makes the film pretty average and worthy of only a single viewing. Right off the bat, I have to say that the cast is great?except the actual dude who played RoboCop. Joel Kinnaman is lifeless, bland, and boring as Alex Murphy and seems more worried about having crazy eyes going constantly than making his representation come even remotely close to Peter Weller's iconic portrayal. However, with Michael Keaton, Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson, Jackie Earle Haley and pretty much everyone else in the cast giving their all and more, it's pretty easy to overlook a main character that is just plain boring. Heck, the rest of the cast does such a great job that they pretty much made RoboCop the side character in a RoboCop film.At its simplest level, I like the commentary the film was providing about a post-9/11 society and the questions it raised about being alive and living with technology. However, these themes are a little jumbled and messy and often make the film drag in a lot of places. When that happens, the action hits and, while some of the action is decent, most of it is completely forgettable?except when RoboCop runs and jumps in the action, that was too strange to forget.Finally, I wasn't too thrilled with RoboCop's look. Despite the fact that the final, matte black finish looks like Alex Murphy is wearing a discarded Batman suit from "The Dark Knight," the fact they were adamant about keeping the visor up so that we can see all of Kinnaman lack of emotion and crazy eyes was a huge mistake. Have they learned nothing from the original or even from "Dredd?" We don't have to see the actor's face if blocking it is intricate to the character. Also, considering how poor Kinnaman's acting was, putting the visor on him would have only been an improvement."RoboCop" has a lot of issues working against it but enough working for it that I felt the final product was, at the very least, watchable. I wasn't blown away with it and this one doesn't come close to the original in any aspect but it was entertaining enough that I didn't feel like I lost two hours of my life for watching it. At the very least, it had Michael Keaton in it and Sam Jackson saying the word "robophobic." Greetings, ladies and gentlemen! Feel like reading more of my rants, ramblings, geek references, bad jokes, and other movie reviews (like a more in-depth look at "RoboCop" or other films that lack both robots and cops)?

		<fullReview>Finally took the time to see this.It was more or less what I had expected. I am not sure why Hollywood can't get something original. Honestly. This could have been better if it was not Robocop.When I started seeing the movie I thought to myself with a few tweaks this could have been a great Deathlok movie (Google deathlok and marvel)Just like total recall this movie had too much too live up to. There are some decent scenes but after they show Robocop kicking something like a 100 efficient military robots asses singlehandedly your expectations from normal people even touching him goes out the window.What I missed most was the amazing humor Paul put in his movie. The dark twisted future he made it alive.. This is but a bleak not needed watered down copy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The New ROBOCOP Loses the Edge of the 1987 Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2014 reimagining of ROBOCOP from director Jos Padilha was a hot steaming pile of wasted potential. I'm not going to call it a reboot because that would imply the start of a fresh franchise and further sequels, and the subpar performance of this movie at the box office is a pretty safe indication that the new Alex Murphy is in for an early retirement. I could be wrong though. Regardless, the future of the ROBOCOP series begins with this movie and I suppose the kindest words I've got for it is, "I didn't hate it." It managed to avoid all of the usual pitfalls that ruin remakes of classic films, but it's brought it's own batch of problems to the table. Most of them are complaints that could easily be tagged onto any modern action film. The basis for the film remains the same. Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is one of the few noble police officers left in Detroit. When he comes a little too close to a local criminal kingpin, he becomes the victim of a car bombing and, when clinging to life by a thread, his wife enrolls him in an experimental program to put a man into a machine for purposes of law enforcement. You see, OmniCorp is a massive corporation with military contracts that's placed drones on the streets of foreign nations in upheaval to keep the peace and they want to expand their contract to American soil. But the people of America aren't sure a machine can be trusted to understand the value of life and a senator has run a strong campaign to keep machines off the streets. Thus, RoboCop was conceived. Part man, part machine? he's OmniCorp's hope of earning America's trust. But how much of Alex Murphy remains? And who's really in control?The main difference between the Paul Verhoeven and Jos Padilha versions is just that. Verhoeven's original film was more focused on the satirical elements and the social commentary that permeated the film, while Padilha wanted to know whether Alex Murphy retains free will once he's embedded in the machine or if the computer (and the men at HQ) retains control. This is where Padilha deserves the most credit. He could've easily spent his film trying to ape the original. But then what would've been the point of remaking it to begin with? He shifts away from the satirical humor and the gratuitous violence to give the new ROBOCOP a more cerebral vibe. Free will is a major theme running through the film. The scientist in charge of the RoboCop program, Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), believes in leaving Murphy's consciousness intact but CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) wants better results, and that means less Murphy. A great majority of the movie spends time with this struggle and that means incorporating Murphy's wife and child in larger roles. The original wife had flashes of Murphy's life before RoboCop and gave us enough background to help the audience sympathize with the man in the machine. In the 2014 film, his wife Clara (Abbie Cornish) is front and center. The filmmakers really wanted to emphasize his human connections, so it led to a lot of scenes with Clara sobbing and demanding to see her husband or begging Murphy to remember his previous life. Family becomes a big part of driving home the point that there is a man inside RoboCop. A man with a soul and a life that we've just got to sympathize with. And you know what? As noble as Padilha's new angle on ROBOCOP might be, it's abandoned everything I loved about the original.I've discovered that Padilha was not to blame for my (and seemingly most peoples') biggest complaint: the PG-13 rating. The original ROBOCOP movie was brutally violent and this is the new film's biggest failing. I'm not saying a movie has to have blood and guts to be entertaining but the violence of the original was such a memorable ingredient that ROBOCOP without the gratuitous blood spray just doesn't feel right. The new ROBOCOP has that modern action look: generic and forgettable. There's a generous use of CG so we now, instead of the heavy robotic strut of Peter Weller's iconic character, we get RoboCop leaping insane distances and spinning to fire his weapon in all directions at superhuman speeds. He's sleek, shiny, and he's got a fancy new black stealth finish. Everything about the way he looks and the way he moves fails to evoke the same feeling. This is not the RoboCop I loved as a kid. I guess Joel Kinnaman does all right as the man inside the machine but, and here I know I'm biased, he's just no Peter Weller. If we could've at least gotten a less outlandish RoboCop, I would've been able to easier forgive the slow-moving spiritual perspective this movie?no, scratch that. This movie's just dull. I don't want my RoboCop mourning the loss of his humanity and yearning for his family. I want him stomping through Detroit telling street scum, "Dead or alive, you're coming with me." Sure, he gets to drop the line at once in the new movie but it's delivery just doesn't resonate the same and, come on, he doesn't start RoboCopping (a verb I'm creating purely for use in this context) until an hour into the movie!I'm sure this movie will find an audience. All of my complaints with the 2014 ROBOCOP lead me to one conclusion: I just need to stick with the 1987 Paul Verhoeven film. I don't need a reboot or a remake or whatever. It wasn't broken and didn't need fixing. If the new ROBOCOP inspires a new generation of fans to seek out the original, then it's done some good but the new version is just too toothless and dull for my tastes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Broken Promises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many Hollywood productions suffer a common ailment, which is to start with a bang, in some cases with a promising prologue only to lose its way by diverging to mindless actions or just forgetting what it started with in the first place. Robocop (2014) is one perfect example: initiating with a very interesting premise of government/corporate surveillance versus individual freedom, within the context of American involvement in the Middle East and the assumption that when we are discussing individual liberties, it is only American liberty, no one else, viewers have a tendency to think that the film will explore those fascinating notions. Liberty to US citizens and foreigners used as guinea pigs for our surveillance programs (because they "prefer" it), we're in for a treat. Captain America - Winter Soldier also examined surveillance programs, to a slightly better result. But Robocop loses its way, as I said, with the government and the private sector trading bad guys/good guys spots. The original film indeed featured the private enterprise in a very negative light. In 2014 the movie is a bit more subtle but also much more muddled. I guess we prefer our stories straightforward... But this one changes to an individual drama quite rapidly and the initial debate is all but forgotten. This being said, I did enjoy the movie, the acting was surprisingly good and, yes, it is good to see Michael Keaton again. The question "what happened to him in the course of the last 20 years" or "after Batman" is justified, but here's an actor we see not often enough, maybe once a year or so, in background or subplot roles. Interesting film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RoboCop (2014)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Happens when futuristic robots, work as police force to take control of violence, murder, and corruption at police department taking the criminals down? This primarily happens in the USA, in one of the most violent cities in the world; Detroit in 2028. It gets interesting when organic intelligence takes place of artificial one. But it also gets more interesting when a human brain is combined with one of these robots to make a prototype of a humanoid called RoboCop, only that it is human. RoboCop (2014) is the story of a devoted Detroit PD cop, Alex Murphy (Joshua Zetumer), whose life was changed after he was paralyzed in a car bombing in front of his house and his wife (Abbie Cornish) agreed to have the rest of his body, which was not a lot, to be implanted into one the robot machines by one of the Omnicorp scientists. Omnicorp is a multibillion-dollar company whose products are running in the streets of Tehran, Iran in Tehran's Operation Freedom and the company tries to get the majority vote from the senate for utilizing its products inside the US. However, backed up by Sen. Hubert Dreyfus, a moral debate rises soon after a Persian kid is killed by one the Omnicorp robots in a conflict which leads to Dreyfus act; ban of Omnicorp products use inside the US territory. However, unlike the other robots, Alex has feelings and considers the value of life which leads him to be 5.6 seconds behind the scenario time in the first test he had after he turned into a RoboCop. Able to recognize potential threat by analyzing emotional assessments, Alex reviews his homicide scene and starts solving his own murder. Adding bits like this to the screenplay, I believe that this was so cleaver of the creators having the remake of RoboCop (1987) exciting still not turning it into a boring replica. I remember watching the first version of RoboCop, in 1990s and as a kid I was excited about the idea of it and enthusiastic about the combination of technology with biology. And of course Alex Murphy's character then was so lovely for me unlike the one in this version which honestly I couldn't come to the point of liking him. One of the other things I didn't like about the movie was having Iran in a war zone by the means of freeing it from the tyranny of its rulers which sounds like another propaganda to have the minds ready for creating yet a brand new chaos in the Middle East, although, I liked the animated art pretty much and for someone who actually lives in Iran I must say that the old facade recreated of the city's streets was more like of those in Syria and Iraq not of the classy and beautiful Tehran. Director Jos Padilha has done a great and like most of the MGM movies a detailed job in RoboCop. Everything is in order and every detail seems to be worked at. What attracted me the most though, was the cypresses grown inside the Omnicorp headquarters suggesting that the machinery world of Sellars saves the world in a peaceful shape without any corruption like what Novak says; "Machines, however, are corrupting free." But what happens when the creator and supporters of it are corrupted already? RoboCop answers this question and unveils the truth by distinguishing the goodwill and punishing the evil deed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth watching but forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite excited about watching this, despite one of my favourite films being the original 1987 version. I was particularly excited due to the director, Jos Padilha, who directed Elite Squad and Elite Squad: The Enemy Within. Both films I really enjoyed (and recommend), which delivered a decent mix of gritty action, story and character depth, while also making an effective political statement about power and corruption.Maybe it was restrictions put on the director by the studio, or a lack of passion for the subject matter, but while visually stunning in places, and unique enough to separate it from the original, this film lacked something. The gritty hardcore nature of the original has vanished, a particular surprise based on Padilha's previous films, and as a result the film doesn't quite seem to know what it wants to be, the tone is off.There are enough decent moments to justify watching Robocop, it is just a little disappointing, as it could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robocop fails to pack a punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite trying to not compare this Robocop to the original, I end up doing just that. But despite that comparison, this movie just fails to pack a punch.The story still loosely revolves around Alex Murphy becoming Robocop, but the circumstances are all different. The bad guy, played by Michael Keaton, was next generationized, so everything now revolves around software and manipulation of media. Michael Keaton though was just a bad choice. How can you picture him as Batman, then this guy. I was waiting for him to say - I'm Batman, I'm Batman.The only drama they could have had, they neutered, when the story makes the wife sign off on turning Murphy into Robocop. There is no Murphy angst about who he really is, or it is half-baked. The bad guys really are not bad enough. There's about 40 guys in this other bad guys gang, but jeez, they don't stand up to the original drug dealers.Comedy or tongue in cheek dialogue? Forget it. Murphy just races around town on his motorcycle looking cool. The screenplay is weak. The acting is marginal. The bond between Murphy and his partner is weak. There is no tension anywhere in this movie.About the only reason to see this film is Gary Oldman. Without his fine performance as the Dr with a conscious, I'd give this movie a 2. Oldman really is the only person who delivers on all cylinders and adds some sort of depth to the story. Otherwise, the characters are flat, dull, and really boring. Not the recipe for success in this type of movie.I'd suggest you pass on this and see the vastly superior original. This Robocop fails to excite. Good luck.p.s. Why did they even have Samuel L. Jackson's role in this film? Totally useless side story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid engineering misses the charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just tonight before popping this in, I saw a TV report about supposedly the most advanced robot, something the Japanese built and showcased. Anyway you hear about robots, you expect to finally see something like what movies have shown should be possible. And the thing that came up was essentially a toy, woefully primitive from the perspective of that's where we are in our quest to construct humanity; it would go up a flight of stairs, move over for you to pass. But looking for a few more moments, I could appreciate that its movements and joints were a little more fluid, that it was a remarkable feat of carpentry, that this business is so profoundly complicated that it's a cause to celebrate when we master the most intuitively simple things.It always depends on what it is we measure, observe. So, compared to the original this one feels fussy, missing the charm and overly serious. But stack it up against Marvel and as a comic-book it lacks nothing. As a film about ideas, one that asks about the extent of what makes us human, about how a human being can surmount the machine that surrounds him, it feels manufactured to ask these things. But the cinematic carpentry and the way it has been engineered to move are good enough.The satire is all packed in the Jackson segments; a TV show rigged to convince us of the need to 'pacify' the streets using giant killing machines; a child is blown to smithereens by a ten-foot robot because the 'suspect' wouldn't drop his knife. But it feels as labored as everything else, done not for the joy of the carpentry involved but as part of a lucrative business.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like spoilers, so I seldom read reviews before viewing a film. But I was glad that I had read the New York Times review before seeing this version because it helped me avoid disappointment. I had been a great fan of the original, and was prepared by that review that this would reflect a more sentimental age than we were in the midst of in the 1980s when the sardonically satirical original came out. On that note, there was "social satire" in the form of showing the US foreign policy as creating havoc while right-wing announcers shill to corporations. However, unlike in the original,the exploitative corporation theme was muted as its malevolence really boiled down to one nasty individual and his henchmen (not "THE SYSTEM").So, with the social criticism aspects out of the way ... the film was more sentimental in that this "robocop" was basically the same guy but in a robosuit so he had his full memories, and he interacted with family members. Taking a different approach is not a bad thing in itself, but this aspect did undermine the movie somewhat by comparison with the original, because if it's just a guy in an incredibly great prosthetic, then you'd have to celebrate the fact that he's been given his life back in this form and think, wow, what a society, that they can give someone mobility who has nothing left but (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER) his head plus one hand. I kept thinking of comparable situations like Star Trek's Captain Pike, with only a head left, confined to a box who could just blink "yes or no." Wouldn't it have been a major advancement if instead he could've had a body that allowed for full use of his feet and hands? So, then, the tragedy of the Frankenstein theme underlying the "Robocop" character is completely lost.To be fair as the story progressed, the morally decent scientist (Gary Oldman as a good guy! imagine that!) temporarily yielded to the nasty corporate head and "roboticized" the Robocop character so for around 10 minutes of the movie, his wife, and his police partner were alarmed at his having turned into a "zombie" as someone put it. But that was almost a minor digression instead of a central focus, which was one of the things that made the original so great.It should also be noted that this movie had a stellar cast - Joel Kinnaman was fine in the role, and even kept a hint of that strange mumbling drawl he uses in his role in "The Killing." Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman were great in their roles, and while his role was brief, the presence of Michael K. Williams (of The Wire and Boardwalk Empire) is always welcome. A superior cast helped a lot here in making this cartoonish and thin story into good Saturday-night entertainment. Hence, I won't go further than a 7, but hey, it's not that bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eh, I Might Buy This for (just) a Dollar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flick on, flick off, 2014's Robocop isn't an instant classic like the original, but on its own, it's about the middle of the road of some of the reimaginings out there. It's way better than 2012's dreadful Total Recall but is weaker than the same year's Dredd.Actually, this movie might be pretty good for anyone who has never, ever heard of the 1987 original. Comparing the two while you watch this one is fruitless because there is no comparison.The Paul Verhoeven vision of "Part Man, Part Machine, All Cop" was nearly spotless and holds up very nicely today. This film brings none of what made that movie special, unique, fun, funny, satirical or exciting and just mimics some of the plot points (and lines) and adds way more drama than needs be.Basically, this future shows another bleak outlook of Earth whereas machines have taken to the streets of all countries worldwide sans the U.S. of A. Congress is actually smart in this fictional tale and outlawed the same for our home front, but they revert back to what we really know them as: just creating bills based on polls and not what is right. Enter "Robocop," who will sway the public opinion that America needs machines to protect them. But, will he close the gap between freedom and technology?As stated, to enjoy this, forget everything you ever knew about that fantastic 80s action satire. While it grasped at minute details and dialogue from the original, its tone, amusement, depth, likable bad guys and necessary R-rating, were sorely missed. Hell, even under the heavy costume, the charismatic Peter Weller was completely missed. This replacement and probably forever unknown Joel "Alex Murphy" Kinnaman, was as cold and emotionless as the steal he wore.Now, while the original's technology was the vision of the late 1980s, I did like the updated database for the Robocop. I'm not much of a gamer, but I image that's the kind of view you'd get from a PS/Xbox game. And I did appreciate half the stars in Hollywood wanting to sign up for this. A bit unnecessary, but it's still great to see the likes of Keaton, Oldman and (ALWAYS) Jackson.Finally, it's painfully hard not to compare the two films, as I have done throughout my review. But, that said, I found myself not hating on this completely when I attempted to detach myself from one of my favorite movies growing up. It's not perfect, or action-packed and way to heavy at moment, but as a throw-away remake, it could've been a lot worse. * * *Final thoughts: ?And speaking of worse: What the fvck is with all the bleeping screens? I can see that might have been a thought of the director's in the beginning and then he'd explain later. Nope. It flickered all the way to the worst possible time, the end credits. Try reading those as you'll either have an epitaphic seizure or be p|ssed by seeing the same names flash several times while you're trying to read the next one. Those flickers, plus an outlandish, unnecessary and out-of-place Michael Keaton outburst, were the worst qualities of this film, if you, again, viewed this as a stand-along, the original never existed, film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better or worse than the original?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I just watched the 2014 version of Robocop. This is a difficult one. Like with Total Recall and Conan the Barbarian, if it was not for the original film, this version would be pretty good. 8 or 9. But this IS a remake of one of the best films in Sci-fi history. Sometimes a film can be remade 30 years or more later and be better such as The Fly and Invasion of the Body Snatchers being remakes. But it doesn't, IMO, work with great originals. Total Recall, better original. Conan, better original. Assault on Precinct 13, original better. There a LOADS more.. Unfortunately, Robocop fits into this category. It's good, 7 or 8, but its not as good. If you make a remake of a classic film or any film, expect comparison and expect to lose. But the film makers should be happy, they still make money and we still get to watch a good...ish film. Most of the time.But in saying this. lets get to the film itself, with no comparison. Murphy, played by Joel Kinnaman, does a pretty decent job. Granted most of the robocop role is CGI, what he does not bad. My favourite role was, of course, Gary Oldman (growing into his surname huh?). He plays Dr Norton and to be honest, he did a great job. Michael Keaton as Sellars...I'm torn on this. I could think of a few that could have done it better, but I suppose they needed big names to stand a chance in the Box Office. What I do wish is that Samuel L Jackson had a bigger part. His aggressive and argumentative attitude in the film was brilliant. The one thing I would imagine being in the original (I know, comparison, but its a good one). The action in it was fast paced, but not a great deal in it. Instead the story focused on the life of Murphy, the involvement of his wife and son, and his ability to cope with what he now was. With the most part of the action in the last 10 minutes. If you came to this film wanting all action like the original, you will be disappointed.In the end, it was a 7 film. Not great, but not bad, mainly due to certain actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but needless remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this unneeded (read unnecessary) remake of the hyper violent film of the same name, former police officer turned big city detective Alex Murphy (JOEL KINNAMAN) is horribly injured &amp; amputated when a bomb that was meant to kill him, explodes one night when he goes to open the car door to shut off his car alarm. But all is not lost, using what parts Alex still has, OMNICORP, a corporation that works with robotic limbs for amputees &amp; providing robot machines in replacement of human soldiers to fight wars in the middle east &amp; led by CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) gets an idea in their heads to use a human being inside a cyborg suit. Their guinea pug? Alex Murphy! Given permission by Murphy's wife, Sellars has a group of scientists led by Dr. Bennett Norton (Gary Oldman) reconstruct Murphy's body into a cyborg suit. Dubbed "Robocop" to the public, Murphy sets out to bring in the criminal scum running the streets &amp; has been making great success, but when he starts having flashbacks to his own attempted murder, he defies his orders &amp; sets out to find those responsible for his condition, uncovering a dark connection between the arms dealers he &amp; his partner were tracking &amp; a few shady members of the police force, who have been tipping them off, every time Murphy &amp; his partner set out to arrest them.ROBOCOP (2014) pretty much came &amp; went at the box office, with a lot of enraged fans of the original crying foul on the film, which also resulted in the film's box office was somewhat hampered with low box office returns, with many fans that did see it, giving it a big thumbs down. However love the film or hate it (I rather liked it myself) I will say this for the movie, it is a heck of a lot of fun, if you can just shut out the original film from you're mind while going in &amp; pretending this is a fresh new idea, ROBOCOP (2014) really isn't all that bad. It makes for a fairly entertaining &amp; at times an oddly amusing little sci-fi/action ride, the film features an ample amount of heavy stunts, tons of gun play, an engaging story, fun characters &amp; the acting &amp; directing here are all very well done. To be truthful, I even admit that I felt there were a few things with this remake that did indeed surpass some of the elements of the original film. Unlike the original film, we actually get to see &amp; know Murphy's family, with the film spending a decent amount of time with them, lending a far more emotional pull that the original film never bothered with, or at least didn't know how to approach. In the original Murphy's family was briefly shown with no amount of time spent with them, much less any scenes where Murphy re-visited them after his death, it just seemed to brush them aside. Indeed as a result of this, the film lends itself to a few touching moments, most notably in the scene where Murphy re-visits his family for the first time in his new robotic body, that comes off as very emotional. The action scenes, most notably the high powered shoot out &amp; stunts, are well thought out, executed &amp; caught on camera at all the right angles &amp; the film is more (arguably) comic book in look &amp; style. Omnicorp is nowhere near as sneaky &amp; as shady as they once were. Murphy's partner has been changed from a girl to a guy (why?) the men attempting to kill Murphy are now illegal arms dealers, not drug dealers &amp; adds a plot element of the arms dealers in cahoots with a few shady characters working within the police department. Murphy's transformation &amp; him trying to get used to his new life covers the first half of the film, wherein the original film basically introduced the idea &amp; then disappointingly pushed it aside.On the downside though, MGM/SONY's decision to water the film down to a more serviceable, audience friendly PG-13 rating, tends to hinder the film-makers from taking a far more violent approach to the film, especially in the high powered action scenes which only serves to hamper their execution. Also the original film was a fun, salty poke in the eye of the Regan era &amp; corporate way of life &amp; it's grip on American society, all that is seemingly (disappointigly) abandon here. Also aside from the obvious allure of money, wonders why the film-makers even bothered to remake the first film at all. This remake adds or does nothing new with the material, aside from some of the elements I mentioned, it did nowhere near the business of the first &amp; much like all the pointless Hollywood remakes, it is quickly on it's way to becoming forgotten &amp; where are all the quirky weird, satirical commercials &amp; advertisements? all we get here is SAMUEL L. JACKSON as a spokesperson for the company who defends Omnicorp every chance he gets against the stiff opponents of the company, these are fun segments to watch, but just not as fun...All in all, despite the fact that this remake not being as good as the original, ROBOCOP (2014) really isn't all that bad, in fact you could do a lot worse when renting a needless remake &amp; unlike the laughable, already forgotten TOTAL RECALL remake, it at the very least manages to remain watchable. It's no ROBOCOP (1987) much less a ROBOCOP 2, but it is fun &amp; has enough things going on in it's plot to make it worthwhile for fans of the original movies.***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie took what was awesome about the original - the individual who no one cares about, especially the corporation, and abusing his humanity and destroying how well that worked.Instead of the Murphy who is just that new guy who doesn't fit in, and instead of the corporate America vision of not caring about anyone, not even board members and twists it into a feel-a-thon about how precious feels are.I think I've seen more violent, moving, thought provoking Care Bear movies.What worked so well were a lot of things. First, Murphy finds himself after becoming robocop, and overpowers his controllers. Second, Murphy becomes more human instead of the pawn in the system that we all relate to. The opening scene of the original movie highlighted a lot of dynamics about how little Big America cares not about the individual. This movie took a steaming dump full of political problems on the audience instead, rubbing it in to ensure it stains with the TV show like opening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expected more. Mediocre movie. Cheap Imitation but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 80's I grew up and Robocop was an amazing movie for that era. So good that I actually seen it again when I grew up a bit and the atmosphere was engrossing as you could feel the struggle of law enforcement against the villains and feel the depth of corruption in all levels. The action was perfect and agonizing.Enough about the original movie let's go to the modern version. two cops use peashooters against baddies make it alive. So baddies put a bomb in his car. Very close up and personal way to kill someone. Then it goes on and on about Murphy having to get used to the idea of being amputated but somehow alive. OK I give it to them that is was a nice touch. But the action was on the low side. You had an overpowering machine going against everything solo killing everyone in his path. His only serious injury is self inflicted and was stolen from another movie (that was stolen twice already but without the drama of other movies since the arm is mechanical). The atmosphere felt fake as well as most of the actors except Murphy probably.Furthermore unless Murphy is totally stupid he should figure out already the boss was corrupt to the bone. This is a cheap imitation of the 80's movie were Robocop would grow on you. By all means it is watchable the same way Abibas are wearable but they're not Adidas, just cheap imitations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not worth watching if you've seen the original robocops. The main issue is being rated PG as opposed to it's predecessor with a R rating. I remember watching Robocop as a child and being traumatized by what I saw, this made the film serious. Robocop 2014 is just a simple action flick with no meaning except for an opportunity to show off graphics.If this is the first Robocop you watch, than I can certainly imagine a person would enjoy the concept, but nothing will top off the original. This movie could have been a great ideal and it was ruined by trying to please a larger audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To many key elements missing! 4/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: This is another one of those movies that they should have left alone. I really wasn't that impressed with this reboot, and the Paul Walker lookalike who plays the lead was a bad choice. This Robocop didn't even move like a robot, and for someone who has a new brain, he certainly remembered a lot. I know that the director was trying to spice up the storyline, but the two main factors that were missing was that his family was supposed to have been killed and what happened to his partner? The black suit looked awful, he should have stuck with the silver, and all of the famous one liners either missing or not used that much. Samuel L. Jackson's character was a total waste of time, but on the plus side, some of the action wasn't that bad. In all, it's a very bad attempt at a modern Robocop. Disappointing!Round-Up: It really looked like they got Samuel L. Jackson at the last minute, when all of the casting had finished, so they just made up a role for him. I preferred the original when they used news reels to explain what was happening in the community. The guy who played the lead didn't really show any real emotion, which was really needed in the role, and he seemed to adapt a bit to quickly, to the fact that his whole body was a robotic suit. I can understand that the director wanted to bring Robocop to these modern times, but there were too many key elements missing which made the first movie. Because the film made over double it's budget, it's obvious that they are going to come out with a sequel, but they really do need to go back to the drawing board.Budget: $100million Worldwide Gross: $243millionI recommend this movie to people who were into the original Robocop, but don't expect the same quality. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original when I was a kid. It was ground breaking stuff. Ultra violent, topical and very funny. The remake couldn't hope to compete, but this doesn't even come close.This version spends most of its time in Murphy's head, looking at his perspective. Good in theory but quite dull as a movie.Robo cop massively outguns the bad guys, and Detroit never looks like it really needs his help anyway.There is a running theme that having robots on the street is bad - I wanted to agree but the film never really articulated a reason why this would be bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible reboot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately this rebooted version of the 1980's classic, Robocop, was the exact opposite in every way. In the original, the plot and the characters were fantastic but the direction and effects were plagued with the typical 80's garbage that ruined so many potentially great films of that decade. This movie had decent effects and improved acting, at least from Abbie Cornish, who delivered a great performance, and Michael Keaton, but they ruined what made the plot fantastic. Ultimately, a great story with terrible acting and effects will always be better than a horrible story with fancy editing. Overall I was very disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robocop The worst part of a robot cop is where you have to blow into their Breathalyzer.Thankfully, the automated officer's design in this sci-fi film isn't so perverted.In the future, the US military fights its wars by means of mechanized soldiers.Though successful on foreign soil, Americans aren't so keen on that soulless style of policing at home.To fix that, head manufacturer Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) directs his scientist (Gary Oldman) to craft a human/robot hybrid cop from the remains of a recently fallen officer, Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman).But Murphy's compulsion to catch his killers overrides his programming, putting his family (Abbie Cornish, John Paul Ruttan) and the project in jeopardy.One of the few revisions worthy of its inspiration, this sleek remake removes the original's tongue from its cheek, but not its gritty violence or social commentary. Incidentally, robotic police officers will devastate the donut industry. Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basing the following information found on the IMDb website on 2nd June 2014 ***Budget: $100,000,000 (estimated) Opening Weekend: $25,061,581 (USA) (14 February 2014) Gross: $58,607,007 (USA) (16 May 2014) ** Having seen the figures above, it speaks for itself! Surely the idea is for a "Gross to out weigh the Budget!. The idea of a reboot was worthy, but it clearly hasn't been successful enough, otherwise the "Gross", would be bigger!! Which is a real shame , considering the cast that they had. Interestingly enough, the concept of Robocop is more possible now then 20 + years ago, in terms of being REAL. Is it worthy of a sequel? I don't think so?If you like your sci-fi and action films then its passable, but if your big into your sci-fi films, probably best to avoid it. I give this film 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another unneeded remake that once again highlights just how good the original is and why more original ideas are needed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You said you could save him, what does that mean? What kind of life will he have?" Officer Alex Murphy (Kinnaman) is a cop in Detroit and very good at what he does. After an accident at his home leaves him on the edge of death there is one way to keep him alive. When the OmniCorp corporation wants to use him as a new kind of policeman his wife agrees, but when Alex wakes up he isn't happy. Now OmniCorp must not only convince him to stick with it but also prove to the world that this is a good idea. I remember watching the original as a kid and liking it and I recently re-watched it and still liked it quite a bit. I am tired of all the remakes lately but I was kind of looking forward to watching this. It started off OK but quickly lost interest. The movie combines the plots of the original 2 movies which makes for a jumbled movie. The most interesting part of the original was watching him try and solve his own murder. This one focuses on his attitude and feeling toward being in the suit and how they get him to go with it. The action seems secondary. When Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman are on screen the movie is interesting and makes you want to watch. When they aren't though the movie slows to a crawl and makes it feel well over 2 hours. I am also comparing this to the originals so that may sway my judgement. If you haven't seen the others then you may like this. I have though and was not impressed with this on. Overall, another unneeded remake that once again highlights just how good the original is and why more original ideas are needed. I give this a C.</fullReview>

But, in this case, you won't give a thing about it.Premise: An inexperience military officer was sent to war to fight an alien race invading the earth. In the middle of the battlefield, he got into an accident which causes him to go robo- a loop that repeats each moment when flesh becomes metallic.The basis of the plot looks familiar... That could be a big problem. On the contrary, it succeeded to provide a big summer blockbuster satisfaction. The pacing is perfect, the acting is perfect. Oh, and did i mention the effects?

		<shortDescription>Robocop review - Greg Newton @gregnewton13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still not sure sure why I felt the need to write a review on a film. I've never done it before, nor am I qualified or educated in the mechanics of film making or acting to be able to exact my opinions on the general public. But then neither are most film critics. So here's my review of Robocop 2014 (Contains minor spoilers)My overriding feedback on the movie is how fast it moves. I am forever reading review of movies that complain about 'how slow it is', or the first half 'dragged along'. But don't assume I mean this is a good thing, because it's not. It's too fast. Things just happen, you are left to try and catch your thoughts and just assume that the story will catch itself up. Example? on the plot summary released with the film, we are given this line ? "When Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) ? a loving husband, father and good cop doing his best to stem the tide of crime and corruption in Detroit"Now maybe I was dreaming, but I certainly didn't see any character development to show the struggles of facing corruption in the Detroit Police Force. I saw a gunfight, and a chase, that involved some bent cops. Maybe I'm a touch harsh, but as I get older, I like to see some of the background, some of the reasons why things are happening when they are.I know some people are leaving the cinemas disappointed, and many reviews from viewers seem to complain that it's nothing like the original. Let's be honest, it's impossible that was ever going to happen. The original is a dark violent comedy with an almost relentless approach to showing you how corruption is rife in large companies and the police force (we are led to believe). This movie takes a different slant, trying to somehow show us the pros and cons of allowing machines to do what humans do, while also flitting to and from his quest for revenge. It tries to be dark, but it just isn't. It tries to be funny, with one liners and nod's to the original ('buy that for a dollar') but it just isn't. It also tries to be too clever, but as I said before, the pace of the film doesn't allow you time to reflect and get under the skin of the characters.Action wise, it's good. Very good in fact. But then with an estimated $100m dollar budget, it should be. I'd challenge anybody to have that much budget and not come up with good action sequences. On the subject of action, the 12A certificate does it no favors. I completely understand why they have done it, and that kids will hopefully be running around the streets with Robocop masks on, but for the good of the film it simply doesn't work. Robocop should not be using a Taser gun. Fact. Even more frustrating, is he uses it alongside a real gun to limit the number of deaths. One of the biggest gunfights in the film, when Robo tracks down the main villain and takes out his henchmen is one of the biggest victims of the 12A cert. The screen swaps to a thermal imaging camera (so you can't see blood), and the whole thing becomes more like COD game than a film scene.I sound like I have nothing good to say about this film, I do. I genuinely like the look of Robocop, I think he looks menacing, with good movement. The fact that the voice doesn't really change gives him a human element that actually makes the character better than the script allows. But again, things just move to quickly to allow you to have a good look at him.Oldman, Keaton and Jackson are left with parts that have you screaming at the screen, wishing that there was more to them.My summary and humble opinion?. This could and should have been a revenge movie. Forget the 'man v machine' message. If the director had spent more time looking at Christopher Nolan's portrayal of Batman, then we could have had a dark, thoughtful and interesting crime thriller with amazing action. Instead, we get a rather damp, rushed and somewhat lackluster action film that's trying to be more intelligent than it really is.Thanks for reading@gregnewton13</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robocop a humble review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have fond memories of Robocop from my early days. The grittiness, the gore, the brutality were aspects that gave it it's flesh and bones and then Robocop himself gave it a soul. R rated films become less and less prominent in franchises that require them to be directed at an adult audience, but Hollywoods greed continue to ravage them for the sake of making the most money. The moment I saw the PG-13 rating I knew the movie was below my expectations. The question was how low below my expectations?Plot: Officer Murphy becomes a casualty in the line of duty as an undercover agent betrayed by corrupt agents in his ranks. He ends up losing most of his body and selected for a special project by a military contracts corporation to make him the first man-machine hybrid to gain a military contract in the states. Murphy surfaces as Robocop and during his journey to reconcile with the fact that he is no longer human, he ends up solving the best case in his career; his own murder. I will say that the film continues to have the soul I love so much, but it's lacking it's flesh and bones just for the sake of attracting younger people to like it. All this new era of censorship and politically correct debates is taking away from real entertainment. Instead we get this dumbed down visions of a world were everything ends up just peachy. Verdict: Clearly directed at a younger generation, but even they might not find it as exciting as I did the original Robocop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I somewhat enjoyed seeing a modern day remake of Robocop. The original three movies were just amazing. Robocop is a movie about a regular cop from Detroid city. When you watch the first movie, you get to meet the guy during the first fifteen minutes or so. You get to like him. Then he gets himself killed in some horrible shooting, which I thought was quite dramatic. Then the movie build up to the point where he's put together as a machine. He's struggling with his twisted half-life. You feel sorry for him. He becomes a supercop, and somewhat of a likable rollmodel. The Movie is all about Robocop. Omnicorp and some of the People against Robocop. Then the movie continues.... The remake lacks all these elements. In my opinion the actor playing Robocop kind of lacks credibility. This is probably caused by shallow screen writing or something (I don't know). Alex Murphy never really grows on you as a person. It's all a bit shallow. He gets killed in a car explosion, is resurrected, and seems somewhat worried about his new situation, but that's as far as it goes dramawise. By the end of the movie it's almost like Gary Oldman has to save the entire thing by overacting and forcefully creating some drama. "Oh my God Robocop, They are going to kill you". He's a great actor, and he deserves a better movie :/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm back! Turns out that my psychotic break at the hands of the Twilight series isn't an isolated incident. Committing serial murders of brunette teenagers named Bella, Kristen or Stephanie in a 100 mile radius is a standard response for men attempting to reaffirm their masculinity after seeing those movies. Hell, the police seemed downright sympathetic after reading my reviews. Apparently a lot of them have wives, daughters and girlfriends that dragged them to see one or all of them. I was arrested for a traffic violation. Fine work as always, LAPD.Well, I sat down to watch Robocop after being released and there is a lot to dislike here. These filmmakers never had my English teacher, apparently. 'Show, don't tell.' The one time they do show something is during the opening sequence which takes place during a broadcast of the O'Reilly Factor--I mean, the Kovac Element. Apparently the good old USA becomes a fascist regime in the future without even the slightest pretense of liberty. The sequence with suicide bombers fighting unmanned drones is never mentioned again. There's a debate about using drones on US soil, but this sequence of events does nothing to propel the story forward. It kind of makes you wonder what the point was if they were going to bring up such an issue just to ignore it. Another thing they don't show: what it is that makes Murphy a prime candidate for the Robocop program. I wouldn't mention it except they specifically set it up by having Gary Oldman reject a line of potential subjects by saying they need to be 'scientific' about it. So why choose Murphy? No? Not going to tell us? Okay?Next, outside of brief clips from in-universe CCTV footage, there's no real crime wave. Apparently crime has gotten really out of hand to the point where the owner of a subsidiary (OmniCorp) of OCP wants to use these drones on the home front, but the audience is never shown this. People don't want this technology to be used on them. Rightfully so if that opening sequence is to be believed. They apparently don't have a problem with the utterly pervasive cameras that can read fingerprints and body language, though!Another detriment is how impersonal everything feels. In the original, Lewis was a bad ass lady cop that also served as a human connection to Robocop. Here, Lewis is some guy that has very limited interaction with, well, anyone. This version of Clarence Boddicker is humorless and lacks any menace. He never pulls the trigger on Murphy, he just has a goon plant a car bomb. A car bomb that somehow takes over an alarm system to draw Murphy's attention away from his horrifically dull wife. She kills all of her scenes with her incessant sniveling. Shut up, lady! You're getting in the way of my explosion porn! Also, the guy playing Robocop seems quite emotionless before he becomes a cyborg, so there is no indication that he's acting differently.Everything was quite clean, too. Maybe I'm a psychopath, but I wanted more blood. You can really feel the watered down quality of that PG-13 rating when you watch the original and then watch this. Remember the disastrous introduction to ED-209 in the original? Nothing like that happens here. Again, I wouldn't bring it up except that they specifically ask this question early on in the movie. 'What if one of them kills a kid!?' They just did! In Tehran, remember? But the way it happened, this was not a glitch in its programming. The kid approached with a weapon and was killed for it.Also, things are set up that never pay off. For example, there is a US Senator that strongly opposes using a robotic police force on the home front. Someone mentions that what they did to Murphy isn't legal. For a moment I thought the Senator would be spying on them, which forces the company cover it up, maybe with some good old-fashioned murder. You know, conflict with established characters. Wrong!My biggest complaint by far is the overuse of hand-held cameras. Why is this such a popular technique lately? Especially during scenes that are completely static and unmoving? I get that this was a method used to bring some sense of urgency before and even to great effect sometimes. Here, there are times where people are just sitting around talking and the camera won't stay still. More often than not you'll have a shaking camera; it is especially jarring when there is no need for it.There are some things I rather enjoyed, though. The soundtrack of ambient noise really helps to sell how creepy some scenes can be: Robocop is getting implants in his brain and he is somehow able to taste peanut butter. That was disturbing and I found myself wanting more of that. Other times the music falls flat because of the lack of anything happening. When he returns home to his family, this creepy music kicks in...and a whole lot of nothing happens.I also enjoyed the fact that the movie was willing to take its time and move at a steady pace. It's more like an origin story, really. There isn't too much in the way of CGI here and that works out. The performances could have used a bit more work, especially on the part of the Murphy family. Gary Oldman is always fun to watch.Honestly, this movie could have been an awesome Cyborg movie that leads into a Teen Titans film. I also found myself having thoughts of Deus Ex: Human Revolutions when the futuristic prosthetics are shown. You know, where the implications of immortality through cybernetic implants causes mass riots and forces the government to behave as I described a hundred paragraphs back? ?I'm sad now. YOU SEE WHAT YOU DID, MOVIE?! You made me relive that awful game ending! I hate your stupid face, Robocop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever started up a movie expecting it be nothing more than a bunch of schlock, mindless drivel that does nothing more than numb your brain and put you into post apocalyptic zombie mode? Thankfully, Robocop is not that movie. Director Jose Padilha did a great job creating a much more cerebral movie than anyone would expect. The movie takes the time to explore the nuances of what makes us a human, is it our body, minds, emotions? Much more than just a shoot em up (the movie has plenty of that) Robocop explores the questions of humanity and takes the time to delve into the emotional aspects of the subject. The acting is excellent, Joel Kinnaman not exactly a house hold name and best know for his role in Safehouse, carries off the role of avenging cop and dedicated farther convincingly. Abbie Cornish puts in a solid performance as his wife, while Gary Oldman as the brilliant scientist and Michael Keaton as the aggressive entrepreneur carry off their roles flawlessly. Throw in a touch of Samuel L. Jackson and you have yourself a can't miss line of performers with seasoned skills. While the plot line is formula, the graphics are excellent, except the fight scenes which I found far too x-boxish with auto-aim cross-hairs drawn on all enemies a little too oversimplified, the overall effect of the movie is a solid 7 out of ten. You won't be disappointed with this movie. Thx for reading this review and whichever movie you select I hope you enjoy it. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story Bad execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slickly made, remains reasonably faithful to the original story, but wrong choices of actors mark it down. Samuel Jackson as the news caster is so wrongly cast,and Michael Keaton just doesn't come across a a billionaire - more an eccentric scientist- and the leather clad immaculately made up (even when hubby is on his death bed)Abbie Cornish isn't convincing. In fact trouble shooter Jackie Earle Haley is the best cast.It starts of pretty well in Iraq(or is it Iran)but dithers as it moves on.Also the special effects, considering the excellent effects in the 1987 movie aren't that outstanding 27 years later. All in all, an entertaining action movie that isn't going to linger in your mind for too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They could have done better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not everything that we could have gained from the use of film making technology, but not at all a worthless effort overall. The downside is that it did nothing to improve the overall story line, nor did it really bring anything new to the picture other than a few visual upgrades and a little bit of humanity. Humanity in the sense that Robocop acted more like a normal street cop than his predecessor, Peter Weller. Still, the action scenes and the toned down violence did little more than rile us up with no real sense of gain in the movie itself. It felt like Robocop's greatest achievement was when he shot the rapist/murderer in the middle of the crowd. Beyond that, the other things he did seemed as simple as tracing some phone calls and running into a building, guns blazing. This was done way better in the original. Still, as said before, it was not a complete loss. Although the partnership of Officer Lewis was one of the high points of the first one, his new partner, Officer Lewis (very funny) was more toned down, but still had a good effect all around. The chemistry between the two was not as effective in this remake, and taking it out of the spotlight was a decent move. We did get to see more of Robocop, but his presence was much less menacing, and he was much sleeker. This also leads to the downfall that never get to see him take down a simple gas station robbery, nor does he take down any smaller crimes other than ones pertaining to the head crime boss. The real problem with this is that we never see him interact with the common people of the city. There was no "Have a nice day" or "Stay safe, citizen." We only get a grand scope of his deeds and no real look at how he deals with your normal, everyday crime.The last thing of note is that there was a gigantic side plot of his wife and son, where it was overlooked a lot more in the original. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is up to individual opinion, but it also means that we see a lot less of Robocop enforcing the law, and a lot less of the overall plot itself. It was a trade off, but was it truly worth it? I'd say no. A mediocre reboot, overall, but it is worth watching if you're in the mood for an action flick where a little thinking is in order.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sure, it needs upgrades but it's still very watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I like the original better this one isn't so shabby. Maybe some viewers think this film should have been rated R and maybe so. I personally didn't think it took out too much. It still has those gut churning moments. This one seems to focus more on the philosophical and political aspect of robotics. Which gets drawn out quite a bit after a while, which I think is one of it's weakness because it seemed like I was watching a sci-fi exposition movie. It's cool to focus a bit more on the origin and build up of Alex Murphy, but sometimes it felt a bit too drawn out. This reboot isn't awful or not necessary but it has quite a bit of flaws. They seemed to want to put in a bunch of philosophical and political moments to the point, it just seemed to be all over the place. And maybe a pit too self-indulgent with it's theories that just didn't seem all that necessary in this movie. Which actually in my personal opinion took away from the entertainment factor more than keeping the audiences thinking. Which actually also hurts the pacing of the overall film. However this actually did a good job of making it seem like a actual "Robocop" movie which I do give credit for. I would have enjoyed some more better Robocop action though, with the exception of the first action scene in this. Sure it has it's flaws but it's very watchable.7.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though Robocop is kind of dumb it's decent and entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1987 Robocop was an instant hit. No surprise there as the franchise was clearly a new concept and the era was bringing some good action movies one after the other and Robocop was riding the new wave. After 27 years the half man half mech robot is rebooted and it certainly looks good. Though plot is slightly similar to the original since the new Robocop has vast differences to its presentation my intention here is not to compare the two movies but to concentrate on the new version.The movie background runs in 2028. American drone and robot technology has evolved in to a stage where their wars off shore are largely handled by unmanned machines. Yet the domestic situation remains hostile to the machines and Omnicorp the large corporate responsible for building the robots are looking for ways to enter the local market. And they find their ticket when Alex Murphy a detective in the police department gets injured in the line of duty. Omnicorp transforms Alex in to a half man half machine Robocop with wrong intentions and Alex starts to disobey his programs letting his human side to take control.At a glance it's evident that the CG work done here is outstanding. Not like in the 80s now the industry is well equipped to make Robocop visually beautiful without using much of onset props. Therefore the man in machine looks flawless and the technology looks spick and span. And when the action kicks in it really blasts. Yet what makes the true contribution to the new Robocop is not how it looks but how it feels. The director spends a great deal of time (Almost exactly half of the runtime) conceptualizing and building the background to bring in the hybrid. The viewer gets a full picture of the political situation against the movement and the corporate strategy that goes in to building the Robocop. And giving a solid foundation the story of Alex Murphy is well put and it's emotional. Though the entire movie is highly predictable there is joys in seeing things unveil.Maybe the only complain that someone could have including me is the lack of action at the peak. It all seems too easy for a single Robot to bring down a large corporate like Omnicorp. However thinking of the point that this movie is just the start of a new sequel and there might be a next one coming, the lack of action is acceptable. On a final note though Robocop is kind of dumb it's decent and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Terms Of C.G.I. FX, This Film Supasses The Original, But...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>in terms of the plot and casting, the original film Robocop (1987) still stands shoulder high above this remake.With the advent of digital computer technology, computers have advanced from their clunky and bulky predecessors. We now have quad-core/octa-core smartphones, smart-TV's, smart-fridges and smart-washing machines. And sooner or later we'll have a smart-toilet as well(LOL!).With all these advances, the special effects Hollywood can now use are simply mind-boggling. They can simulate any environment and creatures so bizarre, you couldn't conjure up in your dreams.Directed by Jos Padilha, the story follows the events of Police detective Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) who attempts to arrest crime boss Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow), unaware that he has contacts inside the DPD. When Vallon is found he is tipped off by his dirty cops and a gun fight ensues hospitalizing Murphy's partner Jack Lewis (Michael K. Williams). As retaliation, the two said dirty cops nearly kill Alex with a car bomb.OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) tasks his marketing team, in conjunction with scientist Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), with the creation of this new law enforcement product. They begin the search for a permanently injured policeman to act as the core of their prototype. Norton chooses Alex for the RoboCop program and, with consent from Alex's wife, Clara (Abbie Cornish), has him outfitted with the cybernetic body and software.Watch the film to see what happens next.Verdict: The film is superb for the special effects. The background music score is inadequate and we are sorely missing the Late Vassilis Konstantinos "Basil" Poledouris(1945-2006) who composed the original Robocop theme and effects for the 1987 original. Also the direction is questionable. Jos Padilha claims he was not given enough freedom to implement his ideas into the film. This is a film which will not stick into the memory as the original. Also the violence in the film is not as dark as its predecessor. Paul Verhoeven is clearly a better director than Padilha in creating an atmosphere of violence. The actor that portrays Robocop Joel Kinnaman does not outperform the Robocop played by Peter Weller.The original cast of Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox and Miguel Ferrer gelled well in the original. Here veteran actors Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson and Jackie Earle Haley(Dollman) try to raise the level of the film but fail. Oldman is one of the better actors in the film and performs better than Keaton or Jackson.Watch the film for the special effects, plot-wise it's not worth it.You may also like... Peter Weller Films: Leviathan, Of Unknown Origin, Firstborn, Prey.Gary Oldman Films: Bram Stoker's Dracula, Lon: The Professional, Hannibal, Air Force One, Murder in the First, Romeo Is Bleeding, The Fifth Element.Michael Keaton films: Batman and Batman Returns, Pacific Heights, One Good Cop.Samuel Jackson: Pulp Fiction, Die Hard with a Vengeance, A Time to Kill, Jackie Brown, Sphere, The Negotiator, Changing Lanes.Jackie Earle Haley: Dollman, Nemesis, Shutter Island, A Nightmare on Elm Street.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RoboCop is a pretty entertaining movie, it's not good, but I do recommend watching it, however, not at the theater, so not worth it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the new RoboCop is here, and it was actually not that bad, I haven't seen the original, and it's on my watchlist now since everyone says it's way better. Anyway, on to the review:The acting in RoboCop was surprisingly good, Joel Kinnaman was spot on as the RoboCop, not really as the human Alex Murphy though, I think he was way better after his transformation, seeing him come to terms with who he is now, although it's pretty boring, was very well acted. Abbie Cornish was also very good as his wife, I just thought her chemistry with Kinnaman was pretty bad, normally this wouldn't be that much of a problem, but this is kind of the main plot, so yeah. The other actors were very good too, Gary Oldman was incredible, really, that guy is incredible, one of the best actors today, his character, the doctor that created RoboCop was one of the best parts of the movie, every time he appeared on screen was awesome, seeing him deal with the guilt that came with the creation of RoboCop was great. Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Keaton were good as well, I liked Jay Baruchel a lot in this movie too.The writing in the movie was the worst part. I liked how this movie tried to do its own thing instead of completely copying the original, but that didn't really work out in the end, because the movie became preoccupied with his transformation into RoboCop, so it felt very dramatic, which isn't good for a movie marketed as an action flick. The story was weird too, I mean, when they created RoboCop he remembers that he had died, so he comes to terms with it, but then he has a convulsion and they erase his emotions, all of that takes like a half hour before he begins to regain his emotions, and that is really boring to see, except for this training scene, where RoboCop destroys all these test drones. Also, the movie didn't have a great villain, all the antagonists were very crappy, none of them were interesting, you didn't even care what happened to them, you know they're going to die, but you just don't care.The design in the movie was really cool, I loved all the weapons, the taser gun was cool, the black suit looked very nice too. I really liked his motorcycle, it looks really slick and all. The drones in the movie look great as well. Overall the design of the movie is pretty great.The soundtrack was very bad as well, nothing exciting or memorable, the only exception is that training scene which was awesome. The effects were very nice, however they were also pretty strange, I mean you couldn't tell some things apart, you couldn't know if RoboCop killed or stunned, and that was strange. But they looked pretty great. The action scenes in the movie were very fun and incredibly directed, I loved Jos Padilha's directing(Go Brazil!) his camera was always moving they were really exciting, the only one I didn't like was the one at Vallon's warehouse, which had the thermal vision, I thought I was going to have a seizure in that one.All in all, RoboCop was a lot better than I thought it would be, it's pretty decent though, if you like RoboCop, I'm not sure if you should watch this, because you'll be angry that it's not as good as the original, but if you're a casual moviegoer, go ahead and give this one a chance, it works as a summer blockbuster, with the forgettable story and all. I give it a 7.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RoboCop Revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit that the original Robocop movie was a hit among fans but to me it was just an OK sci-fi superhero flick. Now, we flash forward to this reboot. Same elements but something to me just felt different. The whole world except the United States has accepted this project of Robotic Cops. Detroit has become a utopia instead of a dystopia like in the 80s flick and not to mention the whole Detroit going Bankrupt crap! Plus, the Robocop suit was different, it was black instead of the silver suit we all were familiar with.Anyways, it was a decent reboot, I mean there were some moments that had me scratching my head. The cast was OK, the special effects were decent and the story was almost similar to the original. I kinda expected more for a reboot. I mean, not a shoot for shoot remake but it worked. What I didn't like was the suit, and the clichd mobster villain. I think what would make this movie better is exposition like others have mentioned. Expand upon the villain, maybe take away the clichs and make him more like the original villain from the 80s. And maybe focus on the political background of why Robo-technology would not work in the United States of the Future? (Maybe Barack Apu Obama had something to do with it).Overall, I give this movie a 6 out of 10. It could be better. I would recommend this to Robocop fans if they just give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a big fan of the original RoboCop movie. It was fun, satirical, enjoyably violent and awesome to say the least. It's sequel, RoboCop 2 was pretty underrated in my opinion. I loved that movie too but not as much as the first. The third installment was garbage. Don't ask me why. I hated it so much, i crushed my DVD copy of that movie. I consider this latest movie as a reboot. Not a remake. Its a totally different story in a totally different setting. It was Detroit City, but not the the crime driven, scum conquered, hell hole dystopia we saw in the original. This Detroit is like a toned down version of its predecessor. When I first saw that it was rated PG-13 I was very skeptical. How can RoboCop be PG? It didn't make sense. I dreaded that it would be like your ordinary Marvel superhero movie or worse. The movies itself was good. Not a big fan of the costume but I guess that's what attracts the newer generation. I can't say a bad thing about the movie, but I can't say anything great either. It was good. Not great, but just good. Joel Kinnaman did a great job as Alex Murphy. Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton was very very impressive and not to forget also Samuel L. Jackson. He had a minor role in the movies as host of The Novak Element, Pat Novak and whenever he spoke you can't help but give him your full attention.As a conclusion, Jose Padilha's version of RoboCop is not as bad as some people thought it would be. It was pretty good as a standalone film. Do not compare it with the original. Is a totally different movie. The story is fluent and its action packed. I really liked it.Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 2014 Release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1987 we saw RoboCop hit the big screen. Back in a time when adult films marketed toys for kids. Hell I even got a RoboCop action figure at the time, I was 7 years old, ah yes the 80's... Anyway back to 2014. Seeing that a remake of RoboCop was underway I immediately thought, Why? I loved the original and even have some fondness for part 2 and 3. The thing I was relieved about is that I could actually see the film when it came out, in '87 I wanted to see this film really bad but my father protested. I can now see why. Anyway after my viewing of the remake I realized it was actually above average and above my expectations. I enjoyed the film very much and would certainly watch it again. The feel of the film is amazing and so fun to watch, there is also some awesome futuristic stuff on screen seeing that the film takes place in Detroit, 2028. Samuel L. Jackson is funny, Gary Oldman does his usual solid performance and Michael Keaton is always great to watch. The acting in the film is good but may reduce in depth at times. Then action scenes are good but can go a bit too fast. I highly doubt any fan of the original can literally HATE this film because in retrospective it really isn't that bad. Like Ghostbusters 2 and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade for example, they're determined sequels and try very hard to keep up with the original just like this movie.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Different Take on the Robocop Origin Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me just get the comparisons out of the way. Did I like this as much as the original? No. There's the nostalgic value and overall coolness of concept in Paul Verhoeven's 1987 sci-fi classic that can't be replaced. This reboot is also missing much of the original's satirical humor, brutality, and a truly despicable bad guy (Kurtwood Smith was amazing as Clarence Boddicker). Does that make it a bad movie, or something that should never have been done in the first place? No. This movie has a very different, although interesting, tone than the original, and is much more dramatic because it doesn't strip away Alex Murphy's humanity immediately after he's built in to the robotic suit as happens in Verhoeven's film. It doesn't totally turn its back on its predecessor though, and makes some nice nods to it in the form of showing the original suit, and using the original's theme from time to time. One more thing that I'd like to get out of the way before I delve in to this review: I get so sick and tired of people whining about how it's impossible to make a satisfying action film without packing on the blood and swearing (aka "realism") in order to get the R-rating. I have seen plenty of great films featuring action that aren't rated R (Raiders of the Lost Ark, the Bourne films, and The Dark Knight come to mind). The action scenes in this movie were very well done, and don't go unnecessarily overboard. I know that the brutality I mentioned earlier regarding the original film is one of its selling points, but for the tone of that film it fit. In this version, I don't think it would.The reason for this is that this version of Robocop is more interested in the human side of the story, and how a person would react and deal with the reality of no longer being fully in control of oneself. Joel Kinnaman does a very good job in the title role, conveying the emotional toll this experience has on Detective Murphy, and Abbie Cornish handles herself well in the role of the wife desperate to have her husband back in her family's life. I also enjoyed much of the work done by the supporting cast, particularly Jackie Earle Haley as the drone controller for OmniCorp, Michael Keaton as the CEO of OmniCorp, and Gary Oldman as the sympathetic doctor responsible for creating and taking care of Robocop. The plot deals with crooked cops, crooked corporations, and the politics involved with replacing humans with robotic drones. While none of this may sound particularly original, the storyline has some good twists and is rarely uninteresting. You might wonder why I didn't rate this higher than a 7-out-of-10, when it seems that I liked it quite a bit. Here are my main complaints. First, the bad guys here just aren't as evil or menacing as they should have been. The central heavy, a gun runner responsible for Alex's transformation, is not developed nearly enough, nor does he have much dimension. Second, there's not enough of Murphy busting common thugs and their reaction to this new form of law enforcement. And third, there are some slow segments of the film that kind of break up the pacing. Overall, I liked this movie a lot more than I had anticipated and am actually quite hopeful for a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing new spin on the action classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I must say I am a fan of the original Robocop film directed by Paul Verhoeven. It's been a while since I've seen a solid remake that could bring interesting ideas of its own instead of simply recreate the same events. I think Jos Padilha's take on the classic action film managed to escape from mediocrity, having a whole different vibe and focus but also containing several great nods to the original. While the action scenes here are flashy and aren't really innovative, Padilha always made them pretty frantic and mildly amusing to watch. I know the brutal violence is one of the reasons why Verhoeven's Robocop is so iconic, so hardcore fans might be disappointed with the remake on that regard. It was intriguing to see more emphasis on the debate of having robots protect the citizens. Also, I felt Murphy's relationship with his wife and son and the ethical issues related to the creation of putting a human being inside a machine were handled very well here. It's nice to finally see another remake that stands on its own just fine, without butchering or replicating the original film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reboot was OK but the plot could been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have chosen to review new 2014 version of Robocop because I have seen the film few weeks ago and I really wanted to give out my thoughts on the film.While the film looked really decent and interesting to watch, the characters and the plot of the film could have been better and improved. As for Alex Murphy however he has too much personality with his son and wife rather than being a ''RoboCop'' what he usually is just like from the classic 1987 version where he only cares about himself then Lewis later on where she helps him out.While in the 2014 version, he may have still solve crimes but the problem I have with the film is the director made Robocop (or Alex Murphy) only cares about his family thus making OmniCorp shutting him down if he doesn't follow orders but the man said to them give him a chance to see what he was doing. Also, for his transportation, instead of a modified police car, he drives a modified motorbike that allows him to swift more quickly through traffic and can also draw out his weapon and navigate his plots at the same time.Since when does Robocop live with a human brain, right hand and lungs? Instead of being tortured by shotgun blasts from gang members from the original 1987 file, Murphy gets blown up by a car bomb during his car alarm goes off that is planted underneath his car in which nobody noticed at first.The plot of the movie could have been better but it's still OK to see it if you're a fan of action based films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is wrong with the new Robocop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched the reboot I liked it so much that it made me want to watch the original once again to see if I wasn't mistaken in say that the new movie is as good as the old one. And I got to say, while I watched the original more disappointed I got with the new one and all the proud feeling I got while watching the reboot was almost gone and I couldn't stop think that the new one could have been so much better. But the real problem with the new one is that people that don't even watched the original are saying that don't like it for the simple fact that it is a reboot, a lot of prejudice is around this new one and maybe because of it many didn't even bother to see the movie and get a own opinion about it. I still like the new one, but I think that when you compare it to the trilogy it's a unfair game. The reboot is more human and less bloody than the original, it focus more in Murphy's family than in the bad guys. The small space given to each actor (besides Gary Oldman and Joel Kinnaman, that shine as a confused man with a lost life) let it difficult to the audience to understand what is going on. You don't really got to know the villain enough to hate him as you do in the original. I think that the main flaw is that it spend so much time in the lab when it could have put more action and dynamic to the story. You wait to the big moment when Robocop will show why he is so needed to this people, but it only came in the end when it may be too late to repair the previously mistakes. Overall, the movie is good enough to bring you enjoyment. The actors are good and the story is good, but for sure, it is not a classic. Thanks God, the Trilogy remain untouched and you can enjoy it every time you like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't hate it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole movie just feels different but not in a good way.If you are going to see the movie expecting to see an update of the original, you might want to stay home and wait for pay-per-view.I had no Idea what to expect when I went to see this movie. I really liked the first movie and was hoping for a lot of the same. I honestly think they tried too hard to make this movie about the human condition and less about a sci-fi action thriller.Now the original movie did show that human condition struggle it also had so much more! It was campy, funny, blood thirsty and a Drama. I would definitely call it a roller coaster ride of emotion. In this movie it seems more like a serious movie about a Man trying to be a robot whereas the first movie was a sci-fi movie about a robot struggling to be more human. The original seeming a little more interesting to me. There was no real bad guy! It was kind of a wash in the bad guy department with just about everyone in the movie assuming the roll of bad guy at one point or another.As stated I didn't hate the movie, it had killer special effects and tons of action but ALL Sci-fi movies have this these days! I also didn't like the fact that they changed a main character out in the movie just so they could make a race joke? Really? Has it come to that?I Rated it a 6, I wish I had waited for the $5 pay-per-view instead of the $50 I spent so the family could see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poised to be one of the worst remake ideas, IMAX-unworthy, one of the weakest climaxes ever....and yet......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me 'fess up, once again (you can 'get' all my disgust for this one from my earlier comments here) that while I knew I was gonna watch this, I was sure I would not like/enjoy/respect this one. Add to that the troubled production, and 'Elite Squad' Padilha himself dissing the studio for their typical 'interference'. Now, shake that, and add the fact that this was going consciously for the PG-13 rating, no doubt studio-mandated. Take all of those elements, and add the ground-reality of casting one of the weakest leading faces ever to occupy the screen, and putting him front-and-center and expecting us to compare him favorably with Peter Weller. Then, take away one of the best female cop characters ever committed to screen, and replace that with a pandering partner that has absolutely no character arc. Then, ensure that the IMAX print doesn't release.Odds fairly stacked against the remake, right? That's where you'd be, and I was, wrong. They also went ahead and made this gloriously IMAX-unworthy; plus ensured that this has one of the most underwhelming climax, EVER, for a studio-pandering big-budget extravaganza.And, in spite of all that, esp. if you don't compare this to the gloriously over-the-top satirical original, this Works! Don't ask me how, but it just goes. Its deffo not gr8, but is deffo above-avg to middling, and IMO, one of the key things it gets right is pop-culture, casting of some character heavyweights who play off one another beautifully (Oldman+Jackson+Keaton in particular); in spite of also having a villain anyone coul shake a stick at (making the baddie of the vastly underrated Robocop 2 the most menacing of all, coming close to Clarence Boddiker as well). There is no need to watch this on IMAX fo sho, but its deffo worth the trip to the multiplex. Die-hard original work fans might still find some heavy nits to pick, and since I'm one of them, I'm getting this essay out there before I change my mind and start dissing Sony and Padilha.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's called a remake for a reason!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well first of id like to say, I saw this today with a good friend of mine whom we both grew up on robocop movies, games and TV shows, and while this is called a remake for a reason, I really enjoyed this! My friend hates remakes. I believe that 9 out of 10 people go into this movie and expect to see robocop and Lois patrol the streets and look for Clarence Thomas but "ITS A REMAKE" it's not the same damn movie and it's not a sequel so don't expect it to be and you won't get butt-hurt! Anyways the whole movie is not about fighting a single villain, it's about establishing Murphy as the first human/robot cyborg policeman in our society and how that will effect the lives of the American people. While trying to get rid of a bill that prevents robotic soldiers to patrol American streets. They do get into a more emotional side of robocop. They try to bring out the essence of a man not a machine, in the original robocop was a man then became a ones sided robot, who had little emotions and felt disconnected from humanity, in this one you get to see the struggle of what it would be like for a man to go through the process of becoming a robot. It's makes him more man then machine. Not just a fighting tub of steel. I'm sure if you're a die hard fan you're going to find something to be closed minded about this movie because you're "too cool" to like a reboot. But I'm not, I enjoy movies for what they are and not for what they're not, and it's not the "original"! So go in this with an open mind and remember no one is gonna think your not cool cause you like a remake. I'm so glad I get to have the chance to see robocop again with modern cgi and fx of today's movies. It was a blast I wish it was filmed in 3D!! I want to see it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RoboCop (2014): Dir: Jose Padiha / Cast: Joel Kinnaman, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson, Abbie Cornish: Inferior remake of a film that asked questions regarding man's relationship with technology. The screenplay is surprisingly faithful, with the exception of the hero's tragic injury, but it comes down to the expected shootout and blam blam action violence. Joel Kinnaman plays police detective Alex Murphy who is subject to a car explosion that leaves him near dead. Gary Oldman plays the chief scientist of an organization that aligns his remains to robotic parts to form RoboCop. He is revised and must adjust to his limited human remains and robot body parts as well as face his wife and son. Michael Keaton plays the corrupt company CEO who is countering his robotic police force with something with some sort of a conscience. Oldman is ordered to erased much of Murphy's memory rendering him almost like a zombie but he slowly recreates his accident and sets out to solve his own attempted murder, which involves police corruption. Director Jose Padiha doesn't do a terrible job but it still pales to the original. Kinnaman brings forth the confusion of his current state as well as piece together his whole life both mentally and physically. The rest of the cast is represented by the best cardboard could offer, especially Samuel L. Jackson as some sort of talk show host with pathetic hair. Abbie Cornish is flat as Kinnaman's wife who realizes that her sex life has been reduced to nuts and bolts. This film is not a total car wreck but it's not exactly out of the scrap heap either. Score: 5 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good retake but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first: I will review this movie independently from the original 1987 Robocop movie as a movie of its own, as the amount of differences don't classify it as a remake in my opinion.This movie has a lot of potential. It has the style going for it. It also is visually amazing. The robots move fluidly, there is hardly a moment where anything looks fake, out of place, or unrealistic, despite the futuristic ideas behind it. The audio is up to par as well, the story is - mostly - fine. Everything set for an enjoyable action movie, right? Yes, but this one wants to go beyond that and even includes some psychological and moral questions. So where's the problem? The problem I have, and there obviously must be a problem looking at the 6/10 I'm rating this movie, is the amount and severity of logical flaws throughout the movie, which just lowered the enjoyment I - as a person that can enjoy a simple action flick without great storyline - got from watching this. It certainly is worth watching once nonetheless, I was just left with disappointment afterwards.Here are some of the issues I had: There is absolutely no back-story. We are sent to the future and a lurid TV show propagandizing machines as executive force in America shows terrible conditions in a foreign country where these machines are already in use. One is left to assume "war" but nothing certain is being told.Alex Murphy turns into the perfect "host" for the Robocop project after being hit by a car bomb. We see how he gets hit by the explosion and are later told he suffered severe burns and organ failure. Firstly, the impact he suffers as seen in the movie hardly suggests any severe burning, as he is pushed away and lands out of reach of the flames. Heavy damage to bones and internal organs is far more realistic. Secondly, the next time we see him there is nothing left but half a head (and brain), lungs, and one hand, no arm or any connective tissue. No explanation whatsoever how severe burns led to scientists having to remove basically everything his body consisted of. A main premise of the movie is the question/debate whether machines can replace humans, which is worsened by the execution of a young boy with a knife by one of the big machines on live TV. However, later on, from Robocop Murphy's perspective, we clearly get to see that the machines are programmed to evaluate any given situation, which seems to be working amazingly well. In light of that, a robot would have never (repeatedly!) shot a young boy whose only weapon was a kitchen knife. This reaction is rather that of a stressed human in that situation than that of a programmed rational robot, one of the pro-robot points stated in the movie.After OmniCorp surpasses the so-called Dreyfuss law, preventing robot forces on America's streets and supported by a majority of citizens, by placing a human inside a robot, suddenly the public's opinion switches by 180 degrees and a vast majority in Congress approves dropping the Dreyfuss law. The idea behind it makes sense: if the main point of criticism of robots was the lack of human empathy and feelings, fusing both could turn public opinion around. However, public opinion would only be realistically turned for similar projects combining a human mind with robotic efficiency, no way this one special case would suddenly make everyone accept "pure" robots. It is shown very clearly that the public sees Robocop more as a human than machine. Within this public turnaround, there is another flaw, regarding the aforementioned TV show, The Novak Element. Host Pat Novak explains, shortly after Robocop has been successfully installed as officer, that on their website, a poll has resulted in 50% of its participants voting for the dropping of the Dreyfuss law. However, as the show is clearly pro-robots/OmniCorp, its audience would mainly consist of people who are (made) likely-minded, so a result of 50% pro would be pretty devastating even before Robocop. The number should be far higher.Towards the end of the movie, Dr. Norton removes Robocop's transmitter (even though what is meant is a receiver) with his bare hands and in seconds. Murphy could have easily done this himself to prevent his suit being shut down, as he surely had the information about its location and is shown to be able to act against protocol multiple times throughout the movie.Later on, Antoine Vallon, the man responsible for the explosion that almost killed Murphy, is targeted by Robocop on his revenge mission. He knows which size of ammunition is able to perforate the Robocop suit, which is possible due to the model being very similar to the non-manned original smaller robot units, however, nobody but himself actually shoots with these dangerous rounds. If the rest had no weaponry strong enough to harm Robocop, any attempt at doing so would be pointless. And if Vallon knows about the necessary round size, he would definitely also know about Robocop's ability of thermal vision, which gave him more of an advantage over his opponents and their night vision than fighting in broad daylight. Hence, he would never even attempt to fight in darkness.And one last thing that bothered me is the "Red Asset" tag. Sellars has one and is almost impossible to kill for Robocop, yet the bigger robots guarding the OmniCorp building as well as the human guards all have none. Sellars knew Murphy was overriding his programming and heading for him, it would have been a simple yet effective measure to equip all defenses with this tag, making it basically impossible for Murphy to succeed in the end. This is a minor point, however, as it would have been very hard to include this and still come to a credible ending where Robocop succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was every bit of "MEH" that I though it would be.Now I have to write a minimum of ten lines to post a review.Here is some Shakespeare: To be, or not to be--that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep-- No more--and by a sleep to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep-- To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub, For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause. There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of th' unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscovered country, from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprise of great pitch and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action. -- Soft you now, The fair Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remembered.</fullReview>

If you like tech and ideas then you will prefer this Robocop as I do.

		<fullReview>It is hard not to compare this remake with the original. It has a more modern look, but the pacing is too slow. The first part just drags on. By trying to make the story more like a drama, they make Robocop more human. The premise should be fine on paper but does not actually work, especially if one has seen the original one. In fact, focusing too much on the human drama, they are making Robocop into a wimp. It does not help that Joel Kinnaman does not seem to emote well. Using big names in supporting roles does not help elevate the movie much. Both Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman's performances seem disappointing. Samuel L. Jackson is useless. Jay Baruchel is unrecognizable but is great, though he does not have much screen time. Jackie Earle Haley does not get to showcase his talent at all. So far, the best role Haley has been casted in is Watchmen. Apart from that, he has had very small and unimportant roles. In fact, I am wondering why they did not cast Haley as Robocop. He can do action and drama much better. In short, this remake is a huge disappointment because it focused too much on drama but cast a weak lead actor.</fullReview>

The most obvious theme is when does robotic justice (drones, automatic street light tickets, etc...) pass from protection to oppression of freedoms. It also grazed free will and making choices. RoboCop believed he was making choices but his human limitations would not allow him to act as fast as the machinery so when he thought he was deciding, he was simply along for the ride.Worth a viewing if you want some action and debate on how big "big brother" should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts on a strong note with Samuel L Jackson playing the PR puppet and viewers getting the impression that a large greedy corporation is willing to unleash drones on innocent people for law enforcement, you get a good first impression with the shot in Tehran. The suspense is well maintained for the first one hour. But then the plot collapses as Robocop gets more interested in dissecting his own past and pursue those who have wronged him. I was left wondering if revenge makes a better plot than crime fighting. It is also confusing to keep track of who is dying and who is just getting stunned. I also could not figure out if the CEO was involved in the death of the Human Robocop. So all in all a pretty average film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually not all that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robocop, the 2014 reboot, is a movie that is very easy to overlook. No redo can ever match the fun, ultra-violent, satirical tongue-and-cheek Robocop that Paul Verhoven directed 27 years ago. Though this is all true, the new one is not entirely terrible. The story is the same. Police officer Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is nearly killed in the line of duty and is brought back to life as Robocop by the robotic organization Omnicorp. He seeks vengeance against the thugs who tried to kill him and also takes down the company that made him. He also tries to understand and accept his new fate as a cyborg while coming to terms with how his bodily change impacts his wife and son. The entertainment mostly lies in the special effects and action sequences. However, the writer delivers some breathing room for the main protagonist. He is not a clear- cut, one-dimensional character. The audience is given the chance to comprehend the hero's plight and thus able to root for him as he overcomes his many predicaments.Joel Kinnaman may not be the best actor, but he gives a subtle performance as Murphy/Robocop. He does a better job portraying the man Murphy whereas Peter Weller rules as Robocop. I really should not compare the two though. Both actors perform differently and do well in their own ways. Abbie Cornish as Murphy's wife is very underwhelming as a woman who has lost her husband to a machine. I had a difficult time believing in her. Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton make up for it as the men who build and design Robocop. I was never aware that Oldman could play such a sympathetic character like Dr. Norton and Michael Keaton as a savvy, yet a bit obsessed businessman as Raymond Sellers. These roles almost go against these actors' typecast. I will always remember Keaton as Beetlejuice and Batman and Oldman as psychotic villains like Ivan from Air Force One and Mason Verger from Hannibal. Nonetheless, both do exceptional work here. Sadly, the screenwriter turns Keaton into a secondary antagonist for the last half hour of the movie, which takes away some of the film's credibility, making the ending particularly forced, contrived, and anti-climatic. Keaton is not meant to play a bad guy. Mischievous maybe, but not the villain. The actor who steals the show is Samuel L. Jackson as Pat Novac, the narrator of sorts. His outrageous, authoritative voice contrasted with his out of style toupee and clean suit makes him the ideal, patriotic news spokesperson. The thing to admire about Jackson is that he takes roles he enjoys. For only around 15 minutes of screen time, he makes himself larger-than-life. If he had grown a beard and wore a top hat, I could believe him as Uncle Sam. He has that power. All in all, this is a fun movie. It will probably be forgotten like the slews of other action flicks and reboots, but unlike many of those, this one is actually not bad. On a day where you need a movie with some brains but not enough to reach Chris Nolan or William Friedkin levels, I recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Murphy/Robocop, nearly lifeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do credit the producers for taking the risks of remaking a classic AND attempting a different perspective than the original. However, in order to do this successfully, one needs to understand the elements that made the original "Robocop" a classic.The classic film "The Terminator" had already addressed the dangers of robotic warfare, soldiers, armor and drones. However, "Robocop" (1987)focused on the dehumanization of mankind and one man's struggle to regain the humanity taken from him. While physically almost all machine, "Murphy" was more human than all of the other characters, except for his partner and a sympathetic police lieutenant. In this "Robocop," there are plenty of sympathetic humans supporting Murphy, even if some of them are seriously flawed.Dan O'Herlihy was brilliant playing the white collar psychopath CEO of Omnicorp in "Robocop" (1987). His CEO was not even aware he was a monster. Likewise, Ronny Cox brilliantly played a corporate executive clearly aware of his white collar evil. Unfortunately, Cox's character does not appear in the remake, having been replaced by paramilitary robotics engineer, extremely well played by Jackie Earle Haley. While Haley is great, his character is a poor substitute for the character played by Ronny Cox.Likewise, Kurtwood Smith's hilariously evil assassin in "Robocop" (1987) has been replaced by a bland assassin blandly played by Patrick Garrow.Thankfully, Garry Oldman and Abbie Cornish, who play characters who either did not exist or were peripheral to the plot in "Robocop" (1987) perform brilliantly. Cornish, a world class actress, is, quite simply, amazing in a nothing role. I shudder to think how this "Robocop" would play without her.Finally, one of the brilliantly prophetic elements of the original "Robocop" was the trivialization of news and entertainment, clearly suggesting a "dumbed-down" society totally unconscious of the decay and chaos surrounding them. However, in this "Robocop," we get a poor parody of Fox News and "The O'Reilly Factor" and an overused Samuel L. Jackson instead of either a Bill O'Reilly lookalike or Alec Baldwin (who would have been perfect). In addition, Detroit in this "Robocop" looks like a prosperous city, not a "war zone".The producers would have been better served by simply re-shooting the original story with updated special effects, as the stop motion animation in the original "Robocop" was the worst thing about the movie.I give "Robocop" (2014) a weak "6" based ENTIRELY on Abbie Cornish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slightly different RoboCop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 2028. Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) is the CEO of OmniCorp whose robots are used to patrol the streets of Tehran. Business is good except Senator Dreyfuss had passed a bill banning security robots in America. Marketing guy Tom Pope (Jay Baruchel) comes up with a PR move to sell the public on RoboCop. Police officer Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is investigating gun runner Vallon but he and his partner get double-crossed by corrupt cops. Alex is heavily injured in a car bomb. Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) takes what's left to create RoboCop.This is a deeper darker remake of 1987 action classic. It takes a bit more pains to lay out the process to make him a robot. It's a more in-depth look into the difference between man and machine. That does make the first half slower. The wife played by Abbie Cornish is given a bigger role. Even the people in the corporation isn't monolithic. Michael Keaton is a little bit more nuanced than Ronny Cox. This has both good and bad. The original is much more of a fun action ride with simplified characters. As a popcorn movie, the original is much more enjoyable. This one is slightly realistic and darker. The action is pretty good although I would like more real stunts. I think RoboCop is a good franchise to use real cars rather than CGI. The one undeniable thing is that I love the motorcycle. It gives the movie kinetic energy just by him riding on it. Joel Kinnaman plays a different cop than Peter Weller. Weller always struck me as a boy scout. It could be due to 'The Killing', but I see Kinnaman with more with an edge. Overall this is a remake with a slightly different tone. It's not necessarily better or worst but it does have differences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting But Not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RoboCop, surprisingly, is a movie of big ideas. The indestructibility of the human soul; the rise of robotic warfare; the control of America by corporations. The movie is not entirely successful in dealing with these ideas, but is quite entertaining in its effort to do so.RoboCop is our hero. In his former life he was Alex Murphy, a married man, a father, and a police officer. And then, he is tragically wounded, paralyzed from the waist down. An omnipresent corporation (appropriately named OmniCorp) took advantage of this situation, inducing Alex's wife to consent to a procedure in which Alex is inserted inside of a mechanical body. OmniCorp's motives are not altruistic. They wanted to create a RoboCop so as to promote robotic policing and warfare, an idea to which Americans are apparently resistant. OmniCorp wanted a machine with the appearance of humanity. However, as the movie develops, RoboCop turns out to be a human with the appearance of a machine.As RoboCop/Alex begins his policing duties, OmniCorp repeatedly tries to stifle RoboCop's human emotions and tendencies. Yet this humanity consistently re-emerges, ultimately to OmniCorp's demise. The movie plays well the theme of human free will. The movie appears to take the stance that the human soul, though weak, can ultimately triumph over mechanical impositions. The movie also addresses the fundamental difference between mechanical and human bodies. There is a powerful scene in which OmniCorp's scientist (Gary Oldman) encourages a man to play his guitar with his new mechanical hands. The man tries, and yet the mechanical hands are simply not the same.The movie, with less success, also addresses issues of corporate governance and robotic warfare. OmniCorp and its leader become conniving caricatures towards the end, unconvincing as candidates for a future of corporate control. Moreover, the movie never reaches a conclusion on the issue of robotic policing, but just lays out the pros and cons ? greater efficiency but less humanity, greater protection but less control.The movie's greatest flaw is that it is simply too damn serious. This is a plot that could use a healthy dose of humor. But Joel Kinnaman, who plays RoboCop, simply slides between being morose and snide. His sidekick hardly makes an appearance and never develops into a fulsome character. But of course, there is always Gary Oldman to save the day. RoboCop is not a great movie. The action scenes are slick and efficient, but ultimately the movie lacks a human heart. This is odd, considering the movie's premise. Nevertheless, the ideas are intriguing and make this movie worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie fans are split on this new Robocop movie; they hate the missing R- rating, the social satire, the Weller. I however, had quite a fun time with it. Michael Keaton, is a big time electronics/weapons manufacturer who is desperately trying to make a splash with a new robotic law enforcement officer. However he needs a human to put in that suit so he finds recently obliterated, Officer Alex Murphy, who after a horrific explosion uses the suit as a life support system and as a weapon against crime. This is how I see this take on the beloved Robocop franchise; it IS a toned down film in terms of violence and maybe isn't as satirical as the 80s classis but I don't think that hurt the movie. What I see is Robocop for a crowd that has symbols like Iron Man and Batman and want a universally loved hero. This movie sold that kind of Robocop rather well. It's definitely an action movie, but there's some real character development in this movie, especially with the man in iron suit himself. Much more than the original even, you really feel for Alex Murphy. My favorite scene in this movie was when he first sees whats left of his human body, it's pretty gripping stuff. Joel Kinnaman, is the lead and I thought he was OK. But it's Michael Keaton and Samuel L Jackson that steal the show for me. The action and special effects were done rather well, but admittedly I would've liked a bit more gritty violence. There are some moments where the movie kind of drags and you wanna just see Robocop kick some ass. It's a fun movie, I really don't think it's as bad as the majority of society makes it out to be. The action scenes are awesome, there's some strong character moments and it's a refreshing reintroduction to a classic character and I wouldn't mind seeing more installments in the future. It does not of course compare to the original, but I recommend you buy it on blu-ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RoboCop. There are a lot of people who hear that word and then start telling everyone how much they love "RoboCop". I understand why. I'm a "Total Recall" person, myself, but RoboCop is a great movie and basically on the National Register of Historic Places.Except now, because of this stupid waste of Gary Oldman, I have to clarify that I love the ORIGINAL "RoboCop" and not this impostor, whose only purpose for existing as far as I can tell is to make "RoboCop" fans look smug when they qualify that they like the ORIGINAL "RoboCop" and not the impostor. Clever, but that will isolate them from society and ultimately backfire when they learn how to build their own RoboCops, or when the price of RoboCop knock-offs from China comes down to a reasonable level. "Total Recall" fans would never attack anyone with a RoboCop.Anyway, pretty much this is a video game. The action sequences are decent; all the "cutscene" material in between is terrible.Below is a short list of stupid decisions on behalf of Jose Padhila.1. Murphy's family lives to see Murphy turned into an emotionless robot. That's cruel in a way Verhoeven's film never was, and I don't see why it's so important. Aren't you supposed to feel sorry for the oppressed RoboCop, turned from subject to object? How can you feel sorry for poor Robocop when you're busy also feeling sorry for his family? This is a Hollywood action film. Stop shoehorning! Ever notice how movies today look like the sets were no fun at all to be on?2. Samuel Jackson. I read in a review somewhere, the critic thought it was pointless to have Offensive Sam Jackson speaking to a live audience of no one at all.3. Using the original theme song to transparently get us nostalgic and ready to love everything about this movie because it reminds us of the original "RoboCop".Well, it was about what I expected from a documentary filmmaker who thought journalism is exchangeable with narrative film, and who had to drive his point home in the first "Elite Squad" by including a scene where the cop who's pretending not to be a cop and is trying to be a lawyer or something by going to school sits through a lecture on Foucault. I don't know anything about Brazil's higher education, but whether or not it's accurate it's still, like, contrived to the point where you feel embarrassed for the movie. In fact, I wouldn't blame you if you started believing movies like this are idea seeds materialized by the singularity to harvest our human empathy to power their A.I.Speaking of A.I., the action looks a lot like the Metal Gear Solid games, which were directly inspired by action movies, so we're starting to repeat ourselves there. Interestingly, the Metal Gear Solid games are renowned and notorious for their cutscenes.Booooooo!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Reality Than Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be an enjoyable action film with some exciting sequences. It may even be an improvement on the original, and I felt that detective Alex Murphy's character was developed more in this remake. The CGI animations are top notch and completely believable. Indeed most of the technology depicted is less science fiction than reality. Important commentaries are made on the security questions that face us today. The film proceeds with a mechanical precision that blends well with the theme of security automation. But when that mechanical feel is broken by Detective Alex Murphy's human side we also come to understand why humanity can never be left out of the security equation. Robocop deals with both the question of when does more security equal less freedom, and also examines the possible moral costs of drone strikes with less human supervision. I think the film makes it clear that it is not a supporter of gunboat diplomacy. Monitoring of people's movements through cell phones and CCTV is a constant in the film, and the audience may ask if anyone is ever free if they are under continual surveillance. Criminals do get caught quickly with these methods in Robocop though, and at the movie's end the importance of American family values that go beyond computer programming are highlighted. So at the end of the day this film is not judgmental about the use of technology in ensuring the security of citizens. It just asks that we will continue to have watchful and moral human eyes involved to prevent abuses of new technology. I for one continue to hope that it is being used for the best interests of our population in a dangerous time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't think it needed to be made, but it was, so here we go...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't anxious to see this one. I love the original RoboCop and remakes are almost always terrible or at best mediocre. But every once in awhile you get a good one. I will say that this movie was better than I expected it to be. It had some strong points, as well as some weak ones. Let me cover the good first. The supporting cast is strong, particularly Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton, and Jackie Earle Haley. The special effects are excellent. I didn't see anything that topped the creativity of the original movie but clearly the effects have come along way since so they managed to pull off the first film's designs even better. I liked that it tried to be different in quite a few ways rather than a carbon copy clone of the original.Now, the bad. Joel Kinnaman is not an especially strong lead. He certainly doesn't have the presence or talent of Peter Weller. While it does try to mix some things up from the original, which I applaud, it still has this feeling of "This was done already and better." The satire in this one is much less clever than the first film, as well. Despite the seriousness of the story, the first movie was fun. This one isn't that fun, with the exception being Sam Jackson's final scene. It also suffers from the same thing that plagues so many of these remakes, particularly sci-fi and horror remakes: it lacks visual style. The polished music video gloss and sameness of mainstream genre movies these days is tiresome to me. To see more evidence of it, look no further than another recent remake of a Verhoeven film, Total Recall. This remake has a lot in common with that one. Oh, and I hated that camera flicker trick they used. I think it was supposed to be emulating how it looks for Murphy when he's booting up or something but it was just annoying.All that said, it's not an unenjoyable movie. Does it surpass or even match the real RoboCop? No, but I suppose if you look at it as less of a remake and more like a reboot (like Spider-Man, Batman, etc.), that makes it easier to swallow why this was even made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacking in both charm and originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Robocop is one of the classic action films. It's had gory action, funny one liners and created one of the icons of action through Peter Wellers cold, emotionless performance as Robocop. Obviously with a character so iconic as Robocop I, like many others was very doubtful when I heard of the Robocop remake. And with each new piece of news such as the 12A rating and changing the legendary costume from grey to black, my doubts continued to grow. Then after watching it I unfortunately discovered that all my doubts were well founded with this weak remake that is the 2014 Robocop. It takes pretty much the same story as the original Robocop. Cop gets killed, brought to life as robot and goes after the corruption within the city. But rather than putting a distinct spin on the character, the film instead uses the same style as the Total Recall remake. It takes something that stood out because of it's distinct style and remade it into something which looks like every other action movie. I wouldn't say they're badly made, but at the same time when there's nothing making these fights stand out there's little reason to actually watch them. I would probably hinge this on producers since the director Jos Padilha was forced to keep a family friendly rating and was only allowed limited creative control. This is the same problem with a lot of Hollywood films right now and reduces the lack of originality within filmmaking. Even if producers are worried about giving away control for a big budget film like this, it remains important to take the risk and trust the directors to make the film in their own way. Otherwise all these blockbusters start to look far too similar. But the problem with this film does not come only from its style, but also it's story. The entire plot hinges around the way that he goes from a loving father into an emotionless robot. The problem being we never see him be a lovable guy. Yes we do get a scene with him putting his son to bed and trying to have sex with his wife, but nothing that demonstrates any real closeness with his family or personality for that matter. We never learn anything about him and so when he does become an emotionless machine we can't see as much of a difference. For a film that's 2 hours long, I don't see why we couldn't have had an extra 5 minutes of flashbacks or prologue that could demonstrate the kind of person he was before the accident. And for those of you thinking that character doesn't matter because it's an action, it does matter when a significant amount of time is devoted to the philosophical problems of taking away a man's emotions. Then there's Robocop himself. When you're using a character as iconic as this, you've got to live up to expectations and treat him as the legend he is. Instead this film gives little build up to the character and you never get the feeling that this is a cool character. This is best shown by the actual introduction of Robocop in the full suit for the first time. Usually when you unveil a character that people recognise they're built up by showing glimpses before we get a full view of the character. But here he's just revealed seeing the full suit in view. Admittedly this won't bother new viewers at much, but he won't stick out at all to them and fans of the character like myself will see that the character is not done justice here. Beyond this, the film adds near to nothing to make it stand out from the original. The only way a remake shall ever work is if it adds to the source material in some way. Without this there's not going to be any point in creating it because it's just rehashing the same experience, just with a worse style. Worse yet, it ignores some of the things that made the original so iconic such as its extreme gore and the cool cop partner, replacing them with more generic elements such as VFX heavy battle and a bland cop without character. But even if you were to ignore the fact that this was a remake, it would still be a bad film due to its weak story and dull style creating a distinct lack of memorable moments. Even with the strong cast with the likes of Jackson and Oldman there remains little to no reason to watch this 2 hour bore. If you've never watched the original Robocop, watch that instead of this. And if you've already watched it, just watch it again. You would get far more entertainment from a second viewing of the original than you would from ever watching this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am big fan of Robocop since long time. I was curious to see, whats new in this? But 10/10 for keeping our expectations. This movie is amazing, action, emotions and human values. Very good work Jos Padilha. Abbie you are beautiful and sexy perfect match and work as Alex wife Clara. Question is can I have so honest wife as her? Well dreams apart. Joel Kinnaman as Robocop tough one facial expressions. Nice work. Today we can make a Robocop, but this movie question a fundamental thing Hero's are honest and I quote from this movie, " machines cannot be corrupt..." Thats tragedy of our system either in India or America we have few good men as Dr.Norton. There is a scene when Alex is a brain with chest nothing else. Great future ahead. I was little disappointed with background music and there could have been more action in the script. Lastly, 8 for this beautiful remake of Robocop in contemporary context with same old values. I am desperately waiting for the new sequel of Robocop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give it a chance it deserves it. From a massive Robocop fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I gotta say I a massive a fan of the original Robocop, I 've given a 10/10 and I have given half a dozen 10s from around 500 titles I have rated. Now that I have cleared that I can say that I was extremely skeptical for such a project and its potential direction. Would it be &#x3b1; reboot? or remake? The first positive comes as the answer to this; it is neither. For a viewer who has no knowledge of the original it is an autonomous sci-fi adventure and a decent one at that, for the rest of us yes it doesn't reach even remotely the original's brilliance but it respects us. It says practically the same story and at times it pays homage the original but it does it in a measured and discreet way.Firsty the good stuff: a) Ambitious project with excellent cast including Hollywood's A-listers in key roles.b) Interesting visual effects, yes they are aided by the fact that in essence it isn't large scale like "Avengers" but very good overall.c) Joel Kinnaman as Murphy. Not for his performance but for his physic and face. He somehow has a victimized face, he is not overly masculine (Wolverine) or wise guy (Ironman) or very young (Spiderman), he is just about right, and as famous as he should be. Also he is tall but not very muscular, for instance you don't see Dwayne Johnson and think what he needs is a suit of armor. As for his performance he does an OK job but nothing more.d) Abbie Cornish, for me excellent performance, she delivers the depth of emotions a woman after such a shock endures and adds the necessary emotion throughout the film.e) The twist. After you 've seen it you'll understand f) The homage it pays is well judged. The score the ed 209 sgt. Lewis, it it was more it would be a rip off the original if it was less it might as well not be Robocop.The bad stuff: A) The lack of gore and ott violence. In the same way the references were well executed the lack of gore was evident no matter how you see it Robocop universe is an extremely violent one.B) Weak villains, they weren't evil enough not even close. They had their own agendas but they never got personal with Murphy the way Clarence Boddicker did. More C) The suit it was too sleek it should more intimidating D) There will always be the original.Overall 7/10 for me, it could be better but it certainly could be much worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dual review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to split this review into 2 part. 1. If you didn't saw the original movie yet, then this will be a fair action movie. CGI effect and storyline good and acting also pass the test. The tempo of the movie is good with very boring parts (seems American movies always have some unnecessary love scenes).2. If you already saw the original movie you'll be somewhat disturbed due to changes (Lewis, the rank of Murphy, the base of the story, etc.). I missed Verhoeven naturalist vision of future Detroit, the raw brutality and beat-up environment. Also, while Peter Weller was ideal for the role of Alex Murphy, Joel Kinnaman is somewhat easy compared to Weller. And one really important thing (from my point of view): the weaponry of Murphy doesn't has the character, the style which it has before.At the end its worth to watch, but won't be a classic like its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robocop (2014) had some interesting ideas behind it but it's hard to keep the comparisons to the original version out of mind especially when the original is far superior and that's ultimately the problem with the new Robocop, not enough new ideas to warrant the remake.The bad guys aren't as memorable or menacing. A real let down, there. The action isn't as heavy or gore-filled but it's all very contemporary and fast-paced with lots of explosions, fancy gadgets and CGI which keeps it from being boring by any means. The supporting cast in Gary Oldman, Samuel L Jackson and Michael Keaton are all very good while the younger and main cast just seem to fall flat and just seem to be running through the motions of a very familiar story.Overall, it had its moments. A well-executed, but by the numbers action movie but ultimately nothing special or memorable here to rave about. Again hard not to compare to the original which has a ton of re-watch value, whereas Robocop (2014) doesn't.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though this movie has a very bad rating of just 6.5 I saw it because I had really enjoyed the Robocop movie from 1987. And at that time, that kind of sci-fi was just unimaginable.This movie is not a remake of that movie and has a somewhat different story line. (I hope you have read the official story line, so I won't tell that again.) The movie is nearly 2 hours long, but there are no filler kind of scenes or anything as there is a continuous engaging story happening all the time. And I was wondering how on earth could this gorgeous movie have just a 6.5 rating! And I saw the last 10 mins and understood. :-)..... They sort of killed the movie in the climax. So be prepared.I highly recommend this movie. Excluding the final 10 minutes - Its enjoyment factor is: * 80% as good as the original movie.* 80% as good as Iron Man 1. Yes, the action and cgi are that good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts by implying that suicide bombers are freedom fighters against global oppression and does little to redeem it's self after. It does attempt to raise issues relating to technology and security, and given the cast, it certainly could have explored them. Instead it devolves into an average video game and regularly insults the viewer. If you're a pre-teen, with a limited imagination, it will entertain, otherwise it will just seem like a waste of potential.The production value and cast are above average. The real problem is that the movie assumes everyone with a brain and a checkbook is corrupt. Other than Robocop, his wife and child, and his one best friend, everyone is terribly corrupt, and everyone in the movie, and I mean everyone, is simplistic and one dimensional. This problem is made much worse by the fact that these one dimensional characters are often shown in a completely unrealistic light, that's only justification is in providing the viewer with a false sense of tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Merely borrows the title "Robocop"...Just an entertaining movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2014's Robocop merely borrows it's title from the original, as it as little to compare with "Robocop". I won't be comparing both the original and the remake, as I find it pointless. In my opinion, when a movie is remade, it should borrow the key elements from the original, and then remake the plot. The director should gives a new take on the same premise, a new point of view, otherwise it's just an update and not a remake. Robocop(2014) does that. In comparison with the original we have the title, some characters names and...Robocop. The rest is new, but is it any good? Robocop(2014) plot revolves around Alex Murphy, a good cop that unravels a possible conspiracy in the police department. Evidently someone makes an attempt to murder him, leaving him paralised and almost dead. A corporation that is trying to aproove a law to have robots fighting crime in merican soil, soon offers to help him have a live again as Robocop, a machine with a human conscience and human emotions. The premise is quite interesting, for someone who didn't saw the original, but this one revolves more about the consequences and individual dramas of Robocop and it's creator...a little too much. The movie is a bit slow paced, and the story just isn't original...and I'm not talking about the original Robocop, I mean, we have seen this story so many times now in so many movies, it's more of the same. The movie is also too predictable, which leads to boredom. If you know what's going to happen before it actually happens, it just becomes boring. That being said, Robocop is watchable and not at all a bad movie. It has decent acting, decent visual effects, decent action sequences, it's all preaty decent, but not something that's going to stick in your memory for the ages. It's an entertaining movie, a good movie to watch while eating popcorn, or whatever. A decent movie, just don't get your hopes high and don't even try to compare it to the original, enjoy this one as it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the 1987 film of the same name, 'Robocop' works, but only in its second-hour. A dull first-hour disheartens! 'Robocop' Synopsis: In 2028 Detroit, when Alex Murphy - a loving husband, father and good cop - is critically injured in the line of duty, the multinational conglomerate OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer. The reason where 'Robocop' falters is its erratic Writing. The first-hour begins tepidly, but gathers solid momentum in its second-hour, which also delivers a terrific climax. Also, the original was far more gory &amp; captivating, in terms of presentation &amp; execution.Joshua Zetumer's Screenplay works, but only in its second-hour. The first-hour is dull! Jos Padilha's Direction is creative. Cinematography is excellent. Editing is fine. A Special Mention for the incredible Action-Sequences!Performances-Wise: Joel Kinnaman as Alex Murphy/Robocop, is perfect. Gary Oldman enacts his part with wonderful ease, while Michael Keaton steals the show. Samuel L. Jackson has a small role, but he portrays the part remarkably well. Jackie Earle Haley is wasted.On the whole, 'Robocop' is part entertaining, part bland.</fullReview>

The dark humor is another missing feature, this Robocop is too serious and sometimes even close to boring.Is a well crafted action movie but it lacks the visual impact and shocking plot of his predecessor, mainly because of his kid friendly rating.

		<shortDescription>Baggy, unnecessary but not entirely merit-less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RoboCop is a 2014 American science fiction action film directed by Jos Padilha. It is a remake of the 1987 film of the same name and reboot of the RoboCop franchise. The film stars Joel Kinnaman in the title role, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, and Samuel L. Jackson.Whilst the original shrewdly grapples with premises like government corruption, identity and the venality of the media, the remake is disappointingly void of the ideas on majority. In a narrative inspired by, but not identical to the original, Alex Murphy - a loving husband, father and cop - is injured in the line of duty. In response to the country's crime epidemic, the conglomerate OmniCorp seize on this as an opportunity to create a new method of crime prevention ? an autonomous machine, RoboCop. Alex's transformation is graphic and horrifying, harking back to the extreme violence which was so intrinsic to the original. This however, is one of the few moments in the film which captures the intensity of the original and despite numerous odd f-bombs being peculiarly asserted throughout, the film is largely subdued and muted. Performances are uniformly good, especially Gary Oldman who plays Dr. Dennett Norton, Omni Foundation Chief Scientist who creates RoboCop. The writing on the other hand is shapeless and baggy, clocking in with a run time of almost 120 minutes, the film vastly outruns the original with little or any justification for doing so. On majority, the remake of RoboCop is largely an unnecessary, dumbed down rehash which is passably mind-numbing, but doesn't bring enough to the table to validate why the original needed to be remade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Ideas hampered by wooden acting from the lead and a PG-13 rating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robocop is a classic action flick. It is, people grew up with it, people saw it when it came out, when it came to VHS, when it came to DVD and Blu-Ray. 27 years on, Robocop is still a solid film, and the fan base only continues to grow. So why is it that a studio finds the need to remake it.Money of course, but i'm happy to say that, while there are many problems, Robocop manages to stand on its own quite well. The lead, Joel Kinneman, is a mixed bag. Great in some moments, completely laughable in others. He's not really likable either and I don't know why most of his dialogue, pre-robocop, was all gangsta, was the role written with a black guy in mind? because its just hilarious watching him say it, I think even he knows he sounds ridiculous.However the acting from Gary Oldman, Samuel L Jackson and Batman himself Michael Keaton is all top notch stuff. Oldman especially brings his A game, whether he did this film for a paycheck or not its nice to know that he always gives 100% to every role he plays.The action sequences are visual spectacle. They have a much more graceful and fluid compared to the original however, yes we have come to that point, the PG-13 rating really stutters the film. Criminals that don't swear, a taser gun instead of a real gun, no blood-not a drop. These things would have made the film better and more authentic but it hampers the film because they aren't in there, they need to be, it doesn't feel right with out a swear work here and there and a little blood squirt every now and again.The message of war with machines is wrong, man will always conquer machine, we shouldn't let machines decide our fate, blah blah blah. Way to over the top in delivering the message, the opening conveyed the message just fine, the rest of the film didn't need to hammer it in.Overall, Robocop is just fine, I don't think it needed to be made, I still think that, however it does have some interesting ideas and if your a fan of the original id say give it a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been great, but greed made it impossible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Paul Verhoeven directed the first film no one from the studios believed in this project and therefore he had the necessary artistic freedom to create Robocop's universe and it's themes. The result was an iconic and unforgettable surprise. 17 years later due to greed and demand, the studio made this "reboot", this time they gave it a big budget that came with a lot of expectation from all the involved parties, not to mention the impossible pressure that the studio put on Jos Padilha. The result? a very disappointing film. After the 2nd time I watched it I realized he made a very clever film. Just take Gary Oldman as the main character who represents Padilha and the struggle he goes through with creating Robocop/Alex Murphy as his product (the film). It is not a film about to good guys versus an army of criminals, it is a story of a story teller (scientist nevertheless) who fight to keep the last human remaining that was part of the original story. Think about this quote - "When the machine fights, the system releases signals into Alex's brain, making him think he's in control, but he's not. It's the illusion of free will."Jose Padilha actually addressed to us, the audience. Explaining about the illusion of free will as a director under the intruding executives/system.Anyway, 17 years of mythology, expectations form both fans and shareholders guaranteed that this will be a flop. It could have been a good film if the executives would have let him do his work, but we will never know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robocop has good premises, but feels rushed and inconcise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked many of the movie premises, from showing the real war propaganda, to robot cops and drones being on the cities of average America to how does consciousness work and what makes us humans and how does one cope with a metal body, with almost nothing left from your biological body. These are all great premises, great questions and could have been a real highlight for the movie, but unfortunately the movie doesn't concisely put them together and present it as one story, its rather disorganized different pieces that feel tacked on and even detrimental to the overall movie.There is just not enough fleshing out of these stories and they don't fit together into a one nice whole. The movie also starts extremely slow, with half the movie being about Murphy becoming Robocop and fighting in practice matches to become a real cop. I also didn't like the actor for the role, I felt like this actor couldn't live up to the original Robocop actor who is Robocop. This new actor didn't have the presence, the look, the Robocop feel. Overall a good effort, it had the premises, it had the potential, but it just wasn't good enough. I feel like the overall movie was weak, the action scenes weren't anything special, the dialogue wasn't great, the story didn't feel concise, etc...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isn't as un-nessesery as some would say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This new take on "Robo-cop" seems to have gotten a lot of peoples backs up. Now I've never been, and never will be a fan of all these remakes. But some original movies are less "un-touchable" than others, and the original "Robo-cop" to me, is hardly a classic. Its ridiculously 80's, and is all about dated looking technology. Plus the main character wears a mask, and acts like a robot. So pretty much any actor could play him. I can't help but feel that rebooting "Robo-cop" is maybe more justified than most. Though I can understand the backlash if your a fan of number 1.Overall, "Robo-cop" (2014) isn't as un-nessesery as some would say. Modern updates include an amazing cast, flashier technology, and a cool new black shiny costume. But its actually promising first half all feels out-down by a second half that doesn't know where to go. Disappointingly leading to a poor "this is now a franchise" ending.Though it is a decent action movie, and I'm not the biggest fan of the original. It still feels kind of forced on us by studio execs that just want to make a quick buck. Though it could have been so much worse. Here's hoping that the series at least goes onwards and upwards from this starting point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very intelligent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not sure why this is getting bad reviews from so many RoboCop fans.....oh wait...yes I am! It's because this sci-fi Robot Cop movie is actually a very intelligent look into the relationship of man and machine. It looks at the impending political issue of robotic police forces and robotic armies. It makes you think...I mean...really think! Robotic soldiers are in fact a very real thing. We already have drones flying all over our heads...and there are even think-tanks and PHD's writing theses about the moral question of whether to mechanize an army completely (or a police force). This issue is not far off in the horizon if you have done your research.No, there was not any blood, or gore, or countless blood-spurts (see 300 sequel for that) emanating from limbless bodies; but there was a good viewing experience. Unlike 300, which is really nothing more than a blood-fest with no real plot line or insight into anything (other than the fact that the whole movie was a social justice commentary used to prop up the empowerment of modern women). But that's in my 300 review...Robocop 2014 is a well-acted, well-shot, well-though-out piece of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few good thoughts brought up in this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall Robocop was not a great movie but it was not a disappointment either. What I enjoyed mostly about it was how it showed a political debate as to whether or not criminal law should be enforced by machines. I thought this was a timely issue to think about and quite often movies and novels (eg science fiction) are the first places issues like these enter the minds of the people. The story line took a hypothetical debate as such and followed a possible course of action that a corporate oligopoly with puppet representatives unconcerned with the dignity of the people along with one or two heroes of liberty and made a possible scenario of how it might unfold. You would not happen to know of such a government form today would you? There are a number of minor flaws with the movie but they are mostly best forgiven by mentioning that this is not a movie that will ever make it to the best of the bunch anyway-and leave it at that. I thought the robocop overacted in some scenes. Movies like this tend to exaggerate emotions in personal relationships (perhaps as a vicarious escape from the shallow relationships of many of their viewers); yes it is true that parents love their wives and children enormously but not so much that they would freak out and go ballistic or irrational in response to stress...unless the police department does a particularly bad job of screening cops' personalities in this case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to start off this review by saying that I have not seen the original Robocop(I know bring on the hate) so I went into this movie with an un biased open mind for this reboot. I don't really have a whole lot to say so I'll just mention what I liked about this movie1. A lot of cool action with plenty of explosions 2. A fairly realistic near future world 3. Samual L. JacksonI didn't walk into Robocop(2014) expecting an amazingly deep and brilliantly executed plot. I wanted to see a fun movie in the theater with my friends and that's exactly what I got. I admit from a strictly film making point of view this movie was not the greatest movie of all time by any stretch of the imagination but it was still good funSo I'd say check out Robocop if you want something entertaining to get you into the summer movie season spirit I give Robocop a 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i enjoyed the the movie very much but there are some negative points in direction......thats why i have given 8/10.ratiting to this movie...this movie is 1 time watch movie ... I like how these themes are teased out and zoomed in upon throughout the movie. Also, there are some absolutely delicious production details and CGIs that are just absolutely feasts to the eye. Not to mention the superb cast and the wonderful performances. I think this is a honest and loyal reboot that will appeal to fans of Robocop who fell in love with the story precisely for the moralistic themes it explores.There's no distinct feel-good actions scenes because the pacing is kept constant throughout and I don't see why there's an issue with the pacing being that way. It's hardly flat, it's just a very honest, straight- flushed story-telling, and it fits the themes that are underscored by the movie. Alex Murphy is a reluctant hero and he's ultimately a father and a husband whose personal agenda serves as his existential core.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was entertained, but i was entertained like a Saturday afternoon movie. I watched it thinking ... that is all they did with the action scenes. Wow, didn't they think about using stunt coordinators and choreographing some kick ... robot moves. Some scenes were simply boring action sequences. I would name them here but I don't want to spoiler anything.SPOILER ...Secondly, the script was cool. I like the idea of using Robocop as a marketing ploy. However, I think the beginning dragged on a bit too long. Also, a car bomb ... seriously, that was horribly boring way to go. I miss the excessively, over the top, ridiculously violent death that made Alex so emotional. Watching the car bomb go off was pretty lame way to over emote.SPOILER ...Finally, Robocop seemed so wimpy. It was kind of sad. I wanted him to be more of a bad ... ... kicker. He seemed more pathetic in this remake.Overall, I enjoyed it because it was simple, but not because it was a good way to remake the Robocop storyline. This could have been a series and instead they wimped out. Sony has no faith in its products.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very human, this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this basic premise of the human cyborg is so well known since the 1987 first edition that it does not require elaboration, it is interesting to note that this remake invests substantially in depicting human nature: the good, the bad and the ugly. There is the titular character that, after a struggle, achieves a balance between mechanical efficiency and human emotions. There is a bunch of most detestable villains in both business and political arenas. Then, there is charismatic super heavyweight Samual L. Jackson playing a talk show host propelled by Crusade-like zeal. He may well be the darling to the audience.The movie as a whole strikes a good balance between human sentiments and heart-pounding action. Not quite remembered from "The girl with the dragon tattoo" and "Safe house", Swedish actor Joel Kinnerman in the titular role rewards the casting people by demonstrating that their decision is a stroke of brilliance. Playing his wife, a much stronger role compared with that in the original, still young Abbie Cornish adds another collection of roles to her already impressive versatility. There are heavy weights too, such as Gary Oldman as the doctor agonizing between right and wrong and Michael Keaton as the ultra-villain. In the talent-wasted department is Jennifer Ehle as one of the villain's assistants. Among the rich pageantry of her screen appearances, the most remembers is her sensitive portrayal of Christabel LaMotte in "Possession" (2002).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eh...had promise but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It didn't quite deliver.Here's my breakdown of the film:Alex Murphy is done well. The rest of the cast do a good job in their roles, though I swear Samuel L Jackson has stopped acting and just has become a parody of himself. Every time he came on screen, I thought we were getting a Capital One commercial. The roles of the doctor and Officer Lewis are reversed from the original. In this version, the doctor (Oldman) gets probably more screen time than most of the supporting cast combined, which is fine. Gary Oldman always delivers in his roles, but what is lost is the dynamic between the two partners that we had in the original movie.The armor is updated; much sleeker, and Robocop is a lot more athletic. No more clunk clunk clunk as he plods around. Robocop can run, jump, etc. It's a nice update to the 80's version. Michael Keaton shouldn't be cast as a bad guy. He's only done it well once before (Pacific Heights) and he just didn't do it here.Speaking of bad guys...there isn't a central villain in this film. For hero films (super or otherwise), it is the villain that really makes the story. In the original, you had Clarence Boddicker, who was awesome. Then in the 2nd movie, you had Kane, who was fantastic. (The third Robocop film was just terrible). But there is no real main villain here. Sure, Murphy is blown up by the criminal Vallon - but Vallon has so little to do with the rest of the story, he's just a side-thought, and his death is so anti-climatic that you will miss it if you blink. Keaton - as already mentioned - just doesn't deliver as a villain.I know, I know, the real conflict is if Murphy still has his humanity, but come on...nobody goes to see Robocop for an existential journey. Give us a good villain!!The plot isn't too bad, and there's plenty of action (nothing like the original though). But the plot gets a bit murky at 2/3rds of the way through. So after Robocop kills Vallon and takes down the corrupt cops, he is shut down remotely and then they decide to "kill him" because...I think, because he killed one of the corrupt cops? But Gary Oldman saves the day and prevents the "termination" of Robocop, and then he proceeds to explain "everything." Robocop storms out and says "you lied to me!" But what was the lie? It was almost like there was some other element that got cut from the film. Perhaps Murphy's injuries WEREN'T that serious and he could have lived a more normal life? That would have been more in keeping with the original films. But we don't get that. We just get that Robocop is mad because he was lied to and then he goes off to kill Michael Keaton.The final scenes are great and terrible. It's great as he battles the super-robots guarding Omnicorp's headquarters and then has to get by Mattox. Great action, great choreographing (I know, CGI, but still, enjoyable to watch).But the climax on top of the building....what? We just learn that anybody with a Red Chip is off-limits to Robocop. The Red Chip (dot, whatever) is one of the first rules established in the film, and it is literally reinforced only about 3 minutes prior to Robocop using sheer will to violate his 4th directive. How? How is he able to shoot Michael Keaton? I felt like they could have done something creative here. Remember in the first one when he killed Dick Jones after he was fired by the old man? That worked great.What's also missing is the humor. Sure, Samuel L Jackson provides some, but it runs dry quickly and honestly, it is repetitive. All in all, this isn't a bad movie to watch. If you were a fan of the original, you'll enjoy seeing the story retold, but this doesn't improve on the original.</fullReview>

Samuel L jackson role in this movie doesn't add a thing in the plot you can call him actor # 6 and will do the same effect. maybe they wanted some star power which is the same reason Gary oldman have a lot of screen time testing and testing and testing.(not really a spoiler ) finally they keep messing with robocop's head over and over just do it once ! who is the genius who decided lets mess with him 5 mins before displaying him to the public !

		<fullReview>This movie had a very good potential, only thing lacking was the writing of the script to fit what a computer cop was able to do &amp; not to do and how he would be able to get around these scenarios. For example when he was holding the gun on anyone who had a wrist band and they would not be able to point a weapon on that person or he would shut down, The solution to solve this puzzle was very, very simple. RoboCop was a computer and he could analyze a predicament and figure a solution, so why when on the helipad did he not just shoot at the helipad and send the ricocheting bullets into Raymond Sellars and fatally wound him that way? Instead that crap of RoboCop try to force his gun up to Raymond Sellars and shoot him, (but RoboCop never did shut down when he raised his gun and shot Raymond Sellars, now what is wrong this story now, they just screwed with protocol of an OCP prime directive not to be able to point and shoot directly at a OCP official).Just a quick thought for you all, QuickMilt</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic Hollywood. Remaking classics from the 1980's and 1990's and making them worse. They have done it with Red Dawn, Total Recall and The Thing and now with Robocop.Lets start with the good:1. Its entertaining. From people getting killed to Samuel L Jacksons chat show this film is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. I found this film most of the time to be entertaining and fun.2. The action scenes. I found the action scenes in this were brilliant. My favourite is when Robocop has the face 40 robots in a simulation. Also I liked it when it fought 6 ED 209 at the same time. However I would have liked more.3. Its funny. There are some moments in this film which made me laugh. Most of them came from Samuel L Jacksons character Patrick Novak who hosts his very own chat show with graphics so futuristic.And now the bad:1. Boring As I mentioned earlier the action scenes are awesome but however the scenes between them are too long and boring. I nearly fell asleep a couple of times during this film and I have only done that once. However I did enjoy the development of Robocops journey.2. Not long enough I wanted more in this film from its 1 hour and 40 minutes runtime. I fill like they could have made 30 minutes longer and put more action scenes in the film and I might have given it a higher rating.3. Underused Actors I felt that most of this cast was underused apart from Joel Kinnaman and Gary Oldman. Abbie Cornish, who plays Robocops wife, should have had more screen time than she did. Even Michael Keaton, Who plays the boss of Omicorp, is underused. And I would have liked to have scene more Samuel L Jackson.Overall I enjoyed watching Robocop even though sometimes I was bored and wanted more action. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was expecting a lot from the new Robocop movie but I admit I am disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, classics like Conan The Barbarian , Total Recall, Predator have been attempted to revamp the dying series. Robocop had potential to make it big but lame script and poor direction takes a toll on the film.Robocop tells the story of brave cop Alex Murphy who is transformed into half robot - half machine after he meets with an attempted murder by local goons. Directed by Jos Padilha, Robo Cop is probably one of most famous franchise of early 90's and I have been an ardent fan of the series. Naturally my expectation was sky-high and trailer added further curiosity to menu.After watching the movie, I was thoroughly disappointed. The story of the movie is tweaked but the substance is same. The movie begins with not-so great action sequences and director does not waste any time and comes to crux of the situation where Alex changes to Robot. The scenes in the lab and testing simulation action sequence is gratifying but the acceptance of Robocop as the hero of Detroit was not convincing. The second half drama of corruption in midst of Detroit police department was executed brilliantly. In fact till the climax, movie will hold your attention but ending was not powerful as I thought. Visual effects were good but not outstanding. Action sequences could have been better considering this is CGI driven film. Background score was repeated as that of the original which I loved. Joel Kinnaman played his part well but I liked Peter Weller more as cop in a machine. Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman were outstanding along with good support from Abbie Cornish. Overall, I was expecting a lot from the new Robocop movie but I admit I am little disappointed. Average 2.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was good but, like most, if not all, remakes, it's ultimately a rehash of an original performance and inadvisable as most will always have the original in mind. And therein lies the problem with remakes. In my opinion, the remakes will always pale in comparison to the original despite having a bigger budget, different great actors, and slight variations. Sorry to sound like a "fanboy" unable to handle a "retelling" of a story but, to me, watching a remake is like watching a youtube re-enactment someone has uploaded.Had there not been and I not seen the iconic original, I probably would have given this movie a better review. Jackie Earle Haley, Michael Keaton, Gary Oldman, Abbie Cornish, and Joel Kinnaman were great but they would have better used in a Robocop 4 set in another city, with different character(s), even a female Robocop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible and pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robocop 2.5/10- It is hard for remakes to really be better than the original, especially when it comes to the awesome Robocop from 1987. This film had the great advantage of being made in the time where special effects needed for an actual Robocop movie exist. Sadly, the effects are the only thing even decent about the film, aside from that, this films offers nothing knew to its genre and is indeed a mediocre film.Let's start off with the plot which is the key for all good movies. This one you could see coming from a mile away. You will be able to guess who the real antagonist in this film will be within twenty minutes of the film and I guarantee you would be right. This adaption of the movie should not have been made and was clearly just a pathetic attempt to make money(and I am not sure a profit will actually happen at this point.) As we all know, most mediocre action movies have a handful of jokes throughout it and the only ones that actually made the theater laugh was towards the end when Samuel L. Jackson gives his trademark. Even though Samuel L. Jackson is a very accomplished actor and usually always adds something extra to nearly every film he is in, Jackson's portrayal as Pat Novak seemed average and I think it is clear that he lost interest in the project. Now, the newcomer Joel Kinnaman finally gets his shot for stardom as the widely known character Alex Murphy better known as Robocop. It was clear he gave his best effort but I do not think he was well suited for this role and I blame the casting department for that, not Kinnaman because he did the best he could. The only actor the gave his role something no one else could was Gary Oldman who plays Dr. Norton who is practically Robocop's creator. Oldman is such a phenomenal actor in everything he is in and Oldman was the reason that I did not walk out of the theater. The rest of the cast all did average. Now for the good part, the special effects. This department did give some pretty nice effects in the inferred scenes and they at least kept the movie entertaining for a while. The only thing I thought was impressive that they did was when they show what Robocop looks like under his armor. Also I would like to give credit to the wardrobe department for making an awesome Robocop suit that definitely looks better in black. Sadly, these departments can only do so much and for the first thirty minutes or so, the movie is pretty boring because of these departments were underused.I would only recommend this movie if you really want to see an action movie since this basically the only one out right now. Otherwise, should just wait till it comes on DVD.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having studied robotics at uni, this film was pretty much required viewing for me and that's perhaps the only reason I could keep watching until the end.I especially liked in the first movie, the moment where they decide to "lose the leg", showing the cloudy morals at play, reminiscent of Han Solo iconically shooting Gredo. Any nefarious deeds done by the company in this film are silly and only arise due to plot flaws.The film was absolutely full of plot flaws &#x2212; why was Robocop's face fine considering the injuries to the rest of him? Why did his robotic hand switch from right to left? Robocop had bullet-proof armour, yet regularly shot people instead of tasering them. Changes to his operation are explained away with an "I don't know" from the doctor. The head of the machine department has an understandable distaste for Robocop, which inexplicably grows into a deep hatred. There are plenty more, but I don't wish to spoil the film.All action scenes with Robocop were uninspiring and the film felt like paint-by-numbers from the director and writers. Michael Keaton was excellent as the CEO. Joel Kinnamon playing Robocop was uninteresting, seemingly because of the stigma that manly, straight American men face when considering going to acting school. Resultantly, there is a very small pool of actors with the all- American hero face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven's classic '80s sci-fi satire RoboCop (of which I've been a huge fan since first seeing it at The London Film Festival in 1987) is stripped down to its chassis, the biting social commentary and extreme ultra-violence removed, and what's left given a state-of-the-art makeover, resulting in a highly polished ultra stylish machine bristling with modifications designed with a much wider audience in mind. And although I will always opt for the original model given the choice, preferring my movies to have more of an edge, I have to say that this particular Hollywood re-imagining isn't anywhere as lame as it looked in early trailers.Directed by Jos Padilha, RoboCop 2014's new features include several interesting subplots?OCP's attempts to repeal a political act that prevents the use of robots in the US, corruption in the Detroit Police department, Murphy's relationship with his wife Clare (Abbie Cornish) and son David (John Paul Ruttan), and the numerous moral dilemmas that face scientist Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman, giving the film's best performance)?plus there's a brand new look and feel for the central character, who is much sleeker in design and can now run, jump and probably even do zumba. While none of this is much of a substitute for death by toxic-waste, Nancy Allen, big cars with really sh**ty gas mileage, and ED209 saying 'You have 20 seconds to comply', we should at least be thankful for small mercies.6.5 out 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.***Edit 4th Jan 2015*** Having just given the film a rewatch, I now rate this a full 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really bad but I still prefer the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess that, when I sat down to watch this movie, I was prepared to be disappointed. Well, it was not as bad as I feared but I was not really impressed either. There are some good parts in the movie and, of course, the special effects are more up to todays standards. However it lacks a lot of the appeal, the over the top gory violence and the cartoonish wow-factor that the original has. I guess it is because they wanted that silly PG-13 rating in the hope of raking in more cash. It is not the first time Hollywood greed have ruined a good movie unfortunately.The beginning of the movie is not bad. Taking out Murphy with a simple car bomb was rather disappointing though. Again here the movie lacks the gritty and brutal aspect that the original had. The parts where Murphy is awaken in the secret(?) research and manufacturing facility and him freaking out when discovering what he as become was enjoyable.Then it really starts to go downhill in what I usually refer to stupid Hollywood scripting. Ten minutes before Robocop is about to make his public debut then they do a huge info dump into his brain? That is just so poor unintelligent scripting. Of course it went to hell.The special effects are quite okay but again the scripting is just nonsense. Most of the time this highly intelligent combat cyborg is just rushing straight into the fire blasting away like some Terminator/Rambo wannabe. Sure it makes for some good firefights but it is still poor scripting.Then the ending. What was that? I do not refer to the actual ending where Murphy, luckily, prevails but the part after that with the TV-presenter (or whatever he was in the end) rambling on about traitors etc. That was just there to show the audience that they hoped to do a sequel but the nonsensical outburst did not really much sense. Actually I thought that those TV-presenter scenes where generally just a nuisance.On the whole it is not really a bad movie but it is sorely lacking the appeal of the original. Too a large extent this is due to it being reduced to a teenage no-rude-language-please type of movie lacking the dark and gory aspect of the original. The poor script doesn't help of course. I am not sorry that I spent time watching it but the feeling afterwards where a bit?meh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was really poor film. In comparison to the old one but also by itself. The movie was focused on special effects. The old one did use those too but it was still a story behind it.Gary Oldman tries hard to rescue the movie but the problem is that Joel Kinnaman does not really put a lot into the character of Alex Murphy but more importantly the horribly acting of Michael Keaton. That was one of the worst performances I ever saw. The old Robocop had really good villains with Kurtwood Smith and Ronny Cox. Samuel Jackson is cool in his role as always but since his part has no real connection to the film it doesn't help.The new one looks pretty cool but thats about it. But is is astonishing that when Robocop is without his helmet the effect from 1987 looks still cooler that the one from 2014. Also the event that leads to Murphy becoming Robocop is so trivial compared to the original. The poor ending also a way worse solution than the old one concludes a movie that does not create tension for one second. It is a typical example of a director who does a remake of a movie but really don't gets what it was what made the original a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After 2 hours of cinema, my conclusion was that Jos Padilha's 2014 remake of 1987's 'Robocop' was disappointing. I got dragged to the movies by an action-loving friend and was hoping for an interesting story. Aside from a few things, that hope was in vain. Robocop shows a future US scourged by criminal violence. There is an ongoing debate about whether to let robots deal with criminal activity, which is already being done in foreign countries. When Police Detective Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is seriously injured by a murder attempt by criminal boss Vallon, conglomerate Omnicorp 'saves' him and uses him as a liaison between man and machine. Robocop touches on interesting themes such as humanity and euthanasia, but unfortunately it does not really deal with them. Instead, serious themes are done away with by action-loaded scenes. Moreover, I cannot recall a single dialogue worth remembering. A film which should be dealing with humanity and human interaction, in fact barely has any of this interaction. After leaving the theatre, I asked myself if this movie contributed anything valuable to humanity or culture or if it changed my opinion about the world. This should be the objective of any film. As the answer was resolutely negative, I don't consider this film to be a noteworthy dot on the history of Hollywood filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was sceptical at first, and as a huge fan of the original I felt it was far too soon for a reboot of such an excellent 80's classic.However, it was a great action film with all the required violence expected with Robocop, which also provided an interesting storyline adaptation. On the whole it was exciting, exhilarating and lots of fun.So, yes, the general premise was similar to the original, and they 'attempted' to add some iconic moments/lines which weren't always well conveyed or well timed. But, if they hadn't made reference to the original it would have been slated for ignoring it. I simply cannot understand why some fans of the original were so upset with this update of the story.... it HAD to be updated on many levels to compete in todays market.The majority of the cast impressed, although Michael Keaton let himself down and wasn't nearly vindictive enough for the head of OCP (a shame, as I am a fan of Michael).Samuel L. Jackson, however, provided a sterling performance as Pat Novak, the host of a highly biased current affairs show; biased in favour of Omnicorp Security, and most probably paid off by them too. This was a very good attempt at providing some of the needed satire so fondly remembered from the original.As a fan of Cyberpunk films in general, I would still place this highly on the list in that genre. It still provides all the main elements: the not too distant future, technological advancement/dependence, social order issues and of course a highly influential mega-corporation in Omnicorp/OCP.If you are sceptical as I was, loosen your grasp on the past a little and give it a go as you may be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

One of my key moments in growing up was Robocop and when i heard about the reboot i was both excited to see this movie but also worried about them butchering the classic. Did they butcher it ? No, i don't think they did butcher the movie but by no means was it as good as the original movie. If like me, you grew up in the 80's and 90's then this movie will not live up to robocop of our childhood, if you wasn't around in those days then this movie will leave you feeling pleased. Don't get me wrong, great movie but for me..it just didn't feel like the real robocop</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly redundant, but at least they're trying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven's "Robocop" seems like an incredibly challenging movie to remake, because even after three decades it hasn't aged a day. It still looks fantastic, it has quick, hard-hitting action (not the Michael Bay kind, the kind where you actually know what's happening), and even the social satire is still uncomfortably relevant. So what can an unexperienced director like Jose Padilha really add to all that? Frankly, not a lot. 2014 "Robocop" isn't a bad movie, but it never shakes off that feel of complete redundancy. Everything that's good about it is from the original, apart maybe from gratuitous use of Samuel L. Jackson as the most biased reporter on the planet. Everything else, we've seen it already and we've seen it done better. The CGI doesn't fit the franchise at all, Joel Kinnaman isn't nearly as charismatic as Peter Weller was, and the parts set in Iran aren't nearly as subtle and clever as the filmmakers think they are. However, you do sort of feel a respect towards the original, there are plenty of neat little touches. Jackie Earle Healy going "I wouldn't buy that for a dollar!" while trying really hard not to wink at the camera, I'm kind of a sucker for things like that. 2014 "Robocop" is an entertaining blast from the past good enough to kill two hours, but it doesn't hold a candle to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>27 years ago, Paul Verhoeven created a movie that would forever be one of my favorite movies ever. I was too young back then but watched it a few years after it came out. The sequels were not satisfying, so I was afraid this would end up in the lower IMDb charts. But man was it fun to watch. You have to distance yourself a little from the original and not expect a scene for scene revamp. I think they captured the essence that is RoboCop. They even managed to sneak in a little of that Verhoeven-esque TV-moderation commentary without falling on their noses like countless others before. Kinnaman (never heard of him) is superb, Keaton is great, and Gary Oldman is ... Gary Oldman. There are numerous nods to the original (I was hoping to hear a squealing ED-209) to make us smile. I'm hoping there will be an R-rated Director's cut. But despite being PG-13, it rocks. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is good. Surely it's not as good as the original, but it couldn't have been. The original was filmed by Paul Verhoeven, who goes all the lengths to drum his ideas into the viewer's head. And rest assured that Paul had plenty of ideas as well as methods of their presentation, of which violence, gore, grotesque and sci-fi would be the most evident ones. If you had a criminal, then culprits on the street would wet their pants from his mere appearance; if you had a corrupt cop, then any real corrupt cop would seem as a minor offender; if you had an ambitious politician, then even Mother Teresa would show no mercy to him. Paul Verhoeven shouted his stand loud right to the viewer's ears, and if the viewer had questions ? well, Paul would push the questions into the enquirer's throat and then would laugh at his meek face.So there clearly was no way for Jos Padilha to make a better movie than Paul Verhoeven. Corruption and evil everywhere? The rise of human consciousness above all the robotic machinery as the last hope? Sorry, these themes have already been dealt with in the original. The only way out for Jos Padilha was to make just a different film. At least once Hollywood managed to perform such a trick pretty nice with transforming Batman to the Dark Knight. Both films had Joker and Batman, but I just don't know how to compare them. They are simply different. And both are perfect.But it would have been hard to work out the new stand. It would have required a lot of thinking. I bet that new film-makers just didn't have enough time for this. Probably they decided to concentrate on making a pretty realistic film, fair and square. And they managed to do it. To me the new Robocop seems quite up to date with all the current realities. It's kind of Zeitgeist, the spirit of our time. I believe that if Robocop were to be made today, he would have looked and acted exactly so.I just wonder how would Jos Padilha answer a simple question: why have you made that film? You probably had some great ideas running behind it ? so could you please show them to me? You may throw them directly at my face as Paul Verhoeven does ? I will have to wipe myself, but at least I will understand you. Or even better you may present your ideas in a subtle and roundabout way, just as David Lynch does sometimes. So you just wanted to make a realistic film, fair and square? Not bad. You did it, pal. You did it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is good. Many reviews here are based on the simple comparison with the old movies, but do not appreciate the quality of the new film. The new Rocobop repeats the question of man vs. machine, or man-machine but without countless unnecessary action scenes. Obviously this makes the first part of the slower film, but the film ends with scenes of great battles. Anyway, the movie is good and paved the way for eventual part two. The direction of the movie is solid and well made. The film has a good time and a storyline that pleases. Without too sentimentality or inexplicable actions scenes, what happens in other actions movies. The reporter who defends weapons is a caricatural figure and that is how it should appear. It is not serious and is not meant to be taken seriously. Robocop is now in a transition between the machine control into a cyborg with some autonomy. I think the next movie will be much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only it had a heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally released in 1987, RoboCop has garnered a huge fan base and the reboot was eagerly anticipated by both the old guard of 80's action fans and a new generation of movie goers. So Padilha has his task cut out for him, could he satisfy both factions? Unfortunately the answer is no and it would be surprising if either group were satisfied with the finished product. It seems like yet another case of the-man-behind-the-curtain syndrome, most notably in the decision to aim for a PG13 rating, against Padilha's wishes, in order to ensure a film that went severely over budget recoups some of its investment. I agree that graphic violence is not necessary in order to make a good action movie, just look at The Dark Knight or Star Trek, but RoboCop falls short of the mark here and delivers a very placid final product. It can be argued that's what happens when the creative control is limited but perhaps hiring a director who's previous work is rated 18+ was the greater mistake. The cast however is strong and Kinnaman(The Killing) executes his role efficiently, with support from veteran actors Oldman, Keaton and Jackson but even this solid foundation seemed somewhat hollow. In a throwback to the satirical nature, that flowed seamlessly throughout the original, Jackson's portrayal of the rhetoric spewing media mogul appears a little disjointed and does little to add to an already inferior reboot. In total RoboCop 2014 does its best to recreate a character that criminals of Detroit should fear but in the end only offers us a modern day Tin-Man and by the closing credits I could not help but think, 'I wouldn't buy that for a dollar'.</fullReview>

It's not like original but still, has lived up to my expectations. Not all of it, but some parts for sure. Thankfully, the makers of the new RoboCop gave themselves some freedom with their adaptation, adding major characters like the chief scientist heading the RoboCop project (Gary Oldman). OmniCorp's head of marketing (Jay Baruchel), a military and weapons adviser (Jackie Earle Haley), and a conservative commentator named Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson). Jos Padilha's debut is an exciting, pacey and thoughtful sci-fi. So as remake, this movie receives from me a thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a stupid movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The people that wrote the script for this should never be allowed to work in the movie industry again. The movie is nothing but technophobic pseudo-scientific nonsense heaped on top of a boring plot with dry, two dimensional characters played by actors who are far too talented for the roles they fill. It's obscene that a script so bad even such a massive dose of recognizable star power couldn't safe it from obscurity ever made it out of a pitch room or saw any sort of iteration past a storyboard. The robots look cool, sure, every robot looks cool these days, artists are great at making shining red lights on black steel look intimidating and cool. The protagonist, who is supposed to be a "military drone expert" comes of as nothing more than an inbred dipstick you can't find a good reason for being present in the story. There are lots of people to dislike in the film and any one of them would have sufficed as the "guy audiences aren't supposed to root for"; some guy that constantly calls the hero "tin-man" making reference to the Wizard of Oz character lacking a heart/humanity and referring to Mr. Murphy as a "robot" or "drone" repeatedly was as irritating to experience as it was unnecessary. Keaton, one of my favorite actors brings his standard charm to the screen, but it's wasted. The greatest actor in the world can't make a character compelling in any direction if the script outright doesn't allow it and the director is only interested in "power shots". We get it, he's a callous CEO of a dubious super company, can we get the man better lines than "What's bigger than "Hero"?" (To which the wonderfully stupid answer of "Dead Hero" is blurted out by the inbred mentioned above. The guy who played Murphy is great in "The Killing" and I enjoyed his performance here, as much as I could given the material. But again, just like with Keaton, good acting alone can't salvage a stupid plot and moron director that aren't interested in the quality of what they put out, just "the style". This movie in totality really calls to mind the kind of irritation I get when I see video games released that are really just predatory offerings meant to shell out a pretty product for kids to impulse buy while requiring as little work as possible on the production side. This film feels hollow and silly at its best, boring and stupid at its worst. I really just wish they hadn't made it. Also, as a science graduate found the overall tone of the movie offensive. It's just bull-ish someone tried to pass off as "deep and relevant, you know, because "drones" bro..." This pile of trash goes right into my "movies I'll never, EVER suggest anyone watch for any reason" folder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie with message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie all by myself and having said that, I really focused on it and analyzed at the same time, with having no distractions. I came to a conclusion that this is a solid good movie ? has a good scenario, great effects, little lacks acting though, but I give it an encouraging 7,5/10.The critics here don't do it justice. A lot of fans of the previous Robocop movies are comparing and complaining about this movie. I respect their opinion, but I saw previous Robocop movies too, and I think that this one did OK as well. A lot of comments were also about that our hero didn't have a reasonable villain or antihero to fight with. That there wasn't any final ? epic battle. I guess I agree in some manner, but that is probably because of a bad habit that we took from watching other action super hero movies, where superheros fight antiheroes.If we think a little bit after seeing this movie, we came to realize that Robocop in this movie had the most difficult villain to comprehend ? ourselves. We are all only people and we all do from time to time something that we are not proud of. Some people commit even crimes. And Robocop is arresting everyone who committed a crime, no exceptions on that! Robocop is occupied so much with this mission, that there is really no time for a true villain to evolve.This movie shows us what would really happen in real life, because the villains in this movie are the real-life villains. An ordinary people who have different interests and are trying to achieve their goal, even if it means committing crimes. If we could actually make a part man part machine police officer that is incorruptible, this is the closest scenario what would really happen: from corrupted police officers, to street robbers, business men and even politicians would try to stop Robocop. Robocop would arrest anyone who has committed a crime and he would go all the way to the top. But having said that, I feel sorry for him, because in real life, he would also be stopped eventually, for the sake of other higher interests. Crime is like and octopus ? it's tentacles are spread and go high in all directions to all kinds of important people. Robocop reminded me of a Don Quixote who fought against windmills ? a battle that is futile.If you expected a popcorn flip with a lot of explosions and brainless scenario, go watch Transformers 2 or 3 (I liked the first part by the way). This movie has a message and it stands by it's one. Currently this movie has 6.6 rating on IMDb. I believe that in years to come, this rating will go higher. I hope they make a good sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People who hate this movie have never worked in the market-driven corporate world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this film with mixed feelings based on the quantity of negative reviews all basically citing the PG-13 rating, the lack of a clear main villain, and the failure of the remake to reflect the same gritty feeling of the original movie. I did not see the R-rated original movie, nor do I care to. I did see the edited-for-TV version and believe anyone claiming that I am somehow unable to understand the movie without the language and violence to be themselves callow and shallow. While I very much enjoyed the original, I always found it campy and even (at times) silly. The presentation of corporate America was so over-the-top as to be wholly unbelievable. However, Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith were clear villains that could be easily hated, which made the movie (like so many westerns) an easy-to-enjoy popcorn movie.Fast forward to today. Robocop 2014 has some obvious flaws. Without a clear villain it was tougher to feel the good-vs-evil joy of the hero winning the day and the second half of the movie moved somewhat slowly. But...Anyone claiming that this movie wasn't worth their time to see or failed to live up to its predecessor has no blooming clue about corporate America. I'm sorry, but you folks missed the point of this film (and probably the point of the original, which was somewhat lost in all the campy action). I recognized the terrifyingly casual screw-the-world-at- any-cost behavior of Michael Keaton's CEO from very real CEOs of multinational companies that I both know and have worked for. I recognized the terrifyingly money-and-success-driven behavior of marketing staff from teams I both know and have worked with. I even recognized the smoothly organized and over-biased presentation of modern political commentary. It was like watching Bill Gates or Kenneth Lay on the Sean Hannity show calmly and positively explain how their business will make America successful as it sucks its people dry. The writers hit their mark so well that by the end of the movie the fears, concerns, frustrations, and exasperation of 30 years in corporate America all reared their ugly heads in a 2 hour movie that left me wanting to pack my camper and run for Alaska.The writers of Robocop 2014 should be given the Academy Award for spectacularly good writing and the best presentation of modern corporate and political reality that I have ever seen in a movie. They not only hit the mark they were aiming for dead-on, but they did a better job of it --- a much better job of it --- than those who wrote the original Robocop.And the "I can't believe it unless the F* word is clearly spoken at least twice and I see people's brains splattered on a wall" crowd needs to stop pretending they understand anything about making a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>so first off, the comparison to the original...it's not technically as good as the original, and to me the originals story was much better. but that doesn't make this a bad movie. this is not the original movie by no stretch of the imagination, this is a completely different film with completely different motivations and inspirations. while the original was about America's culture of privatization and the corruption of the medias role in society as well as its reliance on sensationalism and opinion rather then fact based news , this one was more about what makes us human and how our reliance on machines i.e. Drones and our inevitable reliance on robotics in the military, dehumanizes our society. there were still some of the old themes about privatization (in this case the privatization of the human body or person) and the media (in this case Samuel L Jackson portraying a Bill O'Reilly style pundit) but the main focus was about Alex Murphys humanity and his relationship with his wife and child. i should also note the blood and gore of the original movies wasn't there, the original villain wasn't there and as i already mentioned the inspiration was very different. but different (in my humble opinion) in a good way. so in conclusion take it as it is, a good sci fi action movie which attempts to find relevance in todays world. if it succeeds or not is up to you, film is subjective after all, but at least give the movie a chance, you might be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong first half dominates weak second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Verhoeven's "RoboCop" was one of the crown jewels of '80s action cinema, a cautionary tale about the role of technology in our society presented in the form of a rip-roaring sci-fi adventure tale made up of equal parts black comedy and social commentary. Since the movie's release, technology has only become an ever more intrusive part of American life, so it would seem fitting for someone to mount a remake of "RoboCop" for the early 21st Century.Well, that reboot is here, in the form of a movie written by Joshua Zetumer and directed by Jose Padilha. There are many devotees of the original who will likely balk at this update, but I think it works pretty well, at least before it goes off the rails somewhat in the second half.The time is 2028. Technology has advanced to the point where policemen can essentially be replaced by giant robots capable of taking out the bad guys with minimal risk to human officers and innocent bystanders. Problem is many Americans remain skeptical about leaving such a task to mechanical instruments that feel no human emotion and thus might make the wrong, and potentially disastrous, calls at critical moments. Enter OmniCorp, a high-tech multinational corporation whose CEO (Michael Keaton) comes up with the plan to make such a robot out of an actual person, thereby combining the best of both worlds in a single entity. Alex Murphy, an undercover Detroit cop who has been severely wounded in the line of duty and hovers on the brink of death, is chosen from among many candidates to become the first human/robot hybrid in history. Voila, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present to you RoboCop.As with the original, "RoboCop" is concerned with far more than the average action movie shoot-'em-up. It explores the issue of just how far, as a society, we are willing to go in sacrificing our civil liberties in exchange for enhanced security. It also questions just how much of a person's physical attributes can be replaced by technological ones before he or she ceases to be truly human. In the movie's best scene, a newly-activated "mechanical" Alex learns just how little of his original body remains to him. It is a haunting and heartbreaking moment beautifully realized by both the special effects department and Joel Kinnaman (who made his mark in TV's "The Killing") who makes us actually care about the man in the machine. Without him, all the CGI in the world couldn't have made the scene work this effectively.The movie also looks at how readily public opinion on controversial topics can be molded and shaped through carefully honed messages, much in the same way as products are marketed to easily manipulated and persuadable consumers.This "RoboCop" is definitely at its best in the first half, as Alex and those around him adjust to his new and unprecedented condition. Unfortunately, as with even the best action movies, the second half is less satisfying, as the plot tries to do too much for the time allotted to it and the story becomes muddled and confused as a result. For instance, a subplot involving corruption on the force is so poorly executed that it's resolved almost before we know it's going on.Kinnaman receives some excellent support from Gary Oldman, who portrays that rare movie scientist who isn't either a madman or an evil genius but rather a compassionate man who really wants to do good in the world, even if the technology he's using threatens to spiral out of his control from time to time.At times, "RoboCop" seems to be playing both sides of the fence on this issue of the role of technology in society. It clearly warns against allowing technology to override our humanity while at the same time seemingly endorsing Alex and the role that's been thrust upon him by those with the wherewithal and capabilities to do so. And maybe it's that very ambiguity - one that clearly reflects the world we all now live in - that makes "RoboCop" a movie with something of importance to say to our times.</fullReview>

It was good for what it was. However, this reboot was above and beyond what I was expecting or what all the FANBOYS of the first movie were trashing about. I almost did not see it due to the low critic rating.The script of the movie was so well written, that the next thing I know the big finale was upon me. Plenty of satire and social commentary was included. This movie will having you thinking about corporate domination of politics and in turn society. Also, the emotional aspect of man verses machines. Not to mention the controversy of machine/man interaction.As far as film quality, I give this movie an 'A'. The special effects were great! The CGI was so advanced, that you'll swear what you see is real. The action was fantastic also! Had you rooting for retribution! Lastly, all of the main characters were great in their respective roles. I really loved, and could wait for, the "NOVAK REPORT". Samuel L. Jackson was almost the star!

		<shortDescription>Robocop Begins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robocop Begins...Every now and then a unique, brilliant, innovative movie comes out and changes the landscape for it's genre. It inspires other directors to follow in it's footsteps.. When it comes to the superhero/ action hero genre the maverick is no other than Dark Knight.Robocop, a remake or reboot of the original 1987 version stays current by approaching the theme from the Dark Knight angle. It seems like directors have decided that no longer do audiences want a mysterious, stoic strong silent type of hero. To stay current, Robocop has to be relatable, flawed; a character trying to find his place in this world. Does this ambitious remake hit it's mark? Was Robocop Dark Knightified properly?No and no. Robocop 2014 goes for a more realistic take on the iconic hero. Bringing a man back to life, putting him in a robot and then programming him to kick ass and take names is too 1987 in the eyes of Sony Pictures. Instead, why not humanize Robocop? Hence his new and ''improved'' origin story. Alex Murphy gets blown up and the only way to save him is to hook him up to a machine that kills two birds with one stone: 1) Gives an honest cop his life back 2) Helps Omnicorp in it's insidious agenda to insert robots in law enforcement. In this context the need for R-rated violence in unnecessary because Robocop's birth isn't the product of extreme over the top violence, but a criminal act that however violent may seem is not extreme in today's reality.By choosing this path the plot can explore different avenues the original could not. Questions such as How would it feel to be part man, part machine? and How efficient would a robot with a human mind be? are raised. This is an area in which the movie delivers. The viewer is asked to ask himself a number of philosophical questions, one of them being what makes me who I am? Gary Oldman as Dr Norton is brilliant as a 21st century Frankenstein. He really is the voice of reason in the movie. The fact that they explore this territory is brilliant, however the dosage in inappropriate. They want the audience to relate so much to Alex Murphy, crossed over cop and now machine bound super cop, that they forget that Robocop is first and foremost an action hero. It is only when he actually becomes Robocop (not to be confused with Alex Murphy in a suit or Alex Murphy in a suit by day and Robocop when visor is down) that the movie actually kicks off. We hear the iconic mechanical voice, we get to see how he can solve murders by getting a view into his HUD and we see him stylishly arrest someone. Robocop can't aimlessly patrol the streets arresting people left right and center, so the plot forces him in a direction: solve his own murder. At this point the movie could still have been epic: a revenge story starring a killing machine. But so much time was spent building the protagonist, that there was none left to build the antagonist. Robocop has no Zod, no Joker, no agent Smith. Instead he has his assailant ( who we can't really care about because of his token role) and the evil corporation represented by Mr Sellars. In regards to Sellars, it almost seems like they didn't know where to land his character arc, so they decided to turn him into the corrupt CEO. I'm sad to say Robocop 2014 doesn't quite lad it's mark. There is a lot to like about the movie, but the plot goes places it need not go.The potential was there, but somehow it fell short. At the end of the day, Robocop 2014 is an Ironman without the ability to remove his suit and live a normal life, but also without all of the sensationalism that Tony Stark's alter ego brings to the table.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional - for its Movie Type</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robocop - Great MovieImagine the terminator is back, this time with armor plating. But inside... oh no .... it's not Arnold at all.....It's Dirty Harry Callahan !. Well for my tastes a Robocop movie should be all about action, fantasy, wonder and fun. And I thought this movie hit it on all four food groups. I would think a great motto for this movie would be "If it does not go "whirrrrr" and "clank", then you really got nothing to worry about.Add Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) as the bad guy and Samuel L. Jackson as the commentator, and you have good casting as well.On the other hand, if you ask if this movie was based on a true story, then it might be the wrong movie for you. You would be thinking of Driving Miss Daisy likely... which this is not. Why did I vote so high? For what this movie was supposed to be ... for the type of movie, I think it hit it out of the park. I recommend people to see it... who like these kinds of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent film that lost its plot throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Started off well, got a bit too long winded and lost its plot. The plot is your usual American-corrupt bad cop film that could have been more interesting if the director put less time into filming at the beginning of the movie. IT did not live up to expectations but anyone would say that after seeing the original, scenes were too fast and badly directed. There was no emotional connection between the characters (in particular his son who he seemed to ignore) Robocop seems to be AI controlled where as the man underneath the hood could have interacted with his family more (e.g. play basketball, cook food in a robot suit etc). Compare this to terminator Arnie wasn't the best actor but none the less Peter Jackson was too good at telling the story between the kid and Arnie which was cool. I would give it 4 stars just to see his cool suit the initial one which was eventually changed, the brains and lungs bit which was the only decent part of the film. Samuel L Jackson plays his role well within the film, his acting is good as always and brings an element of comedy to the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is much better than some of the negative reviews and commentary suggests.It does not bring anything miraculous or earth-shattering to the table - not in terms of story or action - but it is a very decent action movie. It certainly doesn't match up with the recent Marvel Blockbusters or Christoper Nolan's Batman trilogy, but if one takes this (unfair) comparison away it is a very enjoyable film. I'd rate it on par with Hancock.The story keeps one guessing and very nicely progresses into more than you expect when the film starts. The blurry lines between good guys and villains and the development of each into his final role is very intriguing. It is so good, in fact, that for a brief moment it reminded me of The Dark Knight (although that moment does pass).The one very distracting and irritating aspect of this movie is Samuel L Jackson as loudmouth propaganda-making TV host. While the TV Studio clip with which the movie starts provides valuable background information and a very effective opening scene, the TV Studio clips soon become very tiresome and a source of great irritation in the rest of the movie.This only detracts slightly from the entertainment though, and I found this a surprisingly good action movie with a bit of character depth thrown in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had minimal expectations, actually liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, being a fan of the classic and all, i had minimal expectations for this. Although i like the new ED-209 look, i tough the new Robocop suit was really crap. I could not stand the human hand and honestly it serves no purpose in this movie in the end, its more or less there just to gives him a more human look, but it just make it look weird as why nobody think about shooting that hand. I guess its because the hand was the first thing he lost in the original... anyway.Past that, i think the movie did a fair job in its story. I wish the murder of Murphy would had been better done, and the villain who done it better developed, but it seem it was never about that. They kinda wanted to redo the shooting in the coke lab of the original, but this time instead of arresting the villain to use him again later, he just goes and kill him right away. Then Omnicorp serves as the villains instead of OCPs very little role beside Dick Jones on the bad side in the first movie. The rest tough was nicely done and i liked how he reacted when realizing what he became.All and all, it will never be the classic one, and nobody is asking it to be, but as a stand alone movie its pretty decent and the action is cool. The character development on Robocop and the role of Gary Oldman where the hight point to me. The use of the classic music, some classic lines and some wink to the original where appreciated. Also it seem by the end of the movie he is back in the more classical suit look. If they can only get rid of the stupid human hand, i wouldn't mind that design at all, even with the iron mask type of mask.So i will say Robocop 2014 is way better than what i expected, its a decent action movie with a soul.</fullReview>

The critic says "Robocop manages to resurrect the franchise and establish a strong build-up for sequels to follow" ! What does this mean. It can't cover its budget.honest and loyal reboot?? Check Wikipedia..it will not be able to cover its budget!With this reboot aimed at more family friendly crowds, the PG-rated violence is filmed using rapid jump cuts which makes it totally confusing, its like watching a video game on fast forward so that by the time your mind registers what's going on the scene is finished. The story amounts to a celebration of brute force in a crudely etched law-and-order context.Pointless nowadays to make remakes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad, but lacks a lot good things. Verhoeven's movie is still the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, so this is a remake of an original movie, the 1987 Paul Verhoeven's Rated R flick Robocop. And it's crucial that you have all this information, because then, you'll understand my criticism around the remake. First and foremost, I have to say that I have a lot of respect for the director, Jos Padilha, once he's the creator of two amazing Brazilian flicks, Elite Squad and Elite Squad 2, that I dare to say you should be watching right now if you didn't. With that said, I thought that this remake of one of Verhoeven's masterpieces of the 80s is at least a respectable attempt of a new look to a famous concept and that's it.And I say that with a lot of restraint, because I'm the kind of person that avoid remakes, I think that a remake is a good idea only when it surpasses the original movie, if that doesn't happen, then it's nothing but a waste of time and I'm not interested. Unfortunately, this 2014 Robocop falls in that category. It's not as interesting or as engaging as the 1987 flick, but it has good moments and, as I said, it's a respectable try from Padilha, that probably faced a lot of interference from the studio to make it a PG-13, resulting in a movie much less violent, less critical about society and much less adult, even with its moments of brilliance. I only opened an exception this time and saw this remake because Jos Padilha is that good and I was entitled to give him a try, being this one his first English language flick, hoping him to find the success he deserves.But, as I said, the movie is not that good. It's definitely not a bad movie either, but, as I said before, given it's a remake and comparing it with the original, it was a waste. If they had it labeled with another name as a totally different character, I would give this a different evaluation, but it's Robocop, I have to compare with the original. You can clearly see, knowing Jos Padilha, when the movie is playing by Padilha's hands and when it's playing safe by the studio's hands. Robocop's helmet for example... why does it flip, showing his face? Useless! Or the stunt gun, for instance? Isn't this ridiculous? A cop with a stunt gun? That's just silly! This is clearly a studio move to sell toys. And where is the acid humor from the original? The dark jokes and chops? I was expecting it to have at least a little of that humor from the original, and we've got none of it. Lame! With that humor, the social commentary would be so much stronger and addressing! It doesn't cut for us to have only a little of the original theme or some references from the original movie if you can't capture the spirit of social commentary from it! As for that bullcrap of him going back to his family, well, that was so My Little Pony! Give me a break! And where's the big bad villain of this? What, not a memorable villain? C'mon!!As for the moments of brilliance, we can highlight the man x machine confrontation, the Novak Experience segments and the scenes when they show RoboCop's insides. This last one was really interesting, because it was totally unexpected and twisted, so it was a real good moment; I can only imagine how Padilha pulled this out on a PG-13 flick! I felt uncomfortable seeing his insides and I felt his frustration watching his reaction, I would have the very same reaction knowing that I lost my own body, so yeah, that was bold and I liked it. Also, the scene of the musician trying to play his guitar with mechanical hands and being frustrated because he couldn't use his emotions, that just hit me right into my soul, so it was good!Having said all that, this remake lacks many things also, compared with the original, the state of suspense, the violence, the more adult approach, that urgency about seeing a society crumbling and giving in on crime, all those things are lacking here.But even so I can applaud Padilha for trying to do something with the little he had in hands. Again, it had good moments, but it's still inferior and pales in comparison to the original Robocop that I own on DVD, so, bottom line, I wouldn't buy that for a dollar! Finally I wish Padilha all the best and may he manage to do great things outside Brazil after this project, he surely deserves a lot of credit.I've paid my respects to a fellow Brazilian, now back on ignoring other recent and vicious remakes. Wait for this to show on TV or watch it when it comes out on DVD, don't spend your money on another inferior remake.</fullReview>

In fact, I would of thought what a great movie concept, if I had not seen the original. The remake was different enough that I could watch and notice a different movie. Regrettable, the remake lacked the charisma, evil hated bad guys, humor, and plot twists of the original. RoboCop remake is just a okay movie. Six out of ten stars. While the original is a ten star movie. Worth watching. More a V O D movie. Catch RoboCop on Netflicks. I hope they do not make a RoboCop part 2. Part 2 would be a disaster, just like when such was done with the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alex Murphy is critically injured after a bomb is planted on his car, following his almost apprehension of a criminal.His wife signs a consent form giving Omnicorp access to his body to turn him into the titular character. But obviously there are sinister things going on because Michael Keaton is just too nice throughout the film.It was a gutsy move to remake one of the defining movies of the eighties. The original Robocop was damning toward consumerism and how people are duped into everything, and also Robo was a Christlike allegory.Not to mention a little bit of the old ultra violence. Truly groundbreaking stuff.Now this movie is nowhere near that film, it's been watered down for the teens, and black was a horrible idea, but it's nowhere near as terrible as you would have thought.It takes a while to get going, and surprisingly, the bits with the titular character are the weakest parts of the movie.It's the scenes with Oldman, Cornish, and Keaton that make the film worth watching. Cornish is wonderful as the grieving wife, coming to terms with a decision that will change her life forever.An underused Keaton is good, but like I've already said, he's just too nice that its a little bit of a giveaway.Oldman owns the film, and he's the heart and soul of the whole movie, he's truly brilliant.Jackson bookends the movie declaring that America is the greatest country in the world. Ironic considering that the movie is playing really poor there, and doing very well elsewhere.There are a few nods to the original, especially the 'I wouldn't buy that for a dollar' line, but at the end of the day,its another pointless remake where the titular character is the weakest thing in it.Worth it just for Cornish and Oldman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun re-make that doesn't take itself too seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't thrilled when I first heard about the Robocop remake. After seeing the trailer with the black Robocop suit, my expectations were even lowered. However, generally positive reviews and an opportunity to watch a childhood favourite movie persuaded me to watch in theatres. I was pleasantly surprised that it was a fun action movie only had minor issues. The supporting cast of Keaton, Oldman were solid. With Oldman once again showing that he can't do no wrong. Jackson plays a Bill O'Reilly type figure, and provides some comedic relief. The actor that played Robocop fulfilled his role effectively, but wasn't given much to work with in the first place. Although many people gripe that the movie wasn't rated R, the scene where they show what is left of Alex Murphy was very creepy and effectively done. The action scenes were very cool, but I got a bit distracted towards the middle when I realized it was shot in Toronto and started trying to recognize street names and buildings. Overall, a fun movie that recognizes its limitations and stays within them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtedly more sanitized and politically correct than the original, but a worthy enough attempt to bring it in to modern times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAnd so the long awaited RoboCop remake (reboot, or whatever) is here. While the original had us taking an aerial tour over Detroit before breaking in to Media Break, here we have Samuel L. Jackson doing some kind of weird animal impersonation before we see him launch in to some political rant about over-turning a Senate bill. You see, in this version of the story, ED-2O9s and RoboCops have already been mass produced and are serving overseas in Tehran, begging the question why they aren't being allowed for use on the crime ravaged streets of the States? It's driving businessman Raymond Sellers (Michael Keaton) crazy, until he is allowed a prototype in Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) a good cop horrifically injured in a car bombing. Conscientious Doctor Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) tries to respect his human side and make him aware of what a force for good he can be. But as he sets about clearing the streets up, and heading on his own course for revenge, he finds those out to get him are far deeper ingrained than he thought.This glossy, big budget remake forces you, first of all, to examine just how ahead of it's time and revolutionary the original film was. The effects and Robo suit design, which still look amazing today, the subtle stabs at corporate America with the clever adverts and the relentless, frenzied approach to violence. While time has inevitably moved on, and the stage has been set higher and the effects inevitably look more high scale and advanced, it can't take away from what a timeless piece of work the source material is. It also came from a more politically stable time, where everyone knew (or at least thought they knew) who the enemy was and it didn't feel so far afield. This new film shows the first sign of it's political sensitivities by opening in Tehran, and having the ED- 209s and Robos contributing to the destruction there, which sets the tone for it's more liberal agenda. But then we switch back to Detroit to find the black seargent from the first film replaced by a black AND female seargent, being introduced to Murphy who, instead of being blasted to pieces, is here simply quietly done away with a car bomb. The 1980s ultra violence has been washed away for a more family friendly 12A certificate, which could serve only to distance it further from the fans of the original.Aesthetically the film hits all the right notes. The original Robo suit looks like something from the 80s, the new version fittingly looks like something a little more advanced, if not exactly better. It manages an epic, grandiose look, with sweeping visual effects and a sweeping scale. There's a lively supporting cast, including Keaton and Oldman, as well as new star Jackie Earle Haley, all adapting to their respective roles very well, masking problems with Robo's synthetic and human side switching a little too easily and an elusive villain who fails to stir the blood anything like Kurtwood Smith in the original.It's a worthy stab at recreating a masterpiece, aiming to explore the Robo character in a more sensitive and politically explosive world, that while pleasing to the eye, may take away from the blood splattered hedonism everyone knew and loved the original for. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>doesn't live up to the original, but could've been worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i had no faith in this movie whatsoever. none. zip. zero. as far as i'm concerned, the very idea of remaking the iconic original was embarrassing and lame. but after seeing it last night, i'm surprised this wasn't one of the worst movie-seeing experiences of my life. while this surely isn't the best thing ever, i wouldn't say it was a waste. that's right, Robocop is actually quite solid. while indeed lightweight compared to the violent slaughterhouse of Paul Verhoeven's classic, this one makes up in emotional weight. although i longed for a foul-mouthed, bloodbath that mocked the smug outlook on 80s America, i couldn't help noticing i was watching a very well performed, technically efficient, and solidly scripted character piece. sure, taking a stab at right-wing politics and the fear of radical change plays a part, but this one sticks with its lead and keeps the focus on him, giving him the weight and development usually skipped over by today's rampant remakes. more on that later. the year is 2028 and militarized robots are big business. used for urban pacification in hopes to lower the casualty rate of human soldiers, the big noise revolves around the hesitance of American politicians allowing all moral decisions to be put upon these dangerous machines with no consideration for the consequences. OMINCORP head Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) aims to prove the political bigwigs wrong. by way of a large loophole, Sellars decides the moral issue can be trumped by putting a man within a machine, a project supervised by Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman). all they need now is a proper candidate which comes in the form of driven police detective Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman). Murphy is a decent family man and honest cop badly wounded in a car bomb, perpetrated by vicious gunrunner Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow). with nearly nothing left of Murphy's body, Norton constructs the ultimate robotic soldier to serve as the perfect cop within Detroit's corrupt police force. while the exterior is a magnificent success (not to mention provides a soaring stock rise for Sellars), the emotional element of Murphy's mind is still intact and no matter what extremes Norton uses (at Sellars demand) to repress those feelings, they always override the programming. whether Murphy rages to solve his own murder and eliminate Vallon or aches for the company of his wife, Clara (Abbie Cornish) and son David (John Paul Ruttan), the human factor can't be denied. this not only brings out the best in our lead, but strikes the most sympathetic nerves inside of Norton, who grows increasingly conflicted by Sellars's blatant ambition. believe it or not, while the premise is the same as the original film, a man in the body of a machine annihilating criminals as a safety measure for citizens, but more so, as a benefit to corporate America, this is a very different movie. unlike the original, Murphy's memory is never erased, leaving Kinnaman to act out every bit of Murphy's realization that things will no longer be the same. it's in these scenes where Kinnaman really shines. sure, he delivers just fine while dispatching endless amounts of criminals, but when expressing even the most subtle moments of Murphy's tortured trauma, it could be argued this is where this film surpasses the original. that said, it's the only advantage. the lack of excessive violence is a problem. this movie has a very high body count, but very few bursts of blood, which was exactly what blew me out of my seat when I saw the original. sure, here we get Robocop fighting six ED-209s, but gone is the savagery of shotgun-wielding scumbags, not only terrifying innocents, but meeting their end in harsh crimson splatters. the upside...well, the cast. as said, Kinnaman is terrific in a role that should burn him if effigy for accepting, but he makes it his own, doing everything he could not to replicate what Peter Weller made legend 27 years ago. Keaton is toxic fun as Sellars, motor-mouthed and moral-free, profit-driven and manipulative; and Oldman has hands down the most interesting role in the film, lending his own brand of class to Norton, a man proud of his work while forced to create what could become a potential monster. there's also extra hands of awesomeness on hand. Jackie Earle Haley is excellent (but underused) as the antagonistic Mattox, a military tactical officer in charge of Murphy's combat training; Michael K. Williams is terrific as Lewis, Murphy's loyal-to-the-core partner, and Samuel L. Jackson as media mouth, Pat Novak, a Bill O'Reilly wannabe shamelessly vouching for the Robo-movement, adds zesty fun. These guys help a lot, but there's only so much they can do. Aside from the aforementioned lack of violence, there's also very little in terms of wit. In fact, without Keaton and Jackson, the film would be universally humorless, which is something the first was loudly revered. no, this movie isn't perfect, but for something that had so much going against it, this was anything but that crap-fest i feared was coming. i don't expect everyone to love it and i sure don't see this becoming anything close to the amazing source material that wowed me as a kid. but this deserves at least a look. for me, there was a lot more to like than to dislike and the exceptional cast, especially Kinnaman, certainly deserves some proper love. in closing, this was surprisingly good.</fullReview>

Also, the special effects were top notch. I must mention that all reviews are a matter of personal opinion and many of the ratings are influenced by ones expectations (especially in a remake). There are a lot of negative reviews but in the majority of cases the reviewers give reasons that are highly and clearly subjective. The bottom line is that movies are made to entertain and/or inform.

		<shortDescription>Second best Robocop movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Robocop is nothing short of a cinematic classic. Its 'hyper violence' is still shocking, its satire is still cutting, and its content was the subject of many playground discussions back in the 1990s (during that terrible period before school boys had an internet upon which all things were available all of the time ? dark days indeed!).Given this high standing ? and the recent underwhelming Total Recall remake (although I do think that it's a perfectly fine film for at least the first hour) ? that same internet was awash with low expectations for a film which nobody was really able to justify the existence of. Excluding it being for the money of course.That said however, the Robocop franchise was already well accustomed to bad movies. Other than the first film it would be fair to say that its sequels, TV series/movies and cartoons were far from fantastic. As such it was not as if it had far to fall with a remake.In context then the 2014 Robocop is far from a bad film. In fact I'd go so far as saying that it's the second best Robocop movie. But there are substantial differences to previous incarnations. Differences which I feel weaken the concept as a whole.At its heart the original Robocop was a story about a man rediscovering his identity. However, this new version chooses to abandon this central theme ? due to Murphy's memory remaining intact throughout. Instead the story is more about his battle to overpower his programming, and overcome the changes which he has been forced to endure (although he does so through a somewhat implausible process during the second act). While this element was always present previously, the films decision to dwell on it exclusively meant that the most interesting aspects of the human drama were lost.Further to this the film's pacing is far too slow. One of the great things about the original was that it was a great example of ruthlessly efficient film making. Murphy is dead and Robocop is on screen within the first 20mins. This time the process seems to take a good hour ? with seemingly endless training sequences to go through. It's almost like the film has forgotten its exploitation cinema roots and is instead aiming for something 'higher'. However, I would argue that it still has far less to say about the nature of life and humanity than the original. For all its exposition and detail, far less seems to be conveyed to the audience than in the few key looks and scenes we had in the original. Whether this is the fault of the acting or the direction I'm unsure, but either way I never found myself engaged with the characters struggles in the same way which I did in the previous film.That said the new version does have a number of good points. For me it was Gary Oldman who held the whole film together. He plays the role of morally compromised scientist perfectly, and is always the most interesting part of any scene he's in. The same must also be said for Michael Keaton's slick corporate celebrity. While he's far less of a comic book villain than the OCP executives in the original films, his character is far more believable.But this lack of a true villain is perhaps one of the films greatest flaws ? especially when compared to previous incarnations. Sure it has baddies; in fact it has loads of them ? at least eight by my count. But none of them come to the front as a true adversary to Robocop. Certainly there is no one who really matches Dick Jones or Clarence Boddicker from the original. To compensate for this they've made Robocop far more vulnerable. This time he stands up far worse to gun fire for instance, so there is at least a greater sense of peril.But in all honesty the film is simply far less fun. While I'm always up for a smart movie with something to say, you can't escape the fact that Robocop is always going to be a bit ridiculous. For me this version tried to do too much, forgot about the fun, and ended up not really doing any one element particularly well.In conclusion then 2014's Robocop is nowhere near as bad as some were expecting. In fact it's way better than Robocop 2 or 3 for instance. But for me too many fundamental changes have been made which result in the concept being far less interesting and far less fun for the viewer. It's worth a watch for sure, but I could happily get through the rest of my life without ever needing to see it again.But at least I got through the whole review without pointing out that he's technically a cyborg rather than a robot?.Rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No justice to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chances are that you know RoboCop, even if you've never seen the original films. The cyborg, with his distinctive metal suit and silver helmet, has been one of the most iconic cinema heroes for the past 27 years. The first film, directed with serious energy and edge by Paul Verhoeven, is still lauded as a phenomenally entertaining classic. Just as it is with 2012's Total Recall (also a remake of a Verhoeven film), the new RoboCop offers a flashy update with modern effects and production designs, but to remake a classic would seem like sacrilege.While many fans have been upset over this remake, I personally expected worse. There are a few things I found likable about the new film. Even though the film doesn't divulge in satire as much as the original did, it does spit out a few bits of faux media that underscores issues concerning drone warfare, foreign policy, corporate greed, manipulation of the media, and technology - all of which are pretty relevant to modern times. The transformation of Alex Murphy into a machine is a pretty harrowing sight, but once it is complete, RoboCop exhibits some interesting new abilities (including access to CCTV, wireless networks, and the complete police department database, all at a whim). The film maintains a steady focus on the character and his family (drama that was never really explored in the original films), and Alex's internal conflict of man and machine factors into the film's most interesting scenes.Of course, there is also plenty of action to be had. RoboCop busts through with all guns blazing in several scenes. At one point, he even takes on several ED-209 drones all at once. The shootouts are loud and the chase scenes are fast. However, the filming of these scenes tend to be erratic, and the scenes themselves don't leave much of an impact.The story covers some interesting ground, given the focus on Alex's constant struggle to maintain human emotion within his mechanical shell, and the focus on his wife and son. However, the plot twists can be seen coming from miles away (especially for those already familiar with the tale). The actual conspiracy involved only makes sense to a point, but it never feels as tight or relevant as it did in the original film. The actual plot structure seems jerky and loose, before reaching a rather flat climax. Given the serious tone of the film, all characters are pretty lacking in personality, and it only accentuates how flat and one-dimensional they are.Some of the most grievous complaints about this film, however, stem from the sheer lack of edge. This film pushes on the boundaries of its PG-13 rating, dishing out only as much curse words and violence as it's allowed to. While a film certainly doesn't have to be hardcore-R-rated to be good, this rendition of RoboCop glosses over the violence and candy-coats things to a more unrealistic degree. Paul Verhoeven made it a point to show violence on-screen, with extreme gore and pain, because he felt it was dangerous to shy away from those things and give audiences an unrealistic interpretation of violence. The movie doesn't just gloss over the blood and guts though; it's also stripped of most of the satire that populated the original film, and I also found it odd that very little crime and crime-fighting is shown. I mean, this is Detroit, right? Why does it look so shiny and modern? You'd never guess there was a crime problem in the film, if it wasn't for the characters talking about it.This film is made with some pretty shaky photography. Editing is okay, but it felt like some scenes were chopped off a little too short. Acting won't really knock anybody's socks off; Gary Oldman easily provides the best performance of the lot. I wasn't sure about Joel Kinnaman at first, but as he went on as RoboCop, I felt he handled the emotional and robotic sides of the character pretty well. Michael Keaton is fine and dandy playing a slimeball character, Abbie Cornish is okay as Mrs. Murphy, didn't care for Jackie Earle Haley's character, and Samuel L. Jackson pops in on occasion to yell some stuff at us. I really didn't care for anybody else's performance in the film, but it is notably disappointing to see that nobody has any lasting stature, especially when compared to the original film. Writing is not that great; it's able to get things moving along, but without really filling anything with good meaning. Occasional references and lines from the original film do little to mask the shortcomings. This production has some slick-looking sets, props, costumes and locales. Some of the choices (like the black RoboCop outfit, or the revamped ED-209) will not sit well with everybody. Some of the music choices seemed really odd to me; I didn't mind the actual music score, but it seemed pretty random.There are things I enjoyed about the RoboCop remake, but the film is not without its issues. The most glaring of which is that it's rather watered-down. Paul Verhoeven originally showed us a gritty world of corruption and crime where people really bled and died in the name of justice; Jos Padilha shows a slick-looking dramatization with a few neat ideas, but it doesn't have nearly as much weight. It's pretty much on-par with the Total Recall remake, which also had its share of neat ideas, but was not nearly as memorable.I'd only recommend this as a rental to interested sci-fi fans.3/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Average | Film: Average)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd Buy That for a Dollar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The expected cringes and groans never surfaced as the modernized re-boot of Paul Verhoeven's 1987 classic unfolded on the screen. Sure, I wish Peter Weller made even a cameo appearance, and yes, I missed the charm, humor and satire that has allowed the original to remain relevant; but, director Jose Padilha reimagines the story, sticks to PG-13 action, and incorporates the video game look favored by today's filmgoers.The opening sequence takes place in Tehran and is extremely well done, setting the stage for incisive commentary on today's foreign policies. Unfortunately, THAT movie never materializes, but we do get the over-the-top conservative news host ... played colorfully by Samuel L Jackson, who does manage to work in his iconic catchphrase. His holographic studio reminds of Minority Report, and has the futuristic look required.Joel Kinnaman (TV's "The Killing) adequately fills the part man/ part robot role (good guy and good cop Alex Murphy), but the script really lets him down when it comes to his wife (Abbie Cornish) and kid, his crime-fighting instincts, and the overlapping criminal elements - a generic arms dealer and the ultimate villain known as mega corporation OmniCorp run by the great Michael Keaton. The movie's best scenes involve the interaction between Keaton and the always terrific Gary Oldman, playing a conflicted doctor/robotics genius with a conscience (most of the time).The supporting cast is stellar and features a nasty Jackie-Earle Haley, a properly proper Jennifer Ehle, a relatively straight-laced Jay Baruchel, a two-faced police captain played by Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Murphy's partner Michael K Williams, and Oldman's loyal assistant played by Aimee Garcia ("Dexter"). The only misstep is the arms dealer played with zero screen presence by Patrick Garrow.A bit too much shakycam in the first shootout left me disappointed, as did most of the action sequences. However, the effects for the robotic suit and Murphy's "body" are fantastic. This is very much a tale of moralistic choices, and it could have been interesting to see Murphy go a bit deeper in his existential questioning of Man or Machine. Mostly, I was simply relieved it wasn't terrible and didn't tarnish the legacy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Not Bad Remake!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Kinnaman, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, Abbie Cornish, Michael K. Williams, Patrick Garrow, Jackie Earle Haley and Samuel L. Jackson star in this 2014 sci-fi remake of the 1987 film. This takes place in the year, 2028 in Detroit, Michigan where we meet cop, Alex Murphy (Kinnaman). He and his partner, Jack Lewis (Williams) are shot at while undercover by criminal, Antoine Vallon (Garrow) and his gang. Jack survives injuries, but Alex becomes targeted next and is killed at home. Soon, company, Omnicorp decides to create a robotic cop out of Alex. He becomes a symbol of law enforcement and soon seeks justice for his murder when his memories come back. Oldman (Batman Begins) plays scientist, Dr. Dennett Norton who modifies and helps Alex, Keaton (Batman) plays Raymond Sellars, the CEO of Omnicorp, Cornish plays Murphy's wife, Clara, Haley (The Bad News Bears) plays soldier, Rick Mattok and Jackson (Pulp Fiction) plays newscaster, Pat Novak. While the original is definitely superior, This isn't a bad remake featuring a good cast, great action &amp; visuals. It's also nice that they included the classic theme originated by Basil Poledouris. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The RoboCop Magic Is Gone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited to see this movie remake of the classic RoboCop movie series made famous in the 1980s. The director creates a great environment during the first hour. We see RoboCop join the Detroit City Police Department again as the famous half human half robot character so many followers like me have come to love. I couldn't wait to see RoboCop fight and catch the bad guys on the streets again with his famous trademark quotes like "your move creep", "thank you for your cooperation" or "come quietly or there will be trouble".But one hour in is where this movie seems to fall off a cliff. All of RoboCop's famous quotes have vanished. In fact I didn't hear any of them. I don't think his crime fighting scenes lasted 10 minutes. The longest catch the bad guys scene is filmed in the dark and looks like a video game. Sadly RoboCop's character turns into a backseat puppet sub plot overshadowed by political, media hype and police corruption stories.On the upside the acting and character development are terrific especially between Gary Oldman and Joel Kinnaman. The special effects are decent, realistic and clearly a big part of the movie budget. If you are not familiar with or didn't see any of the 3 original RoboCop movies you may like this new 2014 movie remake more than I did. I find the results entertaining but very disappointing.I say let RoboCop do what he does best. Put him back on the streets again with lots of screen time fighting bad guys. Upholding the law with the street justice he is so famous for is RoboCop's trademark. So please let him have it again if any sequels are made.</fullReview>

It would probably be something I would enjoy watching more if I hadn't already watched and loved the first Robocop movie.This movie is still definitely a lot better than the other Robocop movies, part two was not nearly as good as the first one, and part three was just a total joke.The Robocop TV series were also not very good, just cheaply made to cash in.This movie has a slicker looking Robocop. I thought the actor was OK but they definitely could have done better. Gary Oldman was a nice surprise, I didn't think he would have been in a movie like this but they must have paid through the nose for him, and whatever it was was worth it because like most movies he has been in he was definitely the highlight in this.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Initially I was all set to rate this $100 million production from 2014 with 5 stars (which I thought, at first, was an OK reboot of the $13 million original from 1987).But that was before character, Pat Novak, the black, TV-news mouthpiece came on screen (just prior to the film's final credits) and made his pigheaded, little, American, flag-waving speech.With the demented passion of a total fanatic, Novak excitedly exclaimed that (and I quote) "America is, and always will be, the greatest country on the face of this Earth!" (end of quote) Of course, Novak had nothing to back up this blindly arrogant statement with facts, but once those words came out of his candy-ass mouth, that was enough for me to reduce my rating of this truly forgettable piece of Yankee propaganda-junk to just 2 stars.I don't know about you, but, I, for one, not being American, do not appreciate having the likes of those bullying, hypocritical imperialists rubbing their conceited, ego-centric attitudes into my face in this manner.As far as I'm concerned - If the snot-nosed producers of this so-so action film want me to believe such a high'n'mighty statement as the one made above, then they're certainly gonna have to start proving it to me through their actions and through the calibre of the movies that they relentlessly churn out like fodder for the brain-dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RoboCop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1987 Paul Verhoeven/Peter Weller version is a fantastic satirical sci-fi film, I had mixed feelings about whether I would to see a remake and a reboot to the whole series, but I decided it was worth a try. Basically in 2028 Detroit, multinational conglomerate OmniCorp is the leading company for military robot technology, but it is banned by the Dreyfus Act for use in civilian law enforcement in the United States, supported by public opinion. To sway the public, OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) tasks his marketing team, working with scientist Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), want to create a product combing man and machine, so they search for permanently injured policemen to recruit for a prototype. Detroit Police detective Alex Murphy (Safe House's Joel Kinnaman) and his partner Jack Lewis (Michael Kenneth Williams) attempt to arrest crime boss Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow), but with contacts in the police he is tipped off, Lewis is shot and hospitalised, and Murphy is critically injured when a car bomb explodes outside his home. With the consent of Murphy's wife Clara (Limitless's Abbie Cornish), Dr. Norton uses Alex in the program, outfitting him with a cybernetic body and software, Murphy at first rejects his modifications, but all that remains of him is his original body is his heart, lungs, throat, head and right hand, for the sake of his family Murphy is convinced to continue. Following a live test against drones, with software controlling but making Murphy believes the decisions are his own, he proves himself a fully automated robot, but on the day of his first public appearance he is emotionally overwhelmed and suffers a seizure with police database uploaded into his memory, including his own attempted murder, so Norton lowers his dopamine levels until he no longer has any emotions, this leads to him ignoring his wife and son, and apprehending a criminal in the crowd. Public opinion toward the Dreyfus Act starts to change, The Novak Element television news pundit Patrick 'Pat' Novak (Samuel L. Jackson) dubs Murphy "RoboCop", and Sellars pressures Norton not to allow Clara and son David Murphy (John Paul Ruttan) see their father, as Murphy drastically reduces the Detroit crime rate, however Clara gets close to her husband and reminds him who he is. This leads to Murphy overriding his programming and attempting to solve his own murder case, reviewing CCTV footage he sees that David was traumatised seeing the incident, Murphy's dopamine levels start returning to normal and his emotions revive, he kills criminals responsible and targets two corrupt cops in the station, until military tactician Rick Mattox (A Nightmare on Elm Street's Jackie Earle Haley) shuts his system down to be taken back to OmniCorp. While Sellars tries to use these incidents to his advantage, and there is support for the repeal of the Dreyfus Act, Clara goes to the press and demands to know why she and her son cannot see Alex, Sellars decides in the end, to stop anyone else connected to the crime and any other corruption being discovered, that robots with human components run a risk of overriding their systems, and RoboCop should be eliminated, but Norton betrays them and revives Murphy to explain the situation. Murphy attempts to find Sellars, who has the OmniCorp building locked down and drones on security, he is unable apprehend him with his programming, so Lewis shoots and kills him, and Murphy finds Sellars on the roof with Clara and David as hostages, his programming means he cannot apprehend Sellars either, but he overcomes his programming and is able to shoot and kill Sellars. In the end Murphy's body is rebuilt in Norton's laboratory and he is reunited with his wife and son, Norton confesses everything about OmniCorp, the President vetoes the Dreyfus Act vote, Novak is outraged by the events, and Murphy is seen on the news reports secretly returning to work. Also starring Jennifer Ehle as Liz Kline, This Is the End's Jay Baruchel as Tom Pope, Marianne Jean- Baptiste as Chief Karen Dean, Aimee Garcia as Jae Kim, Douglas Urbanski as Mayor Durant and K.C.Collins as Andre Daniels. Kinnaman is a good choice as the man turned cyborg, Oldman is fine as the scientist putting him together, Keaton is alright as the near pantomime villain, and supporting cast members Cornish and Jackson get their moments as well. This remake has lost the satire element and the over the top violence that was great about the original, but it is written and paced very well, the scenes with guns going off, machine attacking and chases ensuing are exciting, and of course the special effects are fantastic, so all in all it is actually an entertaining science-fiction action thriller. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As all the remakes, this one cannot escape comparisons. And it is even harder when the original was just made no more than 27 years, when the movies were already in color and special effects were already used.The new movie has a great cast. Even if you are not too cinefil you will see many familiar faces most of which are doing a really good job. Effects and action scenes are great, much better than the original. The plot was really well targeted on explaining every single question with believable scientific arguments and the industrio-commercial view of today. The Oldman-Keaton confrontation was astonishing. I couldn't really find lacking anything and to tell the truth I was glad that the movie had not those disgusting moments of its predecessor. I understand those who complain that it is too family oriented and a part of me would expect some tragedy to increase the attachments to the characters. As Haley said "a dead hero" is "better than a hero", a dead main character, would be better than a character. But for us 30something that already experienced the initial movie's tragedy and have our own family now, we appreciated the lack of too much blood and the connection between father and son.I appreciated the courage that the writers took to criticize USA's expansionism under the flag of freedom. The 1st Robocop was making you think about what is the meaning of "humanity". This one makes you think what the meaning of "freedom" today.This Robocop is much more of a Murphy, but is highly enjoyable and I'm sure that in 30 years, its quotes will sound as heavy as the 1st movie's. Hope we will see a trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Original but not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all let me make this clear, I loved both the original Roboocop and the sequel. So when this reboot was announced, I was excited because I wanted to see how Hollywood would take another shot at it. The effects at a lot of times were very appealing to the eyes. Some of the action scenes I admit were kinda boring and a let down. One complaint I have is that the movie focuses not so much on Robocop but on Omnicorp, the press and his family. Which in my opinion was a unexpected choice but made interesting exposition and a nice addition. An interesting thing the did was that in the original you could see Murphy's slow realization that he was a man who lost himself to this machine he has become. In this movie he had a conscience, loses it and kinda at the end quickly gets it back. I personally would have liked if they had him slowly regain his humanity. Though they do portray the totally lost humanity well. Joel Kinnaman was fairly good but I prefer Paul Welling overall. Most of the actors I enjoyed as well especially Gary Oldman and Micheal Keaton(I like them anyway though). All in all, I have seen much worse reboots and while I can't say it was as good as the original, it's a nice way to introduce Roboccop back to mainstream audiences</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather nice take</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In most recent years a lot of films have been redone since the CGI boom. I have to say however this was a better take on the sci-fi genre of the hero Alex Murphy (AKA Robocop). A married police man who is dedicated to stopping criminals in their tracks is subject to a car bomb rendering his body nearly half dead.With the consent by his wife, he undergoes the radical change from human, to almost a fully mechanical automaton with his faculties intact. This makes him now a deadly force to be reckoned with in the line of duty. Yet with the high office of OCP at the helm led by Raymond Sellers (Micheal Keaton) his life is not all it seems to be in the eye of the public.Now on the hunt for a known criminal, Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) digs up past truths about his career as a cop and who was behind the initial bombing of his car which led him to his final stage as the most significant cop on the streets. Armed with his famous gun, and a few background friends he has to face his most dangerous foe.All in all, I thought this film was a marvellous upgrade. I am a fan of the old Robocop, but I thought this had more action than the first one. Although blood was not the issue here, it stands to reason that Joel had the right attitude to play a bot of such calibre. His facial expression was steel, no emotion to speak of.In the line of cult classics, this is to be the first one that made it as a redo. I hope in the future if they make more of the films they have Joel Kinnaman as the lead metal man. Peter Weller I hope is proud of this guys achievement and goes on to build the Robo status.</fullReview>

Bravo to the director and stellar cast. Top effort. Most enjoyable and such a sumptuous visual feast. Captured the moral anguish of man versus machine and that was what stood out in the original. That relationship between Murphy and his police buddies had to be recreated to make - in my opinion - a plausible and worthy remake. And you know what, it did. The chemistry was there from all the cast. Gary Oldman hit the ball out of the park...and Keaton was superb in support. Very clever sequences, a great tempo, stunning visuals, excellent casting and to be honest a better version than the original from a technical stance yet a worthy adaptation from an emotional bye line. Props to the people that put this together. This will translate well in Blu ray on a 60"+ LED. Yes, a 10. Nothing to complain about...we'll that is, except for the unnecessary and contravening reference to "Greenpeace having been attacked by Wikileaks hackers" on the ticker tape of the news bulletin...Be interested to know why the director felt compelled to add that in?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine science fiction in its own right, but heavy handed in its morals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you make a 'RoboCop' movie, it is inevitable it will be compared to Paul Verhoeven's classic. But despite the fact that both are about a police officer who is is turned into a Cyborg after being mortally wounded in the line of duty, the two movies are completely different. To answer the obvious question: this version is not as good as the original. However, it is a fine science fiction in its own right. It is not remake of the original. It has its own themes and storyline. If you insist on making parallels to the original, it is more of a deconstruction of the original movie.The original movie address topics of (un?)necessary violence, corporate corruption. Themes that were relevant in the eighties. This movie introduces question of the morality of using drones against people, both foreign and abroad.Even the human story is different. In the original Alex Murphy was rebuilt as a dehumanized robot, who slowly regained his humanity. In much of the original RoboCop's face was covered, climaxing in a scene when he took his helmet of and revealed his human face.This movie is about the question if one can remain human if your body is mostly metal and electronics. Part of the storyline has Murphy losing his humanity as the robot part takes over. And the scene where Alex Murphy is confronted with just how much of his body he has lost is quite strong. Though John Kinnaman plays the titular role, and has some good scenes as a man trying desperately to cling to his humanity, it is Gary Oldman who has the most interesting role as the scientist who rebuilds Murphy. It is clear he really wants to help Murphy, but it is interesting to see how he finds himself more and more out of his dept as his creation struggles with what he has become.It is hard to really determine a clear antagonist in this movie. Is it the criminal who bombed Murphy? No, he is just a stepping stone in Alex's quest to regain his lost humanity. A more obvious choice is Michael Keaton as the CEO of Omnicorp, the corporation who rebuilt Murphy. This character isn't nearly as memorable (and deplorable) as Ronnie Cox's Dick Johnes character in the original. Yet, that is not a bad thing as it shows that even a morally ambiguous CEO can be driven by a desire to change things for the better, as long as it improves sales. His worst performance really was when the crossed the line of morally ambiguous to outright villainous. And his comeuppance wasn't nearly as memorable as Dick Johnes death. The movie contains many references to the original, albeit in a re-imagined way. Samuel L. Jacksons 'Pat Novak' broadcasts are clearly based on the commercials of the original, although they are used to explain and even further the plot.Unfortunately, here lies also the weakness of the movie. The 'Pat Novak' character is a caricature. The movie shows that he is supposed to be biased, but he acts as like some straw-man and it is clear that we should despise everything he says.Other themes get the same treatment. The question about using drones in war zones and even at home is very relevant these days, and much of the first part of this movie is about this question. Though good arguments are made by both sides of the discussion, the movie clearly takes sides and demonizes the proponents. It even goes so far as to show a scene where a group of suicide bombers are portrayed as heroes (do not cause any civilian casualties? really?). I'm from one of the most left-wing places in Europe and even I had to roll my eyes. Remarkably, the hot issue of mass surveillance, something Murphy makes a lot of use of (four camera's that are looking at his own front porch?) as RoboCop, is not brought up at all.So there you have it. It is a good science-fiction movie, with an interesting storyline but with a moral that is far to obvious for my liking. I give it a comfortable 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand some of the negative reviews this film got. Those reviewers evidently didn't see the Total Recall remake, the last Die Hard movie or any of the Expendibles movies because this new RoboCop was way better than any of them.The new RoboCop wasn't a bad movie because I've seen worse. It was actually pretty good. Obviously the original was a classic but this film can't be compared to that because it really was a completely different movie. It bore only some superficial resemblance to the original. And that isn't necessarily a bad thing since a remake would've felt like a repeat and a simple repeat would've been boring.The lead actor Joel Kinnamen wasn't a bad choice either. He was a likable guy and had the right combination of strength and vulnerability. His only problem was that he looked goofy in the suit. The special effects were great and the story was interesting. I liked the additional backdrop given to the RoboCop program. And I appreciated the seriousness in tone the filmmakers kept in the movie. Sure, I would've like to have seen a better build up to Murphy's death and more graphic violence so that when Murphy's enemies got their comeuppance, it would've been more satisfying. But overall this new RoboCop was still an entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake from 1987 (before I was born!), I thought a review of the film as its own (instead of comparing with the original) will be more apt, since I've never caught the original and that the technology had advanced tremendously over the past 27 years to make a fair comparison. This is one of the films that was able to give me goosebumps with just their special effects. Swedish-American actor Joel Kinnaman delivered an engaging performance, especially at the part where he became conscious and discovered what's left of his body. Seriously, I can totally imagine myself going berserk if that happened to me.Which led me to think about the question of Euthanasia. Will I make the same decision as Murphy's wife, Clara (Abbie Cornish), or will I let go? Letting go is definitely a tough decision, but imagine the horror of seeing your own husband alive, left with only a pair of lungs, heart, face and? brain?Gary Oldman managed to give the audience the image of sympathetic Dr. Dennett Norton, who was humane yet secretly and crazily awed by what he can do with the human brain. He can get away with anything and not be blamed with his perfectly restrained performance.The other character who caught my attention was Patrick "Pat" Novak, host of The Novak Element (Nick Fury in Avengers). A contrast to his cool and nice role in Avengers, Pat Novak is now a charismatic and pro- robot host who is able to turn any situation to his benefit.Read more: http://tiffanyyong.com/2014/01/30/robocop-2014-movie-review/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great Sci-fi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People that say this film is bad are being evil. OK, the original one is a fantastic movie and a classical sci-fi film. But compare this one with the original one is not the way. You must analyze it as not a remake but as a new story. We have only the same main character, but the vision here is completely different. By this way you will note a nice screenplay showing a critic to America imperialism, the power of media on population choice and how man could be evil and destroying the live of a correct man in favor of money. Beisdes that, the new Robocop visual is fantastic, full of technology and showing an amazing transformation and they remove the robot part from the rest of the man. Padilha made a great work with the material he have and to me was a nice result for his first work at Hollywood. The the interpretation of Keaton and Oldman are great as always. To me the only critic was the final scenes that could be better and more decisive, "The Final Carharsis".</fullReview>

Also criticizes the question of priority is the money, all with fantasy to produce a safe world. Another issue that also addresses the film is about the meaning and importance of family, media manipulation, and because the existing technology is not used for our protection. Several of the tools that our Robocop Brazilian uses in fiction I think it might already be affordable for the use of police intelligence. I hope the future shown, can get our money quickly.

		<fullReview>This movie has a totally different story than the original one, and also a different focus. If you are willing to watch a pure action film, than be aware that this new Robocop will not meet your needs. It has many dramatic scenes, and most of them are sad. What this movie deliver is a nice sci-fi story, exposing some moral question that humanity may face in the future, and some action and drama. These where my expectation when I went to watch it, and that is why I grad it 10. I should also say that the acting was very good.Although, I grade it 10, I believe some point could be improved if the movie was longer. Some part of the story are too fast. The investigation of his murder, his family troubles and the action scenes, all of them deserved more few minutes, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the years we've been given countless remakes and reboots that we didn't ask for. Very few have been worth the trouble they've caused yet they keep on coming. That being said, for every Wicker Man there's a True Grit to allow your faith in Hollywood to be restored. Jos Padilha had some big boots to fill and a lot of people to please, even though he may have made a good film it didn't live up to the high standards that had been set.Paul Verhoeven's 1987 RoboCop was a sharp, witty and brutal thriller. Despite initially being seen as a tacky sci-fi rip-off it was soon loved by audiences and given a well-deserved cult following. Considering we've caught up with the technology, RoboCop seemed like one of the few classic films just about ready for a reboot. Unfortunately Jos Padilha's RoboCop lacks the ultra-violence, satire, heart and balls that made the original such a cult success.The 12A rating angered many of the previous fans as this was guaranteed to step away from the ultra-violence of the original. Surprisingly, this remake doesn't shy away from violence but instead takes away the explicit content and gritty aspect of it destroying any sense of realism. Hearing criminal's talk without any swearing along with the unnecessary and overcooked CGI takes all the fun out of the action sequences.Joel Kinnaman is somewhat wooden at times but tries his best to give emotion to his bland Alex Murphy. Abbie Cornish ? who spends about 95% of the film with tears gushing from her dead eyes ? plays Murphy's wife left holding the fate of her husband's life in her hands and whining about the consequences later on. The chemistry between these two actors is so forced that the scenes they share are uncomfortable to watch and will make you feel embarrassed for them. There isn't a particular stand out performance apart from Gary Oldman's but you spend most of the film trying to decide whether to love or loathe his Frankenstein-like character Dr. Dennett Norton. Samuel L. Jackson's Pat Novak ? a biased network host ? pops up every few scenes waving his hands aimlessly around a green-screen set. Jackson feels awkwardly out of place and his unwanted presence becomes highly irritating as does Jay Baruchel's smarmy marketing man.The film gets off to a good start but after the horrifying scene of Dr. Norton showing Murphy how bad his situation really is by leaving him as nothing more than a floating head above a CGI pair of lungs it's all downhill from there. With no defining or remotely interesting villain and a melodramatic story line revolving around Murphy's family, Padilha captures all of this with his frantic hand-held camera-work making the film even harder for the audience to watch.Despite a couple of nods to the original, that's about as close as Padilha's tedious RoboCop gets to Verhoeven's. A decent remake but it's far from satisfying. Maybe we expected too much or maybe we just weren't given enough. Your move, creep.</fullReview>

Although I was waiting for swearing the whole movie, Pat Novak made up for that at the end with "That is the biggest mother f*****g pile of horse s*** i ever heard!" and the blood spatter at the end when Raymond Sellars gets shot was a nice touch. The motorcycle is awesome, pretty similar to the new bat-bike from the dark knight rises (without that funky wheel spinney thing). I was hoping there'd be a similar scene from the original when Alex Murphy got his left arm and right hand blow off. Also...THEY MADE LEWIS A MAN! Why is Lewis a man? Lewis was perfect female, by making her a man, they've completely changed their relationship.However, none of this changes the fact that this movie was pure awesome.</fullReview>

One is even shocking for me - take consideration that I'm plastic surgeon, nothing causes me awe in reconstructive surgery! I recommend you go see yourself, because in near future, people will recognize this as a modern sci-fi classic. I explain the hate by the political bias of the plot. This movie deserves a 8 rate here in IMDb. There's no way this be a bad movie. Goog acting, top notch effects, memorable moments. Best remake possible for Robocop.

		<shortDescription>Actually not that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You're probably never going to believe this but I have never seen the original so I have nothing to compare this one to. A lot of people didn't like the original while the critics liked it and rotten tomatoes says that it fails to improve over the original one. But don't get me wrong, I really liked this movie and thought it was not that bad. Sure it's not perfect but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Though the film suffers from narrative inconsistencies at the climax, it has stellar performances from the cast. It think Gary Oldman's performance was the best of all and it found him at his most dynamic, and my second favorite was Micheal Keaton as the CEO of Omnicorp (*spoiler alert* the company that makes Robocop in the film). Joel Kinnaman as Robocop was also really great and surprised me greatly. The movie had it's good moments and its bad moments. I won't go into detail on them but there were some very cool moments with Robocop and very heartwarming moments with Murphy and his family. Overall, I think that Robocop was a rather decent film. Though i don't think it's perfect and it is also quite generic, I think it is very well made. Grade: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badly wounded cop gets second life as robot. Good or bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As every generation needs its own Hamlet, perhaps every 20 years or so the advanced film technology needs its own Robocop. It exercises the state of the art, even as it yet again assumes the inevitable loss of compassion and emotion in modern humanity's thirst for progress.Certainly Jose Padilha's version has impressive effects. The Samuel Jackson rabble-rousing TV show is amazing, as is the Robocop's conversion from heart, lungs and brain into fully functioning super machine. Why, the cop hero's kitchen even has one of those hangers to keep bananas fresh! The technology is, for once properly speaking, awesome. The film closes on two statements. One affirms the robot lawman's ultimate triumph: the song over the end credits is "I fought the law and the law won." The second is the Jackson character's closing assertion: America is the greatest country in the world and always will be. That line is both American bravado and an ironic undercutting of itself.For the film functions as a kind of national wish-fulfilment. The giveaway is the early scene where America patrols the streets and alleys of Teheran using drones and robots to keep order without risking US lives. This, of course, when Iran has been running circles around American diplomacy and has brazenly challenged the US on its nuclear monopoly. In another magical detente, the American company developing the man-in-a-machine is operating amid the rice-fields of a docile China. As if the US and not China held all the other's IOUs. Then, too, the film imagines a crime-free and prosperous Detroit. Did I mention wish-fulfilment?And who is the US senator who pushes through a bill to prevent the deployment of human machines? To deploy robocops in America that bill has to be repealed. To the raving right wing he's obviously pro-crime, anti-progress and therefore a traitor. But we're supposed to know he's a good guy because he's named Dreyfuss, evoking the Jewish general falsely accused of being a traitor in 19th Century France. That allusion seems to undercut the TV commentator's raw rah-rah jingoism. But the spectacle of the robocop's impressive mass justice outweighs that liberal sentiment altogether.

		<shortDescription>Ironically, the human focus helps to sink it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of Verhoeven's controversial sci-fi semi-classic 'RoboCop' doubles down on the human element, simplifies its satirical focus and brings a 21st century video game aesthetic to its action sequences. Unfortunately these changes only serve to subvert the film's impact rather than enhance it.I believe putting a stronger focus on the human story was a good idea in theory, but in practice it often grinds the film to a halt. The actors do their part, but the material is rarely up to the task. And while I didn't agree with the original film's politics, it had a stronger and much clearer focus than the too often redundant monologues by Samuel L. Jackson's Bill O'Reilly-esque "Pat Novak" character.There are a number of really good moments and ideas here, but they're held together by a vastly inferior sinew than the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Underrated Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm giving the movie a 10 to try and convey a message to other IMDb users and visitors of this page that this RoboCop Remake is in no way one that deserves a 6.6 rating (rating at the time of reviewing). In my opinion, the film viewed in it's own, deserves a rating of at least 7. Fans of the original need to stop comparing and criticising the film for not been an exact same copy of the original. I agree that the story- line, visual effects, cinematography, costumes (being made in year 2013) and acting itself could have been better to create a more realistic and appealing film. The film felt a bit rushed and also dragged on at times with too many scenes inside the lab and of Det. Murphy riding his bike. A little more character development could have also helped the audiences to grasp the struggle Alex and the family is facing and really emphasise on the human element in the movie which people can relate to. Nevertheless, the director succeeds in capturing the man/machine contemplation within RoboCop and it keeps you entertained from one scene to another as a fast-paced sci-fiction/action flick. - Highly recommended to watch and don't be fooled by the negative reviews.</fullReview>

Like other reviews forget being so in-depth about how roboCop came about and the process of building him. We want a quick 10/15 minute intro to what happened to him, then get on with the film. Use a decent villain, not mix and match of people who don't seem to really have any aim but to hurt roboCop.

		<fullReview>There is an old saying in Hollywood I believe to be true . When you decide to remake a good movie there is no way to go but down . The original Peter Weller Robocop was refreshingly new and exciting to watch when it first appeared in 1987 . Even the sequel, Robocop 2 was pretty good I thought although it suffered from mixed reviews . Robocop 3 was just plain awful . Next came the Robocop TV series in 1994 which I admit to seeing only the first episode . The show lasted from March to November which meant it was a stinker . So now they decided 24 years later to return Robocop to the big screen . However, newer does not necessarily make it any better . Less than half way through this film I lost all interest and couldn't wait for it to end . Lots of shooting and CGI's but short on plot . I doubt you will be seeing a sequel to this very forgettable version of Robocop . This is just another remake that should never have been made ! Not hot ... PWH</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RoboCop Doesn't Need Comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly every review for RoboCop mentions the original RoboCop. Nearly every mention online regarding the new RoboCop mentions the original RoboCop. The majority of comments on social media sites regarding the new RoboCop well, mention the original RoboCop.On one hand, this is inevitable. It's just almost impossible to not watch a major motion picture that is named the same as another major motion pictures from nearly 30 years ago and not somehow compare the two. The severity of it, however, is ridiculous.I loved the original RoboCop. Full disclosure, RoboCop 2 is actually one of my favorite films of all time. However, that doesn't preclude me from also enjoying RoboCop 2014 in all of its slick, re-imagined, re- envisioned, up-to-date glory.So, when I eagerly went to see RoboCop, I wasn't thinking about the original. I was strapping myself in for a new vision on a familiar tale that I held dear. I mean, how many different Robin Hood books have there been? How many different revisions of Grimm's Tales have there been? The remake has been going on since the first story was ever told.I was just going to enjoy 2014's RoboCop as its own movie.And what a movie it is.The first thing you'll notice is the amazing casting job. Joel Kinnaman is fantastic as both Alex Murphy and Robo. He brings a grit to it and a tangible sorrow when dealing with his wife and son after the accident. Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton fall right into their roles as a scientist trying to help out those who have lost limbs, and the leader of a company that makes it possible, respectively. And I had a genuine distaste for Jackie Earle Haley's role as Mattox, poking and prodding and cutting the newly minted RoboCop down to size.Abby Cornish also brings as genuine and heartfelt performance as Clara Murphy and serves to bring as much life to the RoboCop character through her longing as Kinnaman does from beneath the metal.Director Jose Padhila obviously had his pulse on current events when making Detroit circa 2028. The political circumstances in this futuristic set felt realistic. They didn't feel too far off and that also made this "sci-fi" movie, much more down to earth than I originally expected. Once Murphy transitions into RoboCop (which does take a bit of running time) the good stuff just gets better and better. Padhila's themes of identity, privacy, and humanity run deep, but aren't over mined or worn too thing. His action chops are seen in a few scenes that may become cult classics down the line, especially one where RoboCop takes on a drug dealer in a pitch black warehouse.One of my favorite parts about the RoboCop story is that he isn't an indestructible Terminator. RoboCop is made with materials that can't exactly take huge grenade hits one after the other. He has weaknesses, even if sometimes he thinks he does not. It makes the character a fragile one who is willing to give away his own well being in the face of justice, and routinely does. Without giving away any spoilers, it's safe to say that RoboCop can stand on its own and doesn't need to be compared constantly to its predecessor. Sure, the original RoboCop exists, and I'm sure glad it does, but that doesn't mean that a new telling of the story can't have its own place in the pantheon of RoboCop stories. Hopefully, there are many more to tell.</fullReview>

The original was a true crime movie with lots of action from Clarence Boddicker, Mr. Dick Jones and company 1) What cop movie does not have profanity what more not even the criminals used four letter words the entire movie. The only vague swearing was done by Samuel L. Jackson at the end of the movie. WTG MPAA for your censorship of this movie. It could have had an R rating d/t violence with guns and I suppose that was disputed by the momma's at MPAA. The original Robocop had tons of swearing right from the beginning of the movie till the end. OK ill stop ranting and move on....2) The story was good but I felt the movie spent to much time on the family of officer Murphy and was overshadowed by the crimes of the corrupt cops and omni corp. 3) overall its only worth if you see it at matine price and don't even think about going all out with elevated price tickets such as 3D or special seats to enjoy the movie. Crime movies should always have a rated "R" associated with these flicks. But I guess Bollywood is trying to save the planet and profanity all together :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misfire. They focused on the wrong transformation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie focuses on Murphy's transformation to Robocop. They might as well have titled this Robocop Begins. It worked for Batman because it was compelling to see his motivation. The approach doesn't work for Robocop. I felt this was more the story of OmniCorp refining their product rather than about Murphy. While they've come up with some good rationale, the underdog story of Murphy emerging through it all is a far more interesting tale (kudos to the original movie).Unfortunately, the transformation covers most of the movie. I felt the movie suffers for this. The brief moment the movie has after the complete transformation is when things really picked up for me, but it was just too brief.As many other reviewers mentioned, Joel Kinnaman made for a terrible Murphy but I thought he did a good job as Robocop.But my biggest complaint with this movie is the new Robocop design. They've made him so sleek and agile that he's just not all that distinguishable from other superheros. He's so flawless, he's boring. The older Robocop looked like a tank; heavy and bulky, which made him slow and clumsy...and different and interesting, with a flaw that he had to work around. Just the poster of the older movie of Robocop stepping out of the car is far more thrilling and iconic than anything in this movie.</fullReview>

There is a general lack of depth to the main character, too, with little focused on Robocop's humanity, especially his interaction with his family, forget other civilians, that I believe to be an essential part of the story, and way too much focusing on the news show in the film. It's more like a bad drama than action. It certainly does not deserve the Imax treatment and its' related expensive tickets. The original is much better!</fullReview>

And I think critics are too involved in reviewing this in comparison to the first film(which was excellent) than it's own film.A stellar cast, corporate greed, a bit of social commentary, makes this film a decent reboot. And the cast is stellar. My favorite I think was Michael Keaton and the team of people working with him. Healy, Ehle, Oldman were all great and all seemed to be having a lot of fun as was Samuel Jackson.I thought the weakest part of the film was the family aspect. I get that they used Murphy's wife and son to bring back his humanity, but they really didn't give us enough time to get to know them for that aspect to be as effective as it could have. That's one area I feel the original was much stronger with, is they used Alex's partner and that really seemed to work.Overall a very solid film and worth seeing. Don't listen to the critics who are blasting this. It's entertaining and an enjoyable ride.</fullReview>

Most memorable for me where scenes with first person perspective when Robocop makes tactical calculations before going into action - a very nice feature. The armor of Robocop is great, it looks just how it should be.I enjoyed really all scenes including OmniCorp characters. All dialogs between them are full of questions "how to sell a product like Robocop" and answers which finally come out, are a great mix of humour and common sense of greedy, people from big corporations.But the greatest treasure of this film are actors: Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson are performing excellent. This is so unique for sci-fi action movies so I decided to make Robocop remake a 10/10 movie.All fans of great performance and great action scenes will leave a cinema with satisfaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another of those films where nearly all of the sedate conversations are turned into "action scenes" by waving the camera about.And then when there is action...well, if the choreography isn't up to much then let's wave the camera about an awful lot more to try and mask it so it's hard to see what's actually happening.Does it make us feel like we're actually there? No, it makes us feel there's a hopeless cameraman on set stumbling about following the actors around, that it's just a movie after all.Otherwise: Above average. In no way an insult to the original. Good development of the effect of Robocop's predicament on his family. Convincing unspoken turmoil from Gary Oldman's doctor, and Keaton was a shiver-inducing fringe-megalomaniac.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks lustre of original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IN 1987, the Bangles dominated the airways with their hit single Walk Like an Egyptian, the Simpsons are seen for the first time on TV, my parents were blessed by the birth of me and audiences were treated to a film experience that they hadn't quite seen before in the form of Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop. Now the studio executives in Hollywood ? fixated on the "rebooting" franchises ? have taken it upon themselves to target RoboCop to a wider audience, dropping the age restriction from an R18 to a 10-12 certificate. The film is set in the year 2028 in Detroit, and America is the only country in the world not allowed to use robotic cops on the street. OmniCorp ? the company which manufactures the mechanised police officers ? are desperately trying to overturn a state bill that prohibits the use of these new-age law enforcers. When honest and dedicated-to-the-job policeman Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is nearly killed by a car explosion, the massive tech corporation uses this as an opportunity for them to humanise the robotic cops by fusing Murphy ? well what's left of him ? with a machine. And the result is RoboCop, but it's not that simple. OmniCorp uses one of their chief doctors, Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), to aid Murphy in his transition to half-man, half-robot and with pressure from OmniCorp owner Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton), the good doctor resorts to some questionable work ethics. The relationship between Oldman's and Keaton's characters really enhances the story and carries the plot along at a captivating pace. I asked myself why a "big budget" action film with such a cult following was not released in the summer. And the answer was revealed after watching it. The film just doesn't have the calibre to be deserving of a summer release date. There are a good few action scenes, but they are plain down average, with sequences that we have been accustomed to in standard action films. However, there is one scene ? where RoboCop takes out giant dog-like mechs ? which stands out from the rest, but even when it's over, you are not going to remember it when driving home from the theatre. The film's only saving grace is the drama segments, which revolve around the moral dilemma that Oldman's character is put into and the psychological challenge that Murphy endures during his transformation into RoboCop. The acting ? with particularly Oldman and Keaton stealing every scene that they are in ? is top-notch all round, but it is not enough to put RoboCop in the same light as the original. The film is like eating a three-course meal and still feeling hungry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, it seems nobody is ever happy whichever way a director goes. I think they have made a good effort here re-imagining Robocop for the 21st century. The PG rating probably hurt their ability to meet the expectations most have around violence and black humour. Essentially, if you're looking for a decent 1980's Robocop sequel, you're not going to get it. BUT, I do think it's a good movie to go see and make up your own mind. I like the suit.. and I like family element brought in (however weird it feels to watch). Kinnear and Cornish are great in their respective roles (no, I don't think Abbie was irritating - stop it people!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is an interesting robot movie... that is it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leaving an obvious comparison to the original and having my mind in a fresh state I took a sit and watched this movie. I was willing to give it a shot despise the fame around all sequels.The movie doesn't excel in any way and here is why:- The photography isn't present (most of the time is a detail look on the actor's face.- Story telling isn't present at all. No elements will make you bond to the character or his family. The story basically will tell you on the first 15 minutes the guy is a good detective and tries to be a good father... but this two stories are rendered thin if you try to tell them both at the same time. Then there is the even corporation wanting to exploit a new market mixed up with this stories (with Sam L Jackson as an annoying "reporter"). Then the story moves to the struggle between the family and the cop to be reunited which doesn't play well with an officer trying to solve his own murder/half life/trying to find that balance to not damage his family even more.- Visual Effects. This might be one reason to go and see this movie... yet this visual effects nowadays are pretty much the same.- Acting... pretty average.- Wow factor: pretty much none. The movie is completely predictable and the worst part is: if you have seen the trailer you have seen all the 'good' parts of the movie.In conclusion, the movie tried to give you a perspective of current technology and its interaction with the mankind, and how corporations might manage certain aspects of public opinion to get their agendas done. But as a movie is completely average (tending to low average) and as a reboot is pretty disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much talk, not enough action or intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one thing the 2012 remake of Total Recall taught us, it's that Paul Verhoeven's movies are not easily redone. Nevertheless, studio MGM felt like trying with Verhoeven's first Sci-Fi spectacle, by reimagining the genre classic RoboCop (1987) for the audience of today. Brazilian director Jos Padilha, known for his action thriller hit film Tropa de Elite, scored this thankless job and he gets credit for trying, but the fact can't be changed the Total Recall curse is adhered to, as this new RoboCop proves yet another remake that is inferior to its predecessor.Nevertheless, the movie opens on a strong note, when it tries to embrace the satirical touch of the original and apply it to the modern state of affairs. Set in 2028, rightwing political TV commentator Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson playing the part just right with apparent delight) publicly laments not deploying robots at the homefront for keeping America safe, while such products are otherwise keeping the peace the world over. Cut to Tehran, where the local population is intimidated into submission by robosoldiers patrolling every street. When suicide bombers protesting their presence attack the automatons, their ruthless efficiency is made clear, as is their lack of human calculation and reasoning when they gun down a boy armed with only a small knife. Novak calls it a success because no American personnel of flesh and blood died, but for the public it is clear these robots still leave something to be desired. And so the OmniCorp multinational decides to combine the organic with the mechanic to construct a more acceptable, friendlier product for keeping the American streets clean. And this is where the promising political comments on today's affairs, ever a welcome food for thought in science fiction flicks, also sadly end.Enter police officer and family man Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman), who is caught up in undercover operations and suspects his colleagues' corruption. When his car explodes and he is on the brink of death, OmniCorp sees the perfect test subject in him for their 'RoboCop' programme. Saving only the most essential of body parts, sympathetic scientist Norton (the always reliable Gary Oldman) sticks him in a high tech body armour. Controlling his body is one thing, but keeping his mind in check is another matter entirely. The corporation swiftly finds out it's not so easy to confine a man to the status of a product that bows down to its manufacturer's every whim. Eventually they opt to basically brainwash him so the software controls his behavior, rendering him every bit the robot, much to the chagrin of his wife who wants her husband back (as if that's possible when all that's left of him is his head, heart and lungs). Fortunately for her, Murphy's psyche is still alive inside, and it's determined to break out to get his revenge on those that killed him before and return to his loving wife and son.The main problem this remake suffers from is finding the right balance between action and intelligence that characterized Verhoeven's film. Hellbent on not simply being a mindless remake, the movie spends much of its time exploring the dichotomy between man and machine. Where does the man end and the machine begin? Can the mind truly be mechanized? Such questions the film attempts to answer in more detail than feels obliged, without drawing sufficient conclusions either, as it's clear from the get-go where this RoboCop is mentally going. All the talk of the complications of mind versus matter fail to hit a chord due to the predictable progression of the plot which is devoid of surprises to make the film's philosophy reach any narrative fruition. The overabundance of talk is also the cause of the movie feeling overly light on the action which the title by association with the original film promises. Though the occasional crime fighting delivers what we hoped for, though in portions too small to satisfy, the bland battles between the 'tin man' and his fully machine counterparts just prove less than entertaining. And unlike the original it's all PG-13 stuff, only decreasing the emotional impact.Another issue working against this film as opposed to the original is the lack of gravitas Kinnaman displays as the titular character. As a regular human being he feels emotionless already ? never making you believe husband and wife care that much for each other as the movie would have us think later on ? while in his later automatic shape he doesn't strike us as effectively intimidating or commanding. Though it must be said there's little to hold against the new RoboCop armor, or Kinnaman's look when he wears it, it's his performance that simply fails to deliver the right note. At least the movie fares better in terms of acting thanks to veterans like Oldman and Jackson, while decent character actors Michael K. Williams, Jackie Earle Haley and Michael Keaton also do their best to make things work, but miscasting the main character is an error not so easily remedied. At least the movie proves more convincing in the art department, the various environments and robots, including RoboCop's famous antagonist ED-209, making up a little for Kinnaman's human flaws.The new RoboCop is a watered down version of the original that isn't as smart as it thinks it is, nor provides the amount of action it should. It goes too far to say it's totally boring, especially for those who never bothered to see the original (which they still should do regardless). Nevertheless, it would have done well to feature less talking, more action; an argument not often heard for this type of movie. At the same time, it becomes painfully clear there's only ever going to be one RoboCop, and his name is not Joel Kinnaman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The future of law enforcement - NOT!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It must be made clear that before we go any further, controversial Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven's 1987 sci-fi hit, "Robocop," is one of the greatest movies ever made. It's my sixth favorite movie of all time and I've watched the movie way past the point of memorization; I simply can't get enough of it. And then I heard there was going to be a remake. I've been against a remake ever since I first heard of one, and today those feelings have been confirmed when, by pure chance, a decision was made by me to watch Jose Padilha's 2014 remake, not-so-creatively titled "RoboCop." For anyone who would listen, I've ranted and complained for a little over a year on social media (Facebook) regarding my feelings on this matter. The story is much different here, but not in a good way. First it's rated "PG-13," the relentless graphic violence and satire of Verhoeven's original is nowhere to be found here (in spite of a few light chuckle moments). Joel Kinnaman is good at bringing the character of Alex Murphy/Robocop to life and conveys a sense of pathos necessary for the character, but beyond that, he's no Peter Weller (whose performance in the original is one of the most skillful, and nuanced, dramatic screen performances ever by an actor, period). Despite a few creative flourishes here &amp; there (those massive ED-209 robots - oh, my!, and the supporting performances of Michael Keaton and Jackie Earle Haley) and a shoot-out down the darkened corridors of a crime lord's hideout (which quickly resembles a first-person shooter video game) - and the film's laugh-out-loud-worthy final scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson - "Robocop" is mostly a disappointment, yet another excellent example of an unneeded remake of a classic picture. Just do yourself a favor, and play it safe by watching Paul Verhoeven's original 1987 "Robocop."4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even plenty of talent can't save this train wreck of a script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have very high expectations prior to this movie. Basically, I wanted to see some cool action sequences and a decent story. I had some hopes since I really liked the Samuel Jackson sequences from the trailers that made it seem like they were trying to build this rich world with plenty of depth. Unfortunately, the trailers were overselling the final product.After a somewhat promising start where we're getting a very quick introduction to the world Robocop plays in, we're following the protagonist Alex Murphy. The movie seems to take its time telling you more about his character, however, he makes a bad decision that suddenly turns his life upside down. The resulting grief seemed like a great reason to give the character a solid background and set up a transformation, but alas, it's never going to happen.While the character _does_ transform in a very "technical" sense, he doesn't seem to grow as a person. We are then watching roughly 30 minutes of his recovery, which aren't exactly horrible, but at the same time leave you wanting since this is not what you came for. It's far from being popcorn cinema and it also can't be considered good drama since there is simply too little happening.Shortly after, you start wondering if there will ever be a build-up in this movie. Like if there's some gigantic threat / villain that Robocop will have to fight? Let me save you your money by telling you up front that there simply isn't. There were plenty of opportunities, though. Jackie Earle Haley has a somewhat commanding presence most of the times he enters the screen, but with what felt like less than 15 minutes screen time, it's not exactly like you're feeling too threatened by this "villain". Or like he's "established". The other antagonists suffer from different problems; either they only start turning against Robocop 20 minutes before the end of the movie or they are not threatening in any way.In the end, you are left wanting since it's hard to tell what exactly happened in this movie. When you're trying to measure the emotions of someone who's sat through this movie, you'll see a flat-line since there's so little to get excited about... Considering that there are so many talented actors involved, this caused us to leave the cinema feeling extremely disappointed. It's far from being the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not even solid entertainment because it falls flat on so many levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are things that this movie didn't do so well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of things about this film that are done well. The actors, Michael Keaton, Abby Cornish, Jackie Earle Haley, etc... were just fine. Joel Kinnaman wasn't terrible and the director handled the script well enough. The big problem lies in the script and the "pointing everything out" aspect of the film. So before I go into that, I want to say that I like the silver suit and I like the fact that the kid actor was used for just the right amount of time. What didn't work for the film was it's antagonist. Rather than having Dick Jones, the ED-209, and Clarence Boddicker, we got a weak bad guy with the typical "corporations, fox news, and war are bad" line. They had Samuel L Jackson in the film to be a parody of fox news and it didn't really match the rest of the film. The corporate environment felt like a cartoon written by Ted Turner, and the police department had no soul. What kept the movie working was Gary Oldman and the Family story. I'd say rent it rather than see it in theaters.</fullReview>

I did not want this movie and you did not warn me that I will watch this movie. Someone has decided to use lofty thought and philosophy? This is contradictory and absurd at the same time. If concept was to get something more than a good action - did not work. Even in this kind of movie, the main messages were not met and it did not fit.

		<fullReview>First thing first: i'm a huge fan of the original Robocop. It was one of the most significant, critical and powerful action movie of the eighties, so maybe because of that i'm very critical at this reboot but here's my opinion... The "new" Robocop lacks almost everything that the original delivered. It's like a "superhero" reboot (Robocop now is more similar to Iron Man than the original, slow, robotic Peter Weller),it lacks the inner struggle that Weller delivered in the Paul Verhoeven flick. The new protagonist Joel Kinnaman appears uninspired,he does the job but that's all: there's no energy in his role, there's no struggle, there's no Robocop... The "evil guy" in the movie is ridiculous, the Clarence Boddicker of the original could eat him alive... At the end i'm not satisfied with this reboot. Maybe the director wanted to make a movie that could criticize the USA politic of war but the only good message in the movie is the performance of a good Gary Oldman, that's all. Not too much, after all... 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone uncertain about a remake of such an iconic film will quickly discover this latest outing packs a mighty punch right from the start!Based on the original story, Robocop 2014 has had a critical upgrade. As well as fast moving action aplenty which Robofans old and new will expect and enjoy, the storyline also touches on contemporary issues of the day, not least the use of drones and machines in conflict zones and the fight against crime. With a meld of man and machine, it also raises questions of how free-will and computer programming will interact.Joel Kinnaman gives a steely performance as Alex Murphy who confronts all-comers in his stride. (In this case, his 'stride' is quite noisy and rather intimidating). Gary Oldman is excellent as the somewhat conflicted Doctor Norton who is behind the creation. (Could there be any significance in that choice of name?) Michael Keaton gives a totally convincing portrayal of the Head of OmniCorp, a man who would have us believe that his only motivation is to make the world a safer place. Yeah, right! Meanwhile, Samuel L. Jackson's Pat Novak has his finger on the pulse throughout with timely news updates, giving the feeling of a fast moving story unfolding in real time.Older viewers may hark back to the more gentle times of the Six Million Dollar Man. Needless to say, this particular rebuild cost a lot more!Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An example of a remake well done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the movie as I always go into a movie, was pumped by the trailer and I've liked the original one. I walked out of this theaters satisfied with I've seen. I don't think the movie is flawless by any means, but I think really in terms of remake it goes beyond the general idea of remake to become something unique unlike the Carrie remake. I thought the new Carrie was solid, very solid but it really is just an update of the original at the end but it's still enjoyable probably will be a classic for the new generation. Now RoboCop. Let me start with some of the complaint I have. First of they didn't the RoboCop theme enough in my opinion, you hear at the beginning of the movie (my blood just pumped with excitement at this point), in one other scene and that's it. I was hoping may be not for more but for the first song at the credit but they put another song at the roll of the credit. The villains seem weak. I guess because they put much emphasis on the Murphy situation that at the climax with the human bad guys, hmmm yeah it was weak. The training part of RoboCop could have been shorter in my opinion too. Also there is one scene where RoboCop busted into some bad guy factory that could have been better if the movie was rated R, but it's still entertaining. Now the good parts of it. The intro of the movie before the title screen, very well done with Sam Jackson as this brainwashed journalist pro robot, rather pro Omnicorp. It criticizes the morality of the way science could be used in military, very relevant in today's age. The title screen. Then we're going in Detroit where we see the case Alex Murphy is investigating which lead to the fatal explosion. This was handle well, it's the standard cop movie at that point, solid. I think it gives us substance to Murphy, we see his family, we care about them, I felt sorry for his beautiful wife and kid. It is one portion well done in this movie,his family. Let's face it we didn't care that much about Murphy family in the first or second film, they were just used as a plot device. Here no, his wife and kid plays a big role in the movie with them out of it RoboCop is not Alex Murphy. The idea of the movie is to put a human in a machine, a machine that would make the moral decision and I liked that. Murphy' situation is not one of the best, after the explosion he suffers from 4 degree burns in 80% of his body, not pretty. That's when Omnicorp chose him to be part of the RoboCop program so Michael Keaton's character could help his society expands his market in the U.S. fearful of robot in the street. They put Murphy's body, the very little rest of him, in a cyborg suit and implant his brain with a program containing diverse cop tools and security safeguard to keep him in check. RoboCop possess great action scenes, coupled by a good narrative. The story is about Murphy holding on to his humanity despite all this technology in him, this paid off at the end. I was cheering for RoboCop to prove them that it wasn't just a robot especially at the end. The performances are very great, everybody is his part. I even found the actor playing Murphy to old its own against the other A list actors. This reimagination on the myth of RoboCop is more that you could imagine, and I'm rooting for sequel on this one, merit one. I was really impressed at how actually good it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "RoboCop", starring Joel Kinnaman-born in Sweden but you might have seen him in The Killing-t.v., Safe House; Gary Oldman-The Dark Knight movies, Lost in Space-1998; Michael Keaton-The Other Guys, Batman-1989; Abbie Cornish-Seven Psychopaths, Sucker Punch and Samuel L. Jackson-Django Unchained, Die Hard: With a Vengeance.First of all, this is a reboot, not a sequel. It takes place in the not too distant future of 2028, in Detroit. Samuel plays a television personality that opens the movie by explaining how the United States' robot technology has made the World safer; that is, safer every where but here in the good old U.S. of A., where the American people are afraid of the robots and flying drones-imagine that. Michael plays the head of the company that builds these robots and makes a hefty profit at it, I might add. He really wants to expand into the states but the people are just too afraid. Gary plays a brilliant doctor that works with people that are amputees; he replaces their missing limbs with mechanical arms, legs, etc. Michael decides that if he can combine a man and a robot, the people will go for it. Along comes Joel, a dedicated police officer that gets mangled in an explosion-someone tried to kill him because he was just too dedicated-and he is just perfect for the job of becoming the first half man, half robot police officer that will further line Michael's pockets. Abbie plays Joel's wife. There is a lot of action, mostly gun battles, and you also get a look see at what is underneath the robot shell of RoboCop-they show you what is actually left of his human body. I did hear a song in the soundtrack that I haven't heard in quite a while, 'Hocus Pocus' by a group called Focus. This is also the first RoboCop movie to be shown in IMAX-and yes, that is the version that I saw it in. It's rated "PG-13" for intense violence-including lots of gun battles- language and some drug material and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 48 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tin man with no heart does, oh, who cares? Revisit the original instead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The immediate question with Robocop (2014) is: Is it as good as Robocop (1987)? The quick answer: NO! The original was silly but it was different, audacious and plenty of fun. RoboCop (2014) will entertain the youngsters who have no knowledge of Paul Verhoeven's futuristic sci-fi shoot 'em up but some things are best left alone. Oh, this is not in the same league as the Coen brothers' rare turkey, their remake of The Ladykillers, but a bigger budget and more star power can't elevate this to the realms of intelligent sci-fi flicks like Minority Report. It remains little more than a B-movie western set in a 2028 Detroit instead of the Wild West.When OmniCorp boss Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) realizes that public opinion won't allow machines to patrol the streets of America, despite the primetime rallying of TV host Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson ? no, NOT Laurence Fishburne, Sam Ruben!), he tasks his research master, Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) with putting a man inside the machine to fight crime. Meanwhile, detective Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is on the trail of bent cops and corruption in the city when he finds himself all over his front lawn as somebody blows his car up. With his bits and pieces (a sequence early on reveals exactly which pieces) and Norton's technology, it's a match made in technological heaven and RoboCop is born.RoboCop makes more sense than Pacific Rim but that isn't saying a great deal. There are some odd moments when director Jos Padhila aims to moralize about the state of America but it's not really clear whether he believes the pro-America propaganda that Novak spouts or if he's clumsily aiming for irony. The messages throughout are mixed and RoboCop seems to trip up on its own rules, which permit the existence of such a man/machine on American streets. It's probably best if you mentally switch off when anyone utters a line containing words of more the two syllables.There are a few shootouts to enjoy and plenty of digital effects to marvel at but there's little here to stand out from other pure entertainment flicks and it feels like an awkward movie dumped on the world as a mindless change from the worthy award contenders. Better that it does passable business in a cold, flooded February than sinks without trace amongst the summer's heavy hitters.Way back, I recall kids wandering around playgrounds emulating Peter Weller's head-then-body turn and quoting lines ("Your move, creep."). It's unlikely that Kinnaman's rendition will come close to iconic status and RoboCop is destined to become one of those movies you vaguely recall seeing some time ago but made little impression on? oh, look, it's still raining.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine, The original robocop film being a man, named Alex Murphy. Now imagine that WE, the audience, are a part of Alex's brain. Hollywood would be OCP(the company that creates robocop)and decides the original Alex is dead thus all his organs should be replaced with a new and "improoved" 2014 remake. Now, that robocop 2014 is alive, we the audience exist as Alex's conscience and past life memory, while watching helplessly through the eyes of a mechanical suit we see a lifeless portrait of what once was. A robotic voice is talking back to us, it's the OCP'S software telling us there's no where to go, saying: "Dead or a live, you're coming with me!" flashbacks of memory from a dramatic and sens-full past life appear and we struggle to understand... what went wrong?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent remake that delivers what it's supposed to ? fun, sleek and modern action sequences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And this writer thought he needn't be reminded of that disturbing scene in director Paul Verhoeven's 1987 movie. Before the guy made the iconic Total Recall (1990) and Starship Troopers (1997), he gave the world Robocop. The movie has often been mentioned in media as one of the most violently traumatising action flicks ever. How the protagonist Alex Murphy was brutally murdered remains one of the most talked about scenes in cinema history. Don't even get us started on how a villain slowly dissolves to death after being drenched in toxic waste.Call this reviewer a coward, but these scenes freaked the hell out of him. After all, he was only a six year old kid then. But hey, it didn't stop him from pestering his parents to get an uber cool action figure from the nearest toy shop.With this remake directed by Brazilian filmmaker Jose Padilha (Elite Squad), this columnist is pretty sure he can sit through the 121 production without flinching, especially when it's a PG13 movie with the consumer advice "Violence &amp; Brief Coarse Language". In this day and age of movie making, it's all about maximixing profits with impressive box office returns, man.There's not much you need to know about the plot, really. In 2028 Detroit, Alex Murphy is a loving husband, father and good cop. After being critically injured in a car explosion, a multinational conglomerate OmniCorp sees a chance to create part man, part robot police superhero. Cue themes regarding media, corruption, authorisationism, capitalism and human nature. But why get yourself all confused with this academia issues? You want an enjoyable action movie? You've got one right here.Padilha knows better than to get Robocop all moped up with emotions. After a short introduction, Alex Murphy gets hurt and is all ready to suit up in his uber cool outfit. From there, expect adrenaline filled action sequences. You want car chases? Check. What about gun fights? Yup, they're in place. A finale showdown between Robocop and massive machines? Don't even get us started on that. This movie is pure popcorn fun, that's for sure.Fans of the original will find themselves going through a checklist of comparisons, but while this geeky behaviour is somewhat respectable, we are advising that you don't do so because you'd be missing out on what the remake is set out to do ? an entertaining two hours in the cinema.The supporting actors are on form here. Besides the reliable Abbie Cornish (Seven Psychopaths), Jay Baruchel (The Sorcerer's Apprentice) and James Earle Haley (Little Children), we had fun watching Gary Oldman (Sirius Black!), Michael Keaton (Batman!), and Samuel L Jackson (Mace Windu!) portraying a righteous researcher, a shady businessman and a TV host respectively.Unfortunately, our leading man Joel Kinnaman (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) pales in comparison next to his co stars. The 34 year old actor isn't all that bad, but just doesn't hold his own ground. This isn't a major flaw though, because all we want is for him to go shoot some baddies in his Robocop persona. And yes, this writer's got that impulse to go out there to get some action figures again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A colossal miscalculation . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of Robocop is a colossal miscalculation. I'm all for remakes that change up the original material, but this movie does it in such a way as to drain all the juice out of the material until we are left with a dull, boring, lifeless bag of sand. Let's put it this way, that last thing we need from Robocop is pathos.Paul Verhoven's 1987 classic was a brutally funny satire on the 21st century, a future run by corrupt corporations and roving street gangs that kill at will. It was painted in broad strokes and presented, appropriately, as a living breathing comic book, an ultraviolent black comedy in which you laughed at just how over-the-top and silly the whole thing was. The creators of that film understood that the idea of reviving a dead police officer and refitting him with cybernetics to make him tougher was a ridiculous concept, and they kept their film at that level.The trouble with the remake is that it treats this material with sobering seriousness and attempts to give the film an emotional payoff. Think about that: They want an emotional payoff from a story about a cybernetic cop! There's a scene where RoboCop comes home and his son tells him that "I taped all the Red Wings games so we could watch them together." I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.The story you know: Alex Murphy (played this time by Swedish actor Joel Kinneman) is a good cop in a bad city who does his best to remove the city's latest criminal element. In doing so, he is killed in the line of duty. Instead of letting him die with dignity, Ray Sellars (Michael Keaton), the head of the multinational Omnicorp, decides to use him as a guinea pig for an experiment in robotic law enforcement. Alex was badly injured in an explosion (in the original he was shot to pieces) and all that remains are his head, brain, lungs, and for some reason, his right hand - not an arm - just a hand! The rest of his body is made of metal. Sellars gives the job to a brilliant robotics engineer named Dennett Norton played by Gary Oldman in a heartfelt performance that the movie doesn't really call for.When we see Murphy, his only flesh is the face that sticks out of that helmet. We know that he can never be all human anymore. We understand that having a normal home life would be nearly impossible, but the screenwriters painfully attempts to build a relationship between Murphy and his wife Clara (Abbie Cornish) and their son Daniel (John Paul Ruttan). He's 95% metal, so having an intimate bond is not a possibility anymore. That makes the attempts to connect with this family not only painful to watch, but also kind of pointless. This may be the only time I might have welcomed a deus ex machina.Aside from the mishandled emotional stuff, RoboCop tries to address Alex's dual identity. Where does the brain stop and the machine begin? Yes, he can take down criminals with the greatest of ease, but that's also the problem. He's so good at shooting criminals and not taking damage that it renders all of the action scenes boring and repetitive. The drama ? outside of the family stuff ? is suppose to come from Alex's struggle to keep what is left of his humanity even as the nasties at OmniCorp determine to rend it away from him. But that becomes the fulcrum of the movie, and it's not much of a fulcrum. What is he fighting against? We are told that Detroit is a cesspool of urban decay but from our perspective the city looks thriving and beautiful.The original frequently interrupted the action with silly commercials and news broadcasts. Here it's all whittled down to an O'Reilly Factor-style news show called The Novak Element, hosted by Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson) who reports on the progress of Robocop and the senate hearings to shut down the program that created him. Jackson's presence in the movie is welcomed, but it seems to be in the wrong movie. He speaks and comments in a way that the other characters in the movie do not making you wonder if his scenes were tacked on long after the movie was completed. His dialogue is such a mangled mess that I'm not 100% sure what side he's even on. Even his last lines are a head-scratcher.Look, a remake of Robocop is a bad idea anyway. The original was fine. The second film was underrated. The third film was unnecessary. Like many remakes is an overcooked, under-thought piece of commercial filmmaking put together by a committee who couldn't be bothered to figure out what made the original work. The feels less like a movie and more like an annuity in action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RoboCop, a remake of that genial 1987 killer-cyborg film of the same name, is a colossal disappointment, a incoherent mess that's saddled with a below-average script, lousy casting, and superficial performances. It's not as if the original movie was so awesome that no remake could ever compare; Peter Weller's RoboCop was a fun action movie with a budget on the lower end of the scale. But this 2014 redo lacks soul, wit, and a point.Cop Alex Murphy (Swedish actor Joel Kinnaman) works the nation's most violent city - Detroit, of course. He and his partner find out about large-scale corruption in their ranks. The big bad guy who's paying off the other cops gets wind of this discovery and has one of his henchman plant a bomb under Murphy's car. Car goes explodey, but does Murphy die? No, they can rebuild him. They have the technology.They, in this case, is OmniCorp, which is surely a kind, benevolent company that would never seek to profit off war-making machines. Anyway, when Murphy wakes up he's in the lab of one Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), who has constructed a sort of indestructible exoskeleton around what remains of Murphy's body. The idea is to have Murphy rejoin the police force and solve cases, which will make OmniCorp look like geniuses, and both generals and loose women will throw themselves at the company in gratitude.Murphy's suit (it's not really a suit) is equipped with all sorts of weaponry and the ability to access crime databases almost instantaneously. This makes it rather easy to collar the bad guys. But what about the bad guys who put Murphy in this state? That's when OmniCorp and the the Detroit police department get a little uneasy and tug their collars. Or perhaps they're just realizing how bad the movie's turned out.Michael Keaton, who was recently Oscar nominated for his work in Birdman, plays the head of OmniCorp, and he basically phones this one in. His character's motivations are to make money, damn the consequences, so maybe the part's not exactly multilayered. One can almost picture Keaton looking over the script, shrugging, and imagining what he'll do with the extra cash on hand. I mean, the guy's name is even Sellars, so Keaton had little to work with. Trouble is, someone of Keaton's acting caliber should have added a lot to a flat line of a character. Oldman, playing his chief scientist, fares no better. Dr. Norton seems like a nice guy who wants to do the right thing, but he lies to Murphy throughout the movie and frequently shows his discontent by sighing and shaking his head. The moral implications, man! Think of the moral implications! Jackie Earle Haley is on hand as an acerbic weapons guy working for Sellars, and again the character feels like a missed opportunity. Haley has shown plenty of charisma in previous roles, but here he's just the guy who doesn't trust Murphy the Cyborg Cop and treats him like dirt. Haley's Maddox is an unfunny jerk with an uncertain axe to grind. Samuel L. Jackson is the host of a pro-robotics TV program who pops up every now and then to wonder why we don't use robot soldiers in the U.S., like other countries do. Abbie Cornish, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and Jennifer Ehle fill the female roles; if it's any consolation, those roles are just as underwritten as the male ones are. Finally, gender equality! But two actors really stand out in the movie, and certainly not for good reasons. Jay Baruchel, best known for voicing Hiccup in the How to Train Your Dragon movies, is a marketing exec here. But it's really hard to take a business guy seriously when he sounds like he's still going through puberty. Marketers in movies are typically obnoxious, but Baruchel can't even bring the expected (and necessary) level of bluster and crass abrasiveness to the role. He's just annoying. Worst of them all, though, is Kinnaman as Alex Murphy. Kinnaman, perhaps best known for not being Peter Weller, brings little presence to the lead role - no poise, no attitude, no hubris, no nothing. He plays Murphy in such a one-dimensional manner that you'll think you've slipped into an entire universe altogether. (Probably one in which casting a block of wood in a major action movie makes sense.) Kinnaman is in over his head, and essentially his cast can't pick up the slack. There's too much slack. In fact, the entire movie (written by Joshua Zetumer, Edward Neumeier, and Michael Miner, the latter two who co-wrote the original film) is slack.There's plenty of blame to go around for this debacle. Sure, it's a remake, and people rarely expect much out of them. But director Jose Padilha turns in a product that seems to be poorly executed from the ground up. The characters are badly realized sketches on a cocktail napkin. The effects, while updated from 1987, aren't anything to write home about. Every time I saw Kinnaman on screen, I was reminded of Mark Metcalf's character from Animal House, not Peter Weller in RoboCop or even Dustin Hoffman in Outbreak. And while the image of the original movie isn't tarnished (since comparatively few saw this remake/reboot anyway), there seems to be no need for more films in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure nonsense and a waste of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is typical as with the new generation of HollyWEIRD junk movies. Another remake attempt and yet another failure. What is really dumbfounding, is in the age of perfect CGI and visual effects, advanced technology all across the board, and expansion of knowledge, they are actually making WORSE movies at a continuously declining rate. Is this being done on purpose to dumb people down even more? Most movies are now gauged at middle school aged children, because that is the biggest market for movies these days. This is why movies are literally becoming more ignorant and useless by the day. They aim only to give a quick thrill to school children to make profit by any means necessary. HollyWEIRD has clearly run out of originality and creativity, as 1/4 of the movies coming out are ridiculous remakes. The entire industry is hindering the young generations, and dumming them down, purposely. Keep this movie and others like it away from your children! Please! Just watching the main character is incredibly annoying and frustrating. Everything he does is entirely predictable, with the typical added over dramatic nonsense which is only more annoying to a person of intelligence. So much DRAMATIZING! Watching movies now is just stressful! It's one scene of over dramatic nonsense after another after another. Don't watch this movie. Spare yourself the loss of 100 minutes out of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Remake, Who Knew.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start by saying that I am a huge fan of the original Robocop, both 1 &amp; 2 (3 was terrible) so when I heard that they were remaking it, I was pretty mad, so saying that, I was sure they were going to mess it up, but to my amazement, they made an alright movie. Is it as good as the original, NO! But it is a decent movie, so lets talk about what they got right. First off was the cast, the guy they got to play Robocop was very adequate, but it is the rest of the cast that does all the heavy lifting on the acting end. Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Keaton all give very good performances, plus the rest of the cast is fine too. The story was not quite as edgy as the original, but I did like all the modern updates they did, such as CCTV in his head with all the police files of outstanding cases, and the bike and weapon, but not the black, I prefer the traditional silver. They also did a good job with the action, and the family angle worked for what it was. This is far from a perfect movie, but I was surprisingly entertained and liked it overall. 3.5 Beards Out Of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Succeeds in not being terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's strange that we live in a time when a reboot of a classic genre franchise or character is considered a success by not being awful and ROBOCOP isn't awful so it's being considered a success! The original ROBOCOP was an exciting piece of action, social commentary and religion, this film is not that and fails to be everything the original was. But if we look past the original and take this for what it is, it's just a dumb action film with some okay to look at sequences that thinks it's a lot smarter than it is. Look past whenever it tires to make a moral statement, the fact that RoboCop isn't really that much of a hero (a problem in a lot of modern 'hero' films), and that some characters keep on making strange 180's on their views and how they feel (feels like a lot of scenes were cut out explaining this possibly). Look past all that and you will probably have a pretty okay time watching what's more of a modern FPS video game adaptation than a new ROBOCOP, but you'll never have a better time than okay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm giving it a 3, as it was largely a wasted opportunity - and with the original being so iconic, it needed a lot more than this remake offered.Reading more about this, it looks like the studio pressed for a low rating, and overrode a lot of the Directors ideas.And unfortunately, this shows throughout the film - hell, even the animated version of Robocop was better than this.The big names - Keaton and Jackson are largely wasted, and Jacksons role is more annoying than satirical, and Keaton doesn't really come across as a big bad CEO.But the really big problem is the lack of a villain. The original had Clarence Bodicker, whereas this one just lacks any kind of villain - and when Robocop does get his revenge, there's no challenge.Same with the drug factory. In the original this was a standout piece - in this version it's just ride in on the bike and game over.And where was the Murphy/Lewis partnership ? And why make Lewis a guy in this version ? Disappointing and shows why studio executives shouldn't interfere in the creative process.</fullReview>

I was adequately entertained. it just could have been better all the way around. And like another reviewer said, this new, updated version of Robocop doesn't compare to the original.

Its not bad - Too many people are hating on the film, but it is Sub-Par for the budget spent on it - The story is held together in many aspects by threads.It could have been so much better... Oh!

Little following of the original storyline. This one is truly a wast of time, film, and money. There are a few special effects that are good, and occasional actor performances too.

		<fullReview>Robocop isn't a great movie, but its a serviceable action thriller, especially for a February release. The movie does a lot right, including all the emotional scenes. It also does portray Robocop as a futuristic Batman with just a robotic body. I didn't see the original films so I cant compare the quality of them but I will say its a fun movie at times. The action sequences are different but also nothing out of the ordinary. Gary Oldman, Samuel L Jackson, and even Michael Keaton help the film move along but Joel Kinnaman wasn't the best lead. As with Aaron Taylor Johnson in Godzilla, I can see the actor has the chops to be a future lead in cinema but it may take time.Like I said, I think this film did a great job in writing the emotional scenes. The wife and son were devastating to watch, especially when they are waiting for him to walk out to the public, and he doesn't say a word to him. If this type of future is ahead of us then I hope to god the treatment they give these half robot half cops are much better.The film also lacks a true villain. Even if a film has some twists like this one does, then I would still hope that a real villain steps forward to be the face of evil for the film. The story isn't that compelling but I think this would be the way to do a Cyborg movie. The character is relatively similar but the emotional impact of when he first turns into a Robot is exactly how I would want the emotional impact with Cyborg and his father being at fault. This is a decent film that could have been helped by a better script and directing. But definitely an entertaining flick.+Supporting cast+Emotional scenes hit the way they are suppose to+Example of how to do Cyborg-no true villain-action sequences are nothing unique6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Remake Gone Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am giving this movie a 2 instead of a 1 because it was at the least popcorn fair. I have too many problems with this film to go into great detail. However, for starters, Robocop looks more like the Black Ninja from GI Joe. The attempt to remake the film is a complete rip-off of the original and just looks like all the other action films of recent. The fact that they changed the story around just to get it out the door wasn't well appreciated either, no more than the remake of Total Recall. I can't help wondering who's running the show anymore. It's like the folks in Hollywood have lost all creativity and imagination. The story was shallow and the characters were cardboard cutouts of the original cast. Another complaint about Robo was the decision to leave one hand human. Why??? His entire body was supposedly destroyed, yet his one hand managed to escape the damage of the blast that put him in his position. Furthermore, another issue that comes to question is his face. Again, this Robocop came to be as a result of an explosion when he opens his car door. Some how his face, along with one hand are miraculously preserved while the rest of his body is so damaged and burned that a robotic cybernetic suit is the only way to save him. Come on!!! The original Robocop gave you the true sense that he was robotic with quite reasonable acting from Peter Weller. This guy is super ninja as he leaps tall buildings in a single bound in his now black and sleek robo-suit. I guarantee that this is another film among so many today that will soon be forgotten by all and will not get attention again. I'm not saying don't see the film. What I am saying is don't spend a lot doing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 2028 and Americans are okay with robots keeping the peace and protecting citizens of the overseas country they are in. There is a cry to have robots in the US, but ones that exhibit some compassion and know right from wrong so that they don't kill a child who is holding a knife in his hands and is not a threat. Detective Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) almost dies from a car bomb, but he is rebuilt and becomes Robocop.Peter Weller: Where are you? Look what they did to your song? A real pity. (Peter Weller was the star of the original Robocop in 1987)The first hour of this movie is all about getting Alex tuned in to become Robocop. I thought this would be more of a psychological "thriller" than what we were expecting. But, as it turns out, this is more of a political agenda: some want robots in the US and some do not. Yes, yes, there is the question of drones in the US too. Also in the first hour we get dialogues that seemed to be within a dream sequence. Not good. It was almost as like they were rehearsing lines but with no conviction, passion, or purpose. See?The 2nd half has Robocop doing his thing, but he becomes too unemotional and the only thing on his mind is solving crimes. His wife Clara (Abbie Cornish) is shut out and she is the only one who shows true emotions. Everyone else is still in that dream sequence. She is very pretty btw, and we hope we see more of her in other movies. Can't wait. Joel Kinnaman may have been miscast. There was no pull for him. We didn't like him. The writers didn't endear him to us. Maybe it was their fault. (go ahead, blame the writers). Hey, this is a remake of a classic and one would think everyone would be on top of their game and make this better. Didn't happen. Pity.The shoot-outs were not very good yadda, yadda, yadda. See? Same old thing. And, they ran too long. So what was good? Well, the CGI (not for shooting sequences) was very good, and, of course Abbie Cornish.Samuel L. Jackson as TV news- journalist Pat Novak must have been in his Heaven as he got to bellow, harangue and bark to keep up the political theater the country was immersed in. Now, you may think I am criticizing Mr. Jackson, but I am not. This is his shtick and he is very good at it. So there!Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman were under-used and took on passive roles that didn't amount to anything. They were a so-so supporting cast. Mr. Weller: They could have used you. This really needed help. (3/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb by Samuel L Jackson. Some soft stuff, but not much of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has no heart, no soul, like one character claims of Murphy, it's just a "Tin-man"; a shell of a movie that has nothing beneath its skin.The movie utterly fails to deliver upon the promise of the original. While the original is a flawed movie it does manage to achieve some pure moments that demand the viewer's attention. Robocop 2014 is more polished than the original but is sterile and unconvincing.Gone is the gratuitous violence of the original. In its place is violence so softened that it loses all gravity. Robocop 2014 resembles a video game, there's no real sense of danger to the main character, no power behind the machine that is "cleaning up" crime, just a sterile movie where everything falls into place and no one is left offended. I'm not trying to say that gratuitous violence is always appropriate, but in order to create a sense of how dangerous the Detroit of Robocop 2014 is there needs to be a real sense that violence is out of control. Only a city that has become a warzone could put a robot on the streets. The original showcased the dangers of Detroit perfectly in the pursuit on the highway in broad daylight. An American city where there's a roaming gun battle between police and a crime syndicate hits home pretty hard. The viewer is made keenly aware that crime is so out of control that it blatantly challenges the authorities without fear. Robocop 2014 doesn't have anything like that; thus the viewer is left unfulfilled in understanding the danger posed to the citizens.Gone is any cleverness in the satire. While the original's satire wasn't brilliant it was still clever enough to illicit a knowing laugh from someone who was really paying attention. Robocop 2014 removes this cleverness for heavy handed, ham-fisted scenes from Samuel Jackson. Jackson only has one speed in his acting, and his scenes grow tiresome quickly. There's nothing subtle about anything Jackson does in his career and his performance here is more of the same. His portrayal of a sensationalist journalist could have been a great addition to the movie. Instead it's too heavy handed and unoriginal.Gone is a true villain. How they missed this aspect of the movie I don't understand. The three "bad guys" are composed of 1) A mob guy who is under developed and cast aside pretty quickly 2) a guy who's just a jerk, and 3) A guy who I'm not sure ever actually committed a crime. The original was carried by two great performances by the villains, they ground the movie and help establish the sense of pervasive danger that I mentioned before. RoboCop 2014 just has a couple of guys who you don't like, but who aren't really bad guys. The only true bad guy is so under developed that I almost forgot he existed while writing this review. This is the guy who is bringing Detroit to its knees? Yawn...Gone is any semblance of character development. The original RoboCop had a really great closing line and helped wrap the whole movie up and left the viewer with some closure and hope. RoboCop 2014 just ends. Murphy's development is stunted (at best), you don't know if he's made any real progress. His development is handled haphazardly, he starts off in good shape, slides backwards, moves forward, then back, and then the final ten minutes of action takes place and you don't get a good understanding of where he is emotionally. The original provided a steadier progress in Murphy's development, slowly but surely the wall is chipped away. In Robocop 2014 you never get this feeling of progress, stuff happens but it doesn't really seem to matter.Overall this is an action movie for the 21st century. Soulless, heartless, inoffensive, boring, and built to maximize profit. Again, the original is a flawed movie, but RoboCop 2014 is not an improvement and in almost every meaningful way is a step backwards. Some movies should not be family friendly and this is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Growing up I was a big fan of the Robocop movies as well as the Robocop series. So it was one of the anticipated movies for me. I was purely disappointed with this reboot. First thing I disliked was the black suite Robocop wore. It was a terrible idea to make the suite black instead of original silver which made Robocop look like a hybrid version of Dredd. Also babbling about an hour on Robocop training scenes made the movie more boring. Also their were poor choice of casting. Robocop having human feeling made it even worse. Couldn't watch the movie more than an hour. Hope there is no sequels for this movie. If there is another movie it should be R Rated with a Robocop with no human feelings, just like the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The - intended - reboot is overall a big failure. The encompassing theme of Security Vs. Freedom was already a challenging one but they aimed too high with that since they weren't able to deliver on the basic goods: sharpness and action.It is fine to have Samuel L. Jackson doing a show as a pundit, but is that really well integrated with the movie? Once we get to Murphy he looks bland and his first scenes are horribly written. And the movie only really starts after one hour.The action scenes are not really impressive: they only achieve to look like dumb noisy and messy shootouts that don't really get better as they pile up (training, run into small-time villain, run into big villain).The fine ideas, the fine performances (by Gary Oldman mainly) are too much scattered over the whole quagmire to say the movie somewhat succeeds despite its flaws and the risks taken not to be a dumb actioneer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake is OK, but one of the finest director Jos Padilha (who took Elite Squad) should have done far better than this. Imo, there isn't one memorable villain character here due to horrible story telling. There are some good talents like Keaton, Oldman and SL Jackson in the crew but not so properly used by the director. The movie is quite entertaining (i must admit esp. the fight/shooting scene at the dark room) and some finest CGI but is highly predictable for a revenge movie. Jackson's character at the beginning was nice but gets very artificial at the end. No proper refection is given by the director how the Robocop's system overrides certain protocols programmed in it, which is a plot-hole.Bottom line : A movie only for pleasure movie goers and younger audiences who love action flicks with impressive CGI. The first 10 minutes were really cool but it ain't after that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardly the cinematic blasphemy it could have been, this update is miles behind the '87 classic, but better than the wretched part 2 and pathetic part 3. After years of being soiled by bad sequels and terrible TV, the RoboCop brand was hardly on the pedestal as untouchable material, so a reboot or remake or whatever they want to call it should certainly not stimulate the gag reflex. This film starts off strong enough with a decent 'pacification' sequence in Tehran where suicide bombers attack the robots that are policing them. However, our intro to Alex Murphy as our soon to be doomed hero, is sloppy and the chemistry generated between him and his wife is about as hot as an arctic chill. The way these two look at each other before love making seems like they met an hour ago in a bar. But well written family drama is not why we go to see a RoboCop movie, we want to see Murphy eviscerated quickly and get put in that Robo suit and lay waste to vile scum in his usual violent fascist ways. The images and effects of what's left of Murphy's body after a car blast is very well done and provide what little emotion this film has. The programming of the robo suit and getting Murphy ready for a media blitz is handled with enough care that while not compelling material - it's interesting to watch. Then he's let loose on the streets and the film almost immediately goes on auto-pilot. The corporate characters inexplicably become pure evil and Murphy solving his murder is an afterthought that packs zero punch. It's this stage of the film that obviously has the scarring of studio interference. The story is then reduced to a simple evil CEO bent on killing RoboCop, complete with a rooftop hostage scene and all the non-evil, but suddenly evil characters there as well. It's clear at some stage in development, the solving his own murder plot was trimmed to a couple of scenes to expand the story to the evil corporate nonsense. So, at about the hour the mark this film could have headed in any number of directions, but instead goes down a very generic route that seemed to have ripped out the last 65 pages of the script and was cobbled together by a committee. The film also sits uncomfortably between kids fare and trying to make a statement on drones, foreign policy and capitalism and freedom. The result is a film not exactly for kids, but too simplistic in its ideas for adults. At the end of the day, this new RoboCop is entertaining enough, even though you can practically see the exact frame the narrative takes a nosedive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original RoboCop is a cult classic. A satirical action film taking a hard look on modern society, pleasing both the intellectuals and the adrenaline junkies. RoboCop, the remake, on the other hand is aimed more for the said junkies. It sort of tries to be satirical with Samuel L. Jackson doing a talk show host routine about the issues of robotics and their effect on society, but it feels forced. Like it's only there because the original movie was a satire and thus this remake needs to give the style a passing nod.Furthermore, the acting isn't as strong. Both Jackson and Gary Oldman are superb actors, but the script doesn't give them much to work with. And they're not in the main roles, which lessens their impact. Not to say that Joel Kinnaman, the RoboCop himself, is bad per se, but he's not Peter Weller. It's also baffling that they replaced Officer Anne Lewis (then played by Nancy Allen) with Officer Jack Lewis, a generic black best friend. Instead, the main female role was given to Clara Murphy (Abbie Cornish), the wife of RoboCop. And it just isn't as interesting.However, to the film's credit, the special effects update looks good and some of the aesthetics are very pleasing indeed. Can't say that I was terribly enthralled by the action scenes, but they weren't bad by any means. A bit generic perhaps, but they still delivered.I also must applaud the decision to change the story from the original. It starts out similar, but veers to a different direction pretty quickly, which made it more interesting to follow if you're a fan of the original like I was. I still prefer the 1987 version, but the 2014 one is above average, if only just.Should you see this one? Well, if you're a hardcore fan of the original, then I can't really promise you any improvements, aside from the special effects, but if you're just looking for an average scifi action film with a few good moments, then this might be right up your alley.</fullReview>

But if you remove the human common sense how good of an idea is it?Having not seen the original I cannot comment, although I tend to prefer originals than remakes. In terms of a viewing experience I cannot fault it in terms of visuals and actions scenes although the moral of the story was not given the gravity it deserves and thus I submit that it would have made a better psychological thriller as opposed to an action film.Nonetheless it is pleasantly watchable, albeit does not reach any highs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Misconception of Robots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robocop is one of these sci-fi movies that warn us about our future. Robocop's main idea is that if we've been able to create advanced robots in the future, we might not be able to control them. Robocop gives us the misconception that these robots might one day control us!The movie takes place in 2028 where cops in all countries are replaced by robots except America. America's government doesn't accept the idea that something that does not feel any guilt or remorse could be able succeed as a cop. They also claim that these robots would one day get out of control and start disobeying their orders.Raymond Sellers (Michael Keaton), the guy behind these robots, wants to find a solution to introduce his robots in America. He finally decides to get a man in control of the robot by making it half human, half robot. He searches for all human cops appropriate for this project till he finds the perfect man Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman).Alex Murphy, an injured cop, is not going to survive without fixing this robot to his body. After his wife's approval, Raymond Sellers orders his scientists to fix the robot to his body. The new Alex Murphy also known as Robocop becomes a huge success, and gets accepted as a cop in America.Alex starts to lose his humanity and starts to change into a complete robot. Raymond Sellers refuses to mention Alex's changes to the public, but Alex's family starts to get suspicious and claims that there's a problem in him.After many internal conflicts, Alex Murphy manages to return back to his real self. After realizing what Raymond's organization has done to him, he decides to get revenge. He kills him, kills the people responsible for his injury in the first place, and gets his beloved family back.We might one day in our future create a robot to replace cops, but it's a fantasy to say that these robots will one day develop a mind of its own and start doing what it wants. A robot is a robot whether we are in 2028 or 2014.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While this movie tries hard to entertain, it just simply falls flat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RoboCop is a remix of the original 1980s version. I have not seen the original, but I know that it's considered a classic. I mean, why else would they remake it? Today, my dad and I went to see the movie at matine. And after the movie ended, I'm kind of glad we didn't pay full price. This movie stars a cop named Alex Murphy. He's like your average everyday guy, until his car blows up, with him in blast radius. It's not just blast radius, it's "I open the car door and stick my head through the door" blast radius. After this happens, a group of scientists make him a robot body and use this body to help the cities be more safe. And then conflict ensues! I know the basic idea for this movie has been done before. It is a remake, after all. I just have to capitalize on how cool this premise. Having someone being placed in a robot body has always intrigued me, and this brought my fantasies to life. Thank you, movie, for doing that! I also like the special effects. There are first person scenes of RoboCop scanning, analyzing, and doing whatever killer robots do. These scenes are really cool and make it feel that you're actually staring through the eyes of a robot. All the other special effects look good, too. The gunfire, the robots; RoboCop's body armor looks epic. Visually, this movie looks stunning. I think the action scenes are pretty cool, too. They aren't very intense or thrilling, but they are cool looking. My favorite part of the movie was the night vision fight scene. So cool! However, there are only three fight scenes in the whole movie, which kind of capitalizes on the quality of the rest of the movie. My biggest problem with this movie is the characters themselves. While this movie is acted well, all the characters come off as flat, one-dimensional, and generally unlikeable. Not the main character, not his wife; not even Gary Oldman's character was very likable. When certain bad things happen to the characters, I would just be thinking, "I don't care that much." It makes the movie feel unpleasant. This movie also suffers from having too many characters. There are a lot of people in this movie, and very few of them are capitalized upon. In fact, there are a few characters that could've been taken completely out, and the movie would be no different. For example; Jay Baruchel. He's the marketer in the movie, and that's all we no about him. All he does in this movie is talk business. There's no need for him. The story, while fine, also feels like it drags. Somewhere around the middle of this movie, I start thinking, "where is this going?" It feels too long and a good portion of time could've been taken out completely and nothing significant would be altered. Finally, there is no specific "wow" moment of this movie. Sure, there are cool scenes, but none of them stand out. Not even the night vision fight scene, which, stated earlier, is my favorite part of the movie. But when I saw that scene, I thought, "this is cool" instead of "this is awesome". It's things like that that can lower your experience at the movies. Overall, RoboCop is alright. It's entertaining while it lasts, but there's nothing to ride home about. This is a movie where you see it once, find it entertaining, and then never see it again. Then, a few years down the road, that movie will randomly come to your mind, and then you'll question on if you saw it or not. It's worth one watch, sure, but don't pay full price. It's not worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie because a friend of mine said it was good. Well I was skeptical since I really was a fan of the 1st Robocop I was afraid that Hollywood was going to destroy the legacy of the original. Well they didn't really destroy the original because that took the premise but made a whole new movie. Aside from there being a once human cop turned into a Robocop this new installation is its own stand alone movie. They really came up with a whole new story. This I was thankful for. I didn't want it to be a frame by frame remake. If they had done that I would just go back and watch the original. But the problem is when they made these new changes it just didn't completely make for a good story. Action sequences were good. Acting was good for the most part. S. L. Jackson is just becoming a caricature of himself. Not sure what he added to this movie. So if you want a movie that is an OK action movie that you don't have to pay much attention to just sit and eat your popcorn and turn off your brain for a couple of hours here you go. This ones for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's kind of hard not to compare this movie to the original from 1987. It become such a classic and a hit. But Jos Padilha does a fairly good job of modernizing the movie and the look and feel of Robocop.Both versions still have political messages coursing through the movies. But this new version decides to focus more on the human aspect of the Robocop character. I think this was a smart decision. It was something that was lacking in the 1987 movie. Yes, it does become a typical, run-of-the-mill action movie. What do you expect about a cop that gets merged into a robot body? The action that it does have will keep you in your seat.

		<fullReview>ROBOCOPWhy oh why do people insist on remaking classic movies? Robocop is a film that should have never been remade. I did enjoy the movie? it was a lot of fun, but it was still heart breaking to see them destroy such an iconic movie.There were some very good things about this film, but also some bits that I really didn't like. Where should I start? OK, the bad first?The things that I didn't like about this film are just me personal preference? not really about the story itself. First of all? I hated the fact that when Alex Murphy woke up as Robocop, he had his old emotions and feelings. One of the main things I loved about the original was the fact that when Robocop woke up he was a robot. It took the whole film for him to realise who he used to be. The flashbacks etc? Alex should not have remembered everything straight away. I thought that was a bad change. Secondly? I hated the agility of Robocop. The scary thing about the old Robocop was that he never ran and didn't jump. He stalked his prey just like Michael Myers in Halloween. That is the intimidating thing. This Robocop ran fast and jumped over walls etc? it didn't feel right and I thought it ruined it slightly. Making this film a 12 rating was also a mistake. Robocop is a violent character and the criminals he is chasing are very violent? this whole film was watered down. They should have kept Robocop an adult character.The good things? The story is good. The action is very good. I loved the fighting scenes. I also loved the way Robocop was not invincible. He could get hurt just like the old character. They kept the original theme tune? I am not sure if this is a good thing or not. At first I thought it was great? but in another way I was trying to distance this film from the original so was a bit gutted.There are some cheesy lines in it? some are great, but there are some that are terrible. The worst one that was a complete face palm was when one guy said "I wouldn't buy that for a dollar." I hated that line and really wish they never put that in.The movie stars Joel Kinnerman as Robocop. Joel actually did a really good job considering the task he had. I think he is a really good actor and look forward to seeing what he bring in the future. Other cast members were Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson. Gary is a legend and did a fantastic job as always. I am a big Michael Keaton fan so was very happy to see him back on the big screen. He did a good job, but his character really was not enough of a bad guy. Dick Jones from the original was a brilliant bad guy. You really hated him, but unfortunately Michaels character was not hateable anywhere near as much. Samuel L. Jackson always does a good job, but Samuel L. Jackson always plays Samuel L. Jackson in every movie... and this is no exception. The only difference is this time he gets beeped out when his language goes all colourful.Good effects, good action, bad dialogue? all in all I did enjoy the movie but for some reason I can't explain, as soon as the credits started rolling I had a sense of disappointment.I will give this film 6 out of 10."What is bigger than a hero?"For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

Also some computer graphics were not so awesome. PC games has better animation in my opion. I didn't like when robocop was running or the action sequence with robots. Bit fake. The staccato movement of the robots was a copy from the original. But in the original I guess it was due to the SFX limitations when it was made.But for a simple action movie it's quite satisfying.

Now that I have seen the movie, I would say, not bad! The director kinda did a good job since it always draws the attention of the fans when an old, classic TV show or movie has been remade: either he screwed up and ruined the classic or made an amazing job that satisfies the old fans. I'd say he is in the middle. i saw the reviews before i went into the cinemas to watch the film, and i was worried that it might disappoint me, and i persuade my friends to watch this over an another film that is going on cinemas, so doubled anxiousness.... But surprisingly, it turns out the movie has a good story line, and one classic Hollywood ending which made my friends happy, and they even said they were surprised that the movie is pretty good actually. and i assume that the film is definitely going to have a sequel..... so to those who r still hesitating, I'd say go for it, you will not disappointed!!</fullReview>

It's sequel in 1990 followed up with lackluster reviews but still maintained the majority of traits that made the first one a hit. The third one in 1993 fell flat for everyone except for the few forgiving. Once that was over, fans and people in Hollywood alike were curious to when and if the beloved franchise would return. Well here it is and while it isn't bad, it does require some addressing on various elements.The basic plot is similar to the set up of 1987 version but instead of Alex J. Murphy just joining the police dept of Detroit, the audience will be brought in where he's been on the force for quite some time. After being almost killed from an explosion, Alex Murphy is reassembled as the future of law enforcement. But as Murphy soon finds out, things are not all that good. The backbone of this movie and the story is about corruption and how people can not be trusted no matter how nice they come across as. If there's one thing that fans will enjoy is all the tidbits that first time writer Joshua Zetumer included in the screenplay. The homage is definitely there. You want to see ED-209s? They're in there. You want to see that gun leg attachment RoboCop has? That's in there. You want to hear some of the memorable dialog from the first film? That's also sprinkled across the whole hour and forty-eight minutes too. But one of the things that fans may not agree with is the direction that the story took. Instead of RoboCop actually cleaning up crime in the city, there's lots of scenes dealing with getting used to the new Robo suite, training and setting out on a personal vendetta to find who brought him to near death. The issue of ridding crime is touched upon and a few arrests are made but that isn't the main focus of it. The Murphy family is what has the priority in this film and unfortunately it doesn't feel totally like a RoboCop movie. It should be noted that although it isn't the best decision, it is a direction that was at least fully addressed. Unlike before when it was lightly grazed upon in the first and half finished in the second film.For characters, the casted actors play the parts well, but I am getting tired of some of them. For example, I understand that Samuel L. Jackson is a very sought out actor, but to see him in almost every popular franchise gets obnoxious. He's not even a main character and he is seen way too much in this movie. Sam Jackson does not need to be in every movie to make it good - it's not necessary. Same goes for Gary Oldman, his character is particularly more significant and gives a more interesting performance even though his presence could've been covered by another actor. However, it was great to see Michael Keaton come back for big role. The last time Keaton was in a theatrically released film was The Other Guys (2010). Wow.For the most important part, Joel Kinnaman as RoboCop was good. He was able to portray the emotion required to show what a trouble individual he had become. But it was his take on Alex Murphy that had me rather disgusted with. The way Kinnaman portrayed Murphy was more like a cocky hardheaded punk, it just didn't feel right. Peter Weller's interpretation of the character was more soft spoken but still serious. Here, Kinnaman just gets angry and yells consistently. Speaking of which, there are a number of scenes where all the actors are just yelling. Could we stop that please?Lastly, the action, special effects and score were all integrated. The Robo suit looks great and the dark tactical design was a nice upgrade for the current day appeal. The action sequences were well staged too but I didn't find them anything truly unique. The rating also should have been given an R, not a PG-13. As stated for RoboCop 3 (1993), the world RoboCop lives in is very violent, blood is needed, otherwise, the content and tone is lost. As for music, Pedro Bromfman's score had a Steve Jablonsky / Hans Zimmer -ish feel, which was respectable. Bromfman even briefly plays the original RoboCop theme (which he should have continued). One thing I didn't like was the random insertion of contemporary music. Not needed, especially the end credits. It just shouldn't be for a film like this. Altogether, it plays out well but it has very different feel.The properties may resemble that of the original but the feeling is different. The actors, music, action and special effects are commendable - the story is where the essence of locking up crime gets corrupted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is decent enough, but falls apart as soon as RoboCop leaves assembly line.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It does have some sparks, but ultimately deteriorates into realm of predictability with thick cumbersome political plot. The first half decently tells the origins and human aspect of RoboCop, some of these scenes are well constructed and scripted. Unfortunately, it leaks out interest, trudging into mediocre shoot'em up as it goes. Corporate plot angle is uninspiring, and while the cast is robust enough, the movie falls apart as soon as RoboCop leaves assembly line.Joel Kinnaman as Alex Murphy, the destined organic material on the machine, does a good performance. The better moments of the movie are how this sturdy rather stubborn detective undergoes life-changing experience, yet still clings to what little humanity he has left. He exhibits vigor and occasional fragility, a compelling story despite the expected human cyborg premise. Gary Oldman as Dr. Dennet Norton, is nothing but superb pick, he seemingly able to become different person in his every persona. As the doctor who's responsible of Murphy's rebirth into more than half machine, he displays much empathy and also pragmatism as his ways aren't always up to moral value he wants.Donning the role of antagonist is the eccentric entrepreneur, Raymond Sellars played by Michael Keaton. Able to throw money and time just for good advertisement, this man is no villain. In fact, he looks a bit comical at times, surely annoying but works more as commentary of greed than actual threat. Samuel L, Jackson plays a TV persona, Tom Navek, who has a pro machine agenda. He's charismatic, almost in excessive marketing fashion, even though his character is quite unique since he uses monologue aplenty and doesn't interact much with other. With these quirky characters, I can't help but think they wanted to be modern strange authority figures like in Hunger Games, although lacking in sly and wit.Graphic is good, gadgets appears functional, robots move fluidly and most importantly RoboCop doesn't lumber as if he hasn't been greased for months. The stylistic leaner black tone is admittedly eye-catching, plus it's already a given that superhero reboot always wear dark. Visual clues or indicator effects are good addition to modernize the perspective. Holographic HUD makes the detail sleeker; it's a nice touch and merges well with the action. However, there is one shooting scene in darkness which flickers unreasonably, moment like this is too hectic for their own overly expressive good.RoboCop starts out decently, the special effects are good replacement for the original's practical ones, cast does satisfactory job, but as it enters the third act it bleeds out like the titular protagonist did. It's by no means a failure, it's merely an average sci-fi movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new RoboCop for a new generation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the movie. I didn't think it was excellent, but i thought it was an extremely decent and entertaining movie. Of course, people who compare it to the original over and over will never like it, but i think the idea of remaking RoboCop is good, because it's an iconic character, and as a RoboCop fan, i don't like the idea of not having new RoboCop movies to watch. I want the character to be kept alive and to enjoy new RoboCop stories, so i enjoy having a new one for a new generation, and i also enjoy looking back at the old movies, even RoboCop 3, even though it's pretty awful... for me, it's still RoboCop, and i love RoboCop.I would've liked to hear the original theme more often in the movie, because i think it's a very important part of the character. Sometimes they keep the theme songs forever, like with the James Bond series. Other times, they do something completely new, like with Man of Steel. RoboCop was a mix of those two because even though we actually get to hear the theme in the movie it's only for a few seconds and everything else is a completely new soundtrack, that kind of sounds like a Hans Zimmer score.Overall, i enjoyed the movie, and i enjoyed seeing RoboCop back on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's well made, polished, and hits every mark - but is it crazy to want a futuristic sci-fi action flick about a motorcycle-riding metal supercop to be just a little more fun? I personally liked the movie, specially robocop suit and helmet. There may be some nit-picky missteps in narrative and visual execution, but this reboot is enjoyable enough to warrant a sequel. Seductively produced, provocatively scripted update is more interesting than any of its forebears. The Brazilian director Jos Padilha may be working for a Hollywood studio but he doesn't temper his critique of American imperialism, big business and political corruption. I personally saw criticism of drone use by America, which does make a good point also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I don't ever want to see myself this way again..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I would like to set the bias that I am a huge fan of the original Robocop. It is one of my all time favorite movies. That being said, I enjoyed a TON of what they did with this remake.Many remakes that I've had the displeasure of putting into my sensory holes in recent years are often bitter. They seem to simply want a quick cash-in on the former's glorious name. Robocop, however, strikes me as different. It did what I feel a good remake should do: it took liberties where it needed to but remained true to the original content and honored multiple parts of the original that many people remember as mainstays ("Dead or alive, you're coming with me", "I'd buy that for a dollar", Directive 4 and many more). Not to mention the updated use of the theme song which is freaking awesome.Now that I've had that rant, it did leave one or two things to be desired. I felt the ending was a little abrupt where the original was very satisfying. In addition, some fights were a tad outrageous, but believable within the world they had established for this new Robocop (ED-209 final fight sequence).If you've made it this far: The reason for my use of the quote in the title? The remake seemed much darker at points than the original. Sure, Peter Weller got blown away in the beginning. But this new Robocop really delved into the emotions of poor Alex Murphy as he is making this transition into something that is not quite man and not quite machine, especially when his brain is tampered with. I felt that this added a depth of emotion to the remake not entirely felt with the original, where Murphy largely remained a robotic entity until the final moments of the film.That's all! Go watch it and enjoy it! Or don't. But I'd buy it for a dollar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie was not as bad as I thought... but just really OK.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just viewed the film and while it had some great action, introspective moments, and engaging CGI it felt as though it was keeping the audience in the "friend zone." Fortunately I was given a comp ticket for purchasing the new Blu-Ray on Amazon.The commentary on American Society is there, but not as intensely as it needed to be. The action scenes were enjoyable and engaging at times, but really everything felt like it was trying to be safe and cozy.The only redeeming quality is that there is room for so much more story. I had more fun thinking of what could have been done with a more adult rating. If you go in knowing that this is a vehicle for potential action figure sales, then you will have a good time.Again, I was left just wanting more. It needs to be darker and more sinister in terms of the corruption and story. Hopefully, there will be a director's cut. It needs more time to develop characters and story.If I did not receive that comp ticket I would not have gone. So, while it has potential and good moments, just wait to rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much of a backlash there is for not liking this movie, it is met with other reviews that are hellbent on turning the tides of why this was a decent movie. It's not. It's bland and boring. Why drape a shadow of the original movie into the skeleton (or exo-skeleton) version of the original and call it the same name. It's not. It lacks any immediacy of corporations solution to crime. I mean they yap about it incessantly throughout but nothing really comes of it. The "villians" are silly. Worst than silly...non-existent. There is much political in-fighting. A HORRIBLE subplot of some Dreyfus act that needed to be voted on. Presumably, so there's a ticking time clock somewhere. And this Joel Kinnaman...man, is he annoying. He's got the charisma of wallpaper. Bland stupid expressions (most likely attempting to seem deep in thought). Just a terrible terrible movie. Those who direct you towards this, isn't doing you justice. It looks terrible too. Mark my words, this is the bland flat digital look that is now pervasive throughout movies. This proves digital is garbage. It's funny how people are being trained to look at video crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robocop has Made us Iranians even More Upset than 300 or even Argo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching the movie, and I'm not really going to go into the technical details and argue about how much of a horrible, overly long, boring, and unoriginal "movie" the new Robocop is. What I, as an Iranian and my countrymen, cared about was the first 10 minutes and just how unrealistic it was. No, I'm not talking unrealistic in the sense that it is set in the future with American robots roaming the streets of the Capital of Iran (Tehran). I'm talking about the following: The Iran depicted in the movie is far more primitive than Iran was 70 years ago and this movie is supposed to be portraying "the future", which is supposed to be even more advanced than it is now!What's with the men and the little boy wearing funny Arabic hats (we don't wear hats), or with every single guy having a beard while most Iranians are clean-shaven, or with the obviously "Afghan" (and not Iranian) people living in dark primitive slums like the ones in the war-torn areas of Afghanistan, with the almost black Mexican -member-of-a-drug-cartel-looking rocket launcher guy, and another guy who shouts "Allah Akbar" jumping off a rooftop the way terrorists in Syria do, or with the "Afghan" guy with his "Afghan" accent talking with a walky talky, or with the young "Afghan" guy with his "Afghan" accent with an Iranian name and an "Arabic" surname, or with the ugly people looking like members of a primitive tribe on the side of the street with their hands held high, or with the yellow-tinted city suggesting it is a desert or something (while we get to see mountains in the background) or with "the most traditional" associated-with-the-Iranian-culture items "all" neatly arranged on both sides of the street (a traditional tea-pot, a trolley with cabbages,etc), and with the three-wheeled green car, the sort you get to see in the poorest parts of Pakistan and India, with other cars dating back to at least 40 years ago, with the streets with so many cracks and an asphalt which is as good as sand, with scanty trees suggesting it is a desert of some sort (while in reality, Iranian cities have far more greenery than New York's Central Park or their streets for that matter), with a cheeky commentator suggesting how they need to "pacify" the already peaceful people of Iran (when was the last time Iran invaded any other country, again please?) and them being "thankful" for "killer" American robots "occupying" the land which has been rightfully theirs for the past 4500 years, as one of the oldest civilizations in the world, and with them suggesting that anyone objecting to the "occupation" of their country is a terrorist trying to hurt the "good Americans", with the invading U.S. troops being the "good guys" providing the people of Iran with a chance to raise their kids in a "safe" environment they "never" had before "killer" American robots "occupied" their land, while in reality Iran, as a gun-free country is one of the safest places on the planet, far safer than those countries where kids brandishing their daddies' guns go into their schools and shoot dead their peers and their teachers just because they thought they were "uncool" or people going into movie theaters and opening fire on an unsuspecting audience trying to enjoy "The Dark Knight Rises".Hollywood, either learn something about the people of a country and their country or do not portray them in your stupid movies. If you were even serious and "honest" you would have watched a "single" Iranian movie or TV show to learn some things. Oh, and one more thing, the beginning of the movie showing the U.S. has "finally" occupied Iran and with the ending shouting out loud "the imperialist U.S. is the greatest country on the planet" gives away the real intentions of the makers of this "politically correct" excuse of a "movie".Apart from the above, the movie itself sucked, more than Elysium and Ender's Game combined.</fullReview>

But most of all the action will give you satisfaction that you just can't get from sexual intercourse. Of course, there may be some things that could have been done differently, particularly in the ending but it was a satisfying ending none the less.

What is wrong with you guys ? The film is fluent. The story makes sense. In the original Robocop the guy becomes a machine and his emotions are barely mentioned. The psychology put behind this film is amazing. Some people mention that there is no real fight ! ARE YOU SERIOUS ? There is action non stop. I watched this movie waiting for something that will put me off and ruined it. There is nothing bad. I studied this film and all i could see were some acting mistakes and Samuel L Jackson trying to hard to be bad he ended up being funny and same goes for Michael Keaton although the letter managed better in my opinion. This film is about Business, Money and today's world ! It shows that when there is business there is no place for emotions and this film shows it. The last 15 seconds of the film were TOO patriotic which shows the American life that is sometimes fading behind too many heroic words.One question still keeps on popping up. Why did they remove so much of the body of Alex Murphy ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect to enjoy Robocop 2014 but this remake was as good as the original. The movie is about a man turned into a cyborg by a ruthless security organisation with only one interest in mind - profit.Alex Murphy is critically injured by a car bomb and becomes the property of his employer Omnicorp that rebuilds him into part man part machine. Omnicorp has complete control over Alex, with the ability to 'shut him down' at any time. A modern day Frankenstein, Alex hunts down his would be assassins and then, inevitably, turns against his creators.Robocop is a critique on the ruthless corporatism of the global economy, the increasing irrelevance of individuals' rights, and American imperialism in the 21st century. The movie is less clichd than most Hollywood movies, giving it an air of originality. Nevertheless it is still escapism and a veneration of violence, although the violence is Hollywood styled and therefore enjoyable at a sanitized level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great film, but a surprisingly successful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The RoboCop remake really isn't a good film. It suffers from all the same hangups that so many contemporary films do: style over substance, a serious lack of ethical consequences for the lead characters, ridiculous body counts, female characters who really weren't up to much and a lead actor who was a gaping void where charisma ought to be. It isn't a good film, and I rather suspect it will be very quickly forgotten.But what amazed me, and what kept me in the theatre and thinking about it long after the credits rolled, was the one mistake the new RoboCop didn't make: it didn't forget what the original was really about. It would have been very, very easy to do what the godawful Nightmare on Elm Street remake did and just re-cast the original with modern actors, or to take a note from the slightly-less-awful Carrie remake and insert cellphones and Facebook where the original only had notes passed in class. It would even have been easy ? relatively speaking ? to pay bloodless homage to the original and tell the same story with a higher body count and less gore. To my complete surprise, the new RoboCop didn't do that.What it did do, and what it absolutely deserves credit for, was to realise that the story of man and machine coexisting in one body is just as ripe for commentary today as it was in 1987, and it seems like the vast majority of the storytelling decisions were based on that, not just which special effects could be made smoother with CGI or where modern technology could be inserted in place of clunky 80s-style devices. In fact, the new film is so commentative it actually comes off a little conflicted in places. But to my mind, that's a far better problem to have than missing the point completely."

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. In many ways I prefer it to the original version.The original version was an odd mix of gross vulgarity and comedy that I found distasteful. This new version is a serious exploration of the issues around artificial intelligence and what it means to be human. The satirical sequences with Samuel L. Jackson were funny, but were somewhat distracting from the rest of the film and could have been dropped to improve the continuity and smoothness of the film. My main complaint is that, despite preserving Robocop's humanity while simultaneously showing the benefits of artificial intelligence (saving our soldiers' lives, helping the handicapped, etc.), the film is ultimately a condemnation of artificial intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All in all decent social commentary for a 1st Quarter Action Reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm usually quite the cynic when it comes to films. Whether through over analyzation, unfair comparisons, or whatever other elitist reasoning I feel like using that day I'm quite the tough customer when it comes to Hollywood films getting good reviews. With that said I was both shockingly and pleasantly surprised by the 2014 reboot of RoboCop. I was expecting a film that clearly missed the themes of the first flick and was an empty and hollow shell, recoated like old furniture with a shinier finish of better visual effects and more grotesque bloodlust gratifying action. Instead this film payed true homage to the original by illustrating the fine line between Safety and a Police State as well as the ethics in drone warfare, domestic drone usage, and the future of Mechanical/Human bondage and which one dominates whom through the story of Alex Murphy; a being attempting to retain his humanity despite his free will being under the cold calculating the control of computers and a large corporation thinking only of the bottom line. At first I was slightly taken aback by their approach to his family; where as in the first one the most memorable scene for me was him returning to his family only to be shunned as a Frankensteinian monster, in this film they played an integral role in the development of his character and the true litmus test for how much of his humanity he retained. All in all I thought it, although sloppy at times and clearly designed as an action movie with overtones of these themes quite like the original, was in its own right a very worthy film and something the casual film-goer and even the critic would enjoy watching. I give it 7.5 out of 10 and found it substantially better than the other movie I watched this evening, Thor: The Dark World.</fullReview>

What we have is a great tale of dystopia and and loss of humanity for the sake of technology, security and profit. Unfortunately much of this tale is already happening around us. Many will not find that interesting, but the result is different and quirky. In my view the only way to so many negatively criticize this film is because they expected some kind of magic that surpass the old. Well this will not occur. The first changed the standards of film industry, this remake will not, but that does not mean the movie is bad or poor. The true  that has a strong current message. So forget the old movie.

This is a remake, and a remake does not equate to the original with better graphics, and a remade robocop. No, in this one, they retained the elements of the first one, but changed it. Its true, there is no main villain in this movie, but that doesn't make it god awful. This movie is light years better than Robocop 2 and 3. And the fan boys who argue "this doesn't compare to the first one" well guess what, the second one and the third one are garbage compared to this remake. And say what you will, part two and three were supposed to be actual sequels, yet this blew them both away. This movie is good, and different in its own right. It doesn't suck, there's no jet pack flying robocop, or a 10 year old kid as a villain. I mean come on, what the hell was that director thinking? I could have directed a sequel better. Anyways, its more geared towards emotion vs machine. As opposed to the first which was more of revenge vs machine. Overall, if you're after a cut and paste kind of movie, this is not for you. If you want something different, and entertaining, I would definitely recommend this movie. Its even humorous at times. Robocop fans will get what they want, the familiar ed 209 with different villains and yet feel a bit satisfied. I love Robocop, and I liked this movie. Give it a shot, let it do well in the box office so we can get a sequel. Unless you want the usual music documentaries like one direction or that awful Bieber movie to reign supreme over good films like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that's actually good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are some of the least popular movies to be made. Whenever a remake to a movie comes out, people view it as damaging the original or having no creative investment to the story. This is one case where people would be wrong. "RoboCop", the remake of the classic 1987 film "RoboCop", has a similar premise to the original movie, but has a different tone to it and tells the story in its own way rather than copying the same story as the original.The film starts off in a similar manner as the original, using the news as a means to introduce the audience to the world. From TV show host Patrick Novak (Samuel L. Jackson), the audience learns of the use of peace keeping robots being used in other countries, but due to the Dreyfuss Act, the robot peace enforcers can not be used in the United States. After learning this, we jump to Detroit, which is said to be but doesn't look like the city with the highest crime rate, where the audience is introduced to the main character, Officer Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman). A problem is that before Alex is put in the RoboCop suit, he is too picturesque as a husband and father, making him look less like a character you can relate to and more like a person's view of a perfect person. After an explosion injures him, he is put inside the RoboCop suit.Now inside the RoboCop suit, the audience follows Alex through his training and we actually get to see how he feels about being put in the suit. Along with the creation of RoboCop, we get to see some interesting new means of crime solving and witness him going through training, something the original didn't spend much time on. He returns home, but after a breakdown from the crime scene surveillance of the explosion that injured him, Dr. Norton (Gary Oldman) is forced to remove all emotion from RoboCop. A problem with the film is that RoboCop breaks out of this emotionless state fairly quickly and then proceeds to solve his own attempted murder, which leads to his temporary shutdown. RoboCop's wife (Abbie Cornish) and his son (John Paul Ruttan) are brought to OmniCorp by CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) who lies to them about Alex being dead. With the help of Dr. Norton, RoboCop escapes and stops Sellars.As I said before, this remake works because it takes the premise it is reusing, but does so in its own way instead of trying to recreate what the original was. The tone of this film is more serious than the tone of the first one and the only time it feels like it needlessly copied the original is when the lines, "I wouldn't buy that for a dollar," and "Dead or alive; you're coming with me" are used. There is more focus on RoboCop's home life than there was in the original, which feels like an attempt to modernize the movie with a subplot about his family. Both the wife and son are okay characters and do not feel pointless to the story like some families in other films do, but they are one of the less interesting aspects of the movie. Personally, I was more interested in Dr. Norton's character than with the family. Like most remakes, it is not as good as the original, but all of the hate this movie is receiving is just ridiculous. The film has its problems and some aspects to it are weak, but it tells its own story and does not feel like it is insulting the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As remakes go... not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Verhoben has a style of his own, and remaking any of his films is like playing with fire. You will probably never please anyone who has seen the original because his films are for the most part very good, and it doesn't matter the genre. He usually delivers, without reservations.The remake has plenty of violence, much better graphics than its predecessor and Samuel Jackson giving us some heated campaigning for integrating a new "security force" in the U.S., and he's, well, controversially funny. The rest of the film tries very hard to emulate what made the original so special, but it doesn't quite get there. Maybe it's because times have changed, and though we listen to much more explicit lyrics in our contemporary pop, we might have grown a little more politically correct in other ways.People will get plenty of shooting, posturing, and some cool machinery, but we will also see less of the scattered human leftover pieces that raised a few eyebrows the first time around. Hollywood now makes cleaner films literally, and we're not talking about CGI. What this film has in its favor is a good trio of actors: Jackson, Oldman, and Keaton. Each bringing a touch of quality to the mix, but make no mistake, this is no Batman. The lines are not there, just an outline with no much emotional punch.This is not to say the film is not entertaining. It delivers a bit over 90 minutes of the typical crowd-pleaser, but I wouldn't be looking for a sequel. We have no Captain Sparrow, troubled orphan, or even a cold princess to excite us about a sequel. Let's just enjoy what is there, trying to forget the impact of an original that might have been better left alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling tale, well directed - not your average dumb action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched the new RoboCop movie... at last! My theater was packed and the audience had a very good time. What to say? Well, a lot. This is not "RoboCop 1987", a masterpiece ahead of its own time... it's a different movie and a very great one in its own right. It's not a remake, it's a "re-imagining" featuring an alternative version of the character inhabiting an alternative version of the original 1987 futuristic Detroit, and it's definitely a new story. Joel Kinnaman delivers the best. He plays Alex Murphy with gusto, elegance and charisma. His Alex Murphy is a 90% human brain immersed into a cybernetic body. It's not the original premise, it's a different take. The original RoboCop was a cyborg, a machine, equipped with a partial human brain; a robot which gradually "convinced" itself to be a MAN ("Alex Murphy"), and gradually started to feel "sparks" of humanity, despite it wasn't "Alex Murphy", it was a new entity. Think about Alan Moore's Swamp Thing... On the other side, this new RoboCop is a man, and it's the tale of a man struggling to deal with his new body and the fascist "machine" nature of his new body system. It's a brilliant struggle depicted on screen with passion and unpredictability. The direction is top notch. Micheal Keaton's character, Sellars, is very well-crafted, well scripted and acted. Easily one of the best points of the movie. Gary Oldman is maybe the real star of the show, his character is tormented and interesting and one you're not going to forget so easily! I would have added more action in the "final fight", but this is a movie about STORYTELLING, not ACTION. Substance over form. However, there are some action scenes which deliver thrills and great visuals - lots of gunfights in the old "RoboCop" fashion you're already accustomed to. The production values are stellar, and you would not care about the PG13 rating if you're watching movies because you love good stories. There are disturbing scenes anyway, even if most of them are subtle and slick. Overall, you can breath the Isaac Asimov-vibe all over the movie. It's like a good American sci-fi romance with a very Asimov-like "groove". It's great '60 sci-fi turned modern. There are TONS of anti-American satire, and Samuel L. Jackson is in there to remind us a good "RoboCop" movie is all about satire and debate. This movie is more anti-American than the original classic. This is not your average action-movie and it will FLOP just because the old fans of RoboCop have chosen to boycott/kill this great re-imagining. But next generations will eventually discover it. 8,5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not horrible, but not quite good either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the original Robocop, I really do. When I heard the remake was coming out I had no problems with it, because unlike most people, I have no problems with remakes. Some can be quite good. At first I was excited, but then the more I saw new trailers, the more my excitement plummeted. However I decided to see it anyways, because it was cheap, and I'll see anything. I thought Samuel L. Jacksons character was pointless. We do not need the "political" point pushed on us so much. Plus, did we really need to have him do the "Mother F****r" in the movie? Censored or not, it was stupid. I thought the actors we're most familiar with (Michael Keaton, Sam Jackson) were the worst parts of the movie. Great actors, horrible direction. The actor playing Robocop I thought did an amazing job. I love the effect of showing the only human parts of his body. Very effective. I hated the delivery of the "Dead or alive, you're coming with me." line. You don't need to push it that much. It felt like it didn't belong, but they decided to put it in anyways. Over all. I loved parts, and hated parts. But I am very glad I decided to go and check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still doesn't hold a candle to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be honest, I thought this movie was gonna blow. From the clichd trailer to the pg-13 rating(BTW I'm still not over that, how could you take the ultra violent original and cut it's proverbial balls off!). Ahem, anyways. This movie was OK. Something it does have that is similar to the original is that it's a product of the times. The original was a product of the 80s and had something political to say. This movie...Was in your face with it's politics. The original had political subtext. This one was just political. Though I don't know how to feel about the politics of this movie, which only talks about American imperialism. How would America feel about using robots as cops? Didn't congress already create a bill and the president signed it that allows for use of drones on American soil? I seem to remember that being debated over like 3 years ago. Apparently Americans really don't care in real life. But according to the movie Americans are the only ones concerned with liberty, hmm. Now politics aside how was the movie itself? It started out slow, the action was boring, the acting was actually great, but they didn't have a very good script to work with. Also, How is Detroit going to look like that in 10 years? seriously, I actually live in Michigan, I've been to Detroit and there is a reason I live as far west in Michigan as I can get without actually leaving the state. All in all, I'd say it's somewhere between a good B movie action flick...or terrible block buster. either way you go it's an OK action movie. But I suggest renting it on DVD in like six months, it isn't worth full admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is no masterpiece, but at least the story is very interesting, the relationship with Robocop is emotional and special effects are excellent. It has a certain air of coolness about it that transforms the whole movie in a kind of science fiction batman. Joel Kinnaman plays very well as cold police officer than explores his character into the movie. It is a science fiction drama with a lot of twists that makes it surprising and action is fast and engaging. Other than a few problems with the villain side of it( the Director of Omnicorp company is quite evil and unexpected until the second half of the movie, the movie is VERY enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewed this movie in BFI IMAX Cinema, London which is the largest screen in UK. I was expecting this is a very exciting popcorn movie which means corny and stupid story with fabulous visual effects. It turn out to be much better than what I expected. The story was smooth, the story teller try to put viewers into thinking of what is Robocop? A machine or a human? There wasn't any clear answer to that, but I start to think...... Visually, it is splendid, sound was good. Also the Robocop black cover was quite cool. I enjoy the red radiation come from his helmet. The only thing I was a bit picky about is the wife is too young and too pretty. I enjoy the movie very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The human element was better in this iteration.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a personal stand point i enjoyed this one more than the original(crucify me if you will). For what it was the 80's was more of Alex being with less control and over coming them. This version I've seen more of the emotional context of a man imprisoned, and without any chance of escape. I understand the reason for people to have some nostalgia for some iconic 80's movies this included. However the three previous iterations of this title were painful to watch in my opinion, because of how in some instances bad some scenes are. Which to put it mildly there are many 80's that maintained their stature even through technological innovation. By the end of the movie I realized that there was a better portrayal of how Alex. This was a Above average action movie to me. It didn't make me say lets raze the town, but I felt like was better immersed in the image before me than when I saw the original as a kid. That and they didn't have this obsession with using first person perspective in the story telling. And be it I'm an engineering student I can actually believe whats under the suit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haven't watched the original but, a satisfying remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RoboCop is a remake of the 1987 movie of the same name. After inspector Alex Murphy(Joel Kinnaman) is grievously injured in a bomb blast, he has little hope to survive. Alex's wife, Clara Murphy(Abbie Cornish) agrees to a procedure that fuses whatever's left of his body to a robotic exoskeleton to help him lead a normal life. The procedure is completed thanks to the funding &amp; support of OmniCorp, an international company known for its advanced technology &amp; services. OmniCorp's chief members including, Dr. Dennett Norton(Gary Oldman), Raymond Sellars(Michael Keaton), Rick Mattox(Jackie Earle Haley), Liz Kline(Jennifer Ehle) &amp; Tom Pope(Jay Baruchel) are extremely proud of their latest technology who is part-man, part-robot. A new way to curb crime by offering a superior robotic police officer with otherworldly weapons &amp; built-in surveillance, mapping &amp; scanning technology. Everyone is extremely excited about this especially, famous TV news anchor, Pat Novak(Samuel L. Jackson). However, when Murphy breaks protocol &amp; goes after the people who had attempted to murder him, it is up to OmniCorp &amp; the police to stop RoboCop. This movie is really entertaining from start to finish. Complete value for your money. I liked the fact that the film concentrated on the emotional aspect of a half-man, half-machine human being. Murphy's interactions with his wife &amp; son, David Murphy(John Paul Ruttan) are heartwarming &amp; heartbreaking, at the same time. The action is thrilling &amp; engaging. The special effects are mind blowing. However, in the midst of all the "Wham, bam, thank you ma'am", at the heart of the film is a tale about the struggle of a genuinely honest &amp; nice person, trapped in a ruthless killing machine. The performances is one of the highlights of the film. Relatively unknown actor, Joel Kinnaman is impressive as Alex Murphy/RoboCop. However, his eyes are covered for the most part of the film. So, Kinnaman is not able to showcase as much acting ability as the others. Gary Oldman is outstanding as Dr. Dennett Norton. Michael Keaton is brilliant as Raymond Sellars. Abbie Cornish is outstanding as Clara Murphy. Jackie Earle Haley is good as Rick Mattox. Michael K. Williams is effective as inspector Jack Louis. Jennifer Ehle is good as Liz Kline. Jay Baruchel is hilarious as Tom Pope. John Paul Ruttan is adorable as David Murphy. However, inevitably, the star of the show is Samuel L. Jackson as the eccentric &amp; quirky, TV news anchor, Pat Novak. This film further solidifies Jackson's acting range &amp; versatility. So, looking at these facts, RoboCop is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Splendid job, bright future for a fresh director in Hollywood!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Couldn't wait to see this movie. One day before I went to the movies I watched the original with Peter Weller, so I would be able to compare - the original is in my Top Ten Movies of all time. So firstly I was kind of angry, that RoboCop got a reboot, but then ... Director Jos Padilha has done an outstanding job, creating a Sci-Fi-/Action-Movie with an enormous depth of character. Okay, Joel Kinnaman was probably not the best choice for playing RoboCop, but hey, he had great supporting cast. So outstanding performances by Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton (yes, he is still alive) and Samuel L. Jackson, and my god is the performance of Jackson frightening ... The movie gives us enough time to learn about the characters so you could really get the emotions of the various characters in their development throughout the movie. And still, you've got plenty state of the art action scenes. And Pedro Bromfman has done a great job scoring the movie, even honoring the late Basil Poledouris who scored the original. So from my point of view: The new RoboCop gets a 9 out of 10! I wanna see more movies like this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am one of the biggest Robocop fans in history. There is no question about this. I Have to say that when they announced that they were remaking my all time favorite movie, Robocop, I was aghast. I was horrified, and filled with a sense of dread, because Hollywood butchers everything they touch. I swore i would boycott the movie, and never pay the Hollywood machine a dime on this. However, against my better judgment, I decided to see this tonight. In a nutshell - I loves it. Yes, I admit it. There were changes from the original, such as his family still being a part of his life, and his wife giving consent to do the operations vs him being declared legally dead in the first one. His partner in the original one was white female Ann Lewis.,....in this one he is Black man Jack Lewis and the crime lord he went after was no Clarence Boddiker...yet he had more money, guns, and connections then Boddiker ever had. The one major complaint from people was the Robosuit looked like a black Batman...well i can tell you those were preproduction stills. He starts off the movie with an upgraded suit very much like the original..and ends the movie in it...in the middle is the black suit and it ain't that bad. overall i give it a solid 9 out of 10..i'd buy that for a dollar. he is more agile, and much faster in combat, yet when standard walking still has the rifle to it. Did not think i'd like the motorcycle aspect..but it actually played out well with the enhanced robot-vision of the CCTV footage and system telemetry. the tech scenes are superb...Gary Oldman is great...Keaton is likable and yet slimy...you almost like the guy until the end. Sam 'mutherfuckin Jackson is ...well..Sam motherfucking Jackson....with a bad hair piece</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better remakes so far, but still not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the 80's Robocop, so I was a hard sell on the new one, but actually it's not bad.What I really liked was that they made this a new interpretation of the story. It wisely updates the politics and technology for the 21st century, and they changed many of the major characters- introducing new ones and leaving out old ones. Gary Oldman is especially good; his character is what kept me interested in the film most of the time. The performances are also quite good- Keaton, Jackson, and Oldman steal the show, but everyone is good- the supporting actors give it 100% and, though often humorless, it's nice to see that the cast did their best to make this film work. The film does have its flaws, though...quite a few. The film tries very hard to make the plot "make sense." And while it succeeds in connecting the dots very logically, it's so focused on making sure the plot makes sense that it forgets to sit back and let us feel for the characters. Like I said, the actors are great, but they aren't given a lot of unique dialogue or character to work with. The script is fairly generic- everyone is somewhat of a stereotype, and we don't spend long enough on any emotional beats to care that much about them. Similarly, the action is a bit sterile. None of the action scenes had me emotionally invested- it all felt like there was nothing at stake, or visually it was too hard to tell what was happening to get worked up. I would say the choreography was "on par" with your typical current action movie, but nothing stood out to me. The effects are good, but the new Robocop suit itself is somewhat generic too. Lastly, while there are some jokes or funny moments in the movie, it all takes itself very seriously- it doesn't have the "fun" of the original. This is most evident in the character Robocop himself. There is such an added emphasis on how Robocop feels and thinks that it destroys much of the mystique and "cool" of the character. So all in all, I would recommend this movie to any fan of Robocop, I think you'll enjoy the new take on the character and there's just the right amount of homage vs new ideas. The performances are great too, it's just a shame the overall movie feels too controlled, and also too smoothed out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I fought the law and the law won."That song plays under the credits of RoboCop (2014), and it's the best part of the film besides the appearance of Frank Sinatra. Otherwise, this latest iteration of Paul Verhoeven's 1987 classic is so full of thriller-super-hero tropes you'll think you wrote the screenplay. No, you didn't, because you might have done better at not repeating the clichs.The story is best summarized by bad-boy OmniCorp president, Raymond Sellars, played with effective understatement by Michael Keaton: "Forget the machines. They want a product with a conscience. Something that knows what it feels like to be human. We gonna put a man inside a machine." Sellars creates a low-rent Iron Man; in no way does Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnamen) compare with Tony Stark's (a memorable Robert Downey, Jr.) robust intellect and dramatic range.As for the marital romance between RoboCop Alex and his wife, Clara (Abbey Cornish) and the parental love for his child, David (Jean Paul Ruttan), it's all by the book, ho hum. At one point wife and son become hostages?imagine that. Where are Peter Weller and Nancy Allen when you need them?Worst of all, the film takes probably an hour to set up the creation of RoboCop, when the audience already knows something about it. More importantly, the aud needs to see Robocop doing his duty on the streets of Detroit, but he's not on the beat. Nor does director Jose Padhila mine the rich material inherent in troubled Detroit. The film could have been set in Montreal for all the attention paid to Detroit's ill fate in the past and the present. On a more positive note, Gary Oldman's conflicted scientist, Dennett Norton, lends sinister grace. His RoboCop Dr. Frankenstein has the right amount of ambivalence about his creation to make me watch his every reaction to the chaos he has created.Samuel Jackson as the Bill-O'Reilly-conservative TV host, Pat Novak, unknowingly sounds the liberal criticism and theme of the film: "This is the future of American justice!" A question mark rather than an exclamation point could encapsulate the argument about drones of any kind: Do we want machines to make decisions? This RoboFilm is concerned with shooting up everything as the genre dictates. Leave the nuances to Iron Man."What the hell did you do to me?" RoboCop</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well. I would have liked to be surprised for once.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well. First off. I'll be honest. I am coming from a slight bias when I talk about this. I will therefore start with saying that the original Verhoeven flick is one of my favoritest movies of all time... Now, with that said... the original basically had no right being as good as it was. Quite frankly, Orion found themselves with a surprise hit with Terminator. And basically just reached into their pile of scripts for the next one that had robots in it. Verhoeven himself famously refused to even consider directing such dreck and by the way he doesn't even like scifi. The first trailer even had the theme for Terminator as Robo's score wasn't even done yet. So, yes. I know that my particular holy bovine was created just as very much as a simple cash-grab. But dear FSM did they make it awesome.So it was with some trepidation that I sat down and watched this updated version. But, I had told myself, the director has had a couple of flicks with decent reputation. And even recent reboots like Batman and Dredd had produced entertaining romps. So there is some hope that this won't end up like the recent Total Recall debacle.Sigh. Sadly no. Just as suspected. There is very little substance here. Very little new thoughts. And especially lacking was the touch of showmanship.So Robo is self-aware with memories intact from the first awakening. Uhm OK. His wife and son are both there throughout the movie. And he has retained his right hand as human. And he battles both updated ED209's and regular humanoid "drones".. OK all this we see in the trailer. Now surprise me.No. That's about it. We get little to no characterization from anyone here. Gone are the quirks and loveability and bad-assery of both the good and bad guys. Who is Lewis, the black good cop. What does he do? Uhm... Who is the main baddie, and why should I fear him? Well it depe... oh he's down. Heck, what is supposed to differentiate these 209's from the mass- produced Metal Gear units? Gone is the sense of supreme showmanship. The mastery of buildup and release. Gone is also the satire. Yes Samuel L Jackson is the typical Fox anchor... but there's no flare to any of it. And yes there is action-sequences. But without the mentioned showmanship I struggle to remember anything memoreable about them. And also they are either bloodless or with drones so there is little to no weight in any of the spectacles. Now I understand that they wanted to do their own thing. A shot by shot remake including the gore is even more pointless. So I'm glad they didn't fall for that temptation. But please. When you want to do your own stuff. At least go all the way with it. And above all, make it memoreable. This is just bland predictability. I know gore isn't necessarily the answer. I love the old Leone westerns and those wouldn't have any problem clearing a PG13 rating... but just do something to stand out... I'll stop my rant now...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the fact that I hope to write a review, built mainly on statements of an objective nature, I know myself as being someone who approaches every new reboot of a cult classic (no need in saying that there are plenty these days) with a certain skepticism, which is then confirmed time after time by a pathetic excuse for Hollywood money squeezing. My surprise was all the greater, when I saw this refreshing view on the action classic that is Robocop. The film is built on the strengths of the original, and adds in a new, more contemporary atmosphere that is, at the same time, just as raw and compelling as the original. The excellent work of director Jos Padilha is supported by a wonderful selection of cast members. Emerging Swedish actor Joel Kinnaman gives us a wonderful Alex Murphy, and actually manages to emerge from the shadow of Peter Weller's legacy. The same can be said for the supporting cast members, with a special shout-out to Michael K. Williams, having finally found his way to the big screen, rightly so.Overall, Robocop 2014 is just a splendid movie, a remake done absolutely right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As far as I know, he's still doing his job..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** warning this review has a ton of spoilers ***This action film has some depth that the average joe might have missed. The turning point for Alex (Robocop) was when he saw his kid's emotional state. There were 2 scenes that repeated itself. First was when the kid entered the car with the mom. Second when the kid saw Alex get blown up. This is an extremely complex moment. In the film, you just saw the dopamine levels rise, but you have think for a moment to catch the "why" this is happening.Remember that Robocop is part human and that when he saw the entire Detroit crime database in his head, they had to lower his dopamine levels to keep his emotions in control.Now if the database has any coorelation to real-life statistics of fatherless children, here's what that same Detroit database would reveal:When a child does not have a father, there's an increase chance during his/her later stage...1. Criminal behavior 2. Alcohol and/or drug abuse 3. Sexual Abuse 4. Identity Crisis 5. Suicidal tendenciesAlex (Robocop)'s brain cross references details (body language, emotional tone, etc) to predict if something is a threat. And in those few minutes of analyzing his own son, Alex realized he can become a "criminal maker" by neglecting his son. This is how he broke programming per se externally to the viewers while not breaking it internally in the computer sense. This is why emotions were allowed to flow in again as he/himself is the case to assess the threat level. This is how he broke priority because all the information flooding in made this case "infinitely" more possible in terms of danger. This is why the ending is what it is, where the family meets together in the lab and Alex reveals his determining smile to be a father.I hope that's the subtle, thin message everyone can get from Alex's emotional response: That no matter how well our law enforcers are, it's good families that can prevent crime. In some ways, good moms and dads are fighting crime before it happens. As the doc said in the film "As far as I know, he's still doing his job..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True science fiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-This is a true science fiction movie.The original was an action movie dressed as science fiction. This one, without preaching, with imposing answers or going philosophical, has embedded science fiction elements, like what is to be conscious. Science knows that many aspects of conscience and free will are illusory. If those aspects are coming from a computer, is that different from free will?-This is innovative storytelling.A lot of criticism from another reviewers is just that it doesn't have some predictable and overused recipes for storytelling (it haves, but not all, or not as deep). They want a cartoon stereotyped bad guy, which is bad just because that's what stereotypes do, and have not conflicts, or reasons to do what they do. Well, the movie is not completely free of that, but the criticism is that it is not just that. Those critics want just the common story with a new dress. They do not like something different, they want cheesy romance, even when that would not be logical, and complain about not getting enough of it. It haves a little of what they want, but thats a flaw that was smoothed, and they just don't like it.-Is not an empty remake. Is better than the original. Is far more realistic. The evil corp do not just takes ownership of a police body. It needs the approval of the family for a medical process. The writers did some investigation about the scientific aspects involved. Is easy to understand that sometimes conscience is on and other times off, and how it feels. Of course, special effects are far better, but that's just the scenario, not the point of the movie.-This is an entertaining movie.If you want to have fun, you will have it. The movie leaves food for tough, but you don't need to understand or chew it to enjoy the movie.I would give the movie an 8, but I give a 10 because it is underrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry to expose this, but all these supposed fancier and more expensive movies are doing is pushing the cause to discredit the "villain" of American society as is described here and by many other Zionist(aka Jewish) media. This industry has become a mind conditioning tool and is not entertainment any longer.We watched movies with the same themes when we were kids and then saw our kids watching the same themes, and now we see our kids children doing the same. All that has changed is the enemy. This exposes so much about this industry and what tune it plays to.The best thing we can do for ourselves, is to stop wasting our valuable money paying for this stuff that we don't know for sure will make enemies of us tomorrow or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not having seen the original 1987 version of this film, at least I don't remember seeing it, I wasn't swayed or programmed to hate this remake and consider the original untouchable like some, which I feel was an advantage for me going into it. Plus, after watching this version, I have to wonder how the original could have been better or even just as good, since it was made in the late 80's. I though it was a very well done; well directed, written &amp; acted film that was very entertaining as well. I even said to myself during the film, 'this is awesome!' and it is. If you are looking for an action heavy, emotional tale set in the future, RoboCop is your film. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horrible remake. I am guilty of getting psyched about the remake and the new technology with movies since the original. In additional to thinking the awesome technology, the sleuth of great actors would compensate, right? WRONG, Michael Keaton was awful and not convincing as a villain, which he has before in other movies. Abby Cornish was awful playing Murphy's wife. Kinneman did a decent job as Robocop but his role on the TV show "The Killing" was much better. The storyline could have been fantastic. They were almost there, but their was no awesome scenes or major action sequences. The story could have hit its "peak" a bit sooner but dragged out for its $100 million budget. Opening weekend is only $21million and that should have told me to wait for rental. Now I know and hopefully help others save their cash!$$$</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly have no idea why this movie is rated so low. I went to watch it with my girlfriend not expecting much, due to the low reviews and i must say i was immensely surprised. The movie is extremely entertaining from the beginning to the end, has an interesting plot and is well executed. I admit, it is not the same Robocop people got used to; however, in my opinion by no means is it any worse!!! The new adaptation definitely does not deserve the hate it is getting. I can't believe i almost skipped this movie after reading so many negative reviews; however, i am glad i did not. If you are still wondering if this movie is worth watching by all means YESSSS IT IS. Don't get confused by the negative reviews. It is a fantastic movie and at the very least should not get below an 8. So grab a friend and see it for yourself! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another year, and another classic film gets remade. I'm a big fan of the original RoboCop from 1987 so at first when I heard it was being remade I was on the fence. The casting started to fall into place with Joel Kinnaman taking the lead role as Alex Murphy. That was underwhelming for sure, but I was willing to give him a chance. Then great stars such as Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, and Jackie Earle Haley were announced, and I started to get very excite. When the trailers started to roll out I thought for sure it was going to be a pretty good remake. However I was wrong. What we got was an average film.The story of the film is pretty straight forward. OmniCorp is trying to get their brand of crime fighting into the U.S. so they can gain more money, and thus more profits. However they are failing because of disagreement from Senators who want to protect Americans privacy rights. Much like we are seeing today. Putting a man in the suit will bypass current U.S. law so they start their search for the "RoboCop". Eventually after a car bombing Alex Murphy played by Kinnaman takes over as OmniCorp's RoboCop. The story seemed well especially in the trailers, but its overall weak, and falls flat. The acting of Kinnaman as RoboCop doesn't fit the role at all. He is the same exact person as he was before the car bombing. Very generic acting on his part, and he fails big time to even come close to what Peter Weller was able to achieve back in the 1987 classic.The action scenes you would think would be pretty big and time consuming. However they are not. Again these action scenes are very generic. They are few and far between, and nothing really exciting ever happens during these scenes. Scenes of the action is mainly filmed using CG. Overall I felt the CG was pretty good. At times here and there it falls apart, but it mainly sticks together nicely.The acting. I touched on this already a bit with Joel Kinnaman who plays RoboCop. His acting is nothing to be thankful for in this film. Its completely forgettable work on his part. Michael Keaton who plays OmniCorp's owners Raymond Sellars does a fantastic job playing the ruthless bad guy. Sure the writing and pacing aren't that good buy he brings a powerful appearance to the big screen. Gary Oldman is the same way. He is amazing in the film. He lights up every scene he is in. Frankly in this film he proves he can dominate any role no matter how average the film is overall. The rest of the cast who gets small parts here and there aren't bad. Jay Baruchel who is annoying in all of his films, is annoying yet again. No surprise there. Samuel L. Jackson provides some nice comedic relief. Jackie Earle Haley does great for his role in the film. Abbie Cornish who plays the wife of Alex Murphy is very good in the film. She takes the role seriously and really hits a home run in my opinion.Overall the film is lackluster. Sure the film had big shoes to film over its original film, and the odds were highly stacked against it, however even when going into the film with an open mind as I did I felt it just fell flat on its face. With a fairly generic plot, and acting from the star this film will fade away. However if you do plan on watching the film there is no need to rush out to watch it. Waiting for a nice discount showtime would be the best opinion if you truly want to see the film in theaters. If you can wait this film could be a decent watch on a video on-demand service in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Listen to All the Negative Reviews.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has been rebooting old movies for a long time. It seems that no one has issues when Batman was remade a million times, but for some reason everyone has a bad opinion for the reboot of Robocop.First of all, I grew up watching the hyper violent original, R2, R3, and both TV series. I would put the ranking order from best to worst as Robocop (1987), Robocop (2014), Robocop 2, and then the rest. So many people has issues with this reboot, with reasons like it's not rated R, Anne Lewis is a guy, Joel's performance was bad, Robo is whiny, or that the movie has no central enemy. All of this is far from the truth. Honestly, I think this movie was more realistic and portrays the real struggle that any human would have being placed in a cyborg. He goes through an emotional struggle getting used to being put into his new robotic body. Where as the first one, he just totally seemed fine with it, and basically only remembers and pines for his family. In the original, Murphy's wife would be fighting to talk to him and it never happens. In this one, his family fights to be in his life, and I think the family/wife element brings heart into the movie, and also explains why there isn't a female Lewis. She isn't needed in this remake because his wife actually accounts for something.As far as technology, this one also has the original beat. Imagine a Robocop with wifi, criminal databases, and google cameras. He uses these all to his advantage and really makes the action sequences interesting and are done extremely well. This is a remake, and of course it will always be compared to the original, but even though the original is better this remake fleshes out Robocop's story and struggle to face his reality. I honestly loved it and I think this reboot is more successful than Robocop 3, Prime Directives series, and Robocop the series. It might not have the gore and as many metaphors, but it is not nearly as horrible as reviews are making it. It shouldn't be compared to the original, but is a completely retelling of Robocop. So don't listen to the reviews and watch it with an open mind. I honestly loved the movie and hope they make a sequel to it. For everyone who is bashing the movie, all I can say is stop comparing it to the original and appreciate it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy modern reboot of Robocop.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie with no expectation at all.. Because I got tired with those cult fanatics of the 1987 version who keep insulting and comparing a great classic with a modern interpretation. Why can't Robocop fans keep that great classic 1987 version as it is and let this new version shine on its own?And guess what, don't listen to those fanatics, I went and really enjoyed this film. Story-wise it is quite compelling and makes you ask some questions about humanity. Action is good,, and I thought the new Ironman-ish body would look ugly in the movie, but turns out great and moves "mechanically" like it should be, instead of looking like man inside an armor like I initially thought.Overall, just don't compare this to the classic one, then you'll find out that this is a good movie &amp; a worthy modern version of Robocop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Want 80's action? Stay away. Want more thoughtful sci-fi action? Watch this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is Schlindler's List compared to the Total Recall remake. I usually agree with rotten tomatoes or metacritic, but I have no idea why people are bashing this movie so much. I went in expecting something dumb, but mildly entertaining (Transformers has 57% on Rotten) but instead I got a remarkably thoughtful sci-fi movie. Other critics have said this movie is slow, humorless, and the action scenes suck. I'll agree that the movie is a little slow in parts, if by slow you mean that stuff wasn't blowing up. "Slow" scenes with Gary Oldman talking about robotics or Samuel L Jackson doing spot on parody? Not boring for me. Is it as funny as the original? Probably not, but they're going for a totally different feel in this one, exploring what it's like for the guy to be a cyborg WAY more than the original ever did. The action scenes? Well, they're aren't a TON of them, but I thought the action was great.In short, if you want more of an 80's action movie like the original, you'll probably be somewhat disappointed. But if you can forget the original for a minute and enjoy this movie as thoughtful, political sci- fi with some good action scenes and fantastic actors, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my problems with robocop 2014 (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love original robocop but I am just going to act if this one was not a remake and I won't compare this to original robocop. i hate how they explained (or didn't) that Murphy was able to go outside his programming because he had a soul it is just lazy writing. remember when t-800 drives a bike? well obviously robocop was made out of paper because the bike didn't even budge when he sit on the bike. the silver suit was good but the black one didn't make me believe that he was a robot and what is the point of keeping a hand?? it is made out of bones and muscles and there is no way in hell it is as useful as a robotic one. if they saved an arm or something maybe but just the freaking hand?? what is the point? since his head was the only part of him that wasn't heavily armored and his only weak spot what is the freaking point of putting a red target light on his head? and why would Michael Keaton point his gun to child was he a murderous sociopath from the beginning? over all i think everything that was there was just for the looks they thought it would look or sound cool so put them in the movie. it is just lazy writing and it didn't make any sense to me. 4/10 is what it deserves imho.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While robots keep the peace in other countries America has yet to convert. After an officer is left for dead, what is left of him is engineered into a robotic design and he goes about to arrest his killers but finds his investigation is putting himself in jeopardy. Forget Paul Verhoeven's excellent 1987 original, many characters and story emphasis have been changed but for fans OCP is mentioned briefly and there's some dialogue nods to the original to name a few. Director Jose Padilha's incarnation is pleasantly different enough to avoid comparison and he certainly puts his own stamp on the subject material although there are unavoidably elements reminiscent of The Vindicator (1986) and The Wraith (1986). The action is frantic, and gritty with plenty of graphic scenes and violence, for example Robocop's innards out on display, lungs, brain and oesophagus also there's an intense shoot out even though on occasion Padilha's uses thermal imagery to possibly avoid censorship. But a film shouldn't be about a rating, Padilha's offering is about heart with it ending on a high and a hark back to the original Robocop design. All in all the special effects are impressive, the shooting style is what you'd expect from a modern action. This version is more a cop story than robotics. What's on display delves into corporate corruption (less 'Wall Street' than the 1987 version) and (saldy) skims the street crime underbelly. Samuel L. Jackson is Pat Novak, his segments (a show with theme tune of the original film's theme music) replaces and updates the commercial satire adverts and news reels, he's more of a political presenter /analyst, needless to say Jackson is on his usual top form. Both Gary Oldman as Doctor Norton with a heart and Michael Keaton as OmniCorp's head Sellars are outstanding and are what you'd expect for their caliber. Joel Kinnaman is a fitting Robocop/Alex Murphy and carries the emotion, as here it's about his relationship with his wife (Abbie Cornish) making it more focal, which was only touched on in Robocop and part 2. The supporting cast are all high calibre including the likes of Jackie Earle, Aimee Garcia, Jay Baruchel and Jennifer Ehle.Like its predecessor's social commentary another appreciation for the 2014 version which may be overlooked is its own subtle societal commentary, including but not limited to- overseas manufacturing, i.e. Robocop is made in the East, countries marketing and distributing its products/ideals/morals without adopting them themselves and so on. It will be interesting to see where a sequel will take Alex Murphy - part remake, part cop story, all new Robocop, surprisingly recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this in IMAX at a Palladium Preview here in San Antonio.Overall - Great film with lots of action, good storyline, nice expansion on original premise only missing a few points as a film.Comparing it to the original the storyline was similar in scope but different enough to not feel as if it were a simple copy. We like that it remains in Detroit. We like that the old Taurus cars are gone but it would have been cool to see a little more of that cool Detroit car vibe in this movie since they are "motor city".The action was fast paced and executed perfectly by the actors. The only thing we agreed on was that during the height of the action sequences the film seemed to omit a lot of the detail or slow down for a split second for people to see enough of it. Perfect example is when a motorcycle crashes through a barrier - the crashing though was slowed perfectly but the immediate action that it leads into - the reaction / impact - was a VERY fast cut of scenes with very little scenery and a lot of black. I'm ADD so I caught the entire thing but there simply was a void of content in the scenes for those vital seconds of when the action begins. You hear lots of crashes and noise and shooting but there's a lot of black on the screen. Some people said they closed their eyes because it was just too jerky.We give this movie an extra star for the actors. Who plays Robocop? That guy who is always smoking and high on The Killing? Wait, he's a model too? Yep, that's him and his slow, and slight drawl with the sardonic twist is a perfect compliment to the character who needs to have a personality to differentiate him from the robot . Wonderful casting and if you listen to his voice, you hear his character from "The Killing" but you see him in a totally different light. Great job Joel Kinnaman! Michael K. Williams - Omar! Not to typecast but we just love seeing you in film and another great job. Gary Oldman - such a wonderful but tragic lamentation losing this role to a Brit playing an American - again. A truly incredible actor. Michael Keaton - great job as always. The other character actors did a fine job but I would have enjoyed Jay Baruchel's character being a little more underhanded like they are in real life capitalizing on tragedy without any conscience. Jackie Earle Haley - great to see you doing an awesome sociopath.Only thing is we felt there were references to a plot line that had been cut but sounded really interesting. Oh well. See this, you'll like it and money well spent.You won't wish you were somewhere else and its a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Expecting the worst from this movie, especially after tough critics, and being a truth real fan of the original, I can say that Padilha's Robocop do not disappoint.Many critics made the mistake of comparing this vision from the Brazilian director with Verhoeven's. I don't think Padilha actually dared to "remake" or "reboot" or "redone" a perfect movie. He just did a different movie. Same story, more or less, but with a different vision. Low : the score, the villains, and no or little sense of humor. High : special effect, direction, acting and action scenes.This movie is definitely not as bad as we could expect from a reboot (Total Recall, The Omen) and Padilha tentative to follow Verhoeven's steps is successful. Of course not as good as the original, how it could be ? But a real decent reboot from a director full of promises.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched it and yes I took the good with the bad.Without any spoilers i'm just going to assess the film.First half was terrible, until Murphy becomes Robocop there is nothing interesting, and frankly it's all a boring clich.Then however you are introduced to the best part of the movie, and believe me it's good.The main part/thesis is just brilliant. They get all the drama right, actors did a great job, this is when the movie fully comes to life.Climax - not so good.Kind of an anti-climatic final scenes as they build up to something spectacular, but fail to achieve it with a simple ending.Major pros: Murphy's transformation is great. This angle of him remembering everything was done way better than I expected, a true masterpiece.Satire was great, just like the original this one has all the modern mockery you need and then some, you just have to look a bit deeper.Great acting. Yeah, sure there are some phoned in performances here and there, but Abbie Cornish, Joel Kinnaman and Garry Oldman deliver when it matters most.Jackie Earl makes a hell of a role, although simple, it's satisfying!Cons:Boring Murphy before his "death". Running time needed to be longer - it was clear that they had to sacrifice some of the more dramatic tension scenes to the action ones, which are not really that good(except in the final third). With an extra 20 minutes to flesh out some parts and make some more interesting, this could have been a 8/10 movie.Clichd characters - Main protagonist was badly written, although portrayed nice. A police corruption that they could have dwelled deeper into.Uneven production values and timing of the script.A hope for a better sequel, now that they've laid out the foundations.Padilha, you the man! I hope the studio gives him more freedom the next time around and a longer running time.If a director's cut comes out and it's 15-20 minutes longer, we could be in for a more definitive movie experience, but as it stands my final score is a6.5-7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a huge fan of the 1st one, didn't care about them remaking, but I figured I would at least give it a chance. So after watching I can honestly say this is really bad, and should have been done. The action is about the only thing good about it, but unfortunately they bore you to death before it gets to the good stuff.The outfit was totally retarded looking. The story was okay, not to much in depth but that was this movies main problem. The characters none of them show any depth to them what so ever. I don't understand why you would pay big actors, to support a unknown actor, who seems to be a horrible actor, no emotion, no depth, and monotone to top it off, his wife wasn't any better either.They beat the fact that you should feel sorry for how they saved his life, by turning him into a android (half the movie). They could have done that in 10 mins and got to the good stuff, but no, they drew it out way to long.A movie about robotic future, that still uses basic cars, and gun's. Makes the robots look out of place. Just an awful remake, if you cant recreate something as good you should leave it be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid, Story-driven Reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of Paul Verhoeven's 1987 version of Robocop cried betrayal at even the idea of a remake, let alone it being a PG-13 action film. As a film on its own merits, this version of Robocop is a perfectly enjoyable and amiable effort at restarting the Robocop series, even though it does not reach the same heights as the original film.In the near-future, robot forces are essential to enacting American foreign policy and they are able to pacify any area, with a minimum need of human soldiers. While this is helpful around the world, the same robots are not allowed to be used on American soil, because of the Dreyfess Act, causing OmniCorp a problem as the American market is not open to them. To win the PR battle, OmniCorp's CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) suggests putting a man into a machine and hires Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), an expert at making robotic limbs to lead the project.In Detroit, Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is an honest police detective who wants to bring down Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow), a crime lord with corrupt members of the police in his pocket. Murphy barely survives an assassination attempt and he becomes the perfect candidate to become Robocop. Soon a debate rages on how much emotion and mental awareness Murphy should be allowed to have, as he starts to clean up the streets of Detroit. His wife, Clara (Abbie Cornish) struggles against both OmniCorp and the machine her husband has become.There was a lot of hostility towards the reboot of Robocop and the most harden of resistance will never be won. Somehow, this reboot does manage to stand on its own two feet, building up its own world, focusing on the drama, the politics, the science and the ethics in this future. In comparison to a remake of another Paul Verhoven film the 2014 version of Robocop sets out to tell a story and set up a world, while 2012&#x2032;s Total Recall was just a relentless slog of meaningless action scenes.Elite Squad's Jos Padilha took on the directing duties and he puts his own stamp on the series. He takes a more hyper-realistic look, similar to the Iron Man trilogy and The Amazing Spider-man, setting the film in a world similar to our own but with more advance technology. Padilha knows he cannot compete with Verhoven on the satire that made the original Robocop so loved, so plays the reboot straight and keeps the deadpan humour to a minimum.Despite the lack of satire Padilha and his writers do employ some political themes, namely the use of drones by the American military, how America project force around the world, while being safe within her own borders. The other major theme is the political battle between Sellars and Senator Dreyfess (Zach Grenier), how Sellars tries to win over the hearts and minds of the American public. Samuel L. Jackson is the character supplying a satirical edge as a Fox News style talk show host, using his larger than life persona to its fullest extent. Imagine Samuel L. Jackson if he was really right wing and you'll get the idea of what he's going for.The other theme is to what extent Murphy is, a man or a machine and how much free will and emotion he truly has. Padilha tackles the theme of how Murphy regains his humanity much differently than the 1987 version, taking a more scientific and philosophical approach. The 1987 was stronger, as Murphy's life and death is much more tragic, but the 2014 version was aiming to be more realistic and there is strength in the relationship between Murphy and Norton and the moral dilemma Norton suffers.One of the biggest criticisms the reboot was it has a PG-13 rating when the original was a hard-R. Padilha is an accomplished action director in Brazil and the reboot does supply strong action sequences, using a hand-held style and some shaky cam and has excellent special effects and CGI. There was a particularly stunning scene when Murphy sees how much of himself was biological after he became Robocop, showing his remaining organs.Robocop has an excellent cast and they all provide solid performances. Oldman was the strongest performer, as his character has the biggest internal conflict, as a man who wants to do good but slowly sacrifices his ethics. Kinnaman is decent in the lead: he can handle himself in the action scenes, but Peter Weller was iconic in the original film with his deadpan delivery and character arc.The original Robocop is always going to be a classic action film, yet the reboot is a solid sci-fi action film in its own right, taking the basic story of the original and letting the filmmakers make their own film. Robocop (2014) certainly does not join the hall of shame of remakes like Total Recall (2012) and the reboot is not the worst Robocop film (That rightfully belongs to Robocop 3).Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Origin Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robocop is a film directed by Jose Padilha, and stars Joel Kinnaman, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton and Abbie Cornish, and is a remake of the 1987 classic, and explores the origins of Robocop, and how detective Alex Murphy came to don the suit.To begin, Robocop has a pretty awesome ensemble. Kinnaman is fairly flat as Alex Murphy; he still gives a decent enough performance to pass though. He carries the film well enough; it's just a lot of the film, you don't even root for his character, something that isn't a good thing at all! I'd pin that on Kinnaman, as the dialog isn't that bad. The stand out performance, as expected, is Gary Oldman as the scientist, Dr. Dennett Norton. He's relatable, complex, and Oldman's performance makes him quite likable. Keaton gives a strong performance as well, playing the obligatory multimillionaire Raymond Sellars, as does Samuel L. Jackson, in a much smaller role. One of the biggest let downs, though, was Abbie Cornish as Murphy's wife, Clara. The character is annoying, stupid, and doesn't garner any empathy from yourself, which is down to both Cornish and the writers. In conclusion, for the most part, the ensemble nature of this film was executed very well, with some performances missing the mark.This film was written by 5 guys, and that obviously posed a problem. The film jumps around in intensity, seriousness and quality, and it's not good! It's as if all the writers got a 25 minute piece of the film that they could contribute to; the problem is that the vast majority of these writer's styles never mixed together to make something truly coherent. The first 45 minutes of this film, the origin story of Robocop, was executed near flawlessly. I enjoyed it immensely, thanks to Kinnaman and Oldman's back and forth, and the pace. Whoever wrote that first portion of the film deserves a pat on the back, because it was very well done, and had me invested in the film properly. Then the film dropped off in the action and dialog department, and became a clichd, boring action film. What did we get to watch Robocop do exactly in the second act of this film? Well, ride around on a motorcycle, and hit guys with a stun gun. The excitement! The film eventually finds itself a main plot line, one which allows Murphy redemption for what happened to him earlier in the film, which is interesting enough. But, at the beginning of the third act, the screenwriter, which ever one it is at this stage, decided to drop the plot line that had been established and concluded much too quickly for my liking, and continue onward with a new mission for Robocop that had my interest lowering by the second. Basically, the film felt, for the most part, incredibly disconnected, and the main plot line, the motivation for Robocop continually changes and modifies over the 2 hour running time; not something that should be happening!Robocop is famous for action; lots of blood, lots of guns, and lots of one liners whilst shooting those same guns. One of the most criticized decisions surrounding this remake, is the rating; a PG 13 Robocop film?! This is madness! And whilst it's not too much of a problem, it did irritate myself. Robocop finds himself using a stun gun throughout this entire film, for crying out loud! That's right, a stun gun! For fans of the original Robocop, and it's gory, awesome action, you should stay away from this film. Whilst the action is more fast paced and exhilarating, it's not nearly as memorable, and that is a problem when it comes to such a widely known character like Robocop.There were a few angles within the film which I certainly enjoyed, my favourite being that Murphy continually has to fight the robotic side of him. He doesn't necessarily have control over his body, his mind even, and watching him try and take control of himself, issue himself commands is interesting to watch. With a click of a button, Murphy has barely a slither of thought that translates into actual action. He can't jump around, take control of his own body, go wherever he wants. He has to adhere to this robotic side of him, which is trying to overcome the human side of him. Watching the inner dilemma that is this personal fight between himself and computer is something which I thoroughly enjoyed, and something that was quite well done.Ultimately, Robocop is a solid watch at the theatre. It's a fun, popcorn flick which doesn't require too much thought. Yet, the plot feels simply too mismatched to pass, and I hated Abbie Cornish here. I didn't have too many hopes for this film, and I was served correct by telling myself this was to be a disappointment.5.7/10To find reviews for film, scores and television episodes, go to www.entjunkie.blogspot.com!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What about the music?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could have forgiven that 'Rococop' was a convoluted mess. I might've enjoyed the film if it wasn't for the rock 'n roll music used in a scene that ought to have been great i.e. Robocop's second test in the abandoned factory and again at the end credits. And I might've liked 'Robocop' if it wasn't for the fact that Robocop leaps into the air e.g. after he gets out of the testing facility in China...ala 'Avatar' (another film I didn't think much of). And like 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' 'Robocop' starts promisingly, but descends into this repetitive mess and unlike the 1987 original I don't recall seeing this new Robocop reload and it's hard to tell if he's shooting people for real or just stunning them. And the ending on top of the OmniCorp building sucked; it was like they'd written themselves into a corner and just had to end it somehow; a climax on top of a building with a helipad...gee where I have I seen that before? 'Mercury Rising', 'Max Payne'? I was a fan of the original 'Robocop'; I saw it at the movies in 1987 and watched the R-rated version countless times on video, but this remake wasn't good whereas with a few simple changes e.g. using the Basil Poledouris's Robocop theme music for more than just for a few seconds then it could've been decent. On a positive note the ED-209's looked good and there were some good, fresh ideas e.g. that second test in the abandoned factory, but as I wrote it was spoiled by the music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it was a good remake and really showed the "Robocop" and his struggle between being a human and a machine, which i think the original failed to show in some parts. The action was amazing and there were so many ass holes that you want to see die in the movie and they get every bit of what is coming to them.There are a lot of people looking at this movie just as a remake and that is why i think a lot of people think it is a poor movie. You have to watch this movie as a new movie and not a remake, and if you aren't being so critical because it did something different from the original then it will be a better movie and experience. I thought the actors were descent and the story was similar to the original but with some new twists. The new design for the hero is really cool and nice looking. Over all i thought it was a good film because i looked at it as a whole new movie instead of a crappy remake that didn't live up to the original. I think it is worth to see in theaters but not worth buying to watch at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robocop Made in China</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2028, in Detroit, the OmniCorp has developed technology in the area of robotics and their drones have been used by different countries in military application. However the corporation does not succeed in using them to enforce the law in the United States due to the Dreyfus Act. When the detective and family man Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is lethally injured in an attempt with a bomb in his car, OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) convinces the scientist Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) and Murphy's wife to use his remaining parts in a robot with the intention of swindling the law and make a fortune with the drones. However the cyborg RoboCop is indeed seeking justice and will not stop until he finds those that destroyed his and his family's lives.The 1987 "Robocop" directed by Paul Verhoeven is a classic of the genre and every cinema lover certainly knows the story. This 2014 terrible remake is another example of the present Hollywood movies, with top- notch effects and nothing else. Why does RoboCop have a human hand if the intention is to be invulnerable? Prefer watching again the 1987 movie instead of this remake that is "made in China". My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "RoboCop"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weekly Movies with Juan Pedro- RoboCop(2014)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am still wondering why this movie was even made. Not only did the plot hardly get resolved, but the story itself was absolutely awful. There was barely a story to begin with. It was basically about a cop named Alex Murphy who has bad guys blow up his car as he goes in to it, leaving him critically injured. Some doctor ends up saving his life (Gary Oldman) with the consent of Murphy's wife. He is programmed to keep the streets of Detroit safe. What follows is an absolute mess of a story that is convoluted to the point of hardly making sense. The Samuel Jackson cameos are pointless, and the movie just sort of ends without many of the major issues being resolved. Again, this movie was entirely pointless and I hope to God that a sequel is not made because there is nothing to create a new story with! I guess if you are looking for an action movie, without much of a story, yet with good special effects, RoboCop fits the bill. But overall, this is lowest-common- denominator entertainment. Maybe I'll enjoy Pompeii more.2-2.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roboflop. Why did they bother???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the reboot of Robocop last night against my better judgement, and oh my word what a big pile of doo-doo it was. It is loosely based on the original, with a fair few technology updates. It naturally has a few action sequences but these are so obviously CGI they're just not worth banging on about. There were a few half-hearted nods to the original which basically told me "This should keep the fan boys happy". Trust me; they won't.Add to this that Joel Kinnaman is so boring and bereft of emotion BEFORE he is transformed into the "tin man", and the fact that the supporting cast, despite a few big names, are so bland they could have been played by anyone; it all adds up to a big pile of nothingness. Michael Keaton practically phones his performance in, Gary Oldman looks like he's just going through the motions, Jennifer Ehle looks like she can't be bothered and Abbie Cornish has all the character of beige paint. The only person in this film who appears to be marginally amusing is Jay Baruchel and he's hardly in it. Even the ED-209s are boring.There is a distinct lack of urgency; there were virtually no good one-liners (Jay Baruchel had about the only one) and even Samuel L Jackson (with "interesting" hair) had his favourite word bleeped as a TV presenter. The main criminal in the film is also so utterly faceless I genuinely can't remember what he looked like or who he was. It's poorly put together and above all, there's just no incentive to watch. They've left it open for a sequel. Oh dear.Watch the original. It's dated, sure. But it is SO much more fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional Humorous Satire Action movie (Minor Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enter the theater with zero positive expectation. In fact I expect a piece of disappointment on the level of Sony's Spider-man remake fill with dumb ass plot point (since it is another Sony production), in-line with loads of other 'dumb down' remake like Total Recall.But I came out well entertained and surprised.First of all, this movie shouldn't be compare to the now legendary serious themed violent original. It should be saw as a remake of the base concept only. One that pretty much done right for the current world / US political situation of 2014.Sony, who fund the movie perhaps learn from their spidy mistakes, seem to gave the movie makers a free hand on the scrip, hence this robocop is light on glory violence, but rather heavy on political satire humor.The underline story arc of the central character robocop is very simple, even more simple than the original one but it fit in well enough in the bigger picture that is the satire vehicle.Whenever there are no shootings, the stars of this movie is not the robocop but the supporting cast that made up with big names, like 'Holy Batman original' Michael Keaton doing a Steve Jobs inspired chairman of big US multinational company in search of the next iSuccess product at all cost. The bad-ass Samuel L. Jackson without his fists and light-sabre still gave the Fox USA network big mouth anchors a run for their money and Gary Oldman played his Dr character more believable than he did with Commissioner Gordon in the whole reboot Batman trilogy! Done to death but has to be there corrupt cop sub-plot aside, the film managed to show the audiences a couple of situation satires mirror the US policies today, among them: military robot troops walking on streets of occupied Iran, mega factories in China building high tech machines for US corporations while back in USA the factories are small but sophisticated illegal drug labs and illegal weapon processing plants. Cameras are everywhere, makes robocop's job look real easy so the Surveillance State justified! For me, original robocop is the political satire violent action thriller where audience expected to take it and its message seriously. This 2014 robocop is more of a 'tongue in cheek simplified' humorous political satire infused PG action film, audience don't have to take it seriously but it managed to get its messages across particularly for those understood the wit and reality of the situation. It can be done better but sadly we have to 'dumb it' down further for today's younger audience...One big complain of this movie is the Brazilian born director's experimental use of shaky cam action sequences that, in some scene, was done so badly that makes me think that first person handycam monster movie Cloverfield was shoot on rail! Thankfully it wasn't always the case.Over all this movie would be polarizing for the audiences, particularly some US audiences agree the opposite view would dislike it for the political satire messages it carries.If those political satire weren't there, then this movie will be less the mediocre, a 4/10. Simply because of those satire sections and a logically functional script, it elevated the movie to at least 7/10.To balance out the foreseeable 1/10 score from the haters in IMDb, apply how they rank Olympic performances by taking out highest and lowest scores, I will give this 10/10. Allow the score be better reflect its real standing sooner, avoid a situation like that hugely logic flawed The Dark Knight getting 9.5+ out of 10 for years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a bad reboot but a really bad movie in general</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so I can see what they were trying to do with this movie and actually for the first half hour I was on board with it, I especially enjoyed the opening sequence in the middle east, introducing us to the new robots which looked great but after that the movie starts to fall apart real quick.The satire in the movie is pretty unfocused and feels out of place most of the time, Samuel L Jackson does an OK job with what he's given to do although the look of his character is flipping ridiculous. And a lot of stuff in the flick just makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, for example Alex Murphy is supposed to be an undercover cop investigating illegal gun smuggling or some poop I have no idea, yet he chooses to have regular meetings with his police chief at the flipping police headquarters where everyone knows him and greets him by name! Hey Alex Murphy, if you're an undercover cop don't do this poop!! Meet a contact in a motel room or at a park bench you silly poop. I guess whoever wrote this flick just gave zero poops.Another problem with the movie is the pacing. In one scene in particular I felt like I was legit losing my mind watching it. Murphy comes home to see his family after getting chewed out by the chief at work, this is the first time we see him having any interaction with his family which is vital for the rest of the movie, this is supposed to be where we see the emotional bond which will define our main character and it lasts for about 10 seconds. I'm not kidding here, you can see all of this pivotal scene in the trailer. Murphy says about 3 sentences to his wife, pretty much dismisses his own son and then proceeds to get real frisky with his wife, like out of nowhere. Now I'm not saying you need an excuse but in the scene it feels seriously weird, I'm like does she even know this dude, does he have the wrong house?! And it's not like the movie was moving along at a good old pace before this, they took a long time setting up a lot of pretty pointless exposition. This is real basic film making here that is just getting thrown right out the window. Another central problem with the movie is the fact that it has like 5 bad guys, all of whom are not very clearly defined at all. So now you have no real reason to get behind RoboCop because he was pretty much a douche to begin with and no strong villain to motivate him either. On the positive side the special effects and the design of the robots and the suit (silver suit anyway) is great. The action sequences are fine but not quite on par with a lot of other recent movies to be honest. All in all this just feels like yet another review of yet another middling reboot. Uninspired, unnecessary and uneventful</fullReview>

(This might partly be because there are over 9000 too many Masked Rider films out there, mostly from Japan. I understand that the evil corporation thing is an easy fit for generic movie bad guys, but honestly it's pretty overused at this point). I just think this movie was too.... dry? It lacked any kind of charm in my opinion. The ending was supposed to be sad but I was completely unmoved... This movie just didn't work for me.

		<shortDescription>Turns itself into crashed, banged and walloped.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I was really disappointed by this movie, it seemed to fail to have what I would call courage &amp; conviction to play its part in the myth that is Robocop. While having a setting of more than just a theme of Cops &amp; Robbers, it delves into the world of corporate business that has a hold on the whole shebang. This is a lightweight contention that has a simple story of family, corruption, science and revenge; all-well-and-good, but it still lacks any grit that constitutes this type of genre. The lack of any no-holds-barred grown-up action lets it down that in turn makes this more of a Saturday Matine than a Midnight Movie. This was an experience without spirit, and at times predictable filmmaking, you simply saw what was coming next albeit in the script department, no originality and far too bland to warrant any real crash-bang-wallop. What, too, lets this film seem more than tedious is its touch of extreme narcissistic values on its repetitive characteristic that it has to perpetually tell the viewer that there is only one Nation and that within this one nation, and its one peoples', there is the only one alternative to this new, futuristic Brave New World. Its stance here quickly becomes sour and reaches the point of obnoxiousness that never recedes. This is more than reflective psychology but a dim look into an attitude that conveys a world of narrow vision and one-dimensional traits. The character's are too clichd, too stereotyped; bland and, once more, one-dimensional, while Mr. Oldman and Mr. Keaton do do their jobs finely but add no real depth to the score, the remainder are too easily forgot. The use of Samuel L. Jackson's Pat Novak, can, at best, be described as a wasted exercise; this go-between is an unnecessary attempt to project this films narrative further. This not only fails at its job, but also could well have diluted the films mainstay. Whilst the action sequences' and effects' are slightly passable it, while not too surprising and exciting, is barely holding the whole piece together, it slips quietly under the radar, only popping its narrative head up more than often to remind its viewer who, exactly, is its target audience. To conclude it is a weak project that could have being firing on all cylinders but instead tends to backfire due to the lack of any real want for the film to finish first at the finish line.</fullReview>

I was just 5 years old when i watched the original version of robocop 1 and 2. It was on a VCR tape back then and yet those scene still fresh in my mind.The best of all they focus on the automatic opening of the gun holster and gun spinning move.A slower robot,but forever in my mind as the one and only robocop...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really want to like 'RoboCop' seeing it on the big screen, but this remake is a far cry from the original.While it packs some nice action scenes and neat CGI, the continuity and choice of characters really derails the film.Firstly the villains are given way too little back story and time on screen, in addition to not be nearly as brutal, cold and cynical as in the original. That was essential to the satire of Verhoeven's adaption which makes his edition great. There's a reason that Murphy's demise and resurrection in the original remains some of the most discussed scenes because of their sheer rawness and brilliant production. In 2014 we are not even close to anything like that.The original film has a cold, industrial, unsettling feeling over it in line with Verhoeven's excellent criticism of corporate greed and exploitation of people that is central to the plot. The remake lacks all of this - very dull.Choosing Murphy to have a male partner also destroys the neat chemistry that the female Lewis had with Murphy in the first film. Again, the remake also lacks development for his character.The last 45 minutes or so are very unclear as to who the true villain is and Murphy's reason for his actions by then. Seemingly random events occur in a fast pace and it gets very confusing at times.Nopes, stick with the original, 'RoboCop' of 2014 is indeed the lame PG- 13 edition that its rating tells it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not so bad, but disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who knew the old RoboCop movies, this movie might be disappointing, because compared to the 80's movie, it lacks the amount of action scenes, gore, and "badassery" that RoboCop had, which felt like a real hero. This version of RoboCop is very different, focusing on Alex Murphy's feelings, and showing what it feels like to be Half man/Half machine. Being more of a Drama film than an action movie. But if we don't compare the old RoboCop to this Reboot. And take this as a completely new and different movie, it isn't so bad, at least half of it isn't. The first Half of the movie did pretty good in my opinion, it gave a dramatic opening to the story, and showed how much of a shocking change that Murphy's life is going through. But when he was sent to the streets, he kept switching from human to robot, back and fourth, and didn't have a villain or a main target, whoever he felt like taking revenge, he would go and kill, without almost any difficulties. There wasn't too much of a big conflict, something challenging for Murphy. In the last fight scene we knew he wouldn't be beaten, and when he's about to kill Sellars, it's very predictable that he will act more human and be able to shoot him.For an action movie story to be interesting and entertaining, there has to be a big conflict and a big challenge to the main character, which is what i thought it lacked the most in this.Being a half good/half "meh" movie, with decent characters and production. I give it a 6,5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robocop out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, whenever I watch a remake/re-imagining I always fear the worst. Such movies are always made because of a perceived monetisation potential by the studios, not because the original actually needs remaking. And when you are doing something solely to make money out of it, you have to question the artistic integrity of all involved.So, with Robocop, I prepared myself for the worst. For something as dire as the Total Recall remake, perhaps. I will say I was somewhat relieved as I watched Robocop that it wasn't as dumb as that particular movie. Upon reflection afterwards, however, I realised the movie, whilst better than I feared, was nowhere near as good as it might have been.First up, what made the original so good was the satire and the unashamed use of graphic violence. With this new version, there is neither.Oh sure, Sam Jackson gives a good showing as Sam Jackson, being shouty and preachy and trying to fill the satire gap with blatant political dogma. But it doesn't work. After the first time, I began to mentally groan every time they cut to the Pat Novak show. It was neither funny. nor satirical, for the most part, and took on the aspect of padding that bloated the film's runtime.Secondly, hamstrung by a PG-13 rating, this is a terribly uninteresting action movie. The only graphic violence displayed is towards CGI robots. Any violence towards humans or even Robocop himself, is hidden behind smoke, darkness, the flash of an explosion or, as in the film's major set-piece, a night vision sequence. The lack of violence is just painfully obvious.So, as a remake, this is a pale shadow of the original, made safe for younger audiences and, as a result, offering nothing memorable that will stay for you for longer than a day.So is there anything to like about this version? Well, not much. As I said earlier, it is an okay film. Reasonable acting, passable action (though it never excites you at all!), and a story that wobbles, but never quite falls down. The effects are, as you might expect, very good and are easily the biggest draw from this film.Joel Kinnaman isn't really convincing as Alex Murphy. He tries, but I think a more established actor would have had an easier time with the role. Most of the time he doesn't have to do much acting and is covered up by the suit. But if I compare him with, say, Karl Urban's turn as the equally acting-hampered Judge Dredd, then the better actor by far is Urban.Samuel Jackson needs to stop playing himself in movies. He gave a decent performance in The Avengers, but he needs to start turning down roles where he is required to shout and froth at the mouth. It's getting old REAL quick. I'd hate to see his appearance in a movie achieve the groan-inducing, immersion breaking level that Stan Lee has managed to accomplish.Abbie Cornish, as Murphy's wife, is given almost nothing to do except play the grieving widow. But she gets scant few scenes and is pretty much superfluous. It's like they decided to put in the relationship purely for the purpose of making Kinnaman not so unlikable as Murphy.Gary Oldman was the only bright spot, really. He seemed to be the only one that even had a clue what his character was supposed to be and he acted (sometimes a bit of overacting) the part excellently. It's sad in a way, since his performance only really served to put everyone else in a less favourable light.All in all, this was a disappointment, but no so big a one as I feared. It would be nice if, having decided to do a remake, Hollywood could actually spend some of the production cost on a proper assessment of the originals success and the reasons for that success. Lord knows, I don't want them to make scene for scene remakes like True Grit. However, if you hope for your remake to capture even a small amount of the popularity and goodwill that the original secured, you damn well need to examine what made that original so good.SUMMARY: Fair action movie. A shadow of the original hampered by its teen rating. No real villain, to speak of. Good effects, little real violence. Destined to be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lame remake with dumb satire and very little action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In today's Hollywood there's a structure of vested interests. Almost everything is owned by monopolies, a common situation in the United States now. The thing about monopolies is that, as time passes, they resist change more and more. So Hollywood has a formula that it follows closely, which is making profits with as little risk as possible. This means releasing big budget films mostly during the summer. Naturally, this formula offers little in terms of originality and inventiveness. RoboCop is just one of many films that have been remade to make a profit with little risk. It's because the original 1987 film was well-made and has many fans by now. I'm not saying that every remake is inferior however. Some remakes are good and a few, just a few, turn out to be better than the original. For example, Fright Night (2011) and Dredd (2012) are good remakes. But RoboCop (2014) is an inferior remake in every way. It's not really a disaster because the script contains a bit of originality. This same script, however, is the film's biggest problem. There's nothing smart or original about the particular brand of parody by screenwriter Joshua Zetumer. Interestingly, while the 1987 film criticized corporate power and the American media, the 2014 remake praises the excesses of American monopolies. The original showed viewers a society in decay and economic slowdown, but the remake shows a society with hardly any problems. To any intelligent person it should be clear that things are worse in America now than they were in the 1980s. In the original film director Paul Verhoeven added his own vision to Edward Neumeier's script. The result was a clever and tightly paced science-fiction action film with religious metaphors. RoboCop (2014) doesn't have any of that, nor does it offer anything new. This remake also has very little action for an action film. Instead viewers have to watch Alex Murphy reconnecting with his son and getting used to being a cyborg. Zetumer failed to conceive a strong villain or even a serious challenge for Murphy. Famous actors like Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Keaton are wasted since they don't have anything interesting to say or do. Joel Kinnaman is actually good as Murphy. In my opinion he's the only redeeming factor in this film, though Murphy was, like the other characters, written so poorly by Zetumer that Kinnaman doesn't have anything interesting to do. The black costume that he wears as RoboCop does not look good. He seems more like a cyborg in the grey costume, though the grey costume is used very little. As for director Jose Padilha, he complained that he had a very bad time filming this remake. It's obvious why. Not only did he have to deal with constant studio interference, but he also had to work with Zetumer's uninspired script. Another thing that makes RoboCop (2014) worse than it already is is the unmemorable music score by Pedro Bromfman. Thanks to the popularity of the original film, an effective marketing campaign, and the right release date, this 2014 remake managed to make a profit. Still, the box office returns aren't as impressive as those of the original 1987 film. Some people are hoping for a good sequel to this remake, but I'm not enthusiastic about that. Considering Hollywood's recent track record of little inventiveness I doubt that the sequel will impress even if it does get made. Obviously, I don't recommend RoboCop (2014). At least we have RoboCop (1987) and RoboCop 2 (1990).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A generic retelling of Robocop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Robocop is a great film that combined biting satire, over the top violence, and a cool revenge story about robotics and ethics to bring a great sci-fi actioner. Of course, it has to be remade for a modern era and now we have Robocop 2014. Does it live up to the original? Nope. Does it destroy the legacy? Not really as long as Robocop 3 exists, but it is very middle of the road.Good: I will say that the portion of the film dedicated to Alex Murphy getting used to the suit was handled really well. They tackled some interesting themes regarding free will, ethics, what is deemed good for the people or for business, and of course the takeover of big companies in our police force and it is interesting. Having Gary Oldman as the scientist in these scenes doesn't hurt either. The action is slick and it moves at a good pace. I even liked the new version of the suit.Bad: Much like the Total Recall remake, it's all just pointless at the end of the day. The remake doesn't really try anything new or even makes the previous movie and build up on it. It just goes through the motions in the most mediocre way possible. Plus, they had Michael Keaton without him hamming it up was a mistake as the movie needed some sort of a memorable villain.Overall, it's just another needless remake. This will be designed to take up space on shelves for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RoboCop is a 2014 American science fiction action film directed by Jos Padilha.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robocop is one of these sci-fi movies that warn us about our future. Robocop's main idea is that if we've been able to create advanced robots in the future, we might not be able to control them. Robocop gives us the misconception that these robots might one day control us!The movie takes place in 2028 where cops in all countries are replaced by robots except America. America's government doesn't accept the idea that something that does not feel any guilt or remorse could be able succeed as a cop. They also claim that these robots would one day get out of control and start disobeying their orders.Raymond Sellers (Michael Keaton), the guy behind these robots, wants to find a solution to introduce his robots in America. He finally decides to get a man in control of the robot by making it half human, half robot. He searches for all human cops appropriate for this project till he finds the perfect man Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman).Alex Murphy, an injured cop, is not going to survive without fixing this robot to his body. After his wife's approval, Raymond Sellers orders his scientists to fix the robot to his body. The new Alex Murphy also known as Robocop becomes a huge success, and gets accepted as a cop in America.Alex starts to lose his humanity and starts to change into a complete robot. Raymond Sellers refuses to mention Alex's changes to the public, but Alex's family starts to get suspicious and claims that there's a problem in him.After many internal conflicts, Alex Murphy manages to return back to his real self. After realizing what Raymond's organization has done to him, he decides to get revenge. He kills him, kills the people responsible for his injury in the first place, and gets his beloved family back.We might one day in our future create a robot to replace cops, but it's a fantasy to say that these robots will one day develop a mind of its own and start doing what it wants. A robot is a robot whether we are in 2028 or 2014.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another generic remake of a timeless classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are a disease in film making that sadly is becoming popular. Now not all remakes are bad movies such as the King Kong remake was pretty good, John Carpenter's The Thing was a great movie and those Hammer Horror classics were awesome as well. But other than that, 98% of remakes stink. This one is no exception. The plot is pretty much the same as the first one, Alex dies but by a car bomb instead of getting shot to death. Which gets me on my first problem with this movie it is rated PG-13 so sorry fans but, no gore. Another problem is the acting. It is pretty bad I thought. Everyone is so bland and boring I think watching my toothbrush do a performance would be more enjoyable than watching these actors perform. Another problem is that the family is involved with Alex's problem. In the original movie, one of the biggest reasons why we connected with Alex was because not only did he lose his life and turn into a robot, but he also lost his family. In the remake, Alex sort of loses his life (He is half man and half machine which is pretty dumb if you ask me) and he doesn't lose his family at all. Another problem is that there is not really a villain until the end of the movie when out of nowhere Michael Keaton's character (yet again so bland that I actually forgot his name) just turns evil. Why? Because..."Shhhh! Just go with it!" (Ugh). And all the bad guys in this movie are also forgettable. In the first one you knew who the bad guys are and you wanted them to pay for their actions but in the remake, you don't know them because they are only on the screen for 5 seconds. The action scenes are another big problem too because they are not all that great and are boring. So overall, I could go on for years why this movie sucks, but in one word I can say that it is BORING. Very boring movie. Most of the time it is business talk about Robocop and their is barely any Robocop action because the annoying wife and kid stops him from bringing down crime. And Robocop uses a taser. I freaking taser and a generic little machine gun instead of his cool pistol. And Robocop has humanity even though he acts like a robot the whole movie. And there is a twist that makes no sense near the end. Boring, bland, stupid, and pointless are 4 words to describe this movie. 3/10 this movie is one big stinker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HK Auteur film review - Robocop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its combination of B-movie kitsch, sci-fi action and satirical social commentary, Paul Verhoeven's original Robocop was a product of its time. Having thoroughly enjoyed it as a child on VHS, I owned a Robocop action figure, played the Robocop video game on Gameboy and even faithfully watched the sequels without any sense that the stories started to deteriorate in quality. Initially the first film worked as a highly violent action film and it was only later as an adult that I caught on with the satirical bits. Hearing about this upcoming Robocop remake, I wondered if those satirical elements would work again. Yes, technology today has now caught up with what was shown in the original film, but that doesn't necessary mean there is anything substantial to be attacked satirically. I assumed it was going to be more focused on the action sci-fi elements. But my prediction was wrong. The new Robocop gets right what I thought it would have fumbled, the social satire, and drops the ball exactly where I never would have expected, namely the Robocop story itself. The satire elements with Samuel L. Jackson doing a parody of Fox News, makes up for the most entertaining segments but it is the only condensed source of satire. The satire works and is surprisingly relevant, but it is not as naturally incorporated into its fictional world as the original. Every segment with Jackson's TV host feels like a break from the main narrative. Joel Kinnaman does a decent job with the material he is given, but the story is essentially not focused on Alex Murphy. The remake version of Murphy and he is not portrayed as a warm friendly guy like Peter Weller, or at least the story is not showing it. It is a long wait before Robocop officially becomes Robocop and does the Robocop thing, as we are shown the entire production process of his creation. It is here in the second act where the story starts to sag. It is also where the action scenes begin, which are decently designed and choreographed, but ultimately are dull because there is no gravitas behind them. Abbie Cornish plays Murphy's wife seriously, replacing Nancy Allen's Officer Anne Lewis as Murphy's anchor to his own humanity, is unfortunately wasted from having no character progression or payoff. The R-rated violence was an essential element to the original Robocop, establishing great nasty villains and touched upon themes of dehumanization and human conscience versus the judgment of a machine. Whether the ultra violence is included in this telling is irrelevant. There are many things movies can get away with a PG-13 rating now than in the eighties. I do not need this remake to be ultra violent. What I want is the scenes to be emotionally gripping, and this did not achieve that.The main debate between Gary Oldman's kindhearted robotics scientist and Michael Keaton's slimy Omnicorp CEO, representing the individual versus the corporation, is the heart of the film. And it is quite ironic actually. Even down to making Robocop black and riding a black motorcycle, visually reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight (frankly, the original suit still looks cooler), Robocop plays like a film that has taken been workshopped by a committee of producers. Robocop, or as he referred to in the film, "the Tinman", just needed more heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No too bad of a sci fi remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie is pretty action packed. There really is no boring dialogue. If you are going to compare it to the original it's still pretty damn good. Of course most remakes are not as good as the originals, but you can't rent the old robocop at red box nor can you see it on Netflix or blockbuster which is now bankrupt. So for those of you that never saw the 80s robocop, which is probably 80% of you, its a great flick! I saw the original back in the 80's, and enjoyed this one all the way through. It is better than Walter Mitty, gravity, her, and every other over dumb over-hyped flick out there. Now you can tell this is a real review. I don't use $100 words on here that no one can understand. Would give it a solid 7 for a great Saturday night flick to see with your chick. Not an Oscar worthy flick but an excellent remake and not a bore at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard they were making a Robocop remake, I thought it had potential to be really good. Especially when I saw the cast that was going to be in the movie. Overall I thought this movie was good.Alex Murphy is a cop who gets badly injured and nearly dies. So they decide to use him to try and make a new law official that is part machine as well.(Robocop) Along the way problems take place due to Murphy's own thoughts and feelings conflicting with that of the machine part of him.I thought the story and the conflict was pretty easy to follow. I did not get blown away by anything in the story, it was pretty much what I expected and nothing fancy. However I will say that this film did add interesting conflict with Murphy's family wanting to see him since in the Robocop movie in the 80's he did not really have a family. Also I liked how there were arguments over whether artificial law officials would be able to work. I thought it was a cool idea. I really liked some of the acting performances in this film. Michael Keaton was great, I always like him in movies. Also I really liked Gary Oldman as the doctor who helps to create Robocop and later sympathizes with Robocop and his family.The action scenes were good, but it seemed like there were too many scenes showing Robocop riding for a long time on his motorcycle. Robocop as a character was a mixed bag for me. I think that was because he had so many different types of personalities in this film whether it be him being controlled mainly by Murphy's thoughts, or whether it be when he was mainly a machine. I thought the guy who played Robocop was OK, but nothing special. I liked the new design of Robocop's black outfit and I also liked how they used the classic silver outfit for a little bit as well. I thought there were too many times when Robocop had his visor up, but that seems to be a new thing in movies like this nowadays, they want to show the actors face. Overall I thought this film was entertaining, but nothing too special. I still recommend checking it out though, especially if you are a fan of Robocop.</fullReview>

The action is nice and the suit is cool(I wonder how the actor actually wore it all the time during the shooting of the film). Aside from the wardrobe the plot is where they lost some of the stars, in truth its a 7.5(I voted 8 to increase the rating) star movie, but if you subtract Samuel L. Jackson I think it would have been an 8. His facial expressions during his speeches reminded me of a frog.Moving away from animals and on to robots and the robocop. The movie is different then the original which makes it good. The story is different, the villain is different. They did not stick to one main villain, they just threw a couple in the movie and it jumped from one to another. Robocop avenged his death in approximately 60 seconds. Coming in shooting all the bad guys and leaving, also they did not make the bad guy bad enough. He was just a gun dealer who paid off some cops, so what? The good of the movie is his training and becoming robocop, the virtual reality, the not so distant vision of the future made it look and real as we are in the not so far distant future. But why could the producers and the CGI crew make the background slightly more realistic in the office view.They could have attempted to through a spin into the movie, revealing that the owner of omnicorp was a devious mastermind and was ruthless from the start planning to destroy robocop after the bill was passed, but unfortunately they did not. Maybe it would have been for the better or for the worse, but a more evil and twisted villain was needed in this movie to make it great. Otherwise, sorry you are honestly a 7.5 star movie. You were onto something, but lost it.</fullReview>

But I still went ahead and paid to see this new version, despite my reservations, and you know what? It's actually...pretty good! Yes, it lacks the original's humour and ultra-violence, but that's OK, because the 2014 version manages to hold its own in different ways. It does suffer from being a little rough in places (especially at the beginning), and some of the latter scenes lack oompf, but these are minor gripes considering that I was captivated from start to finish.

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the original Robocop movie with Peter Weller, Ronny Cox and of course Kurtwood Smith. I found the new one to be more psychological and Joel Kinnaman's facial features resemble a young Malcolm McDowell of Clockwork Orange fame. The part where the camera repeatedly zooms in on his face, specifically his eyes and he goes into seizure reminds you of the brainwashing scene in Clockwork Orange. The new suit was pretty sleek but the red light over the visor and the glows at night reminded me of Tron. I was kind of disappointed the way his character was injured with a bomb on his car, in the original the bad guys pumped Alex Murphy full of bullets. Speaking of bad guys, there's really no villains unlike the predecessor. Mostly it's criminals and bad dudes with an agenda and it lacks the build up of a rivalry. There were parts where it reminded me of a video game with the shootouts, part of it looked like a Terminator movie. There are better ways to tribute the old movie instead of rehashing old lines like "dead or alive, you're coming with me." Also, using the exact same large two-legged drones was unnecessary. However, this remake was better than Paul Verhoven's Total Recall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happens in case of most remakes, we tend to compare the movie with the old one, and still don't want to see the old one in the theater's. Thus it is always an immense pressure on the directors to create something that would satisfy. We still tend to criticize and kill the inspiration for the directors. those who survive the process, lives with the name tag of 'classic', for example, John Carpenter's 'The thing'. but another pathetic death of a remake would be 'Dredd' which was a remake of Sylvester Stallone's 'Judge Dredd' and as a movie would have quite surpassed the original, and introduced some unique perspective to look at the character rather than the stardom of 'Sylvester Stallone'. But again false expectations killed the good movie.Robocop was an instant hit, when they referred a 'Cyborg' solution to the anarchic social condition with this movie... and that movie is classic till date. With the new Robocop, the Director, or the story-writer has tried to relate an upcoming robotics base society, which we already see, and tried to focus on the human part that is trapped in between. Then we as audience want to see anarchy, which is quite impossible in the present day, with a more stable economic structure of the technically advanced countries. Then we want it not to be PG13+, but bloody and gory. But if Robocop the earlier one was hit for, they were liked by young audience, and cartoon series, video games are the proof.We should better stop compare with the old one, and should watch it as the new audience its meant to. For me this movie was good enough, and 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie and dark subversive humor about our use of tech and drones. Very well done. Oh and those long moments of talking, that I keep hearing people complain about, well that's called character building. The hand was for that emotional touch to keep him human, so his remaining flesh could touch his loved ones it keeps him from feeling too much like a robot. It was more emotional to see him walk past his family with no recognition, since we actually got to see his love for his family and the visceral pain he had being separated from them. The social political commentary focuses on our own personal love and reliance on tech. How yes our troops are safer when drones are used, but who is accountable for collateral damage? We rely on tech, but at what cost to humanity. Or take Novak, a liberal o'rely as it were, a futuristic liberal Larry king live. As Robocop predicts, maybe when drones start flying over our heads as a day to day commonality, we will become more and more complacent with tech taking over more and more of our lives, sliver by sliver. This movie had a lot to say, and it did it very well. The first Robocop is still a better film, but only just that smidgen better because of the amount of dark humor that was prevalent in Verhoven's Original. But this film way surpasses the Frank Miller scripted sequels, 2 &amp; 3. The emotion by the lead was so expressive, and the acting perfect. It plays with morals, corporations, economy, military, politics, everything that is prevalent in today's society. And thusly it succeeds. And on a lesser note, the action is really good, and Robocop is not indestructible! He gets messed up, terminator style. So out of all the remakes of the past decade, this one ranks as one of the absolute best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low on Finesse, but High on Clarity, Theme and Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just seen this film, I feel compelled to come to its defense. I did not have high expectations going in, and am generally skeptical of such remakes. However, Robocop pleasantly surprised me. Is it great? No, but it's very solid, and in my opinion succeeds where many other sci-fi films fail. It's worthwhile, to my surprise.The negative is that the screenplay and direction have an almost complete lack of subtlety. The dialog often beats you over the head, and the plot often steamrolls any hope of finesse. However, and it is a big however, this film possesses exceptional thematic clarity. It's not a muddy mess of unrealized storytelling ambition. It's very concise, and it hammers home its timely social commentary with great efficiency. That is a virtue.Beyond that, this film has a ton of heart, courtesy of both the family dynamic (Abbie Cornish is terrific as the wife) and Gary Oldman's scientist. The characters have emotional resonance, which is more than some films can say (Elysium IMO). The cast is very good in general: Oldman, Cornish, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton, Jennifer Ehle, etc. The lead takes some getting used to, but he does a good job.Ultimately, I think that this is a good, solid thematically relevant sci-fi film. It gets its point across, has excellent visuals and action sequences, and a superb cast. It may not be a top-tier film, but it certainly does not deserve to be dismissed as a poor one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why so serious?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did like to start this by asking why is there so much criticism about this movie? Jos Padilha has managed to bring a new Robocop reboot to us which is quite good if you stop whining about how this is not good compared to the one from 80's. The director have made some action movies before, not sci- fi but he did make this Robocop movie, which in my view is awesome. Joel Kinnaman's acting was good and he did justice to the role. The way his character breaks down when he first sees himself as a machine and later when he goes to avenge his murder was good. Abbie Cornish is beautiful and I think the main villain in this movie should have been more evil. But none the less, this is a good reboot to one awesome character called Robocop!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though comparison with the original is inevitable, and I find the original to be much better, and the action scenes much more satisfying, I will avoid mentioning it in my criticism towards the reboot.There's more bad about the new Robocop. First is the training section. Robocop is tested against 47 Omnicorp robots. However, since the opponent robots are far less advanced (shield, hardware and software) the test seems to be futile. What does this test? I would expect to see a test where Robocops' human side would be a factor and not just being a better machine.Another issue that bothered me was dealing with micro details, like bypassing cognition and fixing level of emotions. Nobody seems to understand anything about it, so trying to invent some explanations to justify the actions seems very stupid and annoying. The relationship of Alex Murphy and his wife is already mentioned by the other reviewers and I will just side with those saying it was too much.There were some good points: Joel Kinnaman looked very mature for the role of Alex Murphy, Michael Keaton played his role well. I liked the action scene in the end (though it was a short one) and the use of information (and its' analysis) was a very good move. However, in my opinion, these strong points were much outweighed by concentrating on unnecessary, weak points mentioned above and the result is a movie with very indecisive plot.Samuel Jacksons' role seems to be derived from directors' Ellite Squad: The enemy within, the show host, with right political views, Guaracy. Up until some point, I thought it was a nice idea of explaining the political background through the news. Later it has really started to burden.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What??! An average of 6.70 rating?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So long story short, me and my cousin, and my sister all decided to go to the movies. It was either Robocop of Ride Along, we had a tight schedule. We decided om Robocop, based on the commercials and that my cousin had seen the original including my sister. When I got in the theater I expected at least a 5 star to a 7 star movie. This went above my expectations! I thought the action was great and wonderful, though the wife was bit bland and over exaggerated at times, and the kid was bland too COMPLETELY all throughout the movie. Could have given the child some character, even he looked like a robot. Haha, good one right? Anyways, it was a great film and very enjoyable, it was also nice seeing Officer Gordon from Batman in this movie (he plays a scientist btw)! A great pick for a family movie, though not the best it was still good and does not deserve an average 6.70 rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In comparison of Old and New</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay here is my review of the Robocop Remake that I saw tonight: Comparing it to the original there is no contest, considering when you measure something that has two completely different time periods it was created in. The original Robocop lacked special effects due to it being a time when digital effects of the needed magnitude were sorely lacking. But made up for it with amazing character development and story. Alex Murphy played by Peter Weller was a brilliant combination of both portraying human emotion through a machine and a trying to cling on what made him human. It like all movies had little flaws here and there but was ultimately a life changing movie for me as a young boy. Beyond the shadow of a doubt comparing the movies would not be entirely fair because of the high standards I place on the Original.That being said the new movie also had its hitches for me on the note that I wasn't a huge fan on who they cast to play Alex Murphy but Joel Kinnaman did the role some justice so I can look past that he is no Peter Weller. I know we have come along way in digital effects I just wish this movie clung to a little bit of old school with some of the moments to make it look more believable. I thought the movie as a whole was very entertaining and I would see it again if you watch it as a stand alone movie it was quite enjoyable I would say it was like watching the Rock play in Walking Tall... Not classic movie worthy but definitely worth watching worthy I give it a 7 out of 10 overall and would recommend people watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the hell did I just saw.I started watching Robocop 2014 thinking there is NO WAY it could match the original, seriously, Paul Verhoeven did a fine movie back then, so, you can pretty much see that I started this movie with negative prejudice.Oh boy how wrong I was. The original was very good but nowhere near this one. The amount of topics this movie touches far exceeds what Paul did on the original Robocop, the Plot is expanded, like 10 times from the original, the acting is superb with great actors too and the general dilemma, dialog and transformations that Alex Murphy goes into this movie are incredible, Paul Verhoeven did a very violent movie about a man who is inside a robot body while Jos Padilha did a brilliant sci-fi flick about a man transforming into a robot and going back to be human and all the choices that define what he is.Robocop 2014 is a much improved version from the original. I know that some people review this movie with 1 star, thinking there is no way this movie can match the original, I even felt that myself before watching it but, guess what, IT IS, get over with, the original just pale in comparison, in fact, it's the first remake that I can safely say improved on the original idea.There was nothing more to add to the original Robocop, that's why we got those pathetic chapters afterward while this one merits a whole new saga with the much expanded universe they managed to create.You have to be really in denial to think the original is better, the plot for one is vastly improved, the action is there in the right moment, the dialog is all well placed and the natural dilemma of robot vs human is all there for us to rejoice.This is a superb Sci-Fi flick and this comments comes from a guy who watched the original more than 30 times.Please, do not believe the critics, or the bad reviews, go watch this movie if you're a fan of sci-fi and you will absolutely love it.It is a solid 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I attribute my negative votes here to people who haven't actually read my review, but are voting down all positive reviews- So you can ignore those.I watched this, then I watched the original, then I watched this again.The Original has some very unique stuff in it, and some wholly enjoyable Gallows Humour as well.But this one is over the top, but even so it sticks to the main story of the original. What I liked was the use of the "ED-209s" - Which in the original were probably the last time stop motion was ever used in a big budget movie.The story was modernized just enough to make it more plausible, maybe in some Future, entire limbs can be replaced and maybe you can even play classical guitar with them- It's more believable today than it was in 1987, when a guy's head was stuck on a robot body and he had to eat Baby Food.Which is just about what happens to Murphy in this one, but we just get to see a little more of that Process.Jackie Earle Haley (Rorshach/Watchmen) steals a lot of this, not speaking like Wolverine like he did as Rorshach, but like a normal guy. Micheal Keaton is "Raymond Sellars" head of OmniCorp or whatever serves as OCP in this, he takes over the Ronny Cox role from the original- But in some ways he is even more sleazy.Gary Oldman has been playing a long succession of "Good Guys" - Gordon in Batman, Sirius Black in Harry Potter. Here he is the doctor that makes Robocop happen, Dr. Dennett Norton.Instead of the guy saying "I'll buy that for a dollar" we have Samuel L Jackson as Pat Novak. In the original, we were peppered with hilarious news reports of dire world events and some insane fake commercials. That aspect is removed from this remake and instead we have "The Novak Element" - A Right Wing News show.But mainly we no longer have Peter Weller as Robocop and his funny One- Liners, we have Joel Kinnaman as an Alex Murphy who is about to expose an arms dealer, but someone from within the police department is a rat for Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow).In Robocop (1987) we have "Objective 4 (Classified)" - In this one we get something new.Mainly it is the exact same story as the Peter Weller version, with enough changes to make it into a fresh story again. And there are several nods to the short lived Robocop TV show.The Original took place in a future landscape that was surrealistic, always with "Delta City" being built in the background. That was Verhoven. This one looks like it can be happening today,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You dumb Americans, Iran has been always safe and will be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts in Tehran, Capital city of Iran, and one of the safest place on earth. S.L. Jackson says: "For the first time in their lives they get to watch their children grow up in an environment of safety and security". Screw you Joshua Zetumer, you are one of the most hateful idiots I've ever heard of. What do you know about Iran? less than Nothing. Of course you may know Iran well BUT you just want the world hate us for nothing... There is NO terrorist action in Iran. USA is way more dangerous environment than our beloved beautiful country. You've mistaken Iran for Afghanistan or Iraq! Even these countries were safe before American troops invaded them. Maybe I would rate this move 9 out of 10 if Iran weren't involved in it. We Iranians are strongly offended for nothing in Hollywood movies. I was just coping with second heinous movie 300 and now I have to deal with this movie. Iran has a nuclear program that is about to solve through diplomatic solutions... that's all. There is no sign of terrorism here. In USA you can't go for a marathon in a big city like Boston but your movies are demonstrating it as the most important and safe place in the world (which is NOT) and Iran as... I don't know what else to say... Totally disrespectful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd buy that for a dollar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Expectations were low. The trailers were flashy and slick and seemed to be packed with lifeless CGI ? but then, watching the finished film, you realise that's the point. The action is shot with the eye of a modern gamer, clean and bloodless: this NuRoboCop is a film about sanitisation; about how we use technology to scrape the dirty human elements from our pristine institutions.Joel Kinnaman plays Alex Murphy, the decent cop left for dead by a mob hit, but then brought back to 'life' with the help of a sleek metal exoskeleton. The scene in which Murphy sees what's left of him ? not much ? is quite chilling. There are various forces fighting for or against the acceptance of a robot enforcer on the streets of America. There are also those who worry about how much of Murphy is really human, and how much is just a human face. Thematically, the film probably bites off more than it can chew, but that's preferable to a film without bite.There are a lot of dialogue scenes, many of them straightforwardly debating the ethical dilemmas at hand. Remember that lunch scene in Jurassic Park, where the only guy in the room to support Hammond's vision is the "bloodsucking lawyer"? RoboCop has half a dozen such scenes, always relevant, never dull or dry. It's a smart movie.Samuel L. Jackson is the narrator for this tech-age tragedy: a Fox News-style conservative tubthumper, espousing the value of social discipline at the expense of the values of humanity. Michael Keaton is brilliantly slimy and charismatic as the appropriately named Sellars, a corporate emperor controlling every ingredient of his snake oil. Between Sellars and Murphy is Gary Oldman's Dr Norton, a sympathetic Frankenstein with Murphy's best interests at heart, but who's too busy watching his tree grow to see the forest burning around him. And there is also Mattox (Jackie Earle Haley), a military man who fears he'll no longer have the chance to scratch his itchy trigger finger.There are a few flaws. As I said, the film touches on many themes, asking pertinent questions along the way, without exploring in great depth. Perhaps it could have been more focused. The music ? other than the classic theme ? is bland and characterless. Speaking of characterless, poor Abbie Cornish is wasted as a cypher again, reduced to holding back tears and defiantly swallowing grief as Mrs Murphy. The scenes between Murphy and his family are far less engaging than the banter between Sellars and Norton. And finally, the iconic ED-209s are disappointingly underused.At the risk of incurring the wrath of fans, this is one remake which improves on the original in many ways. It may lack the boldness and humour of Verhoeven's satire, but it also brings the story into a new era, with its concerns about drone technology, the perception of law enforcement in the context of competing 24-hour news, and the blurred role of government-approved media. It seems like the critical consensus on RoboCop is quite cold ? but let's be clear, this is no lazy reboot like Clash of the Titans or Total Recall. It's a film that deserves to be taken seriously on its own merits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RoboCop 2014 is no classic but is fun to watch to a certain extent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For every generation, there comes a film that stands out among other films of its genre and gets praised by both moviegoers and film critics in the decades that followed. Such a film may not have made gigantic movie ticket sales during the time of its release but its substance and acclaim made it a classic among its admirers. This is true with 1987's RoboCop directed by Paul Verhoeven. That film stood out among 1980s action flicks not only due to its over-the-top action but also for its outstanding direction, solid performances and overall subversive expression (can you say anti-Reaganomics?). This year, we have the remake of RoboCop starring Joel Kinnaman, supported by veteran actors Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman, and directed by Jose Padilha. Aside from looking flashy and futuristic, the new RoboCop movie is surprisingly good and different enough from the 1987 original to stand on its own.Made for a PG-13 audience in mind, RoboCop tells a very different version of the story of police officer Alex Murphy with a setting that is near-futuristic and yet reflective of today's manipulative corporate media environment. Like in the old movie, something terrible happens to Murphy which leads to his becoming RoboCop done by a corporation led by Michael Keaton.This is where the similarity with the old film ends. Unlike in the old movie, Alex Murphy becomes RoboCop with the consent of his wife who really loves him and wants him back with their family. On the corporation itself ? Omnicorp ? the movie seems less critical on corporations which is no surprise since there is no more anti- Reaganomics influence here. This does not mean that the in-movie corporation is a good organization. Like the 1987 movie, this film touches on themes like the conflict between humanity and technology, corporate media manipulation of public perception, the conflict between free will and programmed constraint, etc. The new movie tackles those themes with its own set of flavors to give today's viewers something relevant. Speaking of relevance, it sheds light on modern geopolitics as well as serious developments that test national laws. RoboCop is also a lively reminder about society and its people gradually heading towards totalitarianism.More on RoboCop himself, the film did a nice job explaining how Murphy turned into a machine and how the corporation used him as their premiere tool against a federal law that bans unmanned drones in America. The aspect of family for RoboCop is a welcome approach as it really set it apart from the old RoboCop films' concept. Apart from storytelling, the acting is overall solid. Samuel L. Jackson as the TV show host is much more lively than he was in the superhero movies of recent years. He sure makes a great host who is entertaining and engaging. Michael Keaton as the head of the corporation performed well although I was not convinced with the way his character turned out in the end of the film. Joel Kinnaman as RoboCop is pretty bland although he makes a convincing family man. His wife played by Abbie Cornish did a good job as the caring wife and mother. Jakie Earle Haley is the antagonistic and easy-to-hate Rick Mattox and he fits in well in the film Nothing special from Haley though.The standout performance belongs to Gary Oldman as Dr. Norton. Oldman is very lively in his role and thanks to him, Dr. Norton is a more engaging character to watch than RoboCop himself. Really, Oldman stole the spotlight many times in the film and almost feels like a protagonist. Action? There are several action scenes indeed but if you are expecting a spectacular action sequence or set piece, you will be disappointed. With the action it has, RoboCop is still satisfying to watch as there are a lot of gun battles, some explosions, some special effects combined with stunts, etc. I should mention that RoboCop in this film is faster and more agile too. Conclusion RoboCop of 2014 obviously will not win any major awards nor will it ever displace the 1987 RoboCop from its place in cinematic history but it is good enough on its own. Think of RoboCop 2014 as a less reflective but action-packed and modernized take on the RoboCop concept. I came into the theater with modest expectations and I left more amused than expected. I should say however that the story fell apart somewhat during the last thirty minutes as there were some scenes or happenings that were not believable. Overall, RoboCop 2014 is no classic but is fun to watch to say the least. http://sharkey360.blogspot.com/2014/02/movie-review-robocop-2014-by- carlo.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The RoboCop Rises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RoboCop starts with a futuristic news program called The Novak Element and our host is Pat Novak (Samuel.L Jackson). On The Novak Element they are discussing why the USA does not have robot police, the answer is simply the US does not want them, but everywhere else but the US has these robot police. Then cutting to Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnamen) our hero we see he is a cop just trying to bring justice into the world, he comes to close to discovering a drug empire and the truth behind two cops, so Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow) plants an explosive on his car, later that night the explosion goes off and almost kills Murphy although OmniCorp, the corporation that created the robot police now looks to Murphy as the American people want a person pulling the trigger. And so Murphy becomes RoboCop. From here the movie becomes smoother and we see Murphy suffer as he needs to do his duty but he misses his old life and family. Then we see Murphy solve his own murder and he finds the two moles in the police force and threatens the chief when he finds she might be guilty, although he is shut down before he can do anything. After this i felt the movie became smoother until we came to a sloppy ending. There are a few goofs in the movie and one or two 'jokes' but the movie takes itself way to seriously to actually put a successful joke in. All round the CGI and visuals were good for the most part, the story was good but not great and the acting was good but the strongest character in my opinion was Dr. Norton (Gary Oldman). All round RoboCop was good but perhaps it was made to close after the original. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm sick of films like this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So disappointed with this film just another attempt to make Muslims look like terrorist, the movie basically conditions people to believe that the middle east is full of terrorists. The film was set in a local area with scared Iranian citizens disturbed by US robots who shoot to kill. But of course the film interprets it as if US robots are trying to make Iran a safer terror free place to live. But in my opinion the robots where disturbing the peace, I mean who who want a 6ft robot with weapons walking around the streets. Then of course the ''terrorist'' locals decide to suicide bomb the robots. But obviously the robots react fast and shoot the bombers before they attack. What a shock God bless America and God bless their robots loll !!!! I'm not from Iran but I do know that in America a gun is more freely purchased and carried around. Hence all the attacks on schools, cinemas and shopping malls by American citizens themselves, is this not an act of terrorism? But as their not Muslim they must of had some sort of mental illness to do such thing.To the writer/director/producer of movies as such, if your home was invaded wouldn't you shoot to kill? If someone invaded your country wouldn't you shoot to kill? Exactly, so why show movies invading the middle east as if it's to protect society in the west. I just want movies to interpret situations the right way. Instead of showing Muslims as terrorist, why can't they show 'peace' to encourage peace amongst the Muslims and Westerners who do live together.American movies have become so obviously racist I just do not know how their allowed to be screened in countries such as the UK where we are so much more diverse. It's like how the black man dies first in a movie, why? I mean its so obviously done and black people knowingly still go to the cinema to watch films like that. I just can't blink an eye anymore, to the point that for the first time I wrote a review on IMDb. Overall, we are encouraging racism by watching films as such.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this is a modernized story of RoboCop and also more realistic. In this version, we see more of Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) being a loving and caring husband and father, I also like that his wife, Clara Murphy (Abbie Cornish), has bigger part in this version. I personally love the fact this version tries to show how a Corporation to sell a product with only pretending caring about people's life and safety, they only think about their own pockets. However, I think the problem with the film is that doesn't have a real villain, Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) is not a vicious villain here, he's just a corrupt businessman, instead in the original Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) wouldn't hesitate to get his hands dirty, he would threaten anybody's life who would stand on his way. The cinematography is done well, the movie has a beautiful look, which it also comes from solid visual effects, there are only a few moments the visuals look like a video game, but overall it has a very realistic look. It's also very well directed, Jos Padilha's previous feature films, Elite Squad 1 &amp; 2, had already proved me the action scene will be awesome and they truly are, especially the last 30min, another element impressed me a lot the amount of the detail he paid attention; the very first scene supposedly takes place in Tehran, Iran, and I was so amazed by the amount of the details he got correct, a guy selling "labu," street signs, a "kalepache" place, and the Farsi dialogue ? it felt like I'm watching a Persian film in Imax format! Regarding performances, Joel Kinnaman does a great job as Robocop, I hope they keep him for sequels; Abbie Cornish, my god she's so beautiful and her innocent smile is fantastic, she perfectly plays this dedicated, loving wife, I absolutely liked her solid performance; Gary Oldman, he never does a bad job, and it's awesome seeing him as this intelligent scientist attempting hardly to do the right thing; Michael Keaton, he's great as this selfish businessman but I wish he was more vicious or more of his dark side was shown; Samuel L Jackson, he's also great as a TV host, Pat Novak, who runs his political program , it shows how media can feed and try to brainwash people's view of something; Jay Baruchel, he's pretty useless here, the movie wouldn't miss anything without him, I'm guessing he was supposed to bring the jokes and bright side of the story, but I don't find his jokes are really funny or necessary, they might have cut some of them, not sure, but I don't think he brings anything special on table, I think Jennifer Ehle just could cover his part in the film and she does a solid job; Michael K. Williams, I think he's underused here, I believe they should've teamed up in this film to solve some crimes together, but I'm assuming they're planning that for the sequel, which it can be really interesting to see them working together, because it's obvious he's not just a coworker but a great friend, so I think they can make a great chemistry. The main and original theme is used for a few moments in the film, and the soundtrack itself is not really impressive honestly, for the sequel I really hope they bring something fresh, satisfying, and breathtaking to the screen.At the end, I don't think this is a bad movie; I was ready to be disappointed but it ended up to be a solid action film with a solid story showing some political problems, So I give it 7.2/10 even though I'll end up buying it on bluray!10 = My Favorite of All Time 09 = A Must See in Theaters + A Must Own in Bluray 08 = Entertaining + Good to Own in DVD/BluRay 07 = A Fun + Maybe Own on DVD 06 = Only for Rent/TV/Streaming 05 = A Failure 01 = A Disaster to History of Cinema&#xfeff;</fullReview>

Very natural performance. Neat flow and cut. Can't complain.I've noticed that the reviews are pretty diverse. If you are really curious, I'd suggest you see it yourself and make your own judgment.

		<shortDescription>Robocop with less blood but more heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robocop, the fondly remembered super violent piece of satirical science fiction from the 80s, has been remade. While not exactly bigger, it is debatable whether the remake is actually better. I gave the original Robocop 10/10. It is awesome. So I'd put ROBOCOP 2014 right there at second place; just under the original, but way better than the sequels, TV series and *shudder* Prime Directives.The 2014 remake of ROBOCOP retains many elements of the original, while updating the premise for contemporary audience. For starters it got the satire down very well, firstly in the form of extreme leftist show host Pat Novak (Samuel L Jackson), then among other things, the revelation that the "all American" Robocop was made in China. Although not as dark a dark comedy as the original movie, the satire here works, as with many of the subtle changes.The most obvious being the design of Robocop himself. The original design from the 80s, that bulletproof unstoppable machine, became painfully obsolete in this new century. Anyone with common sense to take cover and shoot accurately could take out the original plodding, stiff Robocop. Our new Robocop, played magnificently by Joel Kinnaman, changes that. If Peter Weller (the original Robocop) was a tank, our new Robocop is a Stealth Bomber. ROBOCOP 2014 shows money well spent on the special effects. He's sleek, fast, he's strong, plus he does not just stand there and get shot at. Best of all, he retains his heart and struggles with his humanity.This is the most welcome change which is a more personalised plot centred on Alex Murphy and his family. The film deals with the consequences of being turned into a commercial product, where every change in your life is dictated by focus groups and monetary decisions. Choice is no longer your own and you are duped into the illusion of free choice. Slowly but surely, everything that made you human is slowly drained away. Then once the company decides to "pull the plug", are they just terminating an asset? Or is it attempted murder?In focusing on the fallout on both Murphy himself and his family, something that the original films barely glossed over, it creates a more tragic angle to the Robocop mythos. In the original, it is told to us that Murphy was a loyal family man and a loving father but we never actually saw that. Here we do, moments before that ideal family life is ripped away in fire and ash. We see Murphy's bittersweet reunion with his wife and son, tragic in the fact that he can never again be the husband and father he once was. We see how the media attention on the family slowly drives the son into anxious isolation. And we see how his wife becomes a victim of biased media coverage.These are all elements that lends much needed emotional weight to what could have been another bland sci/fi action thriller. You can be told that your body was reduced to "a couple of chunks on a coroner's table", but to actually see yourself as said chunks in all their gruesome glory...........that's heavy. Especially for a PG-13 movie. Despite the rating, ROBOCOP 2014 pushes the boundaries on PG-13 violence. You have scenes that will make you squeamish, people are blown up, shot, zapped and ripped to shreds in a hail of bullets. Or at least, it would have been pretty violent if you could see half of the action that is filmed.Ruining the experience is director Jose Padilha and his obsession with extreme close-ups. tight angles and shaky cam. Like a graduate from the Michael Bay school of filming and the Neveldine/Tylor institute of camera-work, Director Padilha's action scenes are a jittery mess. That combined with a painfully generic soundtrack by Pedro Bromfman undermines what could have been a more epic looking and sounding movie.Nevertheless, ROBOCOP 2014 does not disappoint. Once you can get past the shaky camera, and once you leave your prejudices of "will never be as great as the original" behind, you will appreciate this tragic new take on the classic. With excellent performances by Joel Kinnaman and veterans like Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton, this is Robocop with less blood, less violence, less dark comedy, but with an equal measure of brains and a lot more heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again another unnecessary reboot of an '80s classic</shortDescription>

Jackson, Aimee Garcia, John Paul Ruttan. Once again another unnecessary reboot of an '80s classic this time with fair-to-meh results overall in the Frankensteinian mythos cum Dirty Harry meets Iron Man sci - fi action futuristic action flick set in crime-overrun Detroit with recently left for dead cop Alex Murphy (Kinnaman who acquits himself but is no Peter Weller) revived as the titular robotic weapon to vanquish the bad guys. Special effects overload, video-game violent mentality and very little 'fun' involved in spite of some emotional input added and a decent cast. (Dir: Jose Padilha)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do I begin this review? Well first, I would like to say the girl in this movie is beautiful! But on a more serious note, the guy who plays the part of Robocop does an amazing job. The movements and all, he's got it down. He really makes you think he IS who he is suppose to be. One of the things this movie really focused on also, is just how much of a human he still is, while being a robot. I think it shows more in this than the original, but it isn't done badly. It's balanced pretty well to where it needs to be. He can still be controlled, he can still be turned off. He is still a robot. I think the part where he has to come to terms with it is done really well. And one of the top guys tries to take more of that human aspect out, in order to make him a more efficient killer. How the relationships between him, his wife, kid, and partner are affected, are all done really well too. Oh, and the thing about Lewis being a male now instead of a female like in the original, doesn't bother me for two reasons. If they had picked a new girl for her, she probably wouldn't have been near as good for one thing. I loved Lewis in the original, and here the whole buddy cop thing works really well anyway. While they might have done a good job with her, it just wouldn't have been the same. Plus, he's already got a wife involved throughout the whole movie. I don't want to add too much as far as the story goes, and spoil anything. One thing I will add though, is that the action scenes are fantastic! Bad-ass. One more thing, while I do like it gray better, I warmed up pretty quickly to his suit being black. It is very much redeemed by the end of the film. I certainly was not going to skip seeing this because of something like that anyway. I could probably say more about this movie, but I think I have said enough! I will now give this movie an excellent rating of 10/10. Thanks for reading!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review from a long time series fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: Contains some spoilersI grew up playing Robocop in Amstrad 6128 and Amiga, as well as seeing all his movies. When I first saw the Robocop 2014 movie trailer, I wasn't so sure about the final result. According to the remake, Robocop is black, rides a bike and...walks like a human!How is that possible? It's like making a white Batman and making him move like a robot! You can't just change a hero's public image! We also didn't see any serious gunfight when riding the bike. If we were about to see some, I'm pretty sure criminals would shoot the bike's wheel end the pursuit would end.During the whole movie, Joel Kinnaman acted like a human, not like a robot. It was more than clear he was wearing a suit, which could be either leather or plastic. Peter Weller in the original Robocop (1987) was wearing a full metal suit, losing 3 pounds (1.3kg) per day and breathing only from his mouth. He struggled in order for us to have this image. So Kinnaman and Padilha went on the easy way this time and the final result is against Robocop's nature.Furthermore, I will add some serious issues that are not mentioned in Robocop 2014 remake: - Prime Directives - On screen indicators for efficiency, laws that are broken etc. - No practice shooting, gun tricks etc. - Original Soundtrack plays for a few seconds in a no needed time. Not during the action! - It does make fun of journalists, but it doesn't make fun of future commercial spots. - The whole creation procedure step by step.Positives are: - His wife had to give her approval for him to become Robocop. This didn't exist in original movie. - He did meet his family. In the first part his family was totally absent.Finally some other things: - Battles where way too easy. In original movie they weren't - Opposite genders: Female officer, man scientist, man partner. Why? So that they don't tell them that they copy-pasted the original. But IT IS a remake! - Quotes: Thank you for your co-operation, Dead or Alive you are coming with me and I'd buy that for a dollar, where only mentioned once and in situations that we didn't memorize them. Robocop should also pronounce them before, as Alex Murphy. - Less action scenes, more family drama. - The word "Robocop" was only mentioned 3 times If I remember correctly. - The final scene was not the same.As a true Robocop fan since the original movie, I think the remake wasn't the one we expected for the reasons mentioned.

		<fullReview>Its alright. I really enjoyed the first one because of its ultra violence and awesome one liners "I'd buy that for a dollar!". This one didn't feel that way to me, it didn't feel like an action movie and it was more of a 'getting to grips with something new' movie, if you understand? I thought it had some good points too! His suit looks epic, his bike is epic and they even re-vamped up the soundtrack, of witch isn't used enough in this movie! There were moments where i thought "the soundtrack would sound even more awesome right now". The acting is perfect, Gary Oldman steals the spotlight and even Robocop was good! The age was a twelve in my cinema and i completely disagree with that! STOP BEING GREEDY! All they went is money, they know kids will watch this and they will make a bomb off of it! It makes the movie less enjoyable to watch as there are kids screaming constantly in the cinema. this even meant they had to tone down the violence a bit! The reason many of us loved the first one! But the action sequences were good and the start to this movie goes off in a bang. I like that we see him with his family, and i like that we see him grow emotions throughout the film. The ED 209 was in this and they looked cool, they didn't say "you have 20 seconds to comply" witch disappointing me also. Overall its worth what you pay for, but not worth buying on DVD. Its an OK film, a bit disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part Man. Part Machine, All Bull? - Shock and Awe as a remake turns out to be GOOD!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Robocop' 2014 is one those films you already go into the cinema hating. The now decades long trend for inferior, puerile rehashes of flawed but culturally important films that insult not only their inspiration but the audience as well has produced numerous cinematic atrocities, not least the 2012 crime against humanity "Total Recall". So we went in with our rotten tomatoes and witty insults to hand, ready for the appalling poorly rendered 12a travesty that the underwhelming trailers promised. However, as the film went on, we found it was actually quite good, and so we waited patiently for the whole thing to fall apart, yet it never did. At the roll of the credits this remake had turned out to be (deep breath..) GOOD! The one to blame for this is obviously Brazilian director Jose Padhila, a veteran and experienced maker of home grown action thrillers who knows how to tell a story and shoot cool action, but we must also point fingers at novice screenwriter Joshua Zetumer who instead of a simplistic video game powered by a collection of the latest 9/11 truther internet memes has actually (the horror!) dared write an intelligent and perceptive piece analysing the role of technology in prosthetics and warfare and the pros and cons of progress.This new incarnation tells the same story but focuses on different angles. The original was about corporate crime, greed, backstabbing, untouchable drug gangs and something that was just spare parts finding its humanity again. However, in the three decades since, technology has made enormous strides and we now have advanced bionic prosthetics, brain wave activated machines and military drones slowly replacing traditional warriors, as well as high-tech gadgets of every description a part of our everyday life. So 'the old man' is now a Steve Jobs/Bill Gates type, Raymond Sellers (Michael Keaton) and the Ed-209s and android soldiers OMNICORP manufactures actually work very well. The question is no longer 'can the human element make these dumb machines actually work?' but 'they work but the American people don't trust them and neither does Congress. Can adding a human element to a machine make the person on the street warm to robo warriors?" So we have our 2014 version of Officer Murphy, played by Joel Kinnaman, who is not killed in a failed bust but terribly injured in a car bombing by corrupt officers he is tracking down. His wife Clara (Abby Cornish) is not kept in the dark but signs the release forms, and when Murphy wakes up he is not back from the dead but merely reanimated in an almost totally cybernetic body (We are treated to a very disturbing view of just what little is left of Murphy's shattered body in a way the 18 cert originals never showed) mind intact. In fact it is his mind, his emotions that get in the way, forcing his benign creator, Dr Norton (Gary Oldman) to tone them down until he is little more than a zombie, which creates even more problems. The question is not 'can we control him?' but 'can he control himself?' With the vote on the anti-robot act passing through Congress, there is everything to play for in swaying public opinion, not just to make money by putting robots on the streets, but to improve law enforcement and offer hope for paraplegics. But with new horizons there are problems no one can foresee, and difficult and morally compromising decisions have to be made by everybody.The backstabbing company politics are mostly gone in this Microsoft-y OMNICORP, and even the vicious cackling psycho druggy crime gangs of the originals are replaced by rather dull, professional criminals who deal in guns and drugs, led by Boddicker stand in Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow) who prove no threat. The ones responsible for his condition are his fellow officers, and their 'high up ally' will prove quite surprising. The action however is top notch, thanks to Padhila's pedigree, shot cohesively (no quick cuts crap) and with a palpable sense of sweat and danger. The inclusion of Murphy's wife and young son as key players looked like another 'cute kid and family values' play but it turns out to be anything but. This change in dynamics means that Officer Lewis is now a black guy since the 'unrequited crush' angle no longer works, but to compensate the shouty black chief is now a woman (Marianne Jeanne Baptiste of all people!). Verhoven's acid humour, inspired by the Judge Dredd comics Robocop 87 was meant to originally be about, is gone now, as are those crazy adverts, but in their place we have Samuel L Jackson as Pat Novak, a rabble rousing TV shock jock who tries to sway the pulse of the nation OMNICORPs way. Detroit, which in real life is now far worse than even the Delta City 1 stand in of the original, is here shown to be quite a nice, affluent white collar city with only pockets of crime here and there, so the general seediness and sense of decay is also gone. Murphy is no longer Robo-Jesus but more the cripple who gets off his bed and walks. The more modest storyline however means that the final act dramatics feel wrong and shoehorned in, an excuse for a chase and a fight when sitting down and talking seem better. The cast all round is great, including Jackie Earl Hayley as a robot wrangler, and Jay Baruchel as a cocky marketing guy.This film is a Robocop for 2014, not replacing the classic original but addressing ideas and dilemmas of our modern times. An intelligent thriller and a decent remake, this is a rare surprise indeed, and gives us faint hope for future 'reimaginings'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The remake is as delightful today as the original was in 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard there is going to be a remake of Robocop, I was both eager to see it and also worried of how is the new one going to be. Judging from the wave of remakes that have come up in the new century, with such horrible messes like Jurassic Park, Total Recall, Planet of the Apes (Tim Burton version), ... I was worried that the Robocop remake might turn into an action movie with lots of special effects and dazzling CGI effects but unlike the original version with no strong story or idea behind it. It looked to me for a while during recent 15 years as if the new generation can only see the action and sparkles and all brilliant fundamental ideas behind previous masterpieces have been forgotten. I am gratified to say that to my surprise the remake of Robocop does not follow the common path of recent movies. It is an action movie but from the first moment that the movie starts the flavor of negative thinking and critical language is strongly visible and it keeps dominating the entire plot as it goes on. What makes it more authentic and serious is the references it has to today's real world and how global and political conflicts of today might shape the future. It starts with a live news report from US drones operating in the streets of Tehran the capital of Iran. We know that US drones are already operating in Pakistan, Afghanistan and other Middle East countries with unknown number of civilian casualties. It is already a controversial subject which is repeatedly mentioned in anti Imperialism discourses. The movie remarks the terrorizing nature of drone operations and the way it is imprinted by mainstream media as security and stability. It then goes on to show after all so called foreign threats have been addressed and secured, the corporate greed and the monster known as capitalism turns its eyes towards its own society. After all Imperialism is an epoch within capitalism when the capital goes beyond national borders and turns into multinational corporations and globalization. The movie is taking up this argument in its reverse form, nationalism is as meaningless in capitalist's homeland as it is in foreign lands. There are also some hints about lobbies and how undemocratic and corrupt it could be, but the government and congress are in the most part drawn as advocates of people's rights in front of a private corporation who controls media, bribes police commanders and advises senators! This brilliant story is accompanied with some exciting action scenes filled with marvelous CGI and sound effects which add to its enjoyability. As an American tradition it has a happy ending where the good guy shoots the bad guy, but nevertheless it still stands higher than any other American action movie that has been made in this century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall, more than what I was going to expect from a Robocop re-make...I LOVED IT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, I LOVED IT! It was action-packed and full of suspense through the entire film. I really enjoyed how much we got to learn about Alex in terms of his family, his job and how he copes with the changes he was dealt with and that gave both the movie and the main character a sense of humanity. I also enjoyed the action scenes and the crime fighting skills of Murphy. Now, for the part that I don't understand. Why...WHY, do people hate this movie? Even before it was released in the cinema? People were judging it because of the new actors and so on and so forth... When I was young, I LOVED watching Robocop when my dad bought it. And we would watch it a lot because of how good it was back then. I can say this because of the fact that I am a fan of the original Robocop and I have actually watched it (on the day I made this review) so I have proof in saying, it was a FANTASTIC, action-packed, crime fighting and well- done movie. Please don't spam that I am wrong, I am just saying this out of my opinion. Thank you :) and enjoy the movie if you haven't watched it witch I highly recommend.:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roboflop Perhaps?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebooting seems to be all the fashion these days, what with the marvel of 2014 technology and an incessant desire by most directors and/ producers to better any or all original attempts of movie creation.As a fan of the original Robocop movie, I must admit that I was an utter skeptic when I heard of the reboot but as a general movie fan I went into the cinema wide eyed and innocent with the freshest mind that I could muster... unfortunately this movie made me regret my fresh mind... Joel was not the worst choice for Robocop but certainly not anything worth praising but the worst acting is yet to come as We see Samuel L Jackson play the role of Novak- a talk show host that is pro robots on American streets, beside the fact that his character was out of place and unnecessary, I felt that there was some serious over acting on Jackson's part which made this unnecessary character that much more irritating. Oldman delivers but I believe he added nothing special to the mix... the rest of the characters could have been played by almost anyone and still made no impact on the audience, the script was that mediocre and very boring... I found myself writing this review in my head about 20 minutes into the movie, I was that bored... Notable scenes were whenever Robocop was accessing the DPD data base, finding criminals and exercising justice on the streets... this of course happened once or twice... the action scenes were mediocre at best and I truly hope another reboot of Robocop is not attempted anytime soon.All in all this movie wasn't awful... if it were a dish, I'd say it was edible but not delicious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unnecessary Reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first. I don't think Robocop needed a reboot. Its original still stands strong today. But, in my opinion, it just isn't a movie that needed a reboot. Let's face it, it was just your typical 80's action film, complete with blood, bullets, explosions and damage. Paul Verhoeven's 1987 original may have had Jesus-like references in it, but it was still a movie about a robot cop shooting and blowing up stuff. Hardly the most intellectual material.Anyway, this is an action film, and should be treated as such. The 2014 version smartly detours from the previous film, with OmniCorp wanting a human touch added to its cyborg judicial units. An opening scene dictating what happens when a cyborg is faced with a child trying to protect his wrong-doing father is an interesting setup to this premise.Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is a good cop who's investigates the wrong villain, and ends up getting blown up as a result. Murphy's wife (Abbie Cornish) signs the papers to let Murphy continue living as a part human, part robot, as the boss of Omnicorp (Michael Keaton) attempts to add the human touch to his robotic defenders. He's assisted by Dr Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), who struggles with the need to meet his bosses demands, whilst also caring for the man within the suit.Like the original, the true essence of the story comes from the man vs the machine side of Robocop, with Murphy's conscious much more present in this film, as is the role his family plays. His interaction with his family becomes a more critical part of the film, as his wife battles to keep touch with her husband, whilst Omnicorp try to maximise his potential. However, the film rarely manages to achieve any real emotional depth on this side of things, and the film slides into a typical action film eventually, which, given the title, shouldn't really come as a surprise. There's a few good action sequences, especially when Robocop is put through his paces against his robotic compatriots in the training grounds.Kinnaman works well with the title role, switching between the emotional Murphy and the deadpan Robocop with relative comfort. Keaton and Cornish all do decent jobs with roles that don't really go into much depth, whilst Oldman adds his presence to a critical role of Robocop's minder. Samual L. Jackson's role of the opinionated TV journalist is an interesting addition, but perhaps not really necessary as far as plot development goes.In the end, this is an action film, and on the action front, it delivers reasonably well. But there is a lack of emotion and character development to really make this any more than a popcorn flick. Given the original's popularity. it wouldn't surprise me to see this film do well, and as a result, spawn a sequel. But, I would hope not. It's a franchise that should just be left alone, and perhaps, should've been left alone prior to this instalment.</fullReview>

I went to see this movie with high expectation, but it's a disaster, a total waste of two great actors Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman.There's no depth of this movie, just cheap CGIs. The first Robocop has a lot of human nature and emotions in it, the plots of the new one is just very predictable.I have to say the bad guys in this movie aren't bad enough.

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, Insulting, and downright wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2014 remake of RoboCop has had everything working against it, fan backlash over the MPAA rating, the new suit, the new Murphy, you name it, it's already been crucified for it. Now that it is so close to being released and screenings are taking place, I highly anticipate a flood of negative reviews coming in because this film was an utter disgrace. Having caught this at an early screening, I can honestly say that it is an extremely painful watch. From the minute it starts, it gave me the strange reminder of Len Wiseman's Total Recall and how awful a remake that was. This Verhoven remake is no different. RoboCop shows fans of the original just how neutered Hollywood studios have become. Instead of an intelligent screenplay, we are handed a half baked story with too many back stories to follow, sub plots get thrown into the mix and never materialize to anything except bloating the running time. The incoherent story makes RoboCop a tough movie to like. While the film isn't hard to follow due to the excessive use of CGI and action, it still is so far from the 1987 original that I wouldn't even call this a remake. A reboot would be more fitting, either way, this film dies mid way through and we're left with an hour that seems like it is three. Jose Padhilla, who came to fame with Elite Squad and Elite Squad 2 does the best he can with the screenplay. On higher notes, the film does feature strong action sequence that are filmed in the vein of a Michael Mann film, which is interesting to see considering the kind of film it is. Padhilla shows that he isn't just another hack director and he tries to elevate RoboCop from a terrible screenplay into a good film and it doesn't work, unfortunately. The performances are, for the most part, lukewarm. The main problem with the actors in RoboCop is that they are not consistent. Our new Murphy is played actually quite well by Joel Kinnamen. Kinnamen brings humanity to Murphy along with a sense of suppressed rage that sits behind his eyes, it's quite amazing. Abbie Cornish is the weakest link here, turning in such a monotone performance as Murphy's wife. The scenes between Kinnaman and her are so forced that they're uncomfortable to watch. We see Kinnaman going the distance but Cornish never seems to want to meet him halfway. Now, the true standout here is Michael Keaton. Keaton is a show stopper in this film, giving off a very Ari Gold persona (for you Entourage fans). He is quite good at portraying an absolute slime ball that only has money on his mind. It really is a true joy to watch him act in this film, it's just an absolute shame that the film is nowhere near as entertaining as him. And now to my biggest gripe...SAMUEL L. JACKSON. Jackson is hands down the most out of place component here, more so than Cornish. While he tries to replace the "Imd buy that for a dollar" guy from the original, he only brings the film down with a pseudo-intellectual speech about America being crime ridden and "robophobic", as the trailer indicates, yet by the end, he is a hybrid of the news anchors and TV personality from the first and it comes out to disastrous results. If Jackson wasn't in this film, I'm sure I would have given this a higher rating. Not because I have anything against Jackson personally but more so his character is so underused in the film that it borders being useless. Overall, RoboCop is not anywhere close to being as good as the first (or second for that matter) and lacks the satirical edge that made the first a classic. The bottom line is that this is not a good film, it features some good qualities but they are largely overshadowed by poor performances, a lacking script and a ridiculous amount of CGI. This is just another example of how NOT to do a remake, maybe after this one, Hollywood will learn...but I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Verhoeven version will always stand as a classic. I was aware of this.As many reviewers notice; the movie misses subtlety. Everything is a bit bland, raw and not very fine developed. While the touched subjects are very interesting philosophical and relevant to our time - it's in fastfood and bitesizable chunks. Served in a refill cup.Don't expect more as the recent "run of the mill" CGI-film with stock writing "super hero" films that roll out in an industrial way. I hoped it to stand out with a refreshing take instead of producers circle- jerking over CGI and FPS. Yet it became nothing more as a Transformers, Tron, Judge Dred or superhero(tm) VS superhero(tm). Leave it to the children to go out and nag you for the Toys(tm) - and have them discover the Verhoeven version in their teens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Robocop is one of my very favorite films of the 1980s. Like most of you, I had low expectations for this reboot, and the movie lived down to those expectations.This movie wants to be "Batman". They even cast one of the main actors from the Batman franchise, Gary Oldman.Where do I even begin. Let's start with the main character, who is totally uninteresting. Unlike the original Robocop, this modern one doesn't look spectacular at all. They chose a completely random-looking and unknown actor to play him. He has no screen presence or charisma. The suit looks really uninspired.Next up is the plot, which is little more than a reworking of the original Paul Verhoven storyline. Only much more boring. It was hard to finish this movie. Even Gary Oldman has nothing to work with. This movie needs a serious villain, like Clarence Boddiker.I'm sure other commenters have mentioned the shaky camera, so I won't bother. Most obnoxiously, the producers managed to splice in some of the theme music from the original movie, and it's jarringly out of place. And what about those bizarre flickering screen wipes?? I did give this movie five stars because it's not a complete train wreck. It might have made a decent TV series. It was somewhat interesting to see how the original film would translate to today's hyper-propaganda media world.Samuel Jackson was the only shining personality in the film, though he just plays his typical character (which is always entertaining).Please, no sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where as the 1987 version had a more structured and sound storyline, this 2014 remake of "RoboCop" is a shallow experience, and just another branch on the Hollywood tree of remakes that never should have been more than a twig.The movie is really an unnecessary addition to the "RoboCop" legacy, and it offered nothing, absolutely nothing, to those who have grown up with the previous movies.Sure, the effects were great and nice to look at, but the storyline was flaccid and shallow, making the movie suffer terribly from that fact. That being said, I will say that the scene where Murphy's metallic armor is removed as he is on the slab in the laboratory was impressive, that scene alone makes it worthwhile to sit through the movie.Acting was adequate, but nothing extraordinary here. Michael Keaton was perhaps the one carrying the movie by far with his performance. Samuel L. Jackson was not really fully in the character and he could have brought so much more to the movie. As for the role of Murphy/RoboCop, well then Joel Kinnaman had a big pair of shoes to fill out, and he didn't really manage it all that great.The 2014 version is a nice, but brainless movie, for those not already familiar with the previous movies or series. And this is the type of movie that require absolutely nothing from the audience.The trailer dressed the movie up quite nicely, making it seem much more interesting than it turned out to be. I was disappointed with this 2014 remake, but then again, I think that most remakes that Hollywood chew up and spit out should have never seen the light of day. Instead of producing soulless remakes, why not add something new to an already established movie franchise or universe? Has Hollywood really drained the well of inspiration already?Dead or alive, you're coming with me... At least that phrase was still in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i sat down with my popcorn and soda y knew what was coming, i didn't take my eyes off the screen so as not to miss a single detail; throughout the whole movie i was grasped. The movie is a total hit,forget the 1987 film this is it, this is Robocop, whoever criticizes it in a negative way must look at twice. The whole plot is outstanding, i swear when it was over i looked a my girlfriend and just murmured " wow" i had looked forward fro this film for over a year and now that I've seen it i totally agreed it was worth the wait, it was exhilarating, compelling, grasping and historical. I'm looking forward for the Blue ray copy to come out cause i will see it on my home theater</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is (obviously) compared to the original robocop, but i think it looks more like something between iron man and batman. some scenes kinda remind me of iron man, and the urban violence felt munch like batman.This movie also made me appreciate even more the job of actors like Peter Weller and Arnold Schwarzenegger, its really hard to pull out a convincing a human-like robot. The new actor, doesn't pull off the menacing look of a soulless robot.Not a bad movie, now i know how robocop would like if he could run. The original did not had it, but to be honest, did not need it.this is the robocop with the best visual effects and, even not as good as the original, is not the worst robocop i have seen.If i were u, i would wait for streaming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't as bad as people say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(this may contain spoilers) I'm kinda not the one to review things but whatever. So I went to the cinema with my two friends not expecting anything good and it was the only thing on at that time. and I noticed it having 2.5 stars out of 5. But the movie actually wasn't that bad it used the old theme at some bits which was cool and at the beginning he looked like old Robocop before turning into batman Robocop. At parts I can see where the critics were going at, there was bits where you've seen something that they added in that was a lot like another movie e.g. when he first wakes up he goes crazy and escapes from the lab only to yet be shut down. Seems like the bit from Avatar but who can complain. The beginning was just me thing what is happening because when the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios intro appeared all you could here was "hurmadablalala" and I was thinking are "we in the right cinema?" but it turns out it was Samuel L Jackson making those noises warming up his voice for a show. but all things out of the was it wasn't bad I would give it at least 3 stars and I would only recommend watching I one or two times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They want a remake with a conscious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They want a product with a conscious. Something that knows what it feels like to be human. We gonna put a man inside a machine." You don't necessarily have to be from the 80's to have heard about the cult classic and ultra- violent RoboCop which served as a witty and funny satire of its time. As with most remakes I always go into them with very low expectations, so when I heard Brazilian director, Jose Padilha (known in South America for his successful film Elite Squad and its sequel) was working on a reboot of the franchise I wasn't very excited. Despite not loving this remake, I was surprised that this film took such a different approach from the original and stood out on its own. Fans of the original might be disappointed that this isn't a fun action film. Padilha has made an ambitious film that differs greatly from the original one by focusing on modern political themes and powerful corporate agendas. It also humanizes the main character and tries to explore his emotions as he has to learn to deal with his new robotic self. There are some very important scenes Joel Kinnaman shares with Gary Oldman as Padilha plays on the dynamics between them and raises various ethical questions along the way. Oldman's character struggles with how much freedom he should give to his creation while being pushed by Corporate greed to deliver a product. Padilha does explore these political and social issues pretty well, while dealing with other concepts such as the illusion of free will and media bias (which we see through Jackson's character). Where this film failed for me however was in the action sequences which at times felt like a video game. Many scenes felt like I was watching my friends play Call of Duty, and I felt detached. So I can see why this film might upset fans because it isn't an action packed film, but more of a sci-fi exploration of modern political and social fears. It isn't groundbreaking, but Robocop stands on its own apart from the original as a somewhat different film.Joshua Zetumer adapted the screenplay for this remake and he did a decent job at modernizing several of the issues the story presents. It's clearly more character driven than the original, but lacks that witty and sharp humor that made the original such a beloved classic. The film opens in 2028 as we listen to a news report from Pat Novak (Samuel L Jackson) setting up the stage. He's a pro-robot TV host that is trying to convince Americans to embrace robot technology like the rest of the world has. OmniCorp is the multinational corporation that runs this robot technology that has functioned as the military force keeping peace across the globe. Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) is the billionaire running OmniCorp that realizes that if he's going to change American public opinion about robots he is going to need to present a more human one. OmniCorp finds the opportunity they were looking for when a Detroit cop named Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is critically injured after trying to bring down a couple of corrupt cops and a big local dealer. Sellars convinces Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), a pioneer in robotic prosthetics, to save Alex and turn him into a part-robot, part-man police officer. With Alex's wife, Clara's (Abbie Cornish) permission they save his life, but they plan to keep him doped so he will follow their orders. However Alex proves to be stronger than they expected and he sets out to find justice against those that tried to murder him.This new RoboCop turns out to be a very different movie than the original taking itself too seriously and trying to raise important ethical questions along the way. This isn't something we were expecting as viewers from a RoboCop film, but somehow Padilha manages to make it enjoyable in a very different way. I liked the way how the true villains of the film were not the criminals on the street, but the corporate giants who were trying to force their agenda. That is why the film focuses much more on those characters than the ones we usually expect, which in this case would be the criminals Alex was pursuing first. RoboCop has many flaws and is overly ambitious lacking the humor and poignant satire from the original, but it works if judged on its own without having to compare the two films. I barely recommend this one so go see it at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent action film with an emotionally charged story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"RoboCop" is a science fiction/action film that tells the story of Alex Murphy, a Detroit police detective who is critically injured in an explosion. Multinational conglomerate "OmniCorp" sees this tragedy as their opportunity for the creation of a part-man, part-robot police officer. After being outfitted with a cybernetic body, Murphy is transformed into RoboCop, the ultimate crime-fighting machine.The movie, a reboot of the RoboCop franchise, is directed by Jos Padilha in his Hollywood debut and stars Joel Kinnaman, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson, Abbie Cornish and Jackie Earle Haley. The script is written by Joshua Zetumer.Director Padilha, familiarized with action movies such as his "Elite Squad" films, made an excellent job regarding the film's direction, being able to capture the main aspects of the title character and updating them to fit the modern world. The film features many great action scenes, however, Padilha focused principally on the human/emotional part of the main character, how Alex Murphy feels after his near-death experience and his reaction to his new situation. The scene when Murphy looks at the mirror and sees what's left of his human body was really shocking. Joshua Zetumer's script further explores the human side of RoboCop and how he feels about reconnecting with his family and his life, now that life as he knows it is forever changed.The main cast does a fantastic job. Joel Kinnaman is excellent as Alex Murphy/RoboCop, being able to show in a real and honest way the emotional transformation Alex Murphy goes through after the accident, he was able to show Alex's feelings of not belonging anymore with his family at home and being a stranger to himself. Kinnaman is able to portray as well the tough side of RoboCop, being merciless with the ones responsible for his accident and the ones that threaten his family. Gary Oldman is great as Dr. Dennett Norton, the scientist who creates RoboCop, being able to show the guilt he feels for keeping the truth from Alex and for manipulating him by orders of his superiors. Michael Keaton portrays Raymond Sellars, the CEO of OmniCorp, being able to show the nature of his character, a man motivated by greed who thinks people are like robots, expendable. Samuel L. Jackson portrays Pat Novak, the host of "The Novak Element", a TV show which serves as a review of the events of the movie as they happen. Abbie Cornish portrays Clara Murphy, Alex's wife, being able to show the grief she feels for not being able to reconnect with her husband. And Jackie Earle Haley plays Rick Mattox, OmniCorp's military tactician expert, who believes more in robots than in humans.All this elements make "RoboCop" an excellent action film, a movie that provides both great action and an emotionally charged story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great if you hate classic superhero movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't like movies like LOTR, Star Wars, Iron Man, Spider Man, Batman and all stuff that nerds usually love. Actually I'm a master degree student in computer science, but I hate the geek-nerd culture shared by a lot of computer scientists. I prefer watching nouvelle vague movies than poor, non-emotional sci-fi ones. That's why Robocop 2014 seemed promising to me. Directed by Jos Padilha (Elite Squad 1 and 2), I had high expectations on seeing an ambiguous hero as portrayed in the Captain Nascimento from Elite Squad. Padilha's heroes are not cool or of the kind we would like to imitate. They're just humans: sometimes we like their attitudes, sometimes not. They're dystopian heroes.The original Robocop is in some sense dystopian through today's eyes: it was basically a more productive Paul Kersey from Death Wish. However, if you remember well the crime movies from the eighties, it was pretty common this kind of "vigilante" character who kills evil criminals that haunt the American middle class. It was very easy pointing the good and the evil parts from the original Robocop. We loved that. In the latest years of cold war we liked these characters like Rambo and which portrayed a plain dichotomy between totally good heroes and totally evil enemies. In the 2014 version, the manichaeism is not as clear. If you planned watching a protagonist like Batman or a Gran Torino's Walt Kowalsky on Robocop 2014, prepare yourself to watch a Blade Runner's Rick Deckard or a Capt. Nascimento from Elite Squad. Probably the big marketing mistake from Robocop 2014 is being a superhero movie for people who don't like superhero movies. It belongs more to the drama genre, but not without a lot of stunning action scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical remake backlash doesn't change that this is at least an okay movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am NOT ever opposed to remakes. I love seeing my favourite films remade for a new generation. Some of the best films I have seen in the last ten years or more have been remakes. Usually they add something new to the old classic or at the very least bring the concept to a new generation of movie goers. Robocop (the original) is a stone cold action 80's classic. The remake was firmly stuck in production hell for a very long time. There are multiple stories of director and studio clashing over creative rights and differences. Sadly, I think this clashing came through in the final product. There are glimpses here of a truly great movie. I think action movies are so far from what they used to be that studios have forgotten what we loved about action movies during their heyday in the 80's and 90's. Robocop (2014) has too many villains and not one of them really takes the reigns and stands out as being truly villainous the way Kurtwood Smith did in the original. The film focuses so heavily on Alex Murphy's transition to being part robot and his relationship with his family. In the original film, this aspect was implied and sort of came out in the general path of the film. They didn't make it so blatant as they did in this one. As much as I hate gratuitous anything in films for the sake of being nasty, making Robocop PG-13 was a distinct mistake (rumouredly a decision by the studio against the director's wishes.) The original Robocop was gritty, visceral, violent, disturbing with distinctive social commentary. It ended up being so much smarter than what you would have anticipated. For the most part the remake misses that mark. Not completely, but just enough to not make it a contender for great remakes.Joel Kinnaman takes over the title role and I don't envy him. He had big shoes to fill from Peter Weller. However, Kinnaman's Alex Murphy and his Robocop are completely different than Weller's was. They give his initial performance with a lot of emotion still in tact. He isn't the robotic emotionless robot that actually had to fight to get his emotions to return. I think it sort of took away from the story to have it focus so heavily on his emotional state. Still Kinnaman does a solid job and has enough chemistry to carry the role despite a lot of backlash. Gary Oldman...this guy I tell ya. Is he brilliant in everything? He probably takes the film up at least a point or two just by doing what he does best. His morally torn scientist is perfect in this movie and easily the best role. The scenes between him and Kinnaman are terrific. I was very excited to have Michael Keaton in the film as our MAIN villain. The problem is that they don't treat him like a main villain, nor do they give him the opportunity to really open up his character and BE evil. I think Keaton could have pulled it off but the character is sort of bland and his final ending is REALLY anti-climatic. Patrick Garrow is sort of the replacement for Kurtwood Smith and what a disappointment. His character is downright boring and has no great coming out as a villain moment. He is barely a blip in this cast. Abbie Cornish plays Murphy's beloved wife and while beautiful and fits the eye candy bill...her character gets in the way and is mostly unnecessary and way overused. Jackie Earle Haley is yet another villain, a main right hand man so to speak and he does okay but much like Keaton he doesn't get any big development or moments to be terrific. Still he's decent in the role. Michael K. Williams, Jay Baruchel and Marianne Jean-Baptiste round out the rest of the supporting cast all in decent small roles. One of them serves to add a decent twist to the entire story that I thought was clever and appreciated. And you have the ever present Samuel L. Jackson in a boisterous role as a political TV Talk show host. I'm not sure where they were going with this character? Was it simply to have Jackson in the film? Was it to force the social commentary that was far more subtly placed in the original? Jackson is sort of annoying in the role and I almost thought towards the end they were building to a really cool twist and then they didn't bother with that so I was let down. To have Jackson opening and closing the film seemed obnoxious and unwelcome.I was only mildly disappointed with a few key details that I think could have easily been changed to make this a great remake. There are a few really solid little Easter eggs there for fans of the original. The latter half of the film is far more action packed and has some really great scenes including the battle between Robocop and the ED-209's. I was really concerned there would be no battle and it was worth waiting for. I saw Robocop on the IMAX and I didn't feel that added anything to it. There just wasn't enough focus on the action in the film and I think the studio got in the way of the creativity of the film. I'm still not sure Jos Padilha was the perfect choice of director, having so little experience with a film like this but I also read a lot about his vision that was consistently blocked and I see a lot of potential in some of the scenes and characters. What it all boils down to is this remake won't go any further to give birth to a new series but it isn't a total loss. It is an average flick that won't blow you away but for a one time popcorn flick it was okay. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen a Robocop movie before so I didn't really know what I was about to watch all I really had was the trailer after missing the first 10 minutes of the movie I still understood fairly well what the plot was all about and it was great the actors were really well suited to there roles and I was pretty indulged in the movie and it really made me think what would happen if humans really did create a "Robocop" I mean the whole thing about lowering the humans feelings and creating a almost robotic human was very mind opening because you see that gradually the makers of Robocop actually want to shut him down which shows that once you put a robot in a human you really start to not care about ending its life because it looks so much like a robot and humans wouldn't care about killing a robot. I just think the movie was great and had a hidden message deep within it.</fullReview>

The director did an outstanding job with telling the story how robocop came about and what he is capable of. I am hoping they make a sequel so we can get a full story of robocop since he has already been created. The story changed a little from the original which was a great. Every superman or batman movie that comes out has a different story line every time. I would really hate to live the life of the people who bash this movie because they are the people who have uniteresting, no change and boring lives.

		<fullReview>These days nobody says remake, they say reboot. With The Dark Knight films, Man of Steel, The Amazing Spider Man, and it's upcoming sequel, can the same be said for Robocop, well kind of.Joel Kinnaman does not try to top Peter Weller as RoboCop, I mean that would be impossible, cause Peter Weller made that role, and it was hard to top it, even anybody who has played it after Weller left the role. But Joel Kinnaman does bring his own to the role, that which I do enjoy, although there are spots he does pay homage to Weller. The suit I do think is an improvement. Action scenes are well done, and supporting cast Michael Keaton, Gary Oldman, Abbie Cornish, and Samuel L. Jackson are pretty memorable. The story is entertaining, but not quite has memorable as the original, but i'm looking forward where the story is going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie but pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in expecting a mega-turkey. I came out pleasantly surprised.RoboCop 2014 follows a very similar storyline to the original so I'll not spend a great deal of time on the synopsis: cop gets (almost) killed, scientists rebuild cop, cop becomes RoboCop.Although I did find myself ultimately enjoying the movie, it's still a remake that really shouldn't have been made. RoboCop 2014 offers virtually nothing that the original didn't already have.As its own movie however, RoboCop 2014 has a very sombre narrative and steers clear of wise-cracking and humour - which is bizarre for a remake - especially since the original did so well out of its own witty lines and satire. The movie is emotionally darker than the 1987 counterpart but considerably less violent. Having said that, the violence in Verhoevan's movie was very comic-book, whereas this time realism is the target and it achieves that to some degree.The Company is no longer the Mafia-like bunch of thugs it was, but much more like Google and has a more sinister feel as a result. Michael Keaton is great as the Omnicorp (OCP subsidiary) boss and his infamous dark side bubbles under the surface for the majority of the movie. Gary Oldman is the only other noteworthy actor in the movie, possibly the centre-piece as far as performances go.Is it worth watching? Yes - in summary. It is actually a good movie and if the 1987 original did not exist, it would probably be reasonably well received. It is not for young kids, so don't mistake the drop in rating as a signal for Marvel and Transformers fans to gather here. The movie is very dark and does not tread lightly around the suffering of Alex Murphy. This is possibly the only area wherein the remake has out-done the original.RoboCop 2014 is arguably a success, albeit an unnecessary one.</fullReview>

Staring a cast of actors who really take to their roles.

		<shortDescription>What a remake should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the past decade, remakes have become so common that they are simply expected. If there is a popular franchise that a studio owns the rights to, it's shocking if a studio doesn't try to remake it somehow. Paul Verhoeven's 1987 science fiction classic Robocop has always been both an extremely popular and critically acclaimed hit, so regardless of whether there was a reason for it to be remade or not, it was bound to happen eventually. Verhoeven's Total Recall was remade only a few years ago and managed to make a bit of money, therefore a remake of Robocop became virtually inevitable.The good news is that the Robocop remake is much, much better than the remake of Total Recall was. The biggest problem with that production was that it told the exact same story as the original in almost the exact same way, only with more explosions. It was redundant and stuck to the blueprint to a fault. The new Robocop doesn't suffer from that same problem at all. While the new film is structurally similar to the original, the main focus of the story itself is entirely different and, at times, more interesting than the 1987 movie. This version focuses more on the impact that Alex's transformation into Robocop has on his family. The audience didn't see Murphy's family until Robocop 2, here they are introduced before Alex's transformation. The scene that introduces Alex and his wife, Clara, is simple but effective. There isn't even much dialogue, yet it establishes the bond between Alex and Clara well enough to build the required sympathy for what will happen to the characters. As Alex, Joel Kinnaman gives a great performance, one that gives a great depth into a character as he goes through anger, sadness, grief, and loss all while trying to maintain his humanity. It may not be quite as memorable as Peter Weller's performance, but it's a different take on the character, one that focuses much more on the human side than the robotic side. As Clara, Abbie Cornish gives a completely solid and convincing performance as a woman who is trying to hold onto her husband in whatever form possible. The fact that she is given so much screen time is one of the best aspects of the film. In fact, it can be argued that the story this time around is more about Clara than Alex/Robocop. While it's easy to see why hardcore Robocop fans may hate this, I found it to be a fresh and mildly bold turn for an action film to take. Luckily, the scenes between Clara Alex/Robocop aren't sabotaged by an overly bombastic musical score, something entirely too common in movies and television when trying to hit an emotional beat. I can see how some younger audiences will complain that this new version is boring and lacks the amount of action the trailers advertise, but I was rarely bored and welcomed the change of pace.Regardless of how tonally and emotionally different the new version is, the fact that the film is PG-13 is still a stumbling block when trying to judge it as an action film. By eliminating almost any trace of blood and relying on quick cuts, the impact of violence is almost completely sanitized to the point that these scenes feel like a video game. Characters are simply shot at, fall down, and then it's on to the next target. It's not necessary for a Robocop film to be an absolute bloodbath, but the watered down nature of the violence definitely undercuts what the movie wants to say about the nature of violence in America. In addition to the blood and violence being toned down for the PG-13 rating, profanity is virtually non-existent. In the case of Samuel L. Jackson's character, profanity is actually bleeped in order to obtain the less restrictive rating, which comes across as both lame and pointless. If the words can't be used in a PG-13 movie without being bleeped, why even bother having the character utter them in the first place? Jos Padilha makes so many good decisions with this version of Robocop, but the one decision of the film's rating is probably the major decision he had no control over. There was probably no way the studio was ever going to release this as an R-rated picture, so in the end I don't think Padilha can necessarily be faulted too much for that. There's nothing here that couldn't be fixed with an uncensored director's cut, provided the footage exists.Despite the toned down nature of Robocop, it's still one of the most surprising remakes of the past decade. It's not a great film, but it is the work of a director who is actually trying to make a thinking man's action movie as opposed to just a series of endless car chases, gun fights, and explosions. The story is compelling and emotionally satisfying, mostly due the excellent cast. The film is unlikely to be mentioned in the same breath as Paul Verhoeven's version any time soon, but this new Robocop is what a remake should be: different, well acted, and entertaining. 7/10</fullReview>

The end result was a very pleasantly surprised viewing and I am amazed at just how much I enjoyed it.I still think the original is a better all rounder from the story telling and direction, Paul Verhoeven wasn't hung up on making sure it hit the 12+ crowd with let it be a true action film but this was still a good film despite hitting the lower age rating.A very good film. I like the fact that he still sounds heavy and robotic which does't come across in the adverts.I hope the his last scenes are a sign that he will be silver in the (hopefully) eventual sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People must have either some exquisite taste that I don't get, or people just don't have any taste besides fast food movies. I was like a kid of 9 years old when Robocop (l987) aired on. I found it a great movie and he was an instant superhero, it was great in the time because we didn't have much of the sf genre back in the days besides star trek and star wars. Now I watch this movie with that 9 year old kids eyes, and I loved the flick. It was painful, very painful to watch the protagonist loose most of his body, which made the movie much more personal. Robocop 1 was more of a personal vendetta against 1 or 2 criminals ( a western cowboy movie). This Robocop flick is much different in the fact that general corruption is the villain. So the theme of the movie is different. Those who wanted a remake of Robocop 1, go and watch Robocop 1. Those who want to see a good Robocop movie, go watch this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a smart remake. It gave me what I wanted and kept going. This installment gave us what the first didn't an action film with a developed story. The acting is excellent with everyone delivering. This is the Robocop I wanted in the first place.Soap Box Rant to follow (you can skip passed this for more of my review) I am glad the studio did a pg13 rating... sorry Jos Padilha (not that he will read this or am I qualified to critique his work) but in my opinion the studio was right this time. This should be a fun movie that won't scar young people. (I was 6 when the first one came out and it was the first R movie that I snuck to a friends house to watch... scared is an understatement, but what boy doesn't want to watch a Robot Cop. Not everything has to be shocking and graphic we can have fun with a fun movie, in fact I wish they would have toned it down a little more. I am also glad there was no nudity) If I was going to make a Robocop film this is what I would have done. This movie kept me on awesome overload the whole time and did what few movies do anymore... left me wanting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went hesitantly to watch Robocop having ready, heard or watched a number of people saying that it doesn't live up to the original.Well it doesn't live up to the original but in a good way. The story has been re-imagined enough to be a different movie and suitably adopted to the world of today. The emotional struggle of who Robocop is, and the impact on his family is visible and felt throughout. Unusually for a blockbuster its got characters you care about from beginning to the end and it never feels long. If anything, a few more minutes of Robocop would have been great. The acting from the main characters is very good and credible. A couple of things that I think could have been better in my opinion. The young audience friendly certificate (which they have pushed to the limit as there are some pretty gore scenes) will bring in potentially more sales but I would have preferred it a bit more violent (accepting I am biased having seen the original, new audiences would probably find it spot on).Detroit doesn't feel like a crime infected city at any stage. In this movie Robocop is not solution to a problem but a sales pitch which I struggled a little bit with to accept (how credible is the sales pitch if there is no real problem there?)Other than the two points above, the only thing left for me is to find the biggest screen I can and go and watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy of a Remake, brilliantly casted &amp; well made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing i can is it is hard not to compare the two film's as there are scene that remind you of the original film but from a first look at the trailer it looks like an all out action C.G.I mediocre film that look like that all its going to be but this film surprise you by being the opposite. From this version of the film its more than just an action movie, it involves politics and emotions in the storyline that gives this film its edge although the action could of been a bit more.Starts off with an engrossing news which features Samuel Jackson who plays this role brilliantly and an intense but brief action scene involving middle east terrorist there is one disturbing scene here but brief. It is not long before another action scene emerges in a form of retelling of an incident by Alex Murphy unlike the original version where he get shot this version from what we see on the trailer is a car explosion which result in Murphy becoming robocop which to be honest wasn't to bad from the original. I do how ever think that the director made a good choice in casting an unknown star Joel Kinnaman to play Alex Murphy/robocop as i think if they got a well know Hollywood actor this film just would have the emotional &amp; intense feel to it,which Joel Kinnaman bring to the character he plays this role prefect. There was the original score music from the original film which was good add that extra fan base something to be pleased with, as for the armour, the original silver armour from 1987 version was good, but I've got to say the new silver armour look amazing, but its just a shame that it was change to black for most of the film, although the black colour wasn't to bad it did work, but i know a lot of fan probably wont like it. The action scenes that stand out the most happen in the last third of the movie; a gun fight with Alex's main suspect and the gripping robot fight in the climax, with some test range fight as you see him being test up again the machines with Rick Mattox played brilliantly by Jackie Earle Haley who was a bit of a hard ass in this film which had a funny moment with Alex as robocop, most of the scene went well. Abbie Cornish bring the emotion side of the film as she plays Ellen Murphy Alex wife, she really play this well, the emotional level was believable which add that brilliant performance as well as her son David Murphy played by John Paul Ruttan. Bring the politics as well as Samuel Jackson, you have a brilliant performance from Michael Keaton playing the Company.Director of OmniCorp as a business man with a ruthless streak to him in a way money, publicity is more important than anything, Jay Baruchel which is a surprising role for him since he's normal playing a comic role in film he playing more of a high tech nerd in this film which he pulls off pretty well &amp; Jennifer Ehle who seem to be Michael keaton's character's publicity manager with a bit of a ruthless streak as well.Gary Oldman bring yet another outstanding performance as Dr. Dennett Norton who is the inventor of mech limbs for people that have lost limbs in accidents who made robocops Armour. Some scene at the begin were a little shaky with the camera during a gunfight but the rest of this film is pretty much well filmed with some stunning C.G.I effect's with the MA8's &amp; Edd 209's made for believable scenes, although the ending was a little disappointing i think the way its end's it has potential for the sequel to be better, because that what i think its needs to have a spectacular sequel with more action which the silver Armour because he looks better in silver. Fans of Robocop may not be pleased with this version as it lacks the violence and the tone of the original although they may get a kick seeing the modified silver robo-suit in some scenes. General audiences like me will be entertained by seeing a sleek Robocop hunting down criminals. It is clear that this tries to set up a franchise for further film, but time will tell if the sequel is better than the first film, but this is worth worth watch special in IMAX screening the picture is more clearer.Dislikes : One thing this film could of had was a better ending, like a bigger fight scene to end the film on a bigger tone setting up a sequel, not that the ending didn't set up a sequel i just think the ending could've been a bit better, i think they could of left him with the silver Armour on instead of change it half way through then changing it back i thought that was a little stupid but it was OK it was only a minor issue really with the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie On Its Own. Better Compared To The Original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original RoboCop grounded itself in satire and comedy. The robocop in that film, though mostly machine, often displayed a lot of human emotion and human wit. He told jokes. He understood sarcasm. He very convincingly mocked the police system. The film itself was chockablock with blood and exploding limbs. Often it all looked very comical. This new RoboCop is sleeker, smarter, faster, deeper, more tragic, and ultimately much needed.I thoroughly enjoyed this remake, and that's because it devotes a lot of its time and attention to Alex Murphy the man, not to robocop. There is a scene early on that demonstrates this difference. Murphy returns home after a hard day's work to be with his family. He tucks his son into bed and promises to watch hockey games with him. He retreats to his bedroom with his wife (Abbie Cornish) for a romantic night. His car alarm interrupts the undressing. What happens next you've already seen in the trailers.This scene is strategic because it introduces us to Murphy's family. Yes, it's a little bit contrived, but it's something the original film lacked. In order to feel for this man, we need to know what he has to lose. In the original, Murphy's family was only shown to us via memories and dreams. They could've been dead for all we knew. Here, they are very much alive, and Murphy's wife plays a larger role. By the end of the movie we are not sure if we feel more sorry for Murphy or for his family.The general idea of RoboCop, in case you missed the 1987 original directed by Paul Verhoeven, involves a police officer becoming a robot, or a cyborg. In order for this to happen, he has to die, or come dangerously close to death. All that has to survive are his neurological signs. The technology, developed by the Omni corporation, ensures that his physical body can be manufactured. The reason for this transformation, however, is different in both films.In the original, the Omni corporation wanted a more efficient law enforcer. They released a prototype machine that malfunctioned, causing the board of directors to push for a more organic approach. In this remake, robots are already patrolling the streets of foreign countries. Now, OmniCorp ? headed by Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) ? wants to disperse its robots to the streets of America. A debate rises. Do the people of America want humans with intuition, judgement and logic keeping them safe? Or do they want efficient robots protecting them and the lives of their law enforcers? "Not a single police officer has to die in the line of duty ever again", Raymond ensures.Raymond wants his machines protecting America, thus bloating his bank account. The United States congress believes nothing beats human intuition. Raymond and his PR team come up with the solution: Put a handicapped man in a mechanical body and give the people what they want. The best of both worlds. They find Murphy, badly charred and disfigured after a murder attempt sends his car up in flames. With the help of R&amp;D chief, Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman), they create robocop.Murphy is played by Swedish-American actor, Joel Kinnaman, who does a fine job of underacting. This is ideal because he spends most of the movie sedated, stoned, or rigid-faced. I am not familiar with his work, but I suspect he was chosen because his mouth, chin, and voice bear uncanny similarities to Peter Weller's. His downgrade from human being to monotone machine is well charted. And at times it's very painful to witness. Director Jos Padilha does well to draw his transformation to the foreground. Here is a man whose only hope for survival is to become a machine. And in order for him to become a successful machine he has to surrender his humanity. Where is the line that separates us from them?RoboCop takes its time with its characters. It gives us the space to lend sympathy. We are familiar with Murphy's plight, but we are not familiar with what this plight does to him. Now we are. Now we can see that he isn't a hero; he's the victim. His whole life is nothing but a test. A gimmick to help promote OmniCorp's arrogance. The original RoboCop was a gritty and gory action flick that exalted its titular character to superheroism. It lacked depth and patience, and it never penetrated robocop's metallic exterior. If I had to judge this remake on its own, I would've given it 3 stars out of 5. Compared to the original, it gets 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the new Robocop and I've got to say the movie is really very good. Before watching the movie I've read reviews on IMDb, and because of bad reviews I expected nothing from the movie, but now I'm confused because the movie is really god and I don't get all this bad reviews. Well I think you need to consider two things: 1. Anybody can write review on IMDb. 2. The movie talks against new American way of "solving" problems with drones, and it brings right to our face corporation "mechanics". Conclusion: some groups of people maybe are not happy with that. I recommend everybody to see the movie. You would not regret it. It's far better than the most of marvel super heroes movies. The stories you'll find in Iron Man are like some bad jokes against Robocop story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best thing to happen to RoboCop since 1987</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this short and simple: this movie will be what you want it to be. If you are wholeheartedly against the changes they've made to RoboCop and have spent the past 2 years complaining on internet forums about how you don't like his black suit, how it's not R-rated, or how all remakes suck then you wont enjoy yourself here. As a long time RoboCop fan I wanted to give this a chance and I am so glad I did. It's everything a RoboCop fan could want in a film and easily the best thing to happen since the incarnation of the character in 1987. Because lets face it; Robo 2 was okay, Robo 3 was a disaster and everything since (TV show, comics) have all been terrible... this franchise needed a change.This is perhaps why I enjoyed it so much; I wanted change. It's hard to compare the original with this one because they are so different. While the original focused more on all-out mayhem, crazy villains, its satirical approach to American culture and its use of black humour -- this film focuses more on the realism, dramatic and emotional side of RoboCop/Murphy. It deals with themes of corruption, political propaganda and real human emotions. This film to me feels like what "Batman Begins" (2005) was to "Batman" (1989). Both a fantastic and equally good movies but very different in their executions of the character.I'm not saying this will be for everyone but if you are a real RoboCop fan not afraid of change or a newcomer to the franchise then its well worth a look. If you're stuck in the past and would rather watch the inferior sequels again over this then that's your decision; but you're missing out big time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was expecting disappointment, but was pleasantly surprised. I'd buy that for a dollar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a die-hard fan of the original Robocop movies (more the first two rather than the third) as well as the TV series. As far as claims of "destroying the franchise" go I definitely believe the Dark Justice mini-series still claims that title.There is no doubt, a lot of fans were very concerned when they saw the trailer and the new "suit". It's a huge deviation from the accepted canon of Robocop, and my initial impression was that this movie would be an extremely poor remake.Now, don't get me wrong - this movie definitely does not surpass the original Robocop (this is definitely no Nolan Batman trilogy) but it's actually a very interesting and quite entertaining movie in it's own right -- but more in a 'Aliens vs Predator' popcorn flick, rather than a timeless classic.The good: I actually think the new robocop suit worked quite well; and I oddly enough now find myself thinking the new suit is more believable than the slow, clunky version of the 80s. Whilst not nearly as violent as the original it offers plenty of action and you will not be disappointed with the action scenes. As shown in the trailer a huge deviation from the canon is that Murphy's family are more involved this time around and it made for an interesting (but underused) plot device. There are also plenty of one-liner references to the original movie to pay homage for the fans --- I'd buy that for a dollar!Samuel L Jackson's Pat Novak (an obvious take on the likes of O'Reilly Factor style "news" shows) was brilliantly done as the film's satire device - and Jackson clearly lavished this role. (His last few lines in the film are quite brilliant).However, some niggles do hold this movie back from being the classic that the original was. The script, whilst enjoyable, simply does not have anywhere near the depth of the original. Whilst there are some dark moments it is not terribly engaging; this is more a statement of how brilliant the original was however, rather than a statement on this movie. So long as you're not comparing it to the original, this movie is a 9/10 and quite a lot of fun.But, Peter Weller will always be 'Robocop'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reviews on IMDb for this movie can be a little misleading but despite the negative views about the movie me and the wife went to see it anyway.. and were not disappointed.I may take some flack for this but if I were to sit through the '87 original then I would consider it to be quite lame compared to this reincarnation. The story is different enough to make it a refreshed product and not a copy of the '80's classic but the main difference was the increased emphasis as Alex Murphy the person as compared to the '87 version which was Alex Murphy the robot.Plus all this talk about a movie that talks emotion but lacks emotion, well the movie centred on the emotional impact of the transition from human to cyborg, and carried it off quite well considering the limited time available to the Director to fit all this in.The only tiny spoiler I'll list here concerns the most shocking part of the movie where Officer Murphy is shown what is left of him after surgery to save him from an attempted murder. I do have to say the sequence against the Robots was really good as people have already stated.Joel Kinnaman and Abbie Cornish give very decent performances in their chosen roles and Joel coped well considering that I've not seen him in any other movies prior to this with the exception of the US remake of 'Dragon Tattoo' but I've gotta say that I missed him in that one.I give this movie 8 out of 10 whereas the wife wants to give it 10 out of 10 so I've met her in the middle. A sterling effort from all involved, a really good movie that everyone in the cinema enjoyed, hardly any screen glare from people checking emails or playing Candy Crush through boredom. Top quality entertainment from this flick.Go see it and forget about the negative hot air from the old guffers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was met by very positive reviews. I personally enjoyed the film, immensely. The plot from what I could understand, was very simple that Alex is a cop on Detroits streets. There was an attempted murder done on him, his injuries was so severe. He only had the head and lungs and one hand left fromt he explosion. So to save what was left from him, they made a manRobot or "Tinman". It was most impressive. Only two faults I found with the film. There was no need in my opinion for the TV presenter style of the movie. Samuel L. Jackson don't get me wrong did a fantastic job, however with that in mind I didn't' see the logic in it. And secondly fault, I personally am not into seeing body parts namely the lungs and brain. LIke when they were removing a machine part that was implanted in the brain, I personally wouldn't want to see it. If you want to see body parts, go and look at medical programs such as Grey's Anatomy or Casualty etc., I totally enjoyed the film no doubt. The action in it. Aww it brought back great memories. from the childhood. It brought great expectations and lives to its name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never ever we will have a movie that will make us forget the original. However, this movie might be a better beginning for letting two other sequel that will make us forget the movies 2 &amp; 3 from the 90'. They made a nearly good job with most of the actions scenes and the plot but there are some design and casting problems that is making the movie disappointing at some crucial moments, like no real bad ass, no charismatic main character: even Keaton and Oldman seems to overplay. The only surprises are Kinnaman and Jackson that really fit in their roles. About Design, only ED-209 and black-Grey robot design are all right, but the entire black is NOT enjoyable on screen, hopefully at the end of the movie we got confirmation that we wont see the black suit again in the possible sequels. The only appreciable thing is the helmet with red lights, the bike is convenient and make things going faster in the movie. One last thing, but no least, the soundtrack is unpleasant, the background music in the trailer could have been a good tune for the entire movie, but no they used a digitally mixed part of the main theme of the original movie, not the best idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who doesn't love robots? Recently I even bought a robotic body massager! Is it because it is man's version of creating life? And to create that one being better than humans and animals ie. One who will obey all commands without fail? Make no mistake- the Robocop remake is an excellent action movie. The story of Alex Murphy, a righteous cop who is almost killed in the line of duty, but brought back to life to prevent crime when put in a robotic suit is as endearing as it was 27 years ago. It starts with a raging debate in a transgression ridden near future. Robots have already proved their worth in war, should they be allowed to handle law enforcement in America? Multibillion dollar corporation Omnicorp's CEO Raymond Sellers (Michael Keaton) thinks yes, and so does the blustering, agenda driven, opinion modifying TV host Pat Novak (Samuel L Jackson). Opposing them are politicians and the Dreyfuss Act which prevents the presence of robots on US soil, because they lack a conscience. Let us put a man in a machine, say Sellars. Utilizing state of the art biomechanics technology, and a willing donor in Joel Kinnaman's Murphy, Robocop is positioned as the future of American justice- Half man, Half machine, Full cop goes the tag-line, but in order to make him as effective as robots, his creators make him into a machine who thinks it is human. In a showy debut, he captures a long absconding criminal, swaying public opinion. This Robocop oozes style, has a fast bike, and comes in black. Action set pieces soon take over, and the plot follows the original as Robocop solves his own attempted murder and brings down Omnicorp.The original Robocop has endured because it was not only an action movie, it was also a treatise on corporate greed, unchecked capitalism, and of course, corruption. Paul Verhoeven's ability to marry explicit violence with social commentary is unparalleled. New director Jose Padilha understandingly stayed away from the visionary standards set by Verhoeven, and fashioned the remake as a much more personal film. So all the philosophical ramblings are limited within the talk show walls, and center stage is Alex's struggles to retain his humanity within the suit, and his relationship with his family. Alex's coma is a Sinatra filled melody, and when he comes around, he is confused initially, then follows the anger and horror as the audience sees what is left of his body. Like Padilha's groundbreaking Elite Squad series, the action is excellent, and the visual effects are plausible- whether it be the ED-209 battle robots, bionics or holographs. A standout action sequence is shot in complete darkness, with gunfire lighting giving a quick peek at the damage.The ensemble star cast is one for the long haul, as this franchise seems to be set of sequels and all do a decent job. There is Gary Oldman in his Commissioner Gordon mode, as Robo's creator, Abbie Cornish as his troubled wife, Jackie Earl Haley as his trainer, and Jay Baruchel as a marketer. The film could have done with a bit more humor, and a worthy villain. It is very tricky to remake a cult classic. Just by jazzing up visuals and putting new actors does not bring back the connect with a movie that many of us have grown up with. So while the 2014 remake will not replace Peter Weller's original that resides somewhere deep in my movie crazy heart, this one though a PG13 popcorn flick, just does enough to be memorable, and that itself is an achievement -8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A more human remake and a promise of peace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The war on terrorism saw the rise of drone warfare that not only saved lives of soldiers on field but also improved the military's attacking prowess. The future portrayed by director Jose Padilha (Elite Squad) is much more sophisticated with droids and weaponized machines taking the place of real soldiers in combative warfare. The essence of both the original Robocop and its remake is that they are reflective of their times. Padilha exposes the need for human emotions and sensibilities that are lacking in even the most advanced machines and how that need becomes completely irrelevant when politics and mean businesses are in control of who or what is on the street, protecting civilians. Alex Murphy is as human as a robot can get and the movie deals with his conflict between a controlling software and the brain's emotional impulses. His family wants the human, Omnicorp desires the Robot while American citizens are shrouded in political darkness.In a live report covering Operation Freedom in Tehran, Novak (Samuel L. Jackson) asserts the success of robots in peacekeeping abroad while questioning America's reservations against employing the technology within its borders. Novak maybe overly patriotic but his allegiance to Omnicorp soon becomes ridiculously obvious. Sellars (Michael Keaton) brilliantly plays the head of the robotics conglomerate Omnicorp that employs Dr. Norton's (Gary Oldman) genius in robotic prosthesis to create the most human-robot peacekeeper that can win over Americans. After a suspicious explosion, Murphy's salvaged organs are then given a Robotic body that keeps him well alive but devoid of sensibilities that often try to overcome his programmed actions. His wife, though glad of his survival, is cynical of Omnicorp's real intent and Murphy's whimsical attitude towards his family. Meanwhile, Robocop is a hit for the citizens of Detroit as he nabs numerous law breakers in a short period. As he investigates and closes each crime incident, the inevitable occurs when his own accident comes under his scanner. Murphy's persistence in finding the mastermind makes him a nemesis of both Omicorp and the law. That's when Robocop goes crazy.Jose Padilha's screenplay and direction question morality, justice and freedom in the application of robotic warfare. Constantly, it is Murphy's inquisitive human nature behind the stoic and methodical Robocop that becomes the distinct feature of this installment. The battle between man and machine is well delineated in both emotional and physical aspects. Jose's take on this 1987 franchise is of course technologically advanced and while the shoot-out sequence in the abandoned warehouse is thrilling enough to be the best of the movie, there's little else that impresses much. Today's suit could be loaded with weapons but we mostly have Murphy pulling out the gun from his thigh as expected. But damn! That Motorbike......Joel Kinnaman doesn't create the greatest appeal in Robocop's shoes but give him time to play the emotions that range from shock, devastation and anger to see what he is capable of. Gary Oldman is excellent in his dedication to helping mankind rather than supporting malpractice and he would be quite a pillar in this franchise. Samuel Jackson is lavishly over-the- top but that's not his fault. Michael Keaton convinces us of his ambition, greed and confidence in his technology to the extent that he is at times, not wrong. You dislike what he does to the Murphys but you still support his initiatives for America. Murphy's inability to be with his family and his struggle to overcome the shock of his accident are the emotional platforms on which, corporation evil and politics make up for dirty business. The proceedings get predictable and may even drag the film between action sequences but clearly, MGM &amp; Sony Pictures' intention is to tease with sequels that can build on the platform.- 6.882 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw RoboCop on VHS when I was 13. Somehow Murphy's drama resonated more than the ultra-violence. The moment Lewis says "Murphy, it's you"; him visiting his old home; the moment he takes off his helmet; the whole "is he a man trapped in a machine or a machine that thinks it's a man". All these impressed me more than, say, the "acid bath".Based on early signs, I thought the new RoboCop will be much worse - the stills, the trailers, nothing convinced me.But the movie blew me away. Better in all areas (except the violence). Yes, it's not a "hard R" but there's plenty of violence, just not over- the-top. In fact, there are enough elements to make the movie pretty scary for kids (the moment Alex sees what's left of him is nightmarish).The movie is more modern. With all the advancements in robotics, surveillance, drones and even politics, you just can't play the old cards. The world has changed but the RoboCop DNA is all there.</fullReview>

However to those who complain this remake isn't violent enough, strays too far from the original etc I say you already have the best interpretation of THAT RoboCop - treat this as an entirely different movie with a few nods to the original and you might actually enjoy this.I won't for a second claim this movie is perfect or more enjoyable than the original but what you do have is a solid action/sci fi flick with a twist. Sure there are a few annoyances - the lack of a suitably nasty villain, the somewhat questionable screenplay at times and some poor performances (Abbie Cornish). But with the ever excellent Gary Oldman and an admirable performance from Joel Kinnaman this has a lot going for it.A solid 7 out of 10 and I really hope there is a sequel simply because I love RoboCop!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hit and miss but loads of potential for a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review ever of one my favorite films of all time - and I'd been dreading the remake.Pro:Joel Kinnerman - The man was the best thing about the whole cast.The film is its own beast - While this film cannot be compared favorably to the classic 1987 version, it was very enjoyable and was more a re-imagining of Robocop rather than a straight "remake" which I enjoyed immensely.Modern Update - This works pretty well, especially the way Robo' makes use of the modern technology. Even though its set in 2028 it still feels very relevant to our time.Plot - While Paul Verhovens version had a wicked mix of over-the-top violence and sharp satire on America's greed, this one focuses more on Robo' himself and the concept of having a machine do work where accountability is an issue. This I believe is a plus and is what helps have the film stand on its own.Con:Casting - Too many bad guys and not one of em really stood out, unlike the original. The rest did a good job but nothing that really stood out, underutilized is the word to use here.PG-13 - This rating really did hold it back, which is a shame because this re-imagined world holds a lot of potential.Action - Terrible, shaky camera effect was not a suitable as I couldn't tell what was happening half the time.Last 1/3 - This felt rushed and really sloppy, disappointing especially when one remembers just what Robo' did to Clarence Boddigger (2x) and Dick Jones in Verhovans version.Overall: I feel the PG-13 really hurt this film, while I honestly enjoyed the first 2/3, the lack of an epic finale just left me wanting and kinda angry to honest.However against all expectation I did enjoy the film because the director chose to go in a slightly different direction and because of that and the enormous potential this created, I give it a nice 7/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally A Good Robocop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an excellent movie and the best robocop since the first. I'd say it is even better than the first. People keep comparing this movie to original. In hindsight, the 1987 was a decent flick, but I remember when people complained or praised that too. The problem with remakes, reboots, copycats, sequels is that they have a benchmark to live up too. The originals didn't or their closest benchmark was something within the genre (ie SCI-FI ish).Nostalgia is a hurdle for any new movie to overcome. Sometimes nostalgia just wins, because we can't imagine something better today than what we considered the coolest thing when were younger.Ask a young person who has never seen the original (there are lots of them!) to watch this one first, then watch the old one... you'll probably hear a lot of them say how dated or fake looking the old one is.Sorry for the lengthy blurb, go see this movie. Its a fun enjoyable ride, the way movies were meant to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Robocop movie in my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my friends bought the movie tickets for me I was like, "What!? We're watching Robocop?! Why???" I thought it's gonna be bad movie. But when Alex Murphy got his body sliced into pieces, I was like "Damn! That's gross! Whoever made this movie is a f'ng genius!" My friends and I were speechless the whole time. I also like the part when he acted like a real robot(no emotion)when his doctor tried to fix his brain. I wish robots can be part of our lives in the future. Police needs robots, just like in the first part of the movie where soldiers were sent to Afghanistan to battle. I really think that Samuel Jackson's commentary is correct except when his temper get hot, he looks like a guy who has an anger management issue. But over all, the movie is great! Perfect for father and son bonding. Great acting Joel Kinnaman! I don't know this actor until I watched Robocop. We will wait for part 2. ^_^</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honestly, it is not bad and somewhat satisfying, AS LONG as you do not compare to the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am still deciding between a 6 or 7 for this film but I can safely say it is a satisfying reboot. Now obviously comparing this remake to the original RoboCop is quite unfair because let's face it the original is never getting topped ever no matter how many remakes/reboots are made. I went in with a mindset of not going to be better but the movie should end up good which is the right mindset way to go. You have to keep in mind that original RoboCop was rated X and remake RoboCop is PG13 or 15 so there are a lot differences. Let's break it down below.Now this remake tells the story of RoboCop in the future rather present time (at that time) which is a nice interesting concept with internet, crime history files, CCTV data in play for RoboCop.When I first heard about Joel playing Alex Murphy, upon watching his interviews I did not believe he is the right pick. In the movie I guess he played his part well, he was just not written well, Alex Murphy was more of an attitude Mr. I am so cool cop, which I personally did not enjoy, his RoboCop was not that bad though, a little cool really. That is one of the "bads" of the movie, along with the writing and the villain was no memorable at all, in fact he sucked. There is obviously more than one villain but the starting could have been so much better. the climax of the film was not hard hitting as how a climax should be. The worst part is the whole point and core importance of RoboCop is a machine who journeys his was back to human conscious and emotions, I will not spoil but it is done differently here, which is bad because that is the one important thing they should have kept. Shaky cameras at the beginning made it a bit hard to watch, and of course Detroit looked so safe, and clean, which obviously is also a problem in this remake, which connects to the fact its not a dystopian future as how it should be.The "goods" on the other hand include Michael Keaton who was amazing, seriously you just love him, Welcome Back Michael! Gary Oldman also was excellent, he is a character you will end up loving throughout the movie. Jackie Earle Haley was quite a douche-bag but he played a great douche-bag so well done there. Abbie Cornish deserves praise because you feel her pain, sadness, and frustration in the film so that is good acting there. The comedy side of the movie is held by Jay Barchel who was hilarious, I laugh every time I see him. Graphics are good. Concept was nice. Story was not very strong however, although the satire in the movie is still there and not bad, just not very in-depth.Ultimately, the new RoboCop is ONLY good if you do not compare it to the original. You can compare Stallone's Judge Dredd to Urban's Dredd since Stallone's Dredd was terrible while Urban's was a massive upgrade. This film on the other hand every person knows it will be better than the original, so watch it with the mind set of "It will not be better than the original but I still want a nice movie."You do get an alright movie. Its just not re-watchable a bunch of times unlike original RoboCop which can be re-watched a 100 times in a row.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something more than just a generic action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is clear that this version is for the younger people; this has lots of explosions, shiny and sleek CGI and lots of action. The trailers makes the movie looks like a mindless action movie with lots of CGI and action. However Robocop is more than just an action movie, it involves politics and emotions. My knowledge of Robocop is limited. I remembered watching the original movie but I didn't watch the sequels. And that's all. What I definitely do know is that the 2014 version is a toned-down version of the violent original. The story: The movie starts off with an engrossing news which features Samuel Jackson and an intense but brief action scene. It is not long before another action scene emerges in a form of retelling of an incident by Alex Murphy. It is also not long before he gets into an accident (different from the original). That accident makes him Robocop. You will think that there will be lots of action in the second third of the movie. In fact, it is the second third of the movie that sets it different from a mindless action movie. The pace slows down to give a more emotional feeling to Robocop and the difficulties the OmniCorp company faces. The last third of the movie catches its pace back to its intense climax.There is a lot of action but they are brief and not very memorable. Plus sometimes, the quick cuts and hand-held camera work become slightly annoying. The action scenes that stand out the most happen in the last third of the movie; a gun fight with Alex's main suspect and the gripping robot fight in the climax. Acting wise is alright, none particularly stand out. Music wise is decent with hints from the original's music, adding a pumping score to an action-packed movie.Overall: Fans of Robocop may not be pleased with this version as it lacks the violence and the tone of the original although they may get a kick seeing the modified silver robo-suit in some scenes. General audiences like me will be entertained by seeing a sleek Robocop hunting down criminals. It is clear that this tries to set up a franchise. Only time can tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick, polished and reasonably entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, unlike many others, do not hold Paul Verhoven's 1987 RoboCop dear to my heart. I would even argue that of all the cult favourites from the VHS era that are inevitably remade, this one was actually ripe for an update. Yet Jose Padilha's slick and glossy reboot has undoubtedly missed a trick. Focussing on making this an iRoboCop for the smartphone generation ? the set pieces are certainly sleeker and more sophisticated ? Padilha's cautionary message on the use of drones is all but forgotten by the end credits, despite being as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. There's also the little problem of employing the oversaturated Samuel L. Jackson in a bombastic role and underusing the talented Abbie Cornish as Robo's suffering wife. Where this remake succeeds though is in the pure entertainment factor; whereas its predecessor was aiming for gory, subversive b-grade griminess, RoboCop 2.0 aspires for polished, frenetic action that sits comfortably in the popcorn genre, and on that level it largely works. Joel Kinnaman capably fills Peter Weller's shoes as the Detroit cop, and family man, who's afforded a second chance at life as a law-enforcing machine, whilst Michael Keeton is amusingly slimy as corporate moneymaker Raymond Sellars and Gary Oldman adds depth and intellect as the conflicted Dr Dennett Norton. Those who approach this as the big-budget blockbuster it is will be reasonably gratified, devotees of the original will likely be dissatisfied.</fullReview>

Pace of the movie is one thing to comment about as it was really consistent and fun.Production details and CGIs that are just absolutely feast to the eye.As far as robotic kind of movie is concern, for me, this is far better than "Iron Man 3" and "Enthiran".Gray Oldman was cool and Michael Keaton just reminded me why he is one of my favorite villains. Joel Kinnaman as RoboCop/Murphy was pretty good, and I can't comment much on Abbie Cornish, you'll know why when you see it. Samuel L. Jackson well is Samuel L. Jackson, as enjoyable as ever. The rest of the cast was pretty much okay, nothing much.Alex turned into Robocop in this movie was better than the original since they really made you the pain and suffering that Alex and his family were going through. His new armour was a knock off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A commendable effort at a reboot of one of the best films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the original RoboCop being the only film I've ever seen that I would genuinely say is perfect, I was very hesitant in terms of this reboot. I was worried about the PG-13 rating, the casting, the plot, essentially everything you could be worried about. I'm glad to say that this reboot is an entertaining film in it's own right. This is definitely a reboot, not a remake, while a fair amount of concepts and plot points are reminiscent of the original this is it's own film that takes a completely different approach to the premise of RoboCop. I personally am glad they did not go down the Total Recall route of trying to be a remake but ending up a complete shell of the original with nothing new to bring to the table. The decision to take RoboCop down a different path means that you are able to see him in ways you had never really considered, which I enjoyed a large amount. While I certainly don't think people will be watching it thirty years down the line as we do with the original, it's a good time for both the hard core RoboCop fan and the complete newcomer (who absolutely needs to watch the original).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting Reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I have seen the first RoboCop film by Paul Veerhoven back in 1987. That was big film back then. I do not really recall much detail about it anymore, except that it was about a policeman who was morphed into a cyborg. This is new RoboCop film is rated PG-13 and my kids wanted to watch it more than I did. However, since it was receiving good reviews so far, we gave it a go.The year is 2028, and OmniCorp supplies the world with robotic drones to take over military duties overseas. However, domestically, OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars is meeting opposition from Congress. So he decides to develop a robot with a human conscience. So with the cybernetic talents of Dr. Dennett Norton, the first RoboCop was born from Officer Alex Murphy who was critically-injured in an explosion.I do not really recall how faithful this was to the 1987 original or not, but this film was quite a solid one on its own. The backstory was good, with the political angles and the corporate greed all there to make it interesting. The special effects showing what is left of RoboCop's human body behind all the armor was disturbing. The gun fight scenes of RoboCop vs. drones were shot like we were in a frenetic shootout video game, shaky cam and all. I did not recognize the actor who played Alex Murphy when we were watching. It turned out to be one Joel Kinnaman, a new name for me. He lacked a strong charisma on screen as lead actor, so the movie had a B- movie feel when he was on. To his credit though, Kinnaman was able to portray the internal battle between his character's humanity vs. the technology of RoboCop very well.Fortunately, there were big names there like Gary Oldman (as the sympathetic Dr. Norton), Michael Keaton (as the snaky and ruthless Mr. Sellars) and Samuel L. Jackson (hilarious as the pro-robot TV personality Pat Novak) in supporting roles to elevate this film to A levels. Abbie Cornish is also there, playing Alex's conflicted wife Clara.This is a straight-out futuristic action movie. It somehow felt like one of those Marvel films, like "Iron Man", the way it was done by Director Jos Padilha. The computer-generated actions scenes tends to overwhelm the human element though.While it was exciting in the action sequences and thought-provoking in the moral dilemmas it presents, ultimately, it somehow also felt like the remake of another Paul Verhoven film, "Total Recall." This was not really necessary, except to resurrect the character for the newer generation of movie viewers.</fullReview>

Those people won't let go of the past because they're too attached to the past, they're probably the same ones who hate Man Of Steel. (Well, Lone Ranger was horrible, I'll admit that.)So, now that that's over with, on with the review.So the movie itself is full of action, comedy (Provided by Samuel L. Jackson (The Avengers, Unbreakable)) and sci-fi.So the movie opens in 2028 with robots in different countries but the US isn't one of them because senator believes that robots don't know the value of human life and that they don't have sympathy, so the owner of the robot-making company, OmniCorp, Michael Keaton (Batman, Toy Story 3) says to his colleagues, "Let's put a man inside a robot." (In other words blow a cop's car up when he next unlocks it amputate his arms and legs and cover it up with a rip-off of the Iron Man suit.) (Seriously is that how they came up with RoboCop in the first place?) so he wakes up 3 months later, but he's being controlled by Keaton and Gary Oldman (Harry Potter 3, The Dark Knight) but he goes a-wall solves the crime of his murder and kills Keaton and a hole bunch of other crooks and Oldman helps him out by taking out a chip in his brain that allows people to shut him down and overall I love this movie and I think you will too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less a remake and more a re-invention; good in some parts, heavy-handed in others.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the recent flood of remakes, prequels and sequels, it would seem that Hollywood has really lost the plot - lacking original new ideas, studio executives are diving into their back catalogues and dusting off perfectly good films and rebooting them for a new generation of audiences. Generally, the results haven't been great. In that context, it's hard to fault a generation of fans for worrying over Jos Padilha's reboot of Robocop. Fans have fretted at the titular cyborg cop's brand-new, all-black suit and aired doubts about whether the remake can capture the darkly satirical spirit of Paul Verhoeven's 1987 film.As it turns out, the question is whether it should do so. In a handful of moments, Padilha's Robocop displays the same tongue-in-cheek audacity that elevated Verhoeven's film from trashy action flick to socially conscious satire. But it's also an entirely different beast of a film that has its own considerably more sombre agenda. Steering largely clear of the humour that suffuses the 1987 film, Padilha instead homes in on the very human, heartbreaking dilemma posed by a protagonist who wakes up one day as a mix of man and machine.Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) - loving husband, supportive father, upstanding cop - lives in an America that still resists the idea of unfeeling robots patrolling the streets. OmniCorp, led by the Machiavellian Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton), is keen to bring its machines back to home ground. When Alex is critically injured after a disastrous crime bust, he becomes the prime candidate for OmniCorp's decision to address ground concerns by fusing man with metal. When he wakes up, Alex finds himself in a shiny, metallic new body, crafted by Dr. Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman).What follows is a bitter tug-of-war for Alex's soul, as he goes from wounded hero to test subject. On the one side are his wife Clara (Abbie Cornish) and son David (John Paul Ruttan); on the other, Sellars, Norton and all-purpose henchman Rick Mattox (Jackie Earle Haley). The film wants us and Alex - trapped in between and, more often than not, sedated into submission - to ask important questions about humanity, family and love.In the cinema, it actually works well enough. The pounding action beats come fast and furious, although some are too murkily captured. You'll also find yourself identifying with Alex when he wakes up and his armour is removed, so that he can see just how much (or, to be more accurate, just how little) of his body actually remains. It's a scene that's almost sickening in execution and implication: as Alex breathes in and out, his lungs pumping pink and horrible in the mirror, it's easy to ache for the man who's been lost inside a tangle of machinery and corporate greed. Kinnaman is particularly effective in this moment, his horror and heartbreak worn weary on his face.But poke away at Padilha's plot and it turns out that, in retrospect, there are more than a few chinks in its armour. Quite a few interesting ideas fall disappointingly by the wayside as the film cranks into higher gear, such as the morality of the man within the machine. Padilha actually sets Murphy up as a pretty reckless, hotheaded and vengeful guy, which begs the question whether he has any more right to make life-and-death decisions than an emotionless drone. As the film's core message - an excoriation of American big business and politics - is revealed, so do these notions of character and complexity get buried beneath increasingly tense face-offs between Sellars and Norton.It's frustrating, too, that an element deliberately played up in this incarnation of Robocop - Alex's family - turns out to be so disappointing in the end. As a character, Clara is a colourless washout: she seems to exist only to complicate the plot, signing Alex up for surgery at first and creating problems later when her newly robotised husband is kept away from the family. For a film that seems so concerned with exploring Alex's inner dilemma, it's a problem when the family he's fighting for has to struggle to feel real.To its credit, Padilha's Robocop comes determinedly to life when he plays up the darker side of American politics and big business. His supporting cast in this regard is absolutely first-rate: Keaton oozes through the film, his clean-cut American charm scraping away to reveal the greed lurking within him. In a way, this is just as much Oldman's film as it is Kinnaman's: Dennett Norton's crisis of conscience poses the same questions of a different character - what is it like to be human? When is your soul too effectively sold to the highest bidder? Oldman - who could just as easily have played Keaton's part - is the soul of the movie, tied up in knots as he slowly realises what he has done to Alex.In fact, the film's greatest moment is also among its very last. Samuel L. Jackson, who plays the incredibly pro-Omnicorp reporter Pat Novak, bookends this incarnation of America as he pushes hard - too hard - for robots to patrol America's streets. The way Jackson's scenes are shot are almost gaspingly hard-hitting, packed with a delicious satirical punch that otherwise comes across as too heavy-handed and gloomy during much of the overly serious film. When heading into the cinema, fans of Verhoeven's Robocop might want to adjust their expectations. Strictly speaking, Padilha's version isn't a reboot so much as it is a re-imagination. Taking the same basic premise and characters, Padilha has wrought a darker, more heavy-handed castigation of American big business, one that stands quite well on its own as a morality tale. But the film does also let its protagonist down somewhat, by promising more depth but not quite managing to deliver.</fullReview>

It's kinda different than the classic Robocop, however, this movie stands of its own story and interesting plot with up-to-the-edge of your seat ride of the intense gun fire action scenes. As far as robotic kind of movie is concern, for me, this is far better than "Iron Man 3" and Hugh Jackman's 2011 "Real Steel".If IMDb would only allow me to rate this movie more than 10 stars, then maybe I already would have rated this movie to the most top of their rating section. If you're looking for intense computer-game-like rapid gun fire action and jaw-dropping stunt entertainment then this is for you. This movie has also better family-drama attachment story than the classic one.THIS IS A MUST TO WATCH MOVIE to date this month, don't listen to the brickbats, they have weird tastes of the movie they like, but go watch and entertain yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before i say anything, I just want you guys to know that I am huge fan of the original movie.. watched it as kid and I still watch it 25 years later at least once to twice a year.The new RoboCop is how reboots should be done, it is very much different than the original in all ways possible, it's more serious, deep and it touches subjects that matter now in post 2010 and not the problems in the 80s. It deals with Murphy's humanity, his struggle, his heart and soul, things that ere never touched in the Original.i am so glad they rebooted the franchise because quite frankly the original's sequels were so bad. and RoboCop deserved better adventures to tackle. Gray Oldman was phenomenal and Michael Keaton just reminded me why he is one of my favorites actors. Action scenes are nice and you get something between the original RoboCop and the more modern Ironman movies. The movie is no masterpiece, It's no The Dark Knight but it can get there if it hopefully continued further.Just watch it with an open mind guys, just like how we all are going to watch Batman or Superman get rebooted countless times with different takes and themes, same with RoboCop.. It has to have its own direction.Finally I would rate this a 7.5/10 and in the current line of RoboCop movies it sits in second place after the Original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robocop might not live up to your expectations, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. The storyline was good, but there was not as many badass scenes as you would expect, from watching the trailer. *SPOILER* One of the most badass scenes was when Robocop shot his arm off. *SPOILER* Samuel L Jackson was good. Even though his role could be played by anyone else, but because it was Samuel Motherf*king Jackson, the scenes with him were more interesting and fun to watch. The actor playing Robocop was pretty convincing, with his near-expressionless face. I like how both the silver and black suits were used, but it would be cool to see him switch around the combat and tactical suits instead of him using the black suit through. There were also a few homages from the original Robocop, like "Dead or Alive, You're coming with me", which made things cooler. Robocop isn't exactly childish, despite a PG13 rating, but of course, it is nothing as violent as compared to the original Robocop. Robocop not only fights against his will, but there are also conflicts with his family. Its pretty much Robocop owning a bunch of crooks, avenging his "death" with him constantly shooting perfectly. It would be cool to see some close combat scenes with his fists or melee weapons though, instead of just Robocop + a bunch of guns. Not sure if such a thing is possible from the original Robocop, but this is a reboot after all, so it would be cool to see a little variety. In Conclusion, if you are looking for a movie with plenty of shooting, a solid story with no plot twists, a story about robots and humanity, or you just want to see a new Robocop movie (without comparing to the original one), this is the movie you can go for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler warning* Finally, the remake I've been waiting for, is here.I saw the original RoboCop when I was a kid when it was aired on Television. It got me so hooked even though it was full of violence (My parents didn't bother with the violence). Of course at that time I didn't fully understand the criticism and the satire. For me the main attraction was, of course, Robot in action and it was awesome.Now, Jose Padilha tries to recreates the awesomeness of RoboCop once again on the silver screen with Joel Kinnaman as Murphy/RoboCop. Murphy is a loving husband/family man who is also a hardworking detective accompanied with his trusted partner, Jack Lewis. They try to keep Detroit safe from crimes and corruption which seems unstoppable. The film tries to question about robots replacing manpower as law enforcement in the future. It questions whether it's right to leave all the judgement of crime to an automated system that doesn't hesitate to take you down. It's also implied that Detroit's crime rate is high.However, to me this is where the problem lies. I will bring this up since this is a remake. In here there's only one notorious thug/gang leader or whatever you want him to be called, which never have any clear motive or anything. The movie never show any implication on about the how the city has that high crime rates. Yet, all of the sudden, after RoboCop was deployed, the crime rate goes down and people cheering for him, it was a bit strange for me.In the original, Detroit does seems like a dangerous city full of thugs. Even some of Bodicker's thugs doesn't hesitate blowing up cars, or some random thugs tries to rape a woman. It does show and implies that Detroit does have high crime rates and does need a more powerful law enforcement system. In here, we got nothing that shows Detroit as a crime ridden city, it was very clean. It makes the need of robots to reduce casualties implausible and questionable. The film also relied too much on the family drama, which I found half-baked. His partner, Lewis also forgettable, because, well, he does not do much as the original does. I decided to compare him to the original Lewis because in the original, Lewis was an important character.Action sequences was pretty okay for me. The CGI was pretty good, not mind blowing or something like that but it worked great but not memorable. Other parts was, forgettable because it was so generic and decent, lacking any powerful 'impact' for an action set. RoboCop's Black-tactical design was okay but it does feel weird and yes that right hand does distracting but not much. Acting was good and we have likable casts such as Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton. Joel Kinnaman as RoboCop/Murphy was pretty good, and I can't comment much on Abbie Cornish, you'll know why when you see it. Samuel L. Jackson is... Samuel L. Jackson, as enjoyable as ever. The rest of the cast was pretty much okay, nothing much.The film, as a remake, does deliver originality with hints of the original one. But when it comes to the impact, a moment of awe, of which the original delivered, this new one does not pack a punch. From the short-lived action sequences, underplayed plot, and some holes that just left floating, it felt that there was not enough 'energy'. But it's not as bad as most people expected to be, as it's enjoyable. Just never expect it to be a masterpiece or else, you will be disappointed. Sorry for my English, I hope you understand.

		<shortDescription>Should we reflect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alex, is you still there? Clara, stand away. I said things were complicated. Please give me some time. All I need is my husband back.Human and robot were diametrically opposed to each other. We built the robot for facility, but now we tried to replace human with it. People were scared and panic, afraid of robot's non-compassion and no- mercy. Even one day we put a human in the robot, we controlled and manipulated him(it), treating him as a machine. Tragedy happened. We sought justice and safety, trying to pacify the world that the robot was safe and necessary for crime precaution. Guess what?? The answer emerged. We were false and wrong. We built a hero, a robocop, to lie the masses. Something we desired was to justify the use of the robot. However, what we did was diverged, which leaded us to dig our own grave. The nature of a human, our instinct, was unchangeable and spontaneous. Never should we combine a man with a robot no matter how sophisticated it is.As a alert for all humans, we should keep our eyes on the use of the robots, or disaster will occur.

		<shortDescription>A new Robocop for a new generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty good movie. I like that this remake took only the core elements of robocop (cop got killed, made into a robot) and made an entire new story. It is definitely a more realistic take, a movie more in line with the year we living in. The movie has a healthy balance of plot, character moment, action and humor. I really enjoy Gary Oldman's conflicted scientist, Michael Keaton doing profit minded businessman (I'm sure a lot of people will be reminded of their bosses :P ), and SLJ stole the show as the hilariously bias news anchorman, the whole theater was laughing nonstop during his TV show.Joel Kinnaman did a good job as Robocop but only serviceable as Alex Murphy. Alex didn't do much before he was blown up. I hate to compare with the original but the car bomb definitely felt lacking the emotional punch or the oh **** factor. It would have been better if he was killed in a police shootout or get bomb during said shoot out or something. Also, there weren't enough chemistry or moment between Alex and his wife. The relationship played an important later on but the emotion just wasn't there.I really like the black suit but I wish the black suit would have more metallic feel, at least some metallic paint. It still looked rubbery to me, but it didn't bother much, especially it is slick in action. Speaking of actions, some of the action scenes were quite chaotic and shaky, but not to the extent of unwatchable. I really enjoy the field test, with the awesome music :P And the movie was rather slow in the beginning and then sorta rushed when reaching the end. As much as the SLJ commentaries were awesome and hilarious, some of it was rather jarring and broke the story flow.But overall, the good far outweight the bad. I recommend this movie and going to watch again soon.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been trying to watch this movie for a long time. RoboCop was releases only in VHS in Brazil with the USA title RoboCop. At the local release date, there was a lot of others Japanese ripoffs and remakes available.RoboCop looks like a female Kidou Keiji Jiban, which is a fantasy-techno-non-futurist Space Sheriff Gavin. They are all the same thing: someone gets hurt and a ultrascret project saved their lives , turning into a robot. So its time to get a good weapon and... revenge! The camera tricks (like wearing a mask) are really bad for a movie. The special effects are low budget, but its OK. The strange thing is that doesn't look like a Toei's movie, but a Toei's series. There's a lot of theme songs and in the end of the movie appears "The battle is just beginning". Does it supposed to have a RoboCop 2? My guess is that it supposed to be a pilot for some TV series. Even the end of the movie looks like an TV tokusatsu ending (like Juspion or Kamen Rider Black, posing like great heroes on a black background).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about emotions lacks emotional pull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS RoboCop reboot by director Jose Padilha, thankfully, doesn't try to copy the original 1987 version by Paul Verhoeven, although it does follow the same path. Viewers will still get to see a Christ-like figure being killed, resurrected and saving his city, or flock, from the evils of capitalism. There's still a corporation that's pulling the strings of the city, and maybe the whole country, by promoting its saviour, which in this 2014 version comes in a sleek black chrome finish. The 1987 was a satire about TV news programmes and the greed of corporations. However, its main theme was that underneath the Judge Dredd-like armour lay a heart teeming with humanity. The 2014 version still places the story in Detroit but doesn't mention that the city in reality is bankrupt. It also focuses more on the relationship between RoboCop and his wife and son, who were not prominent in the first version. RoboCop (Joel Kinnaman) hands Dr Dennett Norton a tough question. This film has its moments, particularly when RoboCop faces off against a multitude of robotic cops in a warehouse. He disposes of them with the elan of a confident gamer, and viewers even get to see his point of view. However, for a film that talks a lot about emotions, this film feels strangely detached, meaning, it doesn't encourage viewers to root for our "black" superhero. It doesn't help that RoboCop's wife keeps popping into the picture at inopportune moments. The filmmaker wants to show more of RoboCop's family life, but this is the part of the film that fails miserably. The idea of having robots patrolling cities was a new one in 1987. But, in 2014, with all the news about US drones taking out Afghan Taliban rebels, the idea of that now is much more plausible. Padilha frames his film with the notion that US robots and drones are maintaining law and order in faraway lands (Iran) but can't do the same back home because of a piece of legislation that bars them from doing so. Samuel Jackson plays TV host Pat Novak, whose in-your-face reportage is often incendiary. He asks if Americans are robo-phobic. "What's more important than the safety of the American people?" The preamble doesn't aid the film in any way. The film should have just cut out the first few minutes and leapt headfirst into the story. It wants to comment on current issues, just like what the 1987 film did, but its preface bogs down the film. Similarly, it showing OmniCorp as thinking about ways to maximise profits from its robots and drones in the US market is nothing short of boring. Isn't that what all corporations do? There's nothing devious about it. The firm wants to humanise its robots because OmniCorp boss Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) says Americans want a product with a conscience, or something that knows what it feels like to be human. I take this to mean that American troops or security forces will always think twice before killing civilians. I had to suppress a snigger when I heard Sellars say that line. Detective Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman of TV's The Killing) is a righteous cop who stumbles on a plot about dirty cops working hand in hand with drug lord Antoine Vallon (Patrick Garrow). For that, he gets blown into smithereens. When he next wakes up, he's in a body armour. He recoils at the sight of his metallic structure and runs out of the lab and into the fields in a scene similar to that in Avatar. The scene of Dr Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) showing RoboCop what's left of his body is touching, and so is the scene where he meets his son for the first time. RoboCop's wife, Clara (Abbie Cornish), is competent as the strong wife who wants to know what happened to her husband. Her total acceptance of his new body is commendable but it would have been more realistic to show her gasping or taking a moment to take it all in. She could also have been showed wondering how they would ever make love again. However, Clara becomes persistent and a pain in viewers' necks. I don't think viewers will for one minute believe in their unusual relationship. For the rest of the film, viewers will see RoboCop being put through his paces and watching him expand his limited acting skills. This brings us to Kinnaman, whose sardonic and wisecracking ways are curbed by the suit he's wearing. In fact, he's just a lump of metal. Paul Weller was in a similar situation in the first film but he allowed his acting to show us his pain, anger and desire for revenge. Kinnaman, meanwhile, just goes through the motions. In short, RoboCop is a huge mess that lacks emotion. Heck, I can't even be bothered to make myself be angry with this film or take it as an affront to the first film. 2 1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable But Not Too Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was definitely expecting much from this popular movie remake but came out from the theater feeling lost and disappointed. The technology, weapons and stuff were great but the director did not tell the story as intense as it should be. After elaborating the story &amp; building the characters in the movie for the first hour, the audience would naturally be expecting a mind blowing peak or probably a full blast of action scenes. It had those peaks but it just wasn't great enough to 'wow' me. The emotional scenes weren't that great. The action scenes were short and not much intensity. Overall, It was still an entertaining movie though, considering the acting, script and story were quite smooth. My advice? Don't expect too much twist &amp; surprise element before you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid piece of entertainment, let down by the shaky cameras...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I didn't watch the original RoboCop films, so no room for comparisons here. But then again movies are meant to be entertainments on their own, so here goes. Overall it is quite good, but the shaky cameras let down the experience, which otherwise would make it a solid piece of entertainment.So, the annoying fact here is that most of the action sequences rely on hand held cameras, and they are so shaky, most of the time I don't know what's happening. I see gunfires, and cops, and gunfires, and cops. Seriously, it is rather unbearable. Not that the whole action sequences are bad, the final act is decent, and when RoboCop is on his bike and scanning the area using CCTVs &amp; constructing virtual settings, it looked awesome, but every other action sequences are seriously let down by the shaky cams.Otherwise, everything else was good. I was sceptical about the casts initially, but they turned out okay, especially for Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton, who were just brilliant. The general plot line is good, and the conflicting idea of "man against machine" is properly raised, along with the social &amp; ethical issues that goes with it. There is a touch of drama with the emotional responses of Alex Murphy and his family members. Apparently they tried with the humour...tried, though. And also I find the sound effects rather brilliant and enjoyable, especially with the sound of RoboCop's movements.It seriously would have been a decent and solid entertainment, if not for the rather disappointing shaky cameras. The director could have done better, but everything else is good enough and certainly worth the price of admission.VERDICT:Good: Excellent sound effects, Decent plot, Great castsBad: Shaky camerasSCORE: 6.5blockbusted9.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome. Not To Be Compare With The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched Robocop this afternoon and overall,I liked it. The story does seem more complex but better then the 80s version. Joel Kinnaman plays a better Alex Murphy compared to Peter Weller with his more badass attitudeThe story itself for was what made the movie great. The way they told how Alex turned into Robocop in this movie was better than the original since they really made you the pain and suffering that Alex and his family were going through. I also liked how they brought back the classic theme into the film. Really missed it verymuchHowever, some of my complains was the suit. Never really liked it compared to the classic light blue but I was glad that they changed it back at the last minute.I also expected a more fearsome opponent for Robocop in this film. Some one like Kane but the action scenes were still awesome to watchOverall, an enjoyable film and can't wait for the crossover between Dredd andRobocop if those rumors are true</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Compare If You Want To Enjoy This Robocop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You cannot make one like the original. The original worked because it was made in the 80s. If the original were made in this era, it would be binned as a B-grade movie.Is this Robocop vanilla? YYYYYY-no. There's this issue about morality vs money and power. It's not totally about revenge like the first one.We enjoyed the original because it had excessive violence which was fun. Do we need to have that again? Do we need new ways of how Robo can beat the crap out of villains? NO.We need a story. There's a little whodunit despite very brief. which is not solved (is it?)It's something like The Amazing Spider-man... That plot was left hanging somewhere in the middle. so i guess we'll see that bad guy again in the sequel.So, I enjoyed it. Give it a shot. It's nothing revolutionary, but who needs that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the worst copy of a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got 1 thing to say,,the opening 10minutes of the movie is a big lia about Iran,which shows how un educated the cast is ,to destroy good figures of one old culture rich country of the world PERSIA,whose heritage is the jewel of all museums round the world.... Those parts is not even necessary,,,but yes,it is nothing more than a fiction that USA is even the good character which is helping world peace,,,Iran,wont be the next target like Pakistan,Afghanistan,Syria, arab countries,Egypt or else where and we do not have bombers like Iraq ,pakistan or Afghanistan,, This movie is just a terrible version of the previous one which used to be my fav movie as a child...and it is very poor in words and concept... The director and cast must be very sorry to base their movie on a fiction rather than a scientific fiction!!! Reminds me of the title of the movie"body of lias"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wham Bam Thank-you Japan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RoboCop (2014) is an American sci-fi thriller that's essentially a rip-off of the Japanese Space Sheriff Gavan (which itself drew inspiration from live-action Hollywood superhero cinema shows). This one's much shorter, because it cuts out all the background detail, character touches and news media coverage that made Space Sheriff Gavan so much more interesting and resonant. The scenes here blatantly recall scenes inSpace Sheriff Gavan, but the action direction is so much more sluggish. Every bit of business takes much longer than it would have in Space Sheriff Gavan.The actor who plays Alex Murphy, father and good cop - is critically injured in the line of duty plays the part in a bland way, but he can't act and has no real presence. His character is humiliated a lot; even after he becomes RoboCop, he is frequently overpowered and victimized by an unforgiving society. He rallies two or three times, but doesn't really do anything strategically different when he does. This whole concept was handled in a more satisfying way in later Japanese robot-suited hero TV shows (BLUE SWAT) and animated series (BUBBLEGUM CRISIS, among many others).There are some good ideas and interesting powers and gadgets that could have been developed or used more, but they just sit there. There's a formidable wrestler-type villain named Sellars (Michael Keaton), who has the power to disrupt RoboCop's systems and send her flying back and forth. These are the best action parts and have the most special effects (although we see the wires in the flying scenes!). But his character and background are never explored. There is lots of action in the film, but it's never terribly exciting or imaginative; without character development, there's nothing underneath to get us emotionally involved.Directed by Jos Padilha and starring Joel Kinnaman, RoboCop is 120 minutes long and any 15-minute 'Making of RoboCop' short that includes some of the special FX shots, including a miniature set showing cars getting blown up to test the Neutron Magnum gun (an interesting weapon with good FX that should have been used more imaginatively), would probably be more interesting than the film itself. There are shots in the trailer that we don't see in the actual movie, including a shot of Robo glimpsed on a giant outdoor video screen in a shopping area. The film looks like it was shot in the Philippines; the locations look more tropical than South America and the soldiers in the final battle scene look Filipino.One to file along with other craptastic 80/90s reboots along with "Alien VS Predator", Terminator: Castration", and other McG type efforts.</fullReview>
