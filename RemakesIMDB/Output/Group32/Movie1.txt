		<shortDescription>I was the baby - wow, what a star!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I might be considered biased in my view because my twin brother Don and I played the baby in Bundle of Joy. We were only a year old, and lived in the San Fernando Valley area of L.A. when we were picked out of approximately 200 sets of twin boys to be the baby in the movie. Over the years, I have heard my mom and other relatives tell many stories of the filming of this movie, and being VIP guests at the premier movie opening in Hollywood. I have, of course, seen the movie countless times over the years, and still like to watch it and laugh at the cute smiling babies we once were. My mom had to be on the set with us whenever we were filming, by state law. She has told us that Debbie Reynolds was a truely remarkable actress and treated us extremely well. Adolphe Menjou treated us like his own grand kids. Unfortunately, she also said that not everyone in the movie industry was so nice, and our parents decided not to sign a contract with RKO Pictures which would have allowed us to be in more films. Oh well, our short movie career aside, we both have grown up and are very happy in our own careers. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes light-hearted films with happy endings!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Debbie Does It All!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many times have I wondered what Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher were like in their careers (I'm a Star Wars buff). I finally sat down and saw this film. I must say that after watching, I just loved it and wanted more. Since then Debbie Reynolds has become my favorite actress ever. After seeing this I raced to my mother for more info. and she told me of the trouble that followed. I was severely disappointed, because the chemistry in this film was superb. Among the highlights is Debbie's ability to use her magnificent talent to use subtle face gestures to get across the idea of what she is thinking. Eddie was less so, but did an average job. But after hearing the truth, everytime I re-watch this film, I can't help but imagine Eddie with horns on his head or a dunce cap a mile tall. Debbie's charm is the main reason to see this film. She steals the show, the script, the clothes, and anything else she touches. The back-up roles are performed well. This is a remake of the earlier film, "Bachelor Mother." If anyone but Debbie were in the lead, this movie would stink, but it gets a solid 3 stars from me (out of 4).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>musical remake of 'bachelor mother.' Debbie Reynolds shines; Eddie fisher flops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bachelor Mother" was a delightful movie, but one can imagine why a musical, in color, remake would crop up. Debbie Reynolds as Polly Parrish was a good choice, and wound up carrying the movie. Eddie Fisher, as the junior Merlin, was not such a good choice. Many other actors at the time would have been far better. Had someone like Donald O'Connor had the role, it could have been an unmitigated success. Too bad Fisher got the job.Overall, the movie is delightful. The basic plot, of a sales clerk in a large department store who winds up with a baby that's not hers, but that no one believes is not hers, is an excellent set-up for comedy. This one does a good job. "Bachelor Mother" does a better job. And an even better one may pop up in the future.gaynor wild</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bundle of Possibilities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've got to take this movie for what it is. A musical. What was interesting to me was seeing Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher together in the height of their relationship. It's a bit dated, but still has catchy tunes (I especially liked Fisher's "Someday Soon"...but I'm a bachelor so maybe I'm prejudiced). How ironic, though, to see these two who had so many possibilities playing a couple in love when they were in love themselves. Yes, there's chemistry, but they should show this movie to potential drug addicts and drunks to warn them about what Eddie Fisher could have been and what his self-admitted dependencies made him become. There was so much the two of them had and could have had, Eddie and Debbie,and so much they lost because of his weakness of character. Sad.A bittersweet story, not in the plot, but in the shadow of reality cast over it by their true life stories. Still worth seeing and hearing, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely comment on movies, but after seeing the other review for this film I felt compelled to write and tell everyone to ignore the other comment! If you like musicals, you'll love this. If you don't like musicals - well, what are you doing here in the first place? It's campy. It's cute. The songs (especially "How I love my pretty baby") are catchy and the story line is fun to follow. I've seen it dozens of times and highly recommend it! I would say it's my favorite Debbie Reynolds movie next to Singin' in the Rain. Can't wait for the DVD release! Seriously people! Take my advice! This is a must see for all musical lovers, or Debbie Reynolds lovers! Don't hesitate another second! Buy it already!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey you r u crazy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm asking whether the other person is crazy as i loved Bundle of Joy, the character's had great chemistry and great songs. I adore the songs such as 'worry about another day' and 'Someday soon can't come too soon..' It is one of those few simple feel good movies which rarely come around but when they do they capture your heart. As for the comment on about the song 'It's all about Love' which the previous person hated i enjoyed and the joke about don't tell so and so wasn't supposed to be a roll over the floor and cry joke but one that could produce a smile or giggle which for me it did. The person who posted the response must not have good taste in movies to say what they did. I however a huge fan of films and musicals end up watching that film over and over again. For it is one of the greats which could stand next to seven brides for seven brothers. Any true lover of films and musicals must see this and if they ever see it on sell to post it as i live in the UK and only have a taped version. TTFN</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Cute for Comfort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the merry Christmas season, perky department store salesgirl Debbie Reynolds (as Polly Parish) is fired because so many of her customers return their ware. She passes an orphanage and picks up a cute baby. Everyone assumes Ms. Reynolds is the baby's mother. This helps Reynolds get her job back, from singing store owner's son Eddie Fisher (as Dan Merlin), who also gives Reynolds a raise. Soon, the handsome crooner is harmonizing with the cute clerk. This musical re-make of "Bachelor Mother" (1939) is fairly well-suited to the real-life married couple, who simultaneously produced their own "Bundle of Joy" (Carrie Fisher)...A major recording star upon the film's release, Mr. Fisher was so popular he survived the initial onslaught of "rock and roll" - but was about to fall. Fisher last hit the "Top Ten" in 1956. It didn't help that "Bundle of Joy" was lacking in hit single material, with Fisher's "Some Day Soon" barely cracking the record charts in early 1957. Reynolds was a much better actress, and reached her greatest popularity after she and Fisher divorced. Unfortunately, this is it for the popular twosome's musical comedy film career. They look good and sing sweetly together - their "Lullaby in Blue" sung to their "Pretty Baby" was brimming with potential.******** Bundle of Joy (12/12/56) Norman Taurog ~ Eddie Fisher, Debbie Reynolds, Tommy Noonan, Adolphe Menjou</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BACHELOR MOTHER is the better version...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BUNDLE OF JOY I was excited to watch this remake of BACHELOR MOTHER. I loved the story and hoped it would be just as appealing with Debbie Reynolds as the star. Debbie did a great job with what she had, especially in the scenes with the adorable baby, but her real life husband Eddie Fisher lacked the charisma and maturity to capture my attention. I found myself comparing him to David Niven from the original movie and easily one of the most charismatic actors ever in my opinion. Fisher not only paled in comparison, but also came across as a boy and certainly not a man even in his musical numbers. He does have a spectacular singing voice. I'll give him that. I absolutely adore Adolphe Menjou particularly from YOU WERE NEVER LOVELIER, POLLYANNA, &amp; LITTLE MISS MARKER. I thought he did a fine job in the supporting cast. Even if I had seen this version first, then I think I would have felt the same about it as it just came off as rather mediocre entertainment. If you love these actors, then you may disagree, but I found the original screenplay and film to be the real bundle of joy for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favourites with great singalong songs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My sister and I adore this film. We love everything about it - the actors, the costumes, the baby and most of all the music. We have both sung the 'Lullaby in Blue' song to our children, and they now sing it too. Debbie Reynolds acting was a dream and Eddie was great - who couldn't love the baby? Polly Parishes work mates were perfectly cast her admirer was suitably goofy, and her friend had a hard exterior but a warm heart. It is wonderfully kitsch and fun - just what 1950's musicals were all about - a good love story with lots of lovely sets, clothes and humour. We are just very sad that it is not yet available in England, on DVD or video, as we only have one recorded copy. It was nominated for a Golden Globe at the time, so it must have had some high critical acclaim. A must watch film for all romantics and fun loving people!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is and will always be one of the unsung classics of the RKO Studio. A musical remake of "Bachelor Mother", "Bundle of Joy" is a funny, heartwarming tale of mistaken identity and blossoming love.The only downside of this movie is the fact that it has Eddie Fisher in it. He should have stuck to singing as he is the most excruciatingly bad actor I have ever seen.Overall, I give this movie 41/2 out of five stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What would I do without TCM?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on Turner Classic Movies quite accidentally. I was just channel surfing and then I heard that corny announcer (not Robert Osborne) say to stay tuned for "Bundle of Joy" starring Debbie Reynolds. Well, being a Debbie Reynolds fan, I stayed tuned! I became even more interested in seeing this film when I realized that Eddie Fisher also starred. I had never seen a film of his, and I was curious to see the former couple on screen together. Well, I thought this film was very entertaining and funny. Debbie Reynolds was wonderful as usual, and even though I was determined to not like Fisher (because he left not only Debbie Reynolds with two children, but also Connie Stevens!), he was charming as well. His songs were great, and, I hate to admit it, but he was awfully cute too.If you get the chance, try to catch this film on TCM. It is one of the funnier musicals I've ever seen (and I have seen just about all of them!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great example of remakes that never should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is strictly for fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher.I get angry at TCM for showing this mess more frequently than Bachelor Mother, the delightful original. I get angrier still that some Hollywood boob thought it would be a good idea to remake Bachelor Mother, filling it with some lame songs that only serve to interrupt the flow of a cute comedy. Instead, Hollywood could have spent the time, money, energy and talent wasted on this horrible remake to give us something new and original - Wow, what a concept!Bachelor Mother (the original), with Ginger Rogers and David Niven is a spicy stew, simmering with sexuality. It is a 1930's wink at the Hays Office. Bundle of Joy (the remake), with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher is strictly milk and cookies. It is a 1950's handshake with Eisenhower.Which cast would you rather watch - Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adolphe Menjou, or Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, every member of the cast in the original version is far better than his/her counterpart in the remake.In the original a beautiful, young Ginger Rogers is at her peak. David Niven delivers perfectly as a somewhat spoiled, sophisticated and yet befuddled scion of a wealthy department store magnate. And I always love to see Charles Coburn in a movie. In Bachelor Mother, he is priceless as the desperate grandfather wannabe.In Bundle of Joy Debbie Reynolds is her usual perky self. She is fine in this role, although her performance (along with Fisher's) completely changes the tone of the story. As an actor, Eddie Fisher is hopeless. He is completely lacking in screen "presence." Here he is way too wholesome for this story. His acting is completely bland and clueless. Likewise, his singing is so bland and unremarkable that it has been completely forgotten by the world at large. The only time he is not completely painful is in Butterfield 8 - where, incidentally, he doesn't sing. Here, Fisher's lame performance alone is enough to ruin this movie. Adolphe Menjou, a favorite character actor, delivers a competent performance, but not one of his best. He is more blustering than commanding. He and Fisher are not convincing as a father and son.Do you see a musical for the music, the story being merely incidental? Or do watch a musical for a story, with some (hopefullly) good music used for seasoning? If the former, you might like this lame remake. Otherwise you are much better off watching the Ginger Rogers non-musical original, Bachelor Mother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant enough Christmas-themed confection...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glossy and tuneful, if terribly contrived, remake of a just-adequate Ginger Rogers comedy vehicle from 1939 ("Bachelor Mother", itself a reworking of "Little Mother" from 1935). Salesgirl, fired at Christmastime from her department store job for 'over-selling', finds an abandoned baby on the steps outside a foundlings home but can't get anyone to believe the child isn't really hers. The spotlight this time is equally on Debbie Reynolds (doing sprightly, decent work as the bachelor mother) and her then-husband Eddie Fisher (leering at the camera while playing a singing junior-executive). Supporting roles are colorfully filled, production and song numbers are decent, though the script lands us smack in the middle of 101 'risque' misunderstandings (she has a baby but not a husband?! And who's the father?). Worth-seeing for Debbie, who sings and dances--and rolls her eyes with expert exaggeration when it's time to change a diaper. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor Debbie should've realized Eddie was a jerk and their marriage was doomed, when his ego demanded top billing ahead of her... in his very first movie. (And it's no surprise that Eddie's only other movie appearances were in Liz Taylor films, once they got together.) If this non-actor couldn't concede his then-wife was a bigger movie star and deserved to be billed before him, clearly the guy didn't respect or love her as much as he loved himself.The only reason to see "Bundle Of Joy", is as a Debbie Reynolds fan and completist. She's pretty much always fun to watch. But, even though I like Debbie more than Ginger Rogers (who stars in the original movie), "Bachelor Mother" is vastly superior to this remake. The original is laugh-out-loud funny. David Niven is, needless to say, a much better actor and infinitely more charming than Eddie Fisher. I notice they cut some of Niven's best scenes, I assume because Fisher couldn't deliver the witty dialogue.Even as a fan of musicals, there's not much point watching this. The songs are pretty forgettable. I don't mind musical remakes when you get quality numbers, such as in High Society, the musical version of The Philadelphia Story. Not the case here. I don't see anything very special about Eddie's singing. And that insufferable smirk on his face! His expression never changes.I guess there are other reasons to watch this movie. Morbid curiosity to witness the lack of chemistry between Debbie and Eddie, and his total non-charisma. Or a need to watch a baby-centric storyline played by two people who were about to become parents (of Carrie) in real life. Behind-the-scenes film-buff stuff may provide some small entertainment. But certainly no joy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Debbie Goes With The Flow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bundle Of Joy was a musical remake of one of RKO Studio's brightest comedy hits from it's hey day, Bachelor Mother. Taking the roles that Ginger Rogers and David Niven had back in 1939 are the Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston of 1956, Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. Reynolds was an established musical star who was loaned out from MGM to RKO in the studio's waning days for this film. Someone decided that putting Reynolds together with her husband, pop singing star Eddie Fisher was a natural. If musicals were still in vogue, this could have for Eddie Fisher been something like Higher and Higher was for Frank Sinatra which incidentally was also an RKO film. Bundle of Joy alas was not given any songs as good as what Sinatra had in Higher and Higher.Frank's role there did not call for any great acting and neither does Fisher's here. Eddie's a likable enough fellow, the son of the head of a department store who has the idea that Reynolds is an unwed mother.How he got that idea? Like in Bachelor Mother where Ginger Rogers did the same thing, Reynolds is on her lunch break and sees an abandoned baby on the steps of a foundling home. Taking such pity on it, she takes it with her. Probably this being Christmas time definitely helped in the sentiment department.Before long everyone just assumes it's her kid, no matter what she says and does so she has to go with the flow. RKO did give Eddie and Debbie a nice supporting cast that includes Adolphe Menjou as his father and Una Merkel as her landlady. Tommy Noonan almost steals the film as Debbie's officious co-worker. Bundle Of Joy is a good enough film to spend some time during the holiday season watching. Which I did and am not sorrier for the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet Little Comedy About the Power of Babies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a remake of the Ginger Rogers' comedy BACHELOR MOTHER and follows the same plot with the addition of music and dance numbers. Ironically Rogers could have handled those quite well, but after she stopped making films with Fred Astaire she wanted to do films emphasizing acting, not her musical abilities. It is therefore odd that this remake starred Debbie Reynolds and her then husband Eddie Fisher, both of whom could sing (and Reynolds - like Rogers - could dance as well). Reynolds works in a department store owned by Adolphe Menjou and his son Eddie Fisher. Fisher is quite a playboy, although he does try to concentrate on his family business. Menjou is a rather stiff, tyrannical employer (although he does not see himself that way). Reynolds was hired for the Christmas season and thinks she's been doing really well selling more than anyone else in the women's wear department. But she is fired when it is pointed out to her that most of her sales were returned the following day - which increases the store's expenditures. After being fired, the Manager of her floor wishes her a "Merry Christmas".She goes out job hunting, but finds a baby on the doorstep of a orphanage, and does a decent thing of bringing the abandoned child into the building. But the head of the orphanage (Howard McNair) jumps to the wrong conclusion that Reynolds is the mother abandoning the child because she just lost her job. He goes back to the store and gets Fisher to reconsider the issue (in light of this erroneous piece of information). Fisher rehires and gives Reynolds a raise too. Later that night Reynolds realizes why this happened when McNair deposits the baby with her (despite her protests). She confronts Fisher, and tries to force him to take the baby. He chases her to a dance contest she and date/co-worker Tommy Noonan are attending. Fisher and his butler (Melville Cooper) get thrown out for causing a scene, but Fisher returns with the baby to Fisher's home, and gives her an ultimatum: either act like the mother he supposes her to be or lose her job permanently! Rogers knuckles under. She begins to fall asleep at work, now having to take care of the little one (with assistance from landlady Una Merkle). But Fisher maintains an interest in the baby's welfare. He also slowly finds himself falling for Reynolds (much to the dismay of Noonan, although he thinks he got a promotion due to Reynolds' influence). Fisher even takes her to a New Years Eve party where he introduces her as a Swedish débutante who does not speak much English. They carry off this quite well (Debbie even uses words like "Sven" and "Smorgas" as typical Swedish words). The inevitable is the discovery of Fisher's interest in Reynold's and the the baby comes to Menjou's attention, and he takes a deep interest in this. Besides the idea that his son might settle down a bit, he likes the idea that he's a grandfather. This is a further complication.The characters are well played, with Reynolds honorable but not heeded by anyone from Fisher and Menjou and McNair on down. Fisher does act fairly well, and carries his songs nicely. He might have had a better career in films with a little practice. Menjou is at his self-righteous, garrulous best, but showing a lovely weakness to be a grandpa. Merkle is a good friend in need, and one who does not break down easily from pressure. Noonan is a would-be Lothario who has feet of clay when he thinks his reputation and job may go smash. Even Cooper has some great pieces of business. He's given a still lit cigar by a furious Menjou, who won't take it back yet, so that Cooper can't put it down or out (he walks about the mansion holding this cigar not knowing what to do with it).The film is a very good comedy, but it has never been given much notice. My guess is that in Reynolds' career it got sandwiched in between two more impressive films: THE CATERED AFFAIR with Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine, and TAMMY AND THE DOCTOR (giving Reynolds one of her best remembered film roles). As Fisher concentrated on his singing career (his next big film was BUTTERFIELD 8 with second wife Elizabeth Taylor) it did not count for much for him either. Menjou's career was slowing down, although he had a few more years before POLLYANA. So BUNDLE OF JOY was simply a successful example of the Hollywood film machine, ground out rapidly but equally forgotten rapidly too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An imitation of greatness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the classics of the 1930's and 40's were being remade in the 1940's to get films back into the theater and away from Uncle Miltie, Ralph Kramden, Lucy Ricardo and Ed Sullivan. Utilizing color photography and the various wide-screen processes, these films may have seemed like a good idea at the time, and in a few cases, it worked. However, many failed, especially if they were attempts to outshine the classic screwball comedy.One of the most blatant examples of that was "Bundle of Joy", an update of "Bachelor Mother". Practically everything is the same with the exception of added songs, included to promote recording star Eddie Fisher as an actor, and failing miserably. To push the publicity window, his real-life then wife (Debbie Reynolds) was cast as the fired department store clerk who finds an abandoned baby. While Reynolds is a great replacement for Ginger Rogers, Fisher is no David Niven, and that is the factor which turns this attempt to remake champagne into beer.A colorful environment is welcome here, but the script only points out the sitcom elements of the story that back in 1939 seemed fresh and new. The film isn't bad as a whole, but in reflection of what had been, it is definitely a missed opportunity. Adolph Menjou is great fun in the Charles Coburn part, while Nita Talbot seems ripe for Eve Arden roles as Reynold's pal. Fisher sings wonderfully, turning "All About Love" into his one highlight, but failing miserably as an actor, showing no chemistry with his wife on-screen (sort of like Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, ironically, in most of their post "Virginia Woolf" pairings) and lacking in the comic timing of David Niven.</fullReview>

Thanks to Reynolds and the twisty nature of this farcical plot, it's a partial enjoyment, as is. When Debbie's real life hubby Eddie Fisher is singing, viewers occasionally can stop cringing. Another plus is that Eddie is not in as many scenes as Debbie. I've heard somewhere that Elizabeth Taylor took Eddie away from Debbie shortly after BUNDLE OF JOY was shot, guaranteeing that there would be no more Reynolds-Fisher collaborations. Certainly, this is one of Taylor's greatest contributions to cinema history. Her own defection to Richard Burton after BUTTERFIELD 8 might rank second, since Eddie's own top movie accomplishment was siring actress daughter Carrie. Where would we be without Princess Leia?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was 7 or 8 years old in Los Angeles. It was the first movie I ever saw. I am extremely sentimental about it. I love the songs- expertly written by composer Josef Myrow. I thought Eddie Fisher had a beautiful voice, and the chemistry with Debbie Reynolds was wonderful. I especially loved the fantasy scene in the department store at night. I didn't mind that he wasn't an actor. He pulled it off in my opinion. It's very sad in real life the choices he made, but there were a few glorious years where his singing was at it's best and it was very moving to listen to. The sound quality of his voice was so warm and beautiful and he had excellent phrasing. Someone put several performances of his on UTube and I think people will learn to appreciate him once again. Especially in the slow songs. The movie was a fantasy, and for 98 minutes, it brought me into another world. For those 98 minutes, I could forget everything that went wrong after that. Wish they made movies like that today.Barb</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it wasn't for the professional ease DEBBIE REYNOLDS displays in almost any role she plays, BUNDLE OF JOY would rank among the most forgettable romantic comedies of all time.And this is true, even though she's surrounded by pros like TOMMY NOONAN (as an ambitious but overly flirtatious floor-walker) and ADOLPHE MENJOU (as a man who wishes he was the grandpa of the cute baby boy). And in the middle of this mess, is a weak performance by EDDIE FISHER, clearly in need of comic timing and finesse, especially since the lines he's given to speak are slightly short of ridiculous. His department store musical number at the film's start is an embarrassment to watch, clumsily staged and performed.Director Norman Taurog is to blame for not being able to put any life into this retread of a GINGER ROGERS/David NIVEN/CHARLES COBURN film called BACHELOR MOTHER. The story is not the only handicap. The songs are third rate, even though Fisher and Reynolds deliver them in an appropriate style. Only one of them is a remotely catchy tune called "How I Love My Pretty Baby".Obviously this is the kind of story of mistaken identifies that someone like Norman Krasna could write in his sleep (too bad he wasn't summoned to help with the script), but it's played in such uninspired fashion by Fisher and most of the cast (including the usually reliable Adolphe Menjou, Melville Cooper and Bill Goodwin), that it falls flat in injecting any real wit or humor into the contrived situations.Summing up: Debbie deserved better than this. Both she and Fisher appear to be completely clueless as to what a dud this really is.</fullReview>

I think I could drunkenly offer a few lines on a sheet of paper that would far exceed it and probably win a Grammy. Then, as if the writers could come up with no better way to escape the ridiculousness of the scene, Fischer says something to the effect of, "Don't tell (insert the guy's name). He doesn't like music" and smiles. I can't describe how bad this is, I felt a little embarrassed. And that guy Debbie Reynolds works with and who's always hitting on her is so annoying too. I can't even imagine someone like her wasting a fraction of time on him. The jokes were delivered without any sort of chemistry between characters which made the movie crawl by. At least the baby had cute hair. The two stars are for Reynolds, who was like a swan among ugly ducklings.See Bachelor Mother instead.</fullReview>
