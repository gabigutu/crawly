		<shortDescription>Outstanding Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason that completely baffles me, TCM rarely broadcasts this wonderful, romantic comedy of errors, but frequently shows the lame musical remake, Bundle of Joy. Which cast would you rather watch - Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adolphe Menjou, or Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, every member of the cast in this original version is far better than his/her counterpart in the remake. The original cast delivers a film with risqué overtones (with a wink to the Hays Office), while Reynolds and (especially) Fisher turn the remake into 1950's milk and cookies.In Bachelor Mother a beautiful, young Ginger Rogers is at her peak. She portrays a wonderfully sympathetic character. She is strong and feminine; exasperated yet determined. David Niven delivers perfectly as a somewhat spoiled, sophisticated and yet befuddled scion of a wealthy department store magnate. And I always love to see Charles Coburn - in top form here as the blustery, but good-hearted department store magnate who desperately wants a grandson.I like Debbie Reynolds fine, but Debbie doesn't deliver as nuanced a performance as Ginger Rogers. Eddie Fisher as an actor - No Way! The only time he is not completely painful to watch is in Butterfield 8 - where, incidentally, he doesn't sing. Adolphe Menjou is okay.I get angry at TCM for showing the remake more frequently than this delightful original. I get angrier still that some Hollywood boob thought it would be a good idea to remake Bachelor Mother, filling it with some lame songs that only serve to interrupt the flow of the story.For a terrific romantic comedy, accept no substitutes: check out Bachelor Mother. And tell TCM which film you prefer. Maybe it will start showing this film more often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a romantic comedy in the fullest sense of both terms. it is both hilariously funny and touchingly romantic (in the old-fashion boy sweeps girl off her feet even though she can give as good as she gets kind of way).I totally loved the New Year Party scene, and the complications with the other boyfriend were great fun. And Donald Duck has a small but key role to play in this story.Obviously some of the social attitudes are a bit hackneyed today, but the character personalities certainly shine through brilliantly still.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn achieve intense comic chemistry under the direction of Garson Kanin. Hardly a dull moment in this stylish and breezy 1940's "department store" romance. The film is constantly funny, often hilarious and always engaging. Rogers and Niven are so stellar they transcend their era, their characters are as contemporary as they are classic. Overall, a brilliant effort by all concerned!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The angst of Donald Duck?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many of us can sympathize with this? Your job is hanging precariously, your social life is not what it could be, and customer service won't let you return a malfunctioning Donald Duck toy without a receipt in triplicate.This is the irresistible comic situation for the forgotten classic "Bachelor Mother". A young, urbane department store worker happens to run across a baby left on a social office's doorstep. Under the circumstances she is confused as the mother of the baby. She flatly denies this but no one will believe her including her boss, a wealthy, prim David Niven. Following a comedy of errors reminiscent of a Shakespeare play these two are thrown together and Niven is then assumed to be the baby's father by his own father, the inimitable Charles Coburn. The movies dances dizzyingly from one comic scenario to another, including a scene where Niven misdirects Rodgers to rub baby food into the baby's navel, and the cathartic comic moment where Niven, the store manager disguised a customer, demands to have his Donald Duck toy returned, to no avail.Niven: "What is wrong with our Sales Return desk?"Rodgers: "They don't return anything!"Filled with scintillating wit, bubbling chemistry and a feel-good plot it is the perfect comedy to enjoy over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently caught this movie on TV one Saturday morning, and was it ever a delight! The story is based on a series of comedic errors, but unlike more recent films, the top-notch acting leads you to believe that yes, it could really happen that way! (I'm used to films veering way too far into the slapstick so that I'm just rolling my eyes and suspending my belief -- here I was just chuckling away.)Ginger Rodgers and David Niven give fabulous performances, and the head of the Foundling Home plays his part without flaw. I finished the film with a warm, happy glow that I carried into the day. I will enjoy revisiting it in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a comedy of errors that escalates to the point of ridiculousness, and I love it. I have never seen David Niven play a comedy role as well as this. The way he plays it is very reminiscent of Cary Grant... His body movements, his tone of voice, and that makes me wonder if the part of Merlin was written with Cary Grant in mind. But Niven does not disappoint... And it is a refreshing change from his Wuthering Heights type serious, pole stuck up his rear acting in other films. Niven' crack about the baby being able to recite the first line of Gunga Din may be a direct jab (or reference) to Cary Grant.Ginger is not dancing, well, we get to see her dance for a couple of minutes in this... But this film shows us that she is an actress of superb quality, she can play dramatic as well as comedic roles.Of course the cast included Charles Coburn who was just about everywhere you looked in the 30's.Little chunks of one-liner humour spread throughout the picture spice it up. I wonder if Disney had to grant special permission so that Niven could break the head off of a Donald Duck toy? Also, there is a part in the flick where Donald Duck (or at least a Donald Duck Toy) plays a very important role. I wonder if it was because RKO also distributed Disney or something like that?If you have time to burn and they are showing this on TCM it is worthwhile to watch, once, twice maybe even three times. And why not, anyone should watch a few movies directed by Garson Kanin, who also directed "My Favourite Wife" with Grant and Dunne in 1940.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the incurable romantic ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ginger Rogers plays a young woman named Polly who "inherits" a baby. No one, including her boss, believes how she acquired the baby. Ginger Rogers (Polly) is adorable when paired with the ever humorous David Niven as her boss (David). There's wonderful chemistry between Ginger Rogers and David Niven in this movie. While the original movie was in black and white and written in 1939, it's still a cute, witty movie for today's viewing. Polly's a modern woman who doesn't back down to her boss or to any man in general. I especially enjoyed the New Year's Eve scene, where David realizes the shallow company he's been keeping before he met Polly."Bachelor Mother" is a wonderful family movie, with the incurable romantic in mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ginger Rogers is young, single, and unemployed when, as the result of doing a good deed, she gets stuck with a baby in "Bachelor Mother," a 1939 film also starring David Niven and Charles Coburn.Rogers plays Polly Parrish, who on her way home from her last day at the department store she worked for over Christmas, sees an old woman leaving a baby on the steps of an orphanage. Fearful the child will fall down the steps, she is kneeling over him when someone from the orphanage opens the door and mistakes Rogers for the baby's mother. Polly gives the place her name and place of employment before she realizes they think she's the mother. When she runs away and leaves the baby, the orphanage gets busy contacting her employer. She gets the baby and her job back, plus a raise. No one will listen to her, so she gives in and makes up a story. Complications arise with a date who wants to move up in the store to floorwalker and believes the son of the owner (David Niven) is the baby's father. Eventually the store's irascible owner (Coburn) thinks Polly has given birth to his grandchild and insists that his son marry her.This is a charming little film with wonderful performances. Niven in that stuffed shirt way of his is very elegant and likable, Coburn is great as his demanding father who breaks down and cries as he holds the baby. "I'd know that chin anywhere," he sobs. Rogers is fantastic. She looks gorgeous and even has a chance to dance without Fred around.Highly recommended. Wonderful entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful little gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely write reviews but this was such a delightful gem of a romantic comedy that I had to support it.I cannot even explain why it was so great. It's a simple little movie, low-key, 100% predictable, with an absurd premise, and moves kind of slow, with no extravagant sets. The script is linear and the dialog is adequate but hardly a work of genius.Yet I enjoyed this more than any other film I've seen in a very long time. It was totally fun and, although there are much funnier comedies, ( Bringing Up Baby (1938), The In-Laws (1979), Simon (1980), Young Frankenstein (1974) come to mind), this one had me laughing out loud over and over, which I never do, because the comedy was so light hearted and due to the acting rather than the concept.The film has, as you know, a terrific cast. Ginger Rogers has everything. She is beautiful, she is intelligent, she can sing (no singing though in this film), dance (some nice dancing), be depressed or do comedy. I actually like the chemistry with David Niven better than with Fred Astaire, they make a terrific couple. Niven is funny as hell, and all the supporting cast chimes right in with perfect comic timing. As soon as Charles Coburn showed up on screen I was smiling. The film is full of tiny bits of physical comedy and small gags by actors with only a few seconds of screen time, who all perform like seasoned pros turning simple bits into remarkable, funny-bone tickling scenes.The comic acting is not stunning, as in the films I mentioned above; it is stylized, theatrical, a bit stiff. It's the style of the film which is not at all realistic, and somehow it works great. Rogers and Niven go through their comic facial expressions slowly and exaggeratedly, so everyone gets it, as if they were telling a story instead of acting it, and it adds to the effect of light heartedness.The portrayal of the romance, from the initial attraction, through the growing awareness of feelings, is nicely observant and free of cliché. Both the script and the performance capture some of the real moments that happen as two people are drawn together.The ending is, of course, a completely unbelievable high speed wind-up, fitting the conventions of the time, but I was wishing to follow the relationship along a more extended and realistic track. It would no longer have been a screwball comedy. And there is some absurd stop-motion animation of a mechanical duck where they don't even bother to move the feet properly. This is so blatantly faked that perhaps it is a signal from the director that he has been forced into a trite ending he disowns; or maybe just that the ending is forced by convention and not be taken seriously. It is as if it is Donald Duck who has dictated the final corny scene. It didn't bother me, though, because it is clear that the film would have had to end eventually like that even if it were worked out more believably.Also someone complained that the landlady should have known the truth about Rogers' character, not recalling that Rogers' had only been her tenant three weeks- short enough to make the plot work out. And I think it is just fine to call a baby it- plus it shows the awkward relationship the single, childless characters have with the baby that suddenly shows up in their life.If I had to say what it was that was so great about this film, other than seeing Ginger Rogers and David Niven, those two remarkable warm and generous personalities, playing off each other, it would be that the film seems to be filled with love and kindness. Released the year after Kristallnacht shocked the world, it features a saintly very Jewish landlady who comes to the rescue a number of times. There is a six month old baby, who does great work, and Rogers has some lovely scenes with the baby where she seems, briefly, to be genuine. Everyone wrongly thinks Rogers' character is an unwed mother, and there is not the slightest tinge of stigma associated with it throughout the film by any of the many characters that deal with her with kindness, love, acceptance and total respect (if not understanding), and there is also sympathy for the working class pain during the depression. The film totally avoids p retention, it wants to make us laugh and feel good, not to impress us, and it does.So I give this an 8, but really in terms of the heart it is priceless gem of a film, without a single wrong note, for anyone who loves screwball comedy and the great actors of yesteryear whose like, I am afraid, the business is not likely to produce again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen most of GR's movies (both solo &amp; with Fred Astaire), I must admit that I much prefer her "solo" (as opposed to merely a "dancing partner") &amp; "Bachelor Mother" is, without a doubt, her funniest film!There are many great comedic "bits" in this film -- her pretending not to speak English at a New Year's Eve party, the dancehall sequence, David Niven's run-in with a toy "Donald Duck" (and many more), that make this film an absolute JOY!The only other GR film that comes close to it is "Vivacious Lady". Both of these are "Must See"! -- And, try not to laff so hard!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best Ginger Rogers' movies....She proves to be a complete actress indeed, not only just a dancer (even if she was so talented!). The story and the script are witty and they work, not a bit of boredom, counting on the fact that certain things weren't quite disputable then. A "solo" mother was rather to blame....the movie brings in to question a tab? and it's done with class. It keeps a particular far-sighted way of seeing things they had in the late 30s....on my opinion of course. But they lost it after the war. Anyway about Rogers...well, she's great! Niven is one of my favourite actors and together they make a very fine couple....unusual but fine. Must see it! I highly recommend it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I don't care who the father is- I'm the grandfather!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ginger Rogers gets one of her best roles in this absolutely charming, goofy and heartwarming comedy. She's the plucky shopgirl who has just been fired, and has just been landed with a baby in a severe case of misunderstanding! David Niven is the rich shop-owner's son who both foists a child on Ginger that's not hers, and then falls in love with her and it, the adorable little "Johnny". And the always-great Charles Coburn is just marvellous as the "grandfather" who thinks that Niven and Rogers have produced his longed-for grandson.This is pretty much a perfect romantic comedy, with Rogers giving a terrific performance. Niven gets one of his more unusual roles, it;s sort of a role you imagine Cary Grant in, but he's delightful in it and has unexpectedly great chemistry with Ginger. Garson Kanin directs and Norman Krasna provides a sparkling comic script, that has you both laughing and getting a tear in the eye as a loving, makeshift family is created around a cute tot. When a film contains a major plot gag involving Donald Duck, has Ginger pretending to be Swedish and David Niven trying to rub oatmeal into a baby's stomach, you really can't go wrong!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ginger Goes With The Flow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bachelor Mother finds Ginger Rogers as a shopgirl working for the large department store that Charles Coburn owns. When she's let go at Christmas time she's going to have to worry where the next meal for her is coming. No position to be taking on dependents.Which is why when she finds a baby left on her doorstep she takes it to a foundling home where everyone assumes it's her's. When she tells her story about being let go, they're moved to do something about it. She gets her job back with a raise, but Ginger's a most unwilling mother.Of course the speculation gets going as to who the dad is and the playboy son of Charles Coburn seems a real likely possibility. Especially when you've got David Niven as the playboy. Garson Kanin directed the Felix Jackson original story in the film that became Bachelor Mother. The original screenplay was nominated for an Oscar in that category, but lost to Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.I saw the musical remake that RKO did 17 years later with Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds and it was clear just how superior this film is to that one. Eddie was playing David Niven's part and while the man could sing, he hadn't a tenth of Niven's charm. To be perfectly fair though, there were few men as charming as David Niven, he carried more films on the strength of that charm than anyone else I can think of.Ginger Rogers was doing a great variety of dramatic roles now at RKO in between her films with Fred Astaire. She was really kicking her career into high gear at this point and would win an Oscar next year for Kitty Foyle. Hard as she struggles in this film to convince everyone she's not the mother it gets easier to just go with the flow. When you see where the film is flowing you'll agree.Bachelor Mother is a bright and witty comedy, not quite of the screwball variety, but still holding up quite well after more than 70 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BACHELOR MOTHER (Garson Kanin, 1939) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from its originality (the somewhat risqué story, involving the various misunderstandings which arise over an abandoned baby, was even nominated for an Oscar) and reputation as a comedy classic (from an era crammed with them), this film is notable as a touchstone in the careers of all three protagonists ? Ginger Rogers (her musical partnership with Fred Astaire now firmly behind her), David Niven (tackling his first starring role) and Charles Coburn (who practically spent the rest of his life playing wealthy and big-hearted eccentrics) ? as well as marking perhaps director Kanin's most satisfying effort in this capacity (he is still best-known as a scriptwriter); incidentally, Rogers and Kanin would soon be re-united for the almost-as-good TOM, DICK AND HARRY (1941; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034299/usercomments-11). Given the Christmas back-drop, BACHELOR MOTHER makes for ideal festive fare ? adding to the already warm glow (but thankfully eschewing sentimentality) of its subject matter. The two leads exude a wonderful chemistry (they would be reteamed two more times over the course of almost 20 years) which lends conviction to their budding romance and, likewise, a greater sense of involvement to their wacky antics (particularly Niven's attempt to exchange a defective toy in his own establishment incognito, during a marathon dance contest and a New Year's Eve dinner in which department-store clerk Rogers is passed off before Niven's high-society peers as a Swedish heiress). When Coburn, playing Niven's tycoon dad, gets wind of his son's supposed parenthood (via an anonymous note, actually from vindictive employee and romantic rival Frank Albertson), he is overjoyed at the prospect of finally having a grandson ? even after both Rogers and Niven produce alternative fathers (including Albertson himself)!; the ending, then, with the leads getting hitched with a ready-made child in tow (a common occurrence today but not back then I suppose), is pure Hollywood. For the record, the film was remade ? in color and widescreen ? as BUNDLE OF JOY in 1956...which, given the casting of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher (then a real-life couple), not to mention the addition of musical numbers, provided a distinctly unappetizing 'alternative' scenario for this viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ginger Rogers almost made the mistake of her career, when she flatly refused to appear in "Bachelor Mother". Pandro S. Berman forced her to do it and when released she was at last recognised as one of Hollywood's top comediennes. I love this film!!!!!Polly Parrish (Ginger Rogers) has just been given a pink slip from Merlin's Department Store. After being forced to listen to quacking toy Donald Ducks all day the last thing she needs is a baby!!!! While on lunch she finds a woman abandoning a baby at a foundling home. When Polly is caught holding the baby she can convince no-one that the baby isn't hers. The foundling officers contact her boss David Merlin (David Niven) and she is given her job back plus a bonus. She still can't convince anybody that the baby isn't hers.One of the funniest sequences is when she and Freddie (Frank Albertson) enter a dance competition and David comes to the night club with the baby in tow. Another funny sequence is when Niven tries to return a faulty Donald Duck (ha!ha!) incognito and finds the staff less than helpful. Then there is the part where he takes Polly out to party with his rich friends and she impersonates a Swedish girl who can't speak English.When "a friend" sends a note to David's father (Charles Coburn) implying that David is the father then the shoe is on the other foot.Charles Coburn is wonderful as the grandfather (he thinks!!!) "I don't care who the father is - I'm the Grandfather!!!" It is a very funny film and at the end a few men stand up to claim paternity.Ginger was never better than in these type of working girl roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore all the plot holes and just sit back and enjoy the fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, at the outset I've gotta admit that if you are the type person that CAN'T suspend disbelief and just keep your brain from thinking too much, you WON'T enjoy this film. But, if you can and are willing to see this film with an open mind, then you'll find it to be a delightful and funny little romance. Some of this is due to the clever dialog, some due to the fine direction and some of this is no doubt due to the excellent acting of the three leads in the film. And when it comes to the leads, you KNOW a film with Charles Coburn must be watching, as he plays his usual gruff but lovable old rich guy--and perhaps he's just a little more likable and cuddly in this film than usual.The plot is silly and easily could be explained away, but bear with it. Single lady Ginger Rogers is walking down the street when she sees an older lady placing a baby on the steps of a society for foundlings. However, the baby is precariously balanced and the lady just leaves the kid--and the kid might fall down the steps. So, nice lady Ginger picks up the tyke when the door opens and they assume the baby is hers. A quick visit with a doctor COULD have cleared this up but no one thought of that. Instead, after she leaves the baby (despite their protests), they decide to help this poor unfortunate lady by going to her boss and begging him to not only give her a job (she'd just been laid off) but to assist her take care of the little fella. This is how she meets young and handsome David Niven and again and again throughout the film, Niven and others insist the baby is Ginger's. Later, when Niven's father (Charles Coburn) finds out about this "bachelor mother", he is surprisingly delighted and thinks it's his son's! The film has a lot of laughs and is clever, but most of all, it's just a lot of fun as well as romantic. It's a sweet little film well worth your time and one of the better movies Rogers or Niven ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modest Comedy Succeeds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You might expect something different from a synopsis. A baby is left on shop girl Ginger Rogers' doorstep. Everyone assumes she is the mother, including her wealthy boss, David Niven. Rogers and Niven are at odds with each other but shortly the inevitable happens. In addition to everyone's mistaken assumption that Rogers has had a (gulp) illegitimate child, there are various schemes to align her status as mother with her actual pristine character.I had plenty of handkerchiefs handy for when the plot slowed down for the drama and sentiment -- the cute little baby doing cute things, Rogers sobbing over her undeserved shame, everyone hugging the tot and weeping with love. Actually, I don't own any handkerchiefs, so I had paper towels at the ready. I didn't need them anyway. It's pretty funny.There are amusing incidents (a disguised Niven trying to exchange a faulty toy duck at the store he owns)and comic plot twists that end up with several men claiming to be the father.But it's a quiet comedy -- the screenplay is by Norman Krasna and the direction by Garsin Kanin -- no pratfalls and very little shrieking. It's done in a lower key than, say, the Doris Day/ Rock Hudson comedies but it travels on the same track. Instead of an obvious wise crack, we get someone muttering an ironic, "Ha ha." Ginger Rogers is really an attractive woman. She has oversized blue eyes and she can get an emotion across with a muted moue or a flick of her gaze. Niven is good, better at comic roles than dramatic. The supporting cast is at par, with Ferike Boros great as a stereotypical cheerful and loving grandmother, nurse, or housekeeper.If you get into it, you'll probably enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bachelor Mother- The Farce That Makes You Laugh ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I vividly remember the remake of this funny film with Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds entitled "Bundle of Joy."As was the case with the remake, the original "Bachelor Mother" is in fine form due to a great cast of characters.David Niven and Ginger Rogers were never better as two people-the son of a department store owner and a worker who are drawn to love by accident.Witnessing a baby being left at a home begins an odyssey of hilarity when no one will believe Rogers that she is not the mother of the baby. She takes the baby in and when the investigator (Ernest Truex) talks to the son of the boss (Niven), he gives her her job back.Frank Albertson is effective as the disgruntled employee who really sets things in motion by sending the boss (a wonderful Charles Coburn) a note stating that Niven (Coburn's son) fathered the child.This film is well paced and an absolute joy to watch.It just shows how two people from wealth and poverty can join forces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming Film w/Ginger Rogers and David Niven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I checked the spoiler box, just in case I reveal something, but I just wanted to say that I adore this movie. Like someone else said, this is a perfect romantic comedy. The actors are great and the story is great. When I first saw it a few months ago, I was wondering how this story would play out being that it was filmed in the 30s, but it worked out wonderfully.All of the actors had great comedic timing and the chemistry was perfect. Nobody hammed it up or tried to overtake the other actors. Even the baby gave us a show! The story is simple and fairly predictable by 2007 standards, but for me, that didn't make it any less enjoyable. I would pick this one over many of the RomComs of today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Sweet, loving and funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no idea Ginger Rogers was so pretty as a young girl. A very sweet actress, too. David Niven, did his face ever change over the years? I think not! Very nicely acted movie, especially the "Grandfather". He wanted the best for that baby. Even though I am a younger woman, I love old movies, and this is one of the best! The actors and actresses of the 30s through 50s are GREAT! The bouncers at the dance contest were great. The New Years Eve party was very good. The rich girlfriend was perfectly mean. I love the Deco NY feel. The rich old cars, the snooty ladies, etc. The hairstyles, the clothes and the furniture make me wish I lived then, but only if I had money!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Department store clerk Polly (Ginger Rogers) is mistakenly believed to be the mother of an abandoned baby. She has to go along with it to keep her job. David Merlin (David Niven), the son of department store owner J.B. Merlin (Charles Coburn) takes a special interest in Polly's situation. Gradually the two fall in love but things are further complicated when J.B. is led to believe David is the father of Polly's baby.Delightful romantic comedy with wonderful performances from Ginger Rogers, David Niven, and Charles Coburn. Special mention for Frank Albertson in one of his better roles outside of playing Sam "Hee Haw" Wainwright in It's a Wonderful Life. Donald Duck also figures into things in an amusing way. I actually heard the radio version of this before I saw the movie. I heard it on satellite radio several years ago. It featured Ginger and David reprising their film roles. This is a fun, nicely-paced movie with an immensely likable cast that seems to be having a great time. Ginger fans certainly won't want to miss it as it's one of her best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot Improbable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the improbable plots in all the movies in all the world, this is the most improbablest. But the clever dialogue, and the seamless performances of Miss Rogers and Mr. Niven make for an entertaining cotton candy of a movie; sweet, and no nutritional value. But it never gets too treacly. Enjoy. It seems to post this review, I need to be more discursive, IMDb not allowing terse, incisive observations. So I will add a comment that this appears to be the earliest instance of merchandising in a movie. I will not name the item, or the corporation that makes it. In fact, it serves as an unfortunate and annoying distraction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If The Slipper Fits ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is yet another Depression Era take on Cinderella - not for nothing is is the David Niven character named Merlin - designed to take people's minds off both the recent austerity and the global war waiting in the wings. What comes across strongly is the sheer professionalism from all Departments, Script, Directing, Acting, that almost succeeds in preventing awkward questions - the film begins on what Americans insist on referring to as 'the day before Christmas', known to the rest of the world as Christmas Eve, with Ginger Rogers being made redundant from her temporary salesperson position at Merlin's Department Store; due to plot machinations the son of the owner of the store (David Niven) is moved to reinstate her and the continuity implies that she goes back to work the next day (Christmas) - etc. The character played by the reliable and prolific Frank Albertson (so memorable in It's A Wonderful Life) fluctuates between up and down like a dysfunctional yo-yo but it's a safe bet that no one in 1939 noticed any of this and were content to bask in the high Enjoyment factor. Even today it holds up pretty well if only perhaps for one first-time viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the "It" story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I (at age 16) first saw "Bachelor Mother" at Radio City Music Hall in its 1939 original release in New York, I had only heard of Clara Bow as the "It" girl, but had not seen "It" (the title of her very popular 1927 silent movie). But I did (at age 36) see "Bundle of Joy", the musical version remake of "Bachelor Mother". But when I finally did (at age 79) see "It" on Turner Classic Movies, I recognized it immediately as the identical story. Department store girl falls for the boss (store owner's son) who ignores her. She finds someone's baby but everyone believes it's hers. Including boss and his parents. They all fall in love with the baby, and then they all finally end up falling for Clara/Ginger/Debbie. Ask Robert Osborne why there are no other comments about this (including his)? Am I the only one who noticed?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest movie I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ginger Rogers (my favorite actress of all time) and David Niven team up in Garson Kanin's superbly, cleverly directed film. The entire supporting cast is terrific. The look of smug know-it-all on the foundling homes character's faces when they are sure that Polly Parrish is the mother of the orphaned baby is perfect and incredibly funny. From opening store-front scene to Polly's last "Ha Ha", it's completely hilarious. P.S. The film's continuity is pretty bad. If you watch the various cuts within the scenes, there are frequent mismatches. Two examples: A scene with Charles Coburn smoking a cigar shows him alternately with the cigar in his mouth or in his hand from cut to cut. The scene when the baby is found on the steps of the foundling home has a closeup which shows a door and blanket, and hand position which don't exist in the wider shot before and after the cut. No matter. Most people won't notice the poor editing, they will be too occupied laughing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Polly Parrish (Ginger Rogers), a clerk at Merlin's Department Store, is mistakenly presumed to be the mother of a foundling. Outraged at Polly's unmotherly conduct, David Merlin (David Niven) becomes determined to keep the single woman and "her" baby together.Is this what they call a comedy of errors? It certainly is funny, as a woman is stuck trying to get rid of a baby who obviously isn't hers, even though her boss and everyone else seems to think it is. Strangely, the child's well-being is a background concern, and it is interesting that the foundling center claims it receives over 500 babies each year -- what was going on? Or was that just how adoption was done in those days? Ginger Rogers is great, and David Niven is excellent. I just love his debonair demeanor. He is always great, but the younger Niven is a special treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A delightful Romantic Comedy with its non-sticky romance embedded nonchalantly within one of the funniest comedies that I've ever seen is BACHELOR MOTHER. Actually, outside of the best of the Marx Brothers, and maybe THE AWFUL TRUTH, I can't think of a more consistently funny movie. Perhaps not the best comedy ever made (I doubt that it really has very much to say about unwed motherhood, for example, and any other deeper meanings remain, shall we say, not especially evident), but it's close to a perfect example of its kind and the wonder is that it's not far better remembered. Perhaps history has simply lost it among the many excellent and more ambitious movies of 1939. BACHELOR MOTHER didn't go unnoticed at the time, it was both RKO's biggest hit of the year and Hollywood's most popular comedy. And maybe this pure vehicle for Ginger Rogers (she hadn't had many up to this point in her career. Only VIVACIOUS LADY and PROFESSIONAL SWEETHEART come to mind) has been obscured by her continuing fame as Fred Astaire's dancing partner. If so, it's a shame. BACHELOR MOTHER simply begs rediscovery as a forgotten Holiday Classic. The story begins on Christmas Eve and ends on New Year's Day, and includes the most charming and funny and touching New Year's Eve sequence that you could ever imagine.1937-38 had brought on a second leg of the Depression with unemployment again breaching the 20% mark, so Polly Parrish's (Ginger Rogers') predicament at the beginning of the film (ironically laid off immediately after being wished a "very Merry Christmas" by the big boss, Charles Coburn) was an all-too-realistic plot device for its audience. It's hinted without ever quite being said that Polly is a recent orphan herself ("There's no one to go back to," she says when her friend suggests that she might return home), establishing a sympathetic parallel between her and the infant that soon she'll be unwillingly bonded to. For Polly is no more a willing volunteer for motherhood than you or I would be in similar circumstances, but the consequences for a single girl unemployed in New York City in 1939 were ominous, indeed. So she makes lemonade out of lemons and winds up Cinderella at the ball in the finest screwball tradition. Ginger's deadpan approach to Polly's sentimental journey provides just the touch of astringency needed. Neither her growing love for the baby nor for that bigger baby (David) ever grows the least bit gooey.Within the scenes, Garson Kanin's direction is relatively staid and relaxed, as befitting a movie about a mother and child, but the scenes themselves rush forward breathlessly, its set-pieces practically falling one on top of another: David's smug satisfaction at reuniting 'mother and child'; the dance contest at the Pink Slipper; the feeding lessons according to 'Dr. Eaglefoot, or Eagleface, or whatever his name is"; the entire New Year's Eve sequence, "Schmorgen!"; "I don't care who the father is, I'm the grandfather!", etc. Just typing it all out brings a smile to my face.This was Ginger Rogers' first film after the series with Fred Astaire had ended at RKO and she was never better (often different, but never better). If her star wasn't secure before BACHELOR MOTHER, it certainly was afterwards. And if anything, BACHELOR MOTHER was an even more important film for David Niven, for though he wasn't the one to carry the movie, this was probably his most important role to date. He'd been largely a supporting actor to this point, notably in serious movies (THE DAWN PATROL, WUTHERING HEIGHTS), but BACHELOR MOTHER proved him a natural both for comedy and romance. For Charles Coburn, BACHELOR MOTHER was simply one more triumph in what was still relatively early in his brilliant movie career.Ironically, Ginger Rogers didn't like the script and producer Pandro Berman, who must have had plenty of confidence in the project, literally had to force her to do the picture. She did seem to enjoy the experience of working on it once she got to the set, however, and established lifelong friendships with Niven and director Kanin. I suspect that most actors aren't the best judges of what projects are best for them, but it's fitting that a film as delightful as BACHELOR MOTHER worked out so well for everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bright fluff with well-paired Niven and Rogers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I never particularly liked David Niven, I never disliked him either. Here, however, he turns in a very entertaining portrayal of a socially dense department store heir. Through all his density, he eventually becomes rather likable.For years I avoided Ginger Rogers, thinking of her as "that dancer". In recent years I've discovered she was quite a good actress, and she shines here as the woman with the foundling...which doesn't really belong to her. Of course, she works for David Niven's department store.The big disappointment here is Charles Coburn's role. As one of the finest character actors of that era, he was terribly wasted here as the father/owner of the department store. He could have been so good had the role been fleshed out a bit more.I'm not sure Frank Albertson was up to the role of the sorta-protagonist here.The plot line is entertaining. Polly (Ginger Rogers) is walking along the street one day and sees an older lady leave a baby on the steps of an orphanage. Fearing for the baby's safety, Polly picks up the baby and is assumed to be the baby's mother. Although she has just lost her job as a clerk at a department store, the store's owner's son (David Niven) is brought into the situation, and also assumes Polly is the mother. He gives her her job back, but Polly has to start raising the child (BTW, this part of the story -- what ultimately happens to the baby -- is never resolved in the film). Of course, Ginger and Niven fall in love, although it is a bit of a rocky road for a while. Niven's father (Charles Coburn) wants a grandson, even if it was born out of wedlock, and in a screwball finale all live happily ever after...presumably the baby, too.It's light, but charming and funny. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would the Baby's True Mother Please Step Forward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ginger Rogers is adorable, and she has a ton of chemistry with David Niven in this comedy about a woman who's mistaken for the mother of an abandoned baby and for various reasons plays along with the ruse.The film is pretty racy stuff for its time, frankly acknowledging illegitimate children, not to mention the fact that Niven's character falls in love with Rogers and willingly begins a relationship with her all the while believing that she is the true mother of the child. There's little in the film that's outright hilarious but much that induces humorous chuckles, and much worse could be said for many a movie.One of my favorite character actors, Charles Coburn, is on hand to play the child's "grandfather" who goes on a crusade to take custody of it.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not what it appears at first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film annoying from the beginning and almost gave up on it. Through a ridiculous misunderstanding, a woman gets stuck with a rather ugly baby that apparently never needs to have its diaper changed. The next 90 minutes will be all about how she gradually becomes attached to it, yada, yada, yada. Geez I hate this kind of soppy crud.But wait, that's not what the film is really about. The baby quickly becomes a minor character. (Sigh of relief) In fact, it's really about Rogers' relationship with Niven. Although the baby keeps popping up here and there, it's just a reminder of what keeps this going. After the annoying start this turned into a delightful, mostly adult, farce that turned me right around. In the end you just wind up feeling like you had a good time. Even if you hate ugly babies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb eye-pulling wool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Kanin has been called the comic Sirk: like the German genius, he takes a popular genre (here, the romantic comedy), subverts it while retaining its pleasures. This is a film which takes the conservative idea that capitalism is natural and is appropriately symbolised in the family unit, and exposes it as nonsense. Having a child, making a family, being a mother - these are the least natural, inevitable things in the world, and are a result of cynicism and chance. The film's ambiguous title suggests that the character most in need of a mother is the bachelor, a sensational David Niven becoming, er, David Niven. That the film remains romantic AND comic confirms its brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every man wants to be daddy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a recently fired department store employee (Ginger Rogers) finds an abandoned baby, she does what any good woman would do: she tries to get rid of it. But the orphanage she takes it to is sure she is lying about not being the mother and follows her home to return the baby, refusing to take no for an answer. All of a sudden, she has her job back, and every man she knows is yearning to play papa. But circumstances make it appear that the department store owner's son (David Niven) is the responsible party, and hilarious results ensue.This delicious screwball comedy is a bit more subtle in its humor than classics like "My Man Godfrey", "Libeled Lady" and "Bringing Up Baby", but classic none the less. It focuses more on how a definitely single woman must change her life and how she handles sudden and unwanted motherhood. An amusing scene has Niven and Rogers becoming closer with Niven insisting a baby book he's reading indicates that to feed a baby, you must rub oatmeal in the infant's belly button (or "navel") and his awkward reaction to being corrected.A cute Donald Duck toy causes all sorts of contention in the department store, much like Auntie Mame's roller skates. This duck is used as a metaphor to comment on the way adults sometimes argue, talking over each other and sounding perfectly ridiculous. The wonderful Charles Coburn has a wonderful supporting part as Niven's imperious father who gets to be a bit emotional when he learns that he may be a grandfather. Rogers is hysterically funny in pretending to be a Swedish heiress, making up ridiculous sounding words as she goes along, and finally getting a good dig in at the snooty socialite Niven has dumped for her. An intelligent and witty screenplay (by Norman Krasna, with assistance from director Garson Kanin) helps this rise above the average Hollywood comedy, making it a true classic that you won't want to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Start, But Fizzled Fast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This started off pretty well with a good first half hour, but once the romance kicked in between store clerk "Polly Parrish" (Ginger Rogers) and store owner's son "David Merlin" (David Nivens), it bogged down. Despite the romance, there was just too much disagreement between the two on how to take care of this baby. "This baby" was an abandoned one left at a Foundling doorstep, but everyone thought it was Polly's child. That joke was fine to begin with, but got overplayed something fierce. They kept calling the baby "it," too, which is insulting and annoying.Too bad, because the beginning showed great promise, especially when we got to see Ginger dance. That's always a treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing mishaps of a young woman and a foundling baby...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GINGER ROGERS had a flair for light comedy that is evident here as a department store clerk who is mistakenly believed to be the mother of a foundling baby. David NIVEN is the philandering son of rich man CHARLES COBURN and both of them think Rogers is the baby's mother.That about sums up the plot, out of which Norman Krasna makes the most out of a situation which could easily have been explained if someone just told the truth. Apparently, RKO thought the story was so cute that it deserved a remake and in '57 it was remade as BUNDLE OF JOY with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. Unfortunately, it lacked the sparkle of the original and included some forgettable songs.David NIVEN is every bit as charming as Ginger in the sort of role you might expect CARY GRANT to fill and CHARLES COBURN, FRANK ALBERTSON and ERNEST TRUEX add to the fun. The New Year's Eve party scene is a standout among a series of amusing capers.Summing up: Nothing special, but passes the time pleasantly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good romantic comedy...BUT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ginger Rogers does well in this domestic romantic comedy as does David Niven. However the one spoiler has a major plot hole which nobody who has written about the movie has brought up. Ginger is supposed to be the mother of a child. OK...BUT...didn't the landlady who saw her every day notice that she was NEVER pregnant? That she never went to the Hospital? That she never saw the baby during it's first few months? All of a sudden Ginger shows up with a 6 or 7 month old baby. Where was the baby supposed to be during those first months? Just doesn't make sense. And how convenient that the landlady is always available to take care of the baby, day and night!!! Aside from this major story line, BACHELOR MOTHER is still a fun sit through, although the ending is quite confusing. Doesn't the David Niven character care that Ginger was never married and is supposed to have had the baby out of "wedlock"? Oh, and Charles Coburn was quite wonderful in his few scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ginger Rogers happens on a baby being left at a foundling home. She tries to intervene and before we know everyone thinks its hers. I'm not sure why she's called a bachelor in the title but the point is: She not married. This was after the Code and the ensuing plot turns were doubtless risky.But it's predictable and not especially entraining. David Niven is OK as the philandering son of Charles Coburn, who owns the store where Rogers works. Ginger is OK but I would say just OK, apart from the cat fight she gets into with a minor character.Coburn is given very little to do and few lines. More's the pity. And the ducks that keep popping up! Yes, she works in the toy department but wasn't "Joy of Living" enough to convince RKO that they are not only not charming but also, in adult fare, highly annoying?</fullReview>
