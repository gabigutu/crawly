		<fullReview>`I cannot leave the bones lying scattered on the hills.'More melodramatic than his harrowing Fires On The Plain, Kon Ichikawa's The Burmese Harp is still an excellent film and a fascinating glimpse at another perspective of the 2nd World War than the usual (myopic and infantile) Hollywood triumphalism. As with many Japanese films from this period, from Kurosawa to Godzilla, it has an elegiac and reflective quality to it born of the shock and disillusionment that followed the war.I personally was a little uncomfortable with the first 20 minutes of the film that were a little hokey with the singing platoon trying to slip through the forests of Burma to the Thai frontier. However, the film really begins to become compelling and very poetic with the character Mizushima's mission to Triangle Mountain and his voyage south to Mudon to rejoin his unit now in prison camp. Undergoing a symbolic `death' and injured, he is nursed by a priest, but steals the priest's garb as a disguise. However, on the way he passes great numbers of Japanese and is horrified by what he sees. When he arrives at his destination and is staying at a monastery, one monk comments, `You seem to have come through such severe hard training.' He cannot return to his unit. He is determined to bury the dead, to extend empathy to each of them and to pray for their souls. The physical journey is symbolic of a physiological and spiritual journey and is some very creative and effective storytelling. There is much more to the movie, plot wise and thematically, than this, but this is what impressed me most.The imagery is incredible whether it is raindrops collecting and then running along barbed wire, dripping off; or the mud along the riverbanks; or the scene of Mizushima burying corpses at the river, a few villagers standing behind, watching; or the priest bathing in the river; or the shot of Mizushima disappearing into the mist. There is one moment in the prison camp which occurs during a rainstorm. I was really impressed with the natural lighting which gave me the sense of being there. I have looked out windows on days like that as those characters are and the experience "feels like that scene looks". It is incredible how evocative the Japanese films of the period were. The film reminded me of Stone's Platoon with similar music, symbolism, characters, and melodrama. It also seems to have affinities with Apocalypse Now, in that the central concern is not action or tension (though they do not lack these qualities) but potent ideas and a sense of mystery. Both Apocalypse and Harp involve `pilgrimages' and characters transformed by the horror of the situation. They both involve characters unable to return home after this evolution. I do not know if either of these films was influenced by The Burmese Harp, but if they were they modeled on an excellent and moving predecessor.Akira Ifukube's score is classic and will probably sound somewhat familiar to the viewer. He has scored nearly 260 films, including films in the popular Zatoichi series and many of Toho's sci-fi films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Burmese Harp is a poignant elegy to the failure of Japanese imperialism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Burmese Harp (Biruma no tategoto) is a poignant elegy to the failure of Japanese imperialism in World War II and a plea for a more humanistic world. Because it is a Japanese film and portrays events from the perspective of a proud, yet defeated nation, the story it tells is doubly moving. Released in 1956, director Kon Ichikawa's film was made while Japan was still recovering from the effects of war and a full decade before the nation's economy improved on world markets and the international prestige of Japan's technology began its remarkable climb.Born on November 20, 1915, Kon Ichikawa is considered one of Japan's leading directors. Ichikawa's first major film, A Girl of Dojo Temple (1946), was a puppet version of a Kabuki play. The American Occupation authorities confiscated the film because its script had not been submitted for their approval. Ichikawa's early films were often comedies or satires-a rarity in Japanese cinema-and earned him the appellation of the "Japanese Frank Capra." Ichikawa first achieved fame in the West with The Burmese Harp, which won the San Giorgio Prize in 1956 at the Venice International Film Festival.The events depicted in The Burmese Harp are on the surface quite simple. The viewer becomes aware of the film's symbolic and allegorical nature only later on in the film. The story concerns a small band of Japanese soldiers who are fighting in a remote part of Burma, unaware that the unconditional surrender of Japan took place three days earlier.One of the band, Private Mizushima (Shoji Yasui), plays a harp to wile away the time and to entertain his comrades. The ranking officer, Captain Inouye (Rentaro Mikuni), is a former musician, and his soldiers relish the music of the harp and the joy of singing together. But this love of music signifies more than just a temporary release from the stresses of men at war. The men's singing becomes a leitmotif throughout the film and a symbol for the community of spirit that binds them all together. Music functions in the film as a semi-religious, semi-mystical force that has the power to unify and to heal.Melody is equated with the life of the spirit and the joy of home and happier times. The discord of war is heightened by the presence of this music in the midst of palpable fears, where sudden death is not the most frightening, and a painful, lingering death from starvation or wounds is a very real possibility for each man. In a wonderful early scene, Mizushima and his comrades confront British troops as night falls. In the midst of a small celebration, the men learn that British troops are nearby and watching them. But the Japanese continue singing casually in an effort to gain time to ready themselves for battle. But the disguise is not really necessary, as the British themselves burst into song and the two nationalities blend in an instance of peace and harmony with renditions of "There's No Place Like Home."The Burmese harp itself is a central symbol in the film that serves to define Mizushima and his quest. The harp is an element of stability in the lives of all of the men. But have the men have gained their separate peace?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Japanese elegy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film about the immediate aftermath of war from the perspective of the defeated. A Japanese company exhausted by their retreat through the Burmese jungle learn of their nation's surrender. At the request of their allied captors one of their number, Mizushima, agrees to journey to a mountain stronghold where another company is still holding out and engaging in combat. He tries to persuade his compatriots to lay down their arms and narrowly escapes death when they are massacred after refusing to give in. Appalled by the carnage around him, Mizushima decides not to return to his colleagues or country. Disguised as a Buddhist monk, he embarks on the task of laying to rest the war dead that would otherwise fall prey to the vultures. There is nothing in the way of plot beyond this. "The Burmese Harp" is that rare thing, a war film that does not rely on action. Rather does it attempt to define the innate dignity of a former aggressor attempting to salvage some sort of meaning through reparation rather than taking the comfortable course that peace can offer. Ichikawa's tender tribute to a form of saintliness sometimes totters on the tightrope of sentimentality and oversimplification - did ever weary soldiers sing more beautifully! - but by the end the message overrides all doubts. We are witnessing a proud expansionist nation coming to terms with collapse and attempting, through the powerful symbol of Mizushima, to expiate its past. Ichikawa made this film towards the end of the golden age of monochrome. that of Welles, Reed, Wyler and Ford. Like those giants he gives us wonderful closeups. "The Burmese Harp" abounds in evocative images of Burmese villagers, Buddhist monks and Japanese soldier that once seen leave an indelible impression within the mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A universal testament to the horror of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a novel by Michio Takeyama, The Burmese Harp was the first film that brought director Kon Ichikawa to international attention. It is the story of Mizushima (Shoji Yasui) a Japanese soldier in Burma at the close of World War Two who is sent on a mission by his Captain to inform another unit of the Japanese surrender and to convince them to stop fighting. When the unit refuses to give up and are destroyed by the British Army, only Mizushima remains alive and must come to terms with his nation's defeat. Pretending to be a Buddhist monk, he undergoes a religious conversion when he comes face to face with the staggering amount of death and destruction he sees as he travels across the region in search of his unit. Determined to honor and bury the dead, Mizushima is conflicted about remaining in Burma to live a life of service or returning to Japan to help rebuild his own country.The film takes its name from a Burmese harp acquired by Mizushima. He has become an expert harpist and plays while the soldiers sing beautiful chorales with a sound so lush it feels as if it is coming from the Mormon Tabernacle. While the depiction of the soldiers may be idealized, The Burmese Harp transcends its limitations to become a universal testament not only to the madness that prevailed in Burma, but to the unspeakable horror of all war. Ichikawa, in spite of the fact that film became a classic, loved the story so much that he filmed it again in 1985.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique use of WWII as a stage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Burmese Harp" ("Biruma No Tategoto") (Japanese, 1956): What a powerful film. Directed by Kon Ichikawa ("Fires on the Plain"), this story is set during the last days of WWII, in Burma, with a troop of Japanese soldiers. They are weary, confused, but very bonded. When they learn their country has surrendered, with mixed emotions they submit and head to a P.O.W. camp to be detained until arrangements for their fates are made. One of them volunteers to go find a die-hard troop still "dug in" and unwilling to surrender, and ask them to give up, lest they be destroyed by who are now the victors. Thus begins his journey of spiritual awakening. Think of this as the story of Siddhartha, but on a clear, human level. It is gorgeous in its black &amp; white compositions and lighting, slightly theatrical in its scenarios, and quite emotional. "The Burmese Harp" is a unique use of WWII as the stage for larger issues. Superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The grainy black and white can't hide the beauty of this film. Luscious and dealing with the deepest human feelings of war and death and rebirth. This movie is one of the all time greatest ever made. If it doesn't touch your soul, you're missing out and must be numb, cause the acting and the passion and the deep feelings the whole cast puts into their roles is musical in it's beauty. The lush settings and the burmese culture stand out as a slice of history we shouldn't miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Living in Thailand at the age of 10, I saw this movie broadcast on TV. Thirty years later I still think of it. And eventually I became a dharma student. Coincidence? I think not! Such is the awesome impact of this movie. More than an important anti-war film, it can really bring out some seldom expressed feelings - not because of carefully crafted scenarios which bring moral indignation against war, confusion or cruelty, but instead showing a more natural horror of war's results. After watching the film for the third time, I still feel a deep visceral pang when Mizushima covers his face and runs past yet another mountain of rotting bodies he finds on the shores of the river.What's really sad is that you can't get the movie on DVD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very poignant anti-war statement, supported with passionate music and photography. A Japanese POW at the end of the war is separated from his comrades when he tries to coax some hold-outs to surrender. After disastrous results, he disguises as a Buddhist monk and is considered dead, wandering the countryside and continually confronted with the truly dead. His friends suspect he has survived and are disconsolate unless reunited with him. But before he can rejoin them, his journey gradually and painfully transforms him. He has a new mission and a new identity, his spiritual garb no longer a mere disguise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't know how it is fighting a war, man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Putting history and politics aside, I found this film confronted some very human emotions involving war. No matter if this were a Japanese company of soldiers, or a British company, most war movies don't touch on ideas like you'll find here. The film follows a company of Japanese soldiers, with little or no supplies, attempting to reach the border of Thailand. The men enjoy singing wherever they go, and are quite proud of their abilities. It makes them think of their loved ones back home and gives them a sense of unity and hope. One of the men, Mizushima, plays the harp with natural talent, as he had never studied music before joining the army. There is a great scene where the Japanese see the British troops hiding in the forest, so they start to sing, tricking the British into thinking they are oblivious to them. When the British then start singing back, and both sides are singing together, it is a scene of great joy and unity between all humans. Somehow it isn't even cheesy.though it seems it could be, the way I'm writing this review. The British notify the Japanese men that the war ended three days earlier, when Japan surrendered. They are placed in a P.O.W. camp until it is possible to send them all home. The commander of the Japanese men attempts to fill his men's hearts with hope and pride, telling them that together they will rebuild Japan. They are told that nearby, a company of Japanese troops is in an ongoing skirmish with the British, unreachable and unaware of the war's end. Mizushima, is given permission to go and try to explain that Japan has surrendered, promising his company that he'll catch up in Mudon. This turns out to be a not very easy job, as the commanding officer is into the whole `I'm not giving up until I die,' philosophy. Getting nowhere, Mizushima questions their logic to try and persuade them their lives are worth saving, as Japan needs to be rebuilt. The British only agreed to a 30 minute cease fire, and when that time is up, all the Japanese men are killed. Only Mizushima crawls out alive and is found by a Buddhist monk. While he is taken care of by the monk, his company is sad and anxious for his return. Once healed, his intention is to walk to Mudon and surprise all the men, so he sets out in Buddhist costume across Burma. On his way he encounters many heaps and piles of rotting dead Japanese soldiers, and he feels it important to give them a proper burial. These scenes are when Mizushima fully realizes the extent of what war is all about. It's not about pride and hope, it's about putting your life on the line. He is accepted by the Buddhist church and decides to stay and live a simple life, honoring the dead through prayer and burial. His men try to persuade him using a talking parrot switcheroo, teaching a parrot to say `come home to Japan, Mizushima' and giving it to him. He, in reply, sends back his parrot, which he taught to say `no, I am staying here.' It is a pacifist sentiment throughout, a great film covering the human emotional perspective on war in a unique way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japanese soldiers as officers and gentlemen, plus one Buddhist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a justly famous film and well-received by reviewers, however, I could not watch the film without a sense of ironic detachment, especially when it is a Japanese filmmaker who is making a movie about his country's soldiers during WWII, and in a spot made notoriously hot for their enemies, Burma. I could not but feel that whatever the good and pacifist intentions of the scriptwriters and director, that there was a disingenuousness about the depiction of Japanese soldiers as polite and caring gentlemen who could do no wrong. The key character here who saves the film is Mizushima, the one soldier who defects to become a Buddhist priest, and is not only outstandingly musical, but also able to "look like a native" Burmese, when wearing a sarong. Mizushima has the symbolic role of the Japanese conscience after the aftermath of WWII, when countries who were attacked and subjugated by the Japanese were still reeling from the atrocities suffered at their hands. The fact that only one female, that of an old Burmese woman, appears in this film -- she conducts friendly exchanges of fruit with the soldiers -- is another ironic detail, when one remembers that scores of women and young girls were raped and prostituted by Japanese soldiers in virtually everyone of their occupied countries. Is one to take the skillful filming -- all the poetic shots of scenery and of actors' faces admired by other reviewers -- at face value? Mizushima, the soldier who fails to convince the holdouts to surrender (the only reference to Japanese fanaticism), is the only one who undergoes a spiritual change by the war and who suffers any guilt: he not only rejects further killing and his life as a soldier, but he alone rejects his nationality; this is signified by his desire not to return to Japan with his fellow soldiers at the end of the war. As part of the cast, there is a role for a pair of talking parrots, who have been trained to mimic the pleadings of his compatriots to return to Japan. They offer a light but additionally ironic touch to contrast the difference in Mizushima's and the other soldiers' attitudes. Nowhere in the film, except in the stance of passive resistance that the Buddhist priest is known to take, do the soldiers or the filmmakers acknowledge the aggression of their own country as the cause of the war and reason for all these deaths. On the other hand, the "enemy" is also emasculated of his adversarial role by the filmmakers' particular stance, and the viewer is made to feel that the Japanese seem to have felt no enmity toward them. Was I alone in this reaction? Music, moreover, plays a particularly important role: hearty choral singing-- especially using the tune "There's no place like home" -- and harp playing are offered as palliatives to the director's pacifism. In this movie, the harp is a fascinatig symbol. Now I have never heard a Burmese harp, but have listened to much harp music. I wonder whether the music heard over the soundtrack could possibly be that of the instrument that we actually see: what we see is a relatively simple lyre, with no more than an octave range of strings; it undergoes considerable banging about as a result of being carried around on the shoulder, and we never hear it being properly tuned. Yet when the soldiers sing and the harp joins in, it sounds like a Healy concert harp with deep bass resonance. While I enjoyed and admired the music, I also felt that the director was manipulating the listener's emotions more than necessary. Am I being too literal? Should I be suspending judgement and accepting the whole movie as an allegory? I wonder. When a film is shot in sharp and shadowy black and white, as if it were a documentary, and we see actual scenery and sunsets, it is difficult to suspend judgement, yet that is what the director is asking us to do.The upshot of my reaction is that, I feel it is a film worth viewing for the forceful viewpoint of the director, but that the viewer need be forewarned that it represents a white-washed, factually romanticized, conscience of the filmmaker. On a very distant opposing scale of values, may I recommend the films of Ozu Yasujiro. His post-war films speak eloquently of the effects of war on the daily lives of people of conscience, yet without histrionics and without having to even mention the word "war" or "soldiering."Of four **** stars, I would give it three***.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Burmese Harp" is the story of a Japanese soldier who gets separated from his unit at the time of the Japanese surrender in Burma. The plot deals with his attempts to come to terms with the aftermath of the war as he journeys to rejoin his unit. The film has a powerful, if a little sentimental, anti-war message.What makes this film unique is the beautiful music throughout. You will hear the most unusual and thrilling rendition of "Home Sweet Home" by a group of Japanese soldiers. There is other great choral singing, as well. The harp also plays a prominent part in the movie. In addition, there are some thrilling shots of the Burmese countryside and of Burmese Buddhist temples.Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last Thursday night I was sitting in a tiny Amtrak station in Bloomington, Illinois waiting for my train to take me to my beautiful girlfriend in Chicago. As I sitting there, I was joined by a group of stereotypical sorority girls from Illinois State University. For almost an hour I was subjected to their countless stories about meaningless sex, Lady Gaga and the "pounding of shots" that they were so excited to soon be doing in the windy city. By the time we boarded the train, I had realized that I was alone in the car with these five exhausting females. I scurried to the far back to make sure that I could secure a seat by myself and far away from these strangers.My efforts were in vain because one of them spotted my fraternity letters and found it necessary to try and sit next to me. "You're a frat boy, you may enjoy some of my stories". I could not think of any other way to make her leave me alone, so I whipped out my laptop and started watching my next film from the 1077. "What 'cha watchin'" she asked. I answered - "a black and white Japanese anti-war movie made in 1956". After hearing this, it did not take her long to jump out of her seat and rejoin her group of woo-girls. The Burmese Harp saved the day.Little did I know that this movie would not only save me from two hours of annoyance, but it would also be an extremely rewarding viewing experience. Though I was watching it on my laptop, I was still in awe of the Criterion DVD quality and the flawlessness of the hushed black and white. The cinematography is simple and the landscaping of Burma is vast and magnificent looking. It was easy to see that the filmmaker was not interesting in a mass amount of dialogue. It was the striking subtlety in the visual style that properly denoted the overall theme of the movie.The Burmese Harp is about a Japanese soldier stationed in Burma during the days immediately following the end of World War II. He has developed a love for playing the harp and uses it to signal danger to his troop. His playing is also used as a way to raise moral in the lonely mountains of Burma. Music, whether instrumental or vocal, plays a major role in the film. In fact, it seemed like the majority of the communication was presented through song. The sound of the harp is soothing and easy on the ears. It is a beautiful instrument that compliments the smooth visuals.The story is also vividly entertaining in is simplicity. After retreating to the British, the soldier - Mizushima - is sent to try and convince another Japanese troop to surrender. He fails in doing this and the entire troop is eventually killed by British forces. This leads to Mizushima, and his harp, being separated from his fellow soldiers and he is now left to roam the countryside of Burma. As we walks, he meets a spiritual leader and realizes the devastatingly high amount of Japanese casualties caused by the violence of World War II. He sees the bodies of thousands of soldiers with his own eyes. He is traumatized and dedicates his life to giving them a proper burial.The Burmese Harp is the first film by Kon Ichikawa to be seen outside of Japan. It is also one of the first Japanese movies to receive critical acclaim in the United States. What really makes it stand out is that it was the first example of an anti-World War II statement being made by the Japanese through cinema. We forget that everybody is hurt by war, and that the lines are not always as clear as good versus evil. The men in the Japanese army had families, kids and dreams of their own. They just wanted to return home - though they would find that home hardly existed as they knew it before the war.Yes, I may be in debt to The Burmese Harp for saving me from the incoherent ramblings of a loud and proud party animal, but I also legitimately enjoyed it on almost every level. This is a great movie and could serve as an outstanding introduction into Japanese, Asian or world cinema. I am a big fan. I immediately bought the Criterion DVD. You should borrow it sometime...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make Choral Music, Not War.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed on DVD. Restoration = ten (10)stars; cinematography/lighting = nine (9) stars; score = nine (9) stars. Director Kon Ichikawa's bizarre WWII mash-up of choral music, anti-war narrative, kinder and gentler Japanese soldiers, and Japan locations unsuccessfully masquerading as Burma makes for a fascinating film. Basically it is a photo play of fantasized propaganda whipped up by the script writer, Natta Wada (the Director's wife), so just park your brain next to your disc player and enjoy the ride (especially if you simply crave endless choral renditions of the 19th Century song, HOME, SWEET HOME!). In addition to choral arrangements, an obviously prop harp (the "Burmese harp" of the title) serves to link together scenes with emotional fluidity. This film is the first (and likely the only) dramatic (i.e., non-musical) movie to stage a military surrender through singing! (Could choral singing contests be the key to eradicating global armed conflicts?!) That said, the movie is, surprisingly, not maudlin, but much too long and often boring. Besides countless close-ups of choral singers, the closing scenes consist of reading an excruciatingly long letter by a Japanese army captain to his troops. They are stuck on a ship taking them home (so the troops can not escape by jumping to the next DVD chapter!). Cinematography (narrow screen, black and white) is excellent especially for exterior location shots. (It is a shame the movie was not shot in color.) Scene lighting is exceptional and some of the best exhibited in Japanese films of the era. Akira Ifukube's score is one of the best composed for a Japanese film after the war. Subtitles are okay, but, interestingly, signs posted in English are not translated into Japanese. Well worth watching at least once. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Use of Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the War's closing days, when a conscience-driven Japanese soldier fails to get his countrymen to surrender to overwhelming force, he adopts the lifestyle of a Buddhist monk.In Japan, Nikkatsu, the studio that commissioned the film, released it in two parts, three weeks apart. Part one (running 63 minutes) opened on January 21, 1956, and part two (80 minutes) opened on February 12, both accompanied by B movies. Its total running time of 143 minutes was cut to 116 minutes for later re-release and export, reputedly at Ichikawa's objection.I have only recently become aware of Nikkatsu, and more so in the context of their gangster films. This is really quite a feat, and the use of music is excellent. I appreciate these stories of post-war Japan (and the surrounding countries). Such a marked difference from post-war America, which was mostly celebration... everywhere else was destroyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Burmese Harp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this Japanese film in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, I was hoping it would be another foreign film I would never have found otherwise and was enjoyable, directed by Kon Ichikawa (An Actor's Revenge, Tokyo Olympiad). Basically, set during the Second World War, Japanese soldier Private Mizushima (Shôji Yasui) is the harp player in a group composed by Captain Inouye (Rentarô Mikuni) who raise morale for the Burma Campaign by fighting and singing. They are offering shelter in a village, eventually realising that British soldiers are watching them, with their ammunition retrieved and the forces advancing, Captain Inouye tells the men to sing, laugh and clap to trick the British into believing they are unaware of their presence, the British soldiers do not fire, they sing along, the war has ended, and the Japanese surrender to the British. As Australian captain at a camp asks Mizushima to talk down a group of soldiers still fighting on a mountain, he agrees and has 30 minutes to convince them to surrender, he is almost shot by them before they realise he is Japanese, he climbs up and informs the Defense Commander (Tatsuya Mihashi) the war is over and to surrender. But after conferring with their commander, they decide to fight to the end, even after Mizushima begs them, he asks the Australians for more time, but him creating a surrender flag is taken the wrong way and they believe he is surrendering for them, he is beaten unconscious and left on the floor, he is the only survivor following a bombardment. An Old Monk (Eiji Nakamura) helps Mizushima to recovering from his injuries, one day he steals the monk's robe and shaves his head so he will not be spotted by a soldier, he journeys to the camp where his comrades were sent, but he finds many Japanese soldiers dead on the way, he buries them. Captain Inouye and his men cling on to the belief that Mizushima is still alive, eventually the buy a parrot to speak a phrase with Mizushima's name, and an Old Woman villager (Tanie Kitabayashi) takes it to a monk they suspect is actually Mizushima in hiding, she returns with another parrot with a reply rejection phrase. The old woman also gives the captain a letter, saying that Mizushima has decided not to go back with them to Japan, because he continues to bury the dead, while studying as a monk and promoting the peaceful nature of mankind, but he states when he has finished burying the fallen soldiers, he may return to Japan. Also starring Y?nosuke Itô as Village head. I was just about able to follow the story, about the young musician/harpist renouncing his homeland to remain in Burma as a Buddhist monk during World War II, sincerity does occasionally turn into sentimentality, but there are good military and musical scenes, and more than anything this epic film has great landscapes that accompany the great music, an interesting war drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kon Ichikawa's The Burmese Harp is based on Michio Takeyama's book written to introduce children to fundamental Buddhistic principles. The film abandons this idea and instead focuses on the humanistic themes common in many post-war Japanese films that center around the war itself. Ichikawa remade this movie in color during the '80s.One thing I feel this movie does best is establishing a truly memorable setting. The sense of location, or of time and place is general is very strong here. The most memorable shots feature characters seen from a distance, in midst of huge plain areas or dry mountains. The local buildings and majestic temples are seen from below, which has a great effect for some reason I can't explain easily. The story is told from the perspective of both the main character and his unit (one of its members narrates the film) with some lengthy flashbacks here and there.The Burmese Harp shows how music can unify people and give them hope, even during the bleakest of times. It's a powerful anti-war statement told as a touching story of an individual's spiritual transformation. While not as engaging as some other war movies of the same period, it certainly gets its message across brilliantly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Numinal Ichikawa masterpiece that declared his genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Burmese Harp" meditates brilliantly on comradeship, killing, surcease from killing, guilt, remorse and reverence for the dead. From early in his career, this supple and nuanced story discloses Ichikawa to have a subtle mind that operated on many levels. Ichikawa's outsize talent would soon be declared in full force by "Fires on the Plain." This film broods on horror that one man tries to stop, and cannot, and spends the rest of his life in penance for. The story arc celebrates Buddhist thinking, and has such universal themes of guilt, commitment, personal accountability, isolation and shame that it could be transposed well to another place and time. Ichikawa's film occasionally tear-jerks, and some of the musical digressions could be trimmed, but "The Burmese Harp" is anchored by a deft human touch and a pervasive sense of ethnicity-transcending universality. Minoru Yokoyama, the cinematographer, has lovingly lensed this film with an attitude of creating iconography, which he has. Shoji Yasui's performance as Mizushima is one in which muses ever sing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Covenants of the Crown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1853. US Navyman Commodore Matthew Perry makes his way into Japan and forcibly opens the country up to international trade. After two and a half centuries of self-imposed, peaceful isolation, Japan henceforth begins emulating Western powers. After the Meiji Restorations of 1868, Japan not only conclusively shifts from a feudal society to a market economy, but embarks on an endeavour to assimilate Western ideas, technological advances and customs. To the chagrin of the Western Empires, it also spends the next few years aggressively expanding into neighbouring territories, encroaching upon Korea, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, Burma and the Philippines, all countries which had themselves been taken over by Europeans and Americans. The apple in Japan's eye is China, though, which Russia, France, Germany, England and the US are busy dividing between themselves via "Open Door Policies". These policies grant multiple international powers access to China, all to the detriment of China itself.Ticked off that the big Imperialists aren't letting Japan get down to some sweet Imperialism of its own, Japan launches the First Sino-Japanese War (1894) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904). Ironically, these expansions are funded by British and American bankers (Jacob Schiff famously provided 200 million in loans), to such an extent that Japan's outstanding foreign loan indebtedness grows from near zero in 1896 to 421 million yen in 1904 and then 2600 million yen in 1913. After about two decades of further pressure cooking, a complex cocktail of forces and/or contradictions eventually lead to all the world's major nations getting their collective grooves on. In Japan's case, a mixture of nationalism, exceptionalism, racism, stupidity, economic competition, mounting debts, the need to open up foreign markets to prevent local markets from collapsing (historial J.A Hobson would famously call capitalist oligarchy, rather than national pride, the "taproot of imperialism"), blockades, Western bullying and sheer confusion leads to a state of Total War. The end result of WW2? The two Imperialist upstarts ? Japan and Germany ? get bombed back to the stone age, whilst the old Imperialist Empires go broke and are forced to scale back their domains. The United States emerges as top dog.Two of the major war films in Japanese post-war cinema were "Fires on the Plain" and "The Burmese Harp", both by director Kon Ichikawa. Released in 1956, "Harp" follows Private Mizushima, a lowly member of Inouye Company. Mizushima plays a lute, whose music becomes Ichikawa's metaphor for a humanity which is suffocated during war time. The film's awash with bleak landscapes, craggy, war-torn and steeped in death, a canvas which the lute attempts to hold back with an aesthetic of its own. But it's no use. "Soil is blood-red," a title-card reads, "so are rocks.""Harp" finds Ichikawa drawing parallels between Japanese and British soldiers, the fighting class on either side identical in their humanity. Its climax points to Japanese concentration camps, the scientific barbarism of the atomic bombs and finally to monastic Buddhism, Mizushima's newfound path. It's a path which divides Mizushima from both his comrades and an increasingly secular Japan. If warfare remains the music of the gun, Mizushima's Buddhism embodies the music of the lute, an aural flame which he dedicates his life to fanning."Harp's" overriding tone is one of sadness. "Fires on the Plain" (1959), however, is suffused with blunt cruelty. It begins with a slap to the face and then the introduction of Private Tamura, a young man stationed in the Philippines. Tamura, we learn, has been ordered to kill himself with a grenade if he fails to admit himself to a hospital for healing, an absurd situation which informs the rest of Ichikawa's film. Whilst Tamura's countrymen prefer death to the dishonour of capture, Tamura rejects the nationalism and indomitable Yamato-damashii spirit of the army. He sees no dishonour in staying alive, and will do anything to survive. "Fire" thus offers the reverse of the spirituality and positive affirmation of Ichikawa's "Harp". It stresses the corporeal, the physical, its tone is nihilistic, and Tamura will cross any barrier in the name of self preservation, unlike Mizushima, who challenges himself and others to live humanely even within evil circumstances. Lost in a nightmarish odyssey, Tamura stumbles upon burning hospitals, corpses and vampire-like soldiers who cannibalise flesh, his narrative serving to undermine any measure of value or nobility wrongly ascribed to warfare. The film climaxes, in a scene evocative of Sam Fuller's "Big Red One", with Tamura shot whilst trying to surrender to an American soldier. His life's been lost for nought.Aesthetically, "Harp" and "Fire" are similar. Both are melancholic, at times shocking, and carefully juggle impressive wide screen photography with blunt close-ups of haggard faces. Both also feature dated scores, dip into excessive sentimentality and feature soldiers who are more dirty, dispirited and exhausted than was typical of Western war films of the era. This is not surprising. Before the revisionist and/or counterculture movements of the 1960s, British and American war films tended to be upbeat. Even Lewis Milestone ("All Quiet On the Western Front"), would get roped into directing gun-ho flicks ("Pork Chop Hill", "Halls of Montezuma"). Italian, Polish, French and Japanese war films, meanwhile, most of which fell under the umbrella of neorealism, operated under a completely different sensibility. Indeed, directors like Masaki Kobayashi, Andrzej Wajda and Rossellini were directing whole anti-war trilogies. 7.9/10 ? Worth one viewing. See "Paths of Glory", Suleiman's "The Time that Remains" and Kobayashi's "The Human Condition".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a beautiful, moving film but lacking a discussion of Japanese war crimes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this film is a deeply moving, profound film discussing music, the choice between nationalist and religious collectivism, the power of forgiveness and the choices faced by japan in the post war period but it is far from unproblematic. that this film champions devotional over nationalistic collectivism in the main character and individualism over collectivism in the form of the soldiers themselves (as well as openly criticising the fascism which gripped japan with the fate of the troop on triangle mountain) is a great thing and aided the cause of pacifism in post-war japan.the use of music is likewise, as a musician, deeply moving and almost unique in film but i can not walk away from this film without feeling it is somehow problematic.the history of Japanese war crimes is well documented (the use of rape as a weapon of war, indiscriminate torture and murder) and this is side-stepped in the film. perhaps it is simply that this was too painful for japan to face up to at this period (indeed revisionist histories only began to occupy the Japanese mainstream in the 1970s) but it leaves a bad aftertaste for a contemporary viewer.i would however, even with these problems, recommend this film highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The soil of Burma is red</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this masterful antiwar movie Kon Ichikawa uses the big emotional impact of music and singing. It goes straight to the heart of the spectator.The soil of Burma is red with blood of fallen Japanese soldiers. Nobody is there to bury their corpses decently, until one soldier, disguised as a Buddhist monk, takes the herculean task on his shoulders. Kon Ishikawa asks in his movie: 'why must the world suffer such misery?' But, the example of one soldier who survived the onslaught, gives the devastated world a glimmer of hope. Indeed, 'our work is simply to ease the great suffering of the world.'In one of the extras, the actor Rentano Mikuni reveals that bayonet drills in the Japanese army were 'performed' on living prisoners of war! This movie is a real masterpiece. A must see, also the extras.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>war as existential crisis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Towards the end of WWII, a group of Japanese soldiers struggle through the chaos of national disintegration, trying to reach the border through the Burmese jungle. Their Captain is musically trained and forms them into an ad hoc male choir in order to maintain morale. Foot soldier Mizushima plays the titular instrument and as such become a talismanic figure in the group. When he later disappears and suffers an existential crisis, his fate comes to obsess the group as a whole.Ichikawa's iconic piece contains a strong anti-war theme that survives beyond its 1945 setting. Mizushima's troop are timeless, soldiers dreaming of homes, wives, town festivals; clinging to nostalgia to guide them home and fighting on for each other rather than any greater cause inspired by the imagined national community. Much more identifiable with the period are the troop holding out against the British even after national surrender, fanatics looking to die for an Emperor who has forsaken them rather than return to their families and rebuilding of the community. Among these men, there are no songs.Mizushima's conversion from soldier-musician to selfless monk symbolises a state of reflection that follows all armed conflict. The film has been criticised for failing to confront the barbarism of the Imperial army, but this lack of identification with specific national failings is what gives the film a theme that transgresses to other cultures, conflicts and evils - the coming to terms with a life to be lived in the aftermath of horror. The flaws on the Yamato spirit may not be interrogated, but the atrocities of war are present, most visibly in Mizushima's encounter with the rotting flesh of fallen comrades being picked over by scavenger birds. The framing is impeccable, and those looking for a quintessential Japanese aesthetic will be surprised by the extensive use of closeups. The music is spare and suitably evocative of military camaraderie and frightened young men coping far from home. Mizushima's journey is both symbolic and highly plausible, as is the reaction of his brothers-in-arms. Great cinema in its own right, and at the very top of the tree in anti-war movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most sincere anti-war movie I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a novel by Michio Takeyama of the same title, Biruma no Tategoto is a beautifully produced movie about the last days of war in Burma. Mizushima is a foot solder in his platoon fighting the Pacific War in Burma against the British and the allied forces. He's with a commander who used to be a musician, and he himself had exceptional music talent as he picked up a Burmese harp and learned to play all by himself. His platoon learns of the ending of the war and Japan's surrender. They surrender to a near by British camp, but about a hundred miles away, he hears that the war is still on going by a troop that hasn't heard the news. Mizushima volunteers to be the messenger to deliver the message to the troop, but the soldiers there are determined to die for the country and refuses to surrender. Mizushima gets injured in the incident, and is brought back to health by a local monk. He then puts on monk's robe as disguise to travel the country undetected. But as he travels, he witnesses the carnage the war has left. This transforms him from a person in guise of a monk to a true monk that feels his mission is to devote himself to the ones who died in the war. The movie is a war movie of a different sort. It's an accurate account of the war mixed with fantastic novel about the people, the circumstances, and the coincidences that connects the story together. Through the transformation of Mizushima, we are shown the tragedy of war, and its senselessness. Never a word against war is spoken in this story, as the characters are all proud men of the Japanese army, but it conveys the message that war is wrong in the sincerest way.I didn't know that this movie was directed by Kon Ichikawa. This must be one of his early great works. It's a beautiful story like no other, and is sure to leave lasting impression on all who sees it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting and heartwarming parable of selflessness, compassion and spiritual awakening.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the end of WWII, a Japanese platoon is stationed in the jungles of Burma, who have impressive singing skills inspired by their star musician, Private Mizushima...and his harp. Mizushima becomes separated from his company and is presumed dead. Stealing the robes from a Buddhist monk who saves his life, he disguises himself to avoid suspicion as he goes in search of the British prison camp where his platoon awaits repatriation, but is unprepared for the new perspective the stolen robes provide. The initial selfish act of theft contain the seeds of the thief's selfless future. Mizushima's spiritual transformation from a fake monk, thief and soldier of war to that of a genuine bodhisattva warrior (a peaceful 'warrior' of wisdom, compassion and generosity) is reflected in a wonderful and unforgettable scene where his platoon assembles for choral practice in front of a large reclining Buddha statue. As the platoon begins to sing, they are baffled by the mysterious and beautiful harp accompaniment that seems to emanate from inside the body of the Buddha statue, where unknown to the platoon, Mizushima, who is thought to be dead, has taken refuge... and has himself become an instrument of peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superb Anti-War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story is about Mizushima, who was in a Japanese outfit in Burma at the end of World War 2. He mastered the harp and plays it for the regiment. The company finds out Japan has surrendered in the war and Mizushima is chosen to try to persuade a defiant Japanese unit to surrender, as otherwise they will be slaughtered by the British. They refuse to believe Japan has surrendered and are either killed or wounded. Mizushima, who unknown to his regiment survived the shelling, dons a monk's robes and has a new mission. This film is full of evocative images that make you think, make you feel regret and make you wonder, when all is said and done, what is it all for? To listen, for example, a company of British soldiers sing "There's No Place Like Home" and Mizushima accompany them on harp is tremendously powerful. What really blew me away about this film was that it felt like it was playing out in real time, as if it was actual footage of the war. I've not seen the 1985 remake also by Director Kon Ichikawa, but this is a powerful statement of the war that is pretty sobering. The film feels necessary to watch, which is about the best endorsement I can give.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japan's new way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many in the United States have heard about how Germany (and maybe about how Italy) had to do a lot after World War II in order to deal with the residual effects of their actions during the war. It's also worth looking at how Japan had to do the same. Kon Ichikawa's "Biruma no tategoto" ("The Burmese Harp" in English) does a good job with this.In July, 1945, a Japanese platoon in Burma gets captured by the British army. One of the men - named Mizushima - has to go to the mountains to convince another Japanese platoon to surrender. But the latter platoon refuses to do so and all the members get killed in a shootout. As Mizushima walks back to his platoon, he comes across the bodies of more soldiers who perished in the war. Thus he sees his new mission in life: no longer can he be a soldier, but becomes a Buddhist monk, with the aim of healing all affected by the war.I see Mizushima as representing what Japan as a society had to do following its defeat in WWII. Aside from the fact that the Land of the Rising Sun has had to be a pacifist country (the US forced it to have a constitution prohibiting military intervention), the bombing of Hiroshima made the Japanese people averse to militarism in general. Certainly this movie's anti-war stance makes it all the more relevant in this day and age. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lyrical, beautiful, but heart-wrenchingly bleak spiritual take on war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was impressed enough by NOBI that I immediately had the desire to watch this earlier and just-as-celebrated war film, though my local store had no DVD. The old Homevision VHS is a little dark and hazy at times, but serviceable enough, and the film is far more than that. Just as powerful and moving as a denunciation of war, this takes a very different path in showing us that philosophy. Captain Inouye (Rentaro Mikuni) leads a troop of Japanese infantry in the waning days of the war in Burma, keeping their spirits up by engaging them in song as they march dispiritedly through the jungle. Mizushima (Shoji Yasui), a very serious young soldier, has learned to play the Burmese harp very beautifully despite no formal training. They are offered shelter in a Burmese village and are captured by the British, but the war ends and they end up in a prison camp where they are reasonably well treated. Not all Japanese have surrendered though, and there is a tough band occupying a mountain lair that is giving the Brits some trouble; they ask for a volunteer to speak to the holdouts, and Mizushima volunteers. He has little success in persuasion and soon the British are shelling the cave hideout again ? before he can escape. Almost killed, he witnesses the destruction of all of those around him. Unconscious for a time, he misses the British and his own men leaving the area and goes to rejoin them, but he is so sickened by the slaughter that something snaps inside him; he takes the robe of a monk, and in the process of burying men and slowly journeying towards his comrades, he takes on the weight of the tragedy, and decides that his destiny is not, in fact, to continue with his men back to Japan, back to the everyday world.Like NOBI this is brilliantly acted and shot, and very moving. It is not, to my mind, quite as consistent or as powerful; there is just a little too much of the Christlike about Misushima, and his captain seems to function in some ways more as a plot device (the understanding, well-read, philosophizing man who still must do his duty, though his heart belongs with Mizushima in Burma) than a real army officer. Still there is a powerful humanity at work here; I love how the British are presented, for example ? just essentially doing their duty, not particularly brutal though quite stern when they need to be ? and as with NOBI there is some comic relief, in the form of a parrot, and an old woman who barters with the POWs. The film is perhaps a little naively optimistic, in its assertion of old spiritual values as a potential remedy to man's violence?.but this is counterbalanced by the realistic take on the majority of the crew aboard ship as the soldiers head home?.the CO reads a letter from Mizushima informing them of why he cannot join them; they are moved and respectful, but moments later many of them are turning their minds to worldly pursuits?Ichikawa knows better than to believe one Mizushima, or one film by him, can change the world. The hope is something, and that is all he and we can do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BURMESE HARP (Kon Ichikawa, 1956) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best-known and most impressive anti-war films ? a companion piece to the same director's later, if more cynical, FIRES ON THE PLAIN (1959) ? and, arguably, Ichikawa's finest. Its 1985 remake ? also made by Ichikawa! ? is, curiously, not mentioned at all in the interviews that accompany the movie on Criterion's exemplary DVD (though, admittedly, I haven't read the booklet).While I usually cringe at the sentimental songs that frequently crop up in Japanese films, here, this element is actually integral to the plot: the hero ? a soldier thought dead, missing or AWOL ? has learnt to play the titular instrument and used to complement with music the heartfelt singing of his companions (instigated by their music-lover captain for morale-boosting purposes). Having become a monk, the soldier is staying at a Buddhist temple; at one point, while his outfit is looking for him in the vicinity, he instinctively resumes to playing the harp when they break into song?but he's determined not to return home with them (following the defeat and capitulation of the Japanese army) because of a spiritual calling by which he is to give dignified, honorary burial to the mass of dead comrades still lying around the battlefields of Burma, putrefying and at the mercy of prowling vultures. Given the importance of music in the film, Akira Ifukube contributes a powerful and memorable score.Ichikawa had first intended to shoot the film in color, but the cumbersome equipment couldn't be carried on location ? so, he stuck to black-and-white; consequently, he relied on expressive lighting to bring out all the various aspects of war such as honor, comradeship, fatigue, despair, fear of death, loneliness and, ultimately, serenity. While there are a few harrowing scenes, they're not at the forefront as they would be in the afore-mentioned FIRES ON THE PLAIN; that film was basically a character study of a private driven to madness and cannibalism by the experience of war: as I said at the beginning, this shows the other side of the coin with respect to the effect of combat on a human being ? where the inherent grimness is overcome by a selfless embrace of asceticism. Incidentally, Ichikawa made a very different and less optimistic film about a monk with CONFLAGRATION (1958) ? which preceded this viewing: in my review for that film, I mentioned that the director employed an interesting technique to jump from the past into the present and back again; here, we're not shown immediately what led to the hero's 'conversion' ? but this is eventually shown in poignant flashback.The film may be considered longish at 116 minutes, but the emotions driving the narrative are so strong and honest that one hardly notices it; even if most of the actors are unfamiliar, Ichikawa brings out the best in each of them and, in particular, the two protagonists: Shoji Yasui (as the soldier/monk ? he had a rather brief career) and Rentaro Mikuni (as his compassionate superior officer ? he appeared in such acclaimed films as KWAIDAN [1964] and VENGEANCE IS MINE [1979]). The extras are the icing on the cake: Ichikawa's interview (he died only recently and this, in fact, instigated the viewing of the film) details plenty of behind-the-scenes anecdotes and also states that, when THE BURMESE HARP won a prize at the Venice Film Festival, he wasn't even aware that it had been submitted for competition! Mikuni's interview is shorter yet quite candid: he recounts that his own war duty being still fresh in his mind, he wouldn't stand for compromises in authenticity (brought on by a tight schedule more than anything else) and, at one point, he even stalled the film for a week because of this; he also gives due credit to scriptwriter Natto Wada (the director's own wife), who was the only person allowed in the editing room and whose suggestions often led to reshoots, and ends his interview with a plea to put a stop to war once and for all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't recall who said it, but one film theorist has said that anti-war movies are a paradox, because the excitement of battle scenes inevitably romanticizes war, contradicting the chosen theme of any director. Well, whoever said it didn't see this film, which brilliantly sidesteps the problem by taking on an 'adult fairytale' (as the source book was described by its author) as a way of telling an anti war story.The film is set at the very end of the war, when the Japanese army, already routed, is persuaded to surrender. One soldier, a brilliant musician, is separated from his unit when he is sent to persuade some hold outs to surrender. He first dresses as a monk to try to escape, but gradually finds his mission in life as he accepts teachings as a monk and chooses to devote his life to properly disposing of the remains of the thousands of dead Japanese soldiers scattered around the country.The story is simple and runs a tightrope where it very nearly falls into sentimentality. But the skillful direction (along with some stunning photography) prevents this happening. The whole movie is very beautiful and emotional with a profoundly resonant pacifist message.I saw this on Criterions excellent DVD. The quality is excellent and the extras are very interesting. It seems very clear from the interview with the actor Rentaro Mikuni, who plays the commanding officer, that Ichikawa's wife and screen writing partner Natto Wada played a key role in the movie, even insisting on some parts being re-shot. Its clear that if there is any justice, she should have equal billing with her husband in the very fine movies of this period made by him.The movie has been criticized for taking a romanticized view of the Japanese soldiers, and ignoring the viciousness of the occupation by Burma of the Imperial Army. Indeed Mikuni in his interview directly alludes to his own experience as a young soldier there where he witnessed prisoners being slaughtered in bayonet practice. But I think this misses the aim and theme of the movie, which is the savage waste of young lives represented by war, and how bravery in battle is nothing next to the spiritual nobility of the true pacifist represented in this film by the Buddhist monks. In Ichikawas later film 'Fire on the Plain', he addressed the viciousness of the war in much more direct terms. Viewed purely on its own terms, I think this movie succeeds wonderfully and is fully justified in its approach.</fullReview>

Images are sharply etched throughout. It's nothing less than a crying shame that black and white films are considered passe (even the stop-motion monster classic 20 MILLION MILES FROM EARTH has been colored- one presumes, to accommodate/placate more "contemporary tastes"). Eschewing (for the most part) the grisly battlefield scenarios found in most World War Two dramas (including the shocking FIRES ON THE PLAIN), THE BURMESE HARP boasts superior performances by actors whose characters are all on the same spiritual plain. The reading of the letter aboard ship is guaranteed to bring a tear to the eye of even the most jaded viewer: "There is no end to words of farewell." Amen to that.</fullReview>

It is refreshing to see a film from this era where Japanese soldiers are presented as regular human beings, not as sadistic subhuman devils. A lot of attention to detail went into the film score, and there are some nice choral musical numbers. In my opinion, the message of the book gets lost trying to make the movie work as a story, but the images of Buddhist temples and the music somehow redeem it. This film was groundbreaking for it's time, but like most films that are over 50 years old, it seems dated in retrospect. If you are interested in an older Japanese language film with nice black and white images and choral music, you will love this movie. If you are looking for an action packed shoot-em-up, or even just an accurate historical depiction, that is not what this film is about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the finest anti-war films, which also explores the Buddhist beliefs of altruism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps one of the finest anti-war films I have ever seen. It is the near total lack of violence/depiction of war that makes this movie so powerful. Rather than focusing on the battles and the guns and the ships, etc, this film instead focuses on the human tragedy and suffering caused by war. The viewer is introduced to Mizushima, a Japanese soldier who is well liked by his comrades. As the movie develops, he is separated from them. On his journey to rejoin his comrades, Mizushima witnesses the tragedy of war as he comes upon dozens and dozens of unburied Japanese dead. This exposure to the ultimate tragedies of war is countered by the kindness of a Buddhist monk, who takes Mizushima in and nurses him to health. Mizushima starts to realize that he must give his life to help others - altruism - even if those others are dead. Filled with Buddhism and the Buddhist way of life, the film explores altruism and sends a strong anti-war message that cannot be missed. The scenery is stunning, including the Schwedagon Pagoda in Rangoon, Burma, perhaps one of the most beautiful of all Buddhist temples. The music is outstanding as well. It is simple, yet moves the film forward and sends powerful messages. A great movie to watch and internalize. It is a tear jerker as well. At worst, it will make some understand that the Japanese were people too, and not just some monster as they were often depicted as in the USA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting Anti-War Allegory Reveals the Uniquely Japanese Identity After WWII</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the flip side to David Lean's "The Bridge on the River Kwai", filmmaker Kon Ichikawa's 1956 anti-war parable takes place in the same sweltering Burmese jungle but at the very end of the war in 1945. By this time, the British troops have the upper hand, and a demoralized Japanese battalion led by the indefatigable Captain Inouye has peacefully surrendered. However, there is a fanatical unit of Japanese soldiers cloistered in a nearby mountain, and Private Mizushima accepts a risky mission to convince them to surrender. He fails valiantly and is left for dead after a hailstorm of gunfire. What happens next is tracked in two intertwining story lines - the first is the spiritual journey of Mizushima as he is traumatically affected by the overwhelming number of casualties he sees on his way back to the prison camp where the rest of his troop has been sent; the second is about Inouye and his men and how they use music to reconcile themselves to defeat and rebuilding their lives after the war.Considering how graphic many of the images are, it's hard to believe that the screenplay written by Ichikawa's wife Natto Wada was actually based on a young adult novel with an almost fairy tale tone. Yet, some of the more fanciful elements remain in the movie, in particular, the magical affinity that Mizushima shows when he fluently plays a handmade harp and the insistent use of the overly familiar "Home, Sweet Home" as a connective plot device between the opposing sides of the war. If one can embrace such contrivances, then the rest of the allegorical movie begins to resonate on a deeper level. What helps immeasurably is Ichikawa's clear-eyed sense of narrative flow as Wada's script reveals the character transformations in human-size terms. The one drawback to this subtle approach is the overly symbolic leap that Mizushima makes from dutiful soldier to pacifist Buddhist monk. It feels far more like the personification of a country's postwar metamorphosis than an honest change in outlook, whereas Inouye's overwhelming feeling of accountability over Mizushima's fate grounds the film in a more certain reality.The two key performances reflect this divergence - Shoji Yasui is sincere and often powerful but dramatically opaque as Mizushima, while Rentaro Mikuni maintains a forceful presence as Inouye with a prevailing humanity. The Criterion Collection does its usual stellar job in restoring the pristine condition of the original film highlighting the crisp black-and-white cinematography of Minoru Yokoyama. At the same time, this is not one of their more robust packages. Even though film scholar Tony Rayns contributes an informative essay on the accompanying booklet, there is surprisingly no commentary track on the 2007 DVD. There is, however, two recent featurettes included - a 16-minute interview with Ichikawa, probably the least known of the Japanese masters, conducted in 2005 when he was turning ninety; and a 12-minute interview with Mikuni. Both are insightful on a cursory level, though they do beg for follow-up viewing of Ichikawa's other classic films. The remaining extra is the original theatrical trailer. One wonders if Clint Eastwood saw this film in preparation for his own "Letters from Iwo Jima" since they share an observant eye for the distinct emotionalism unique to the Japanese mindset during WWII.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red Dust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of this long film the audience sees a spectactcular view red dirt and red mountains of Burma, which is very significant because, if one is familiar with Buddhist tradition, the dust symbolizes the mortal world of suffering and it represents what one wants to brush off if one desires to follow the path of the Buddha. After seeing the bleak terrain, the audience is introduced to a small contingent of soldiers led by Captain Inoue a former music teacher. In order to keep his troops spirits up, the Captain teaches his men how to sing with varying degrees of success. His most gifted soldier is Mizushima, who has taught himself how to play a Burmese Harp which he has mastered quite skillfully. Trudging along the harsh landscape, The soldiers find shelter and food in a small village. The villagers feed and shelter them, but when the soldiers want to perform a song for them, the villagers turn their backs on the troops. Later they learn that Japan has ceased fighting. Captain Inoue and his men peacefully turn themselves over to the British. However, other pockets of Japanese soldiers are still fighting. Captain Inoue asks Mizushima to inform one group of soldiers to stop fighting and give themselves up. After talking with the British Colonel, who gives Mizushima thirty minutes to make peace with the Japanese, Mizushima speaks with the commander of the Japanese forces, but instead of giving up, they fight to the bitter end and are completely wiped out by the British.Mizushima survives, but is seriously injured. He is discovered by a Buddhist monk who nurses him back to health. One day, while taking a bath, Mizushima's clothing is stolen, so he dons the robes of a Buddhist monk and also shaves his hair. He travels around and is given food by devout Buddhist people. At this point Mizushima's main goal is to reach Mudon and be reunited with his unit, but after seeing hills made of the bodies of deceased Japanese soldiers and funeral ceremonies performed by the British for fallen Japanese soldiers, he takes a new path to bury the bones of his fellow soldiers. However, his old friends have not forgotten him...This movie is based on Takeyama Michio's 1946 novel of the same name, which has come under some serious criticism because of its portrayal of the Japanese soldiers as a basically happy bunch victimized by the British, when in fact the Japanese brutalized Burma, China, Manchuria, and several other countries. However, this film was created some ten years after the novel and was directed by Ichikawa Kon, a humanist director. So, when you watch the film take it with a grain of salt, but don't let the salt get into your eyes and keep you from enjoying this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an incredibly strong anti-war statement, beautifully photographed and most unusual in that one realizes the horror of war without the usual heroics of battle. I was reminded of John Ford films which often gain their power and their ability to move the viewer by the use of music. Ichikawa shares this with him by the various songs -- particularly "There's No Place Like Home" sung in tandem by both Japanese and British soldiers and by the eerily beautiful burmese harp itself. The whole experience was overwhelming!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very poignant anti-war statement, supported with passionate music and photography. A Japanese POW at the end of the war is separated from his comrades when he tries to coax some hold-outs to surrender. After disastrous results, he disguises as a Buddhist monk and is considered dead, wandering the countryside and continually confronted with the truly dead. His friends suspect he has survived and strive to be reunited with him. But before he can rejoin them, his journey gradually and painfully transforms him. He has a new mission and a new identity, his spiritual garb no longer a mere disguise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it a true anti-war and Buddhism teaching film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this poetically crafted anti-war film from the recent new DVD release from Criterion, I must say there are something disturbed me profoundly. The platoon led by Captain Inouye (Mikuni Rentaro) was depicted throughout the entire film more like a Boy Scout group than WWII Japanese Imperial soldiers. They enjoyed choral singing so much as if they weren't aware that they were battling with the British army in the tropical Burmese jungle during the final days of WWII. The film never dropped any slightest hint of any suffering or hardship of the local Burmese people because of the war brought onto their land by the Japanese and British. The film concentrated on the main character, the harp-playing soldier Mizushima's spiritual awakening while disguised as a Burmese monk fleeing alone from a deadly battle in the mountain to join up his platoon which have already surrendered and been taken as war prisoners by the British army. The film showed several times how Mizushima was shocked and horrified upon seeing dead bodies of his fellow Japanese soldiers scattered in a raven, along a river bank or in the jungle. But the film never showed even once any casualty or suffering of any Burmese people, which made it appeared as if the Burmese people during the war were nothing but a bunch of on-lookers. The story in this film seemed to tell us that Mizushima's transformation from a soldier to a Buddhist monk was solely because he saw many dead bodies of his fellow Japanese soldiers but not because he saw the mass killings on ALL SIDES, including the death of innocent civilians. Ichikawa Kon's film had an admirable anti-war intention and message, but unfortunately it appeared it laden with the ever subtle message that says "We Japanese soldiers are good people, we never really want to do harms to others, we suffered and died just like any other war victims." Some people may think this film has a clear Buddhist teaching in it, but the way I see it, it's not a pure Buddhist altruism because I can smell the 'nationalism' hidden behind that harp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While a bit sentimental, it never veers into mawkishness, and the full five or so minute reading is one of the great humanist documents in cinema, perhaps even greater than Charlie Chaplin's speech at the end of The Great Dictator. Mizushima claims his new mission in life is monkdom, and helping to bury the war dead, and promote peace in the world. The film then makes an interesting decision, and one virtually uncommented on in any of the criticism of it I've read. After the letter is read, the film's narration (which opens the film, and is rather sparse) begins again. All along, viewers have been led to believe- via closeups of the captain's face during other narrations, that it is he who has been telling this film's story from some indefinite time in the future. But, no; the speaker, as the camera move sin, turns out to be a wholly anonymous member of the unit; one who had no prior scenes nor close-ups.Imagine, as example, had Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick, not opened with Call me Ishmael, and the reader only found out who the narrator was on the last page, and had to guess if the narrator was omniscient, or a member of the Pequod, only to be startled their guess was wrong. The reason this is so important, looking back at the film, is that a) the point of view change from the expected narrator to another recapitulates the confusion that the troop has over whether or not the monk they see is their comrade- thus letting the viewer 'feel' the confusion that the internal characters are feeling- albeit for a different reason, b) it makes the viewer question whether or not what has been shown is true or not, since we now know the narrator is not the reliable and honorable captain- a character we would trust as reliable. This ties the whole film back to the more fairy tale like quality of the source novel. The final reason, c), it forces the viewer to wonder whether or not he or she has assumed other things that were not so in the narrative, even if one accepts that all the anonymous private has revealed is true.This is an astonishingly effective device that Ichikawa employs, and coming on the heels of the straightforward and moving missive revelation by Mizushima, the audacity of Ichikawa's narrative sleight of hand erases any doubts over whether this film is great or not. It is as great a film as his later Fires On The Plain, which, narratively and tonally, is almost the complete opposite of this film. But, the fact that such a key element in the film has never been commented upon before shows how little most critics actually pay attention to the subjects they criticize, as well as how little they understand how even a small moment, or the slight use of a technique, can radically change the whole tenor of a work of art. This is too often because the critics approach art with their own biases in tow, rather than viewing the work on its own merits. Another moment that has gone critically unnoticed is the scene on the bridge, between Mizushima (dressed as a monk) and his troop. This occurs two times. The first time, the viewer is as confused as the soldiers are, but the second time, the narrator tells the audience it was definitely Mizushima. Thus, we know that Mizushima's ruse will be found out, and this diverts the narrative tension from will the soldiers learn the truth of Mizushima? to how will they learn it, and will they learn why? This is not an insignificant narrative change of direction, but one, again, which never seems to have stirred critics.The DVD, put out by The Criterion Collection, is well transferred- the black and white hues are brilliant. However, the DVD lacks an audio commentary- an increasing annoyance with Criterion releases ever since they went to their new C logo. There are too all too brief interviews with Ichikawa and Renataro Mikuni, who played the captain. There is a trailer, and only subtitles, again in white- another b?te noir of Criterion, for white subtitles often are lost against the whites of a black and white film. Colored subtitles are a must if no English dubbed soundtrack is to be added. The insert contains an essay on the film by film critic Tony Rayns, but it's a rather pedestrian take on the subject. Akira Ifukube's score is solid; the only real highlights are the delightful harp playing by Mizushima.Overall, The Burmese Harp is a great film. It is not one of those razzle-dazzle works of art that is flashy, but it gets the job done, and invites rewatchings to elicit subtleties one viewing may miss. It also kills the old notion that all war films- even those with explicitly anti-war themes- end up celebrating war because of the battle scenes and those scenes which show individual valor. Both this film and Fires On The Plain kill that notion; the former by eliding almost all scenes of battle, and the latter by the sheer devastation of the results of war it shows. It certainly deserved its nomination for an Academy Award as best Foreign Film, as well as numerous other festival awards. Ichikawa's reputation is that of a serviceable studio director, and that may be true; but the two films of his I've seen are the equals of the best films made by the titanic Japanese triumvirate of Yasujiro Ozu, Akira Kurosawa, and Kenji Mizoguchi. Here's hoping he has a few more deviations from that norm others claim for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While far from perfect, it is an exceptional anti-war film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I review THE BURMESE HARP, I should point out that I had previously watched another Japanese anti-war film, FIRES ON THE PLAIN ("NOBI"). I mention this because it definitely colored my view of BURMESE HARP, since FIRES did a much better job of conveying the horror of war--so much so that BURMESE HARP seems to pale a bit in comparison. So, if you like the message in BURMESE HARP, then seeing FIRES ON THE PLAIN is an absolute must.This film is set in the final days of WWII. The focus of the film is a small company of Japanese soldiers who are mostly trying to avoid being killed as well as find something to eat. Within this groups is a soldier who is almost like a mascot, as he carries a small harp with him and uses it to raise the morale of these dispirited troops. When they receive word that the war is over, the harpist (Mizushima) volunteers for one last mission--the try to convince some hard-core Japanese soldiers that the war is finished. However, these men don't believe him and soon they are attacked and killed--leaving Mizushima alive but wounded. As he makes his way back to the internment camp where his comrades are being held, he comes upon many war dead--so many that his mind seems to snap. From then on, instead of returning, he decides to don the robes of a Buddhist monk and travel the land burying the dead and dedicating his life to peace.When it comes to the technical aspects of the film, the music is wonderful and gives a rather surreal edge to the movie. Additionally, the cinematography is excellent as well. There is one problem, however, and that is that the film is poorly paced. In other words, while an exceptional film, it probably would have been better had it been trimmed a bit (the Leonard Maltin Guide also stated this--I read its review after I saw the film). I really think the message could have been more powerful had 15 or so minutes of the film had been trimmed--and this is something I rarely feel. Normally, I love longer films.By the way, this isn't so much a criticism of this particular film, but when I saw it I found myself a bit torn. Although many Japanese soldiers suffered and died in the war and it was a great loss, I wondered how many Japanese-made movies talked about the Rape of Nanking, their forcing Korean women to be "comfort women" (i.e., sex slaves) and the wide-spread killing of prisoners of war? If you know of any such films, let me know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half a Century Later ????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie did not move me nearly as much as it seems to have moved others, perhaps because it resembles in certain respects other stories about World War II survivors. I can't help wondering how I would have reacted if I'd seen it when it was originally released. I suspect I would have found it much more affecting then than I do today. To be sure, the locale is more exotic than many other war survivor movies (though one suspects it was not actually shot in Burma). The gritty black-and-white film gives it a bit of a newsreel quality. But despite the left-over bones on the landscape, it does not make for a particularly powerful antiwar statement. All it really tells us is that Japanese soldiers were people too and one of them felt a pull to a more spiritual calling which he obeyed rather than return home with his wartime comrades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great postwar japan novel by Takeyama Michio made into a great anti-war film by Kon Ichikawa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the story set it's background and the time on a very specific historical event, it also borrowed not only ideas but positive ideas from other known facts of wars to remind the audience that the film wasn't created to blame the other country who has devastated Japan but to review and revise the consequences of war and the suffering of the humanity as a whole.For our hero in this film, he was battling between the urge to rejoin his friends, the opportunity of going back to his home country and the moral responsibility of taking care of the fallen comrade. The entire film was very well presented, as the movie explored the horror of the war, the sorrow for the dead, as well as the down-to-earth friendship between the comrade, the affection; the humanity between factions and the struggle spiritual responsibility and the memorability of the social relationships, it deeply touched me and i would recommend everyone to watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbearable melodrama that substitutes true dramaturgy and motivation for saccharine sentimentality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lesson on how NOT to make a picture by one of the most celebrated Japanese directors of all time. I have no other way of explaining the ignominious debacle that is THE BURMESE HARP. This must be Ichikawa's 110 minute masterclass on how NOT to create a story. And it's genius for that.The basis of HARP's story is another return on the widely traveled path of the Hero's Journey. The mentor, the death and resurrection of the hero, the gift he returns with from the other world to bestow upon the world, everything the respectable Joseph Campbell taught can be found here.Where the movie falters is in substituting true dramaturgy and character motivation for saccharine sentimentality. Ichikawa goes straight for the jugular, his intentions to force the drama upon the viewer's emotions instead of letting it derive naturally from the premise and the character orchestration. Conflict, the most surefooted and ancient root in the heart of all storytelling, is forced via jumps in logic or simply produced on demand when the movie requires it.After a decent first 40 minutes and an almost excellent following 30 minutes, the movie proceeds to foreshadow its calamitous conclusion by turning the protagonist, a Japanese soldier turned Buddhist monk, into a sulking child. On his way back from a mission from which he barely survived he has the opportunity to witness the ravages of war firsthand. He returns to the previously appointed gathering point for the surrendered Japanese troops a changed man. Instead of rejoining his platoon to wait for their shipping back to Japan, he runs off and hides from them. His platoon spends the rest of the movie looking out for him, cajoling him and singing when the opportunity provides. Which is pretty darn often.Why did the private run off? Something to do with the harrowing images of unburied Japanese soldiers he saw on his way we understand. Let us make a small jump in logic and assume this is the first time a soldier engaged in war comes across such horrors. What is the specific character motivation that turns him into a sulking child? We never know. Ichikawa probably doesn't either as he has the platoon break out in song every 10 minutes until the final 5 minutes of the movie where he remembers he somehow needs to explain the protagonist's irrational behaviour. At which point the sergeant produces a very convenient letter written by the private, where in, what essentially amounts to little more than a voice-over narration, we are "told" a bunch of utterly vapid and bland clichés regarding "peace", "courage" and "easing the suffering of others".All great ideas to be sure but for the love of god man!! You can't tell us these things, we know already. You have to show, invoke the images and character actions that will enable us to arrive at those selfsame conclusions. Something Ichikawa himself did with the harrowing and soul-destroying FIRES ON THE PLAIN a couple of years later. Stacked against that monumental war drama, The Burmese Harp is feeble and puny, an elegiac ode on humanism that lacks the power of conviction.The black and white cinematography is great, it is after all a visual master of Ichikawa's calibre we're talking about. Is it surprising then that the most gripping sequence of the film is almost entirely silent? Ichikawa delivered his masterpiece with Fires on the Plain and with The Burmese Harp he shows how NOT to make a movie. What else could be expected of any director?</fullReview>
