		<fullReview>"THE BOY CRIED ' WOLF' 'WOLF' SEVERAL TIMES AND EACH TIME THE PEOPLE CAME TO HELP HIM THEY FOUND THERE WASN'T ANY 'WOLF' ".Aesop's FablesRKO certainly lived up to its reputation as the finest creators of Film Noir with this taut and suspenseful thriller made in 1947. Held back, for some reason, by Howard Hughes until a 1949 release THE WINDOW was based on a story by Cornell Woolrich that became a splendid screenplay by Mel Dinelli. Photographed in stunning crisp Monochrome by William Steiner it was directed with unrivaled regard to tension and impact by Ted Tetzlaff. With no marquee names to speak of and costing a modest sum to produce on the streets of New York's Lower East Side the picture was a great success with both critics and public alike.The story of THE WINDOW concerns a 10 year boy Tommy Woodry (Bobby Driscoll) who just loves to spin yarns and tell tall tales. He lives in a modest apartment with his parents (Arthur Kennedy and Barbara Hale) in the lower East Side of New York city where his playground is the dilapidated tenements that surround him. One warm night he awakens and because of the heat takes his pillow out on to the fire escape to sleep. Here he witnesses a murder under the window shade of an adjoining apartment. But being the great story teller he is no one will believe him. No one, that is, except the killers themselves (Paul Stewart and Ruth Roman) who now must find a way to silence the boy. From here on the film never lets up. It becomes a white knuckle ride as Tommy tries to escape the killers clutches down alley ways and across the dodgy rooftops of dangerous tenements. The picture ends with one of the killers falling to his death and Tommy being reunited with his parents who finally believe him. Now he makes a solemn promise never to cry 'Wolf' again.Adding greatly to the thrills is the marvellous music score by RKO's Noir composer in residence Roy Webb. With a terrific main theme, heard in its broadest form under the titles, there is also some splendid eerie music for the stalking scenes and exciting action cues for the chase sequences.But there is little doubt that the film is held tightly together and dominated by the outstanding central performance from the ill-fated 10 year old Bobby Driscoll. You simply cannot take your eyes off him. An amazing little actor, it is a great shame he never got to have a full career in film. But it was never to be! Fate had other plans for him. He was to be plagued with bad luck for the rest of his days. First he suffered with severe acne in his teens which halted his film career. Then he was arrested and sent to jail on drugs charges. When he was released his reputation proceeded him and he was unemployable in Hollywood. Later he made a couple of stabs at supporting roles in films of no repute. But he never regained even the slightest spark of his childhood genius. With his career virtually over he became a drug abuser again. In 1968 - and ironically in the same setting as his greatest success in the film THE WINDOW - two children playing found his dead body in a derelict tenement in New York's Lower East Side. He was only 31 years old. It is quite inconceivable that for someone who had demonstrated such a mighty talent should finish up unknown, unclaimed and sadly come to be buried in a pauper's grave on Hart Island.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The central figure of 'The Window' was a slum ten-year-old boy (Bobby Driscoll), living in New York poor neighborhood and known to everyone there as a teller of fantastic stories?His parents (Arthur Kennedy and Barbara Hale) warned him he must stop his fantasies? and what followed was a classic up-dating of the boy who cried 'wolf' once too often?One stifling night, the boy climbed out on to a fire escape to seek cool air and, through a crack under a window blind, he witnessed a murder?He knew no one would believe him although this time, for the first time, his story was true? He tried to tell his mother that he had seen a couple called Kellerson trying to rob a drunk and killing him in a fight: the boy got scolded for his imagination and sent to bed? His father locked him in for punishment; the boy escaped and took his story to the police station. A detective investigated, but could find no body, no signs of a struggle?Now the awful irony: the guilty Kellersons learn through the detective that the boy had seen them committing the crime, and the boy's parents, with terrifyingly understandable logic, send the boy to the killers to apologize 'for spreading such an awful story about them'.The Kellersons cannot decide: should they leave well alone, as nobody believes the boy; or should they commit another crime to cover the first?'The Window' is a classic little second feature, entertaining and suspenseful; unfortunately it had few successful imitators?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional little thriller of a child's worst nightmare...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theme of a murder being witnessed by someone who no one believes, is based on the familiar concept of "cry wolf once too often and no one will believe you when you're telling the truth". Here it's played to the nth degree by an excellent cast--Bobby Driscoll, Barbara Hale, Arthur Kennedy, Ruth Roman and Paul Stewart--and directed in realistic, gritty style by Ted Tetzlaff. The New York tenement setting is an absorbing environment for this chilling tale of a boy who is in danger when the murderers know they have been seen--and must come to grips with his situation without the aid of his parents or police. Based on a Cornell Woolrich story, it's so tight and suspenseful for the length of its running time that it effectively projects the dark, nightmare world where one's worst childhood fears can come true. With the dark ambiance of lower East Side tenaments as its setting, danger and death seem to entrap the boy in every lurking shadow until his ultimate pursuit by the killers. This is a modest thriller that achieves a maximum of suspense thanks to the skillful performance by child star Bobby Driscoll and bears a resemblance to other Woolrich stories, as for example 'Rear Window'. Barbara Hale and Arthur Kennedy register strongly as the parents. Ruth Roman and Paul Stewart are a chilly pair as the neighbors from hell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Driscoll Delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bobby Driscoll is not a name familiar to most people, unless they are die-hard classic movie fans. Driscoll's career was short, but that wasn't because he couldn't act. This movie shows his talents as a young boy who cries wolf and then pays for it, big-time.The first 40 minutes of this film deals with that "wolf" angle. It goes a bit too long and begins to drag the story down a bit, but stay with it. Once the killers come looking for the boy (Driscoll), the film suddenly becomes extremely tense. In fact, the tension is so strong the last 30 minutes that there are scenes you almost can't bear to watch.Story-wise, there are some credibility questions, mainly "Why would good parents - as portrayed here by Barbara Hale and Arthur Kennedy - leave their 10-year-old all alone all night?" But, ignoring that, the film is entertaining and has a good ending, so I have no complaints.Driscoll does a fine job of acting, as mentioned, and Hale became famous for being Perry Mason's secretary on television. Kennedy is always interesting no matter what film he is in, and Paul Stewart is effective as the villain.As of this writing, the VHS tape is out-of-print, and there is no DVD available yet, sad to say. Hopefully, that oversight will be corrected soon. This film is a valuable part of anyone's film noir collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ten-year-old with an overactive imagination is subjected to a night of real big city terror in 1949.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Window" is a rich and underrated tale of urban terror from a ten-year-old's perspective. Tommy Woodry is jolted from his innocent world of make believe games when he witnesses a murder in the middle of the night. Making the terror all the worse is that the murderers are his upstairs neighbors, the Kellertons, and neither the police nor his parents will believe his story. The terror grows darker when Tommy's only protection, his parents, leave for the night because of shift work and family illness. The music and lighting brilliantly reflect the evil that begins with nightfall and the removal of his parents. When the Kellertons kidnap Tommy, even pretending to be his parents to fool the police, bad "parents" replace the good ones. "The Window", in a way, is the opposite of the classic "These Three" of thirteen years earlier. In the latter, the lies of a young girl (Bonita Granville) regarding adult wrongdoing are believed without reservation, with swift and devastating consequences. "The Window" also nicely showcases the hard life of the working class in 1949: the only telephone is at the drug store and the apartments are cramped and dilapidated with no modern appliances. Paul Stewart, as Joe Kellerton, plays his villainous role with a cool, almost smug arrogance, while Bobby Driscoll, as Tommy, expertly handles the role of an innocent child drawn into the gritty ugliness of urban violence. The movie maintains a fast pace, with total suspense all the way to the nail-biting end, and every second of it is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crying Wolf has never been so deadly...or as entertaining!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this film noir is listed as unavailable on DVD, I took a chance and purchased a "collector's" DVD copy on ebay, something I didn't condone until I realized that some of these old films will never be released and only exist as public domain property in 16mm prints. That being said, I watched "The Window" on an unlabeled DVD-R copy and was very impressed with the quality of both the audio and video. I've purchased other "legit" releases only to find the packaging far superior in quality to the program. "The Window" features a very plausible plot set in a run down urban neighborhood full of tenements and condemned buildings. A nine-year old boy with a vivid imagination and a reputation for telling tall tales, witnesses a murder by his upstairs neighbors while sleeping on the fire escape one sweltering summer night. After going to his dismissing parents, then to the police without their consent, he is sent on his way into a nightmarish experience. The suspenseful sequences are masterfully paced, and there really isn't a slow moment in the film. I would definitely buy this film if, one day, it's released in commercial packaging. Tense, taut and brilliantly done on the obviously low budget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neglected noir...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First saw this nail-biter when I was a kid. It still holds up. Based on a Cornell Woolrich story (as was REAR WINDOW), this one boasts some of the most stunning cinematography I've ever seen. Director Tetzlaff, himself a cinematographer of considerable skill (he shot Alfred Hitchcock's NOTORIOUS), milks this one for all it's worth. Bobby Driscoll (the kid underground comix artist Robert Crumb reveals his brother fell in love with in the documentary CRUMB) never once wavers under the camera's close scrutiny: his must be one of the greatest performances EVER by a kid in a feature film. In fact, it's his performance that carries the film. Paul Stewart is as creepy as they come; his performance, as good as it is, perfectly compliments the low-key desperation of young Driscoll. Absolutely must-see moviemaking.</fullReview>

I sat on the edge of my seat, glued to the screen as every second of suspense ticked away. A masterpiece to rival even the best of the great Hitchcock Thrillers!

		<fullReview>Late-night tv sometimes throws up some high quality gems. The Window is one of them. And before you go saying ''aww! but this movie is old and in b&amp;w, i bet it's awful!" STOP. Take a step back. This movie is excellent.9 year old Tommy Woodry (Bobby Driscoll) is a lying little git. Always telling lies and making up stories. It's gotten to the point where no-one believes a word he says anymore, not even his own parents.Tommy's world is about to come crashing down around him after he is witness to a murder in the apartment above his one night. The problem is, Tommy knows the truth, no-one believe's him and to make matters worse the Kellerton family upstairs (the murderer's) find out that Tommy knows what happened and want him silenced.I swear to god, this movie was so harsh. Harsh in the sense that for a movie thats well over 50 years old now - taken in it's original form without modern day conception - this is one violent movie. One guy gets beaten to near death then is finished off getting stabbed to death with a pair of scissors in front of a kid. The Kellerton's kidnap Tommy and in one scene Joe Kellerton (Paul Stewart) punches the little boy in the face about three times then drugs him with chlorophyl!! Another point to add, this movie is actually banned in Finland! This movie must have genuinely shocked it's original audience when it was first shown back in 1949.This is a dark movie; very eerie and some scenes mount incredible depths of tension. The acting is superb and the camerawork doubly so.If your a true movie fan and are happy to watch any movie no matter the age, you'll love this. It's a real treat and i'm glad i caught this one on tv. Special mention goes out to fellow IMDB user Bob The Moo, who supplied me with a VHS edition! Now to track down the DVD...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claustrophobic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The claustrophobic cinematography makes this film. You feel cramped and trapped as does our young hero. The tenements are lit just enough for you to imaging all sorts of horrors within. The ending was evidently rushed and a bit hokey; the director et al. could have fleshed it out a bit moreThis is a very real film, in that we all know children who 'fabricate' as easily as they breath. Bobby Driscoll was superb. I've never seen his Disney work -- now I'll keep my eye out for his name.I loved seeing a younger Arthur Kennedy (before he played only drunks) and a plain but always pretty Barbara Hale (pre-Perry Mason). Both were excellent and demonstrated a range I never gave them credit for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While 1949s "The Window" may not be a noir classic many have heard about I strongly recommend seeing it if you can find it. (It is occasionally on TCM, but it is not currently available on DVD or VHS.)The film stars child protege Bobby Driscoll ("Song's of the South" "Peter Pan") as a young boy who is living the Aesopian nightmare of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf." His parents are portrayed the ever capable Arthur Kennedy ("Champion" "High Sierra") and Barbara Hale ("Perry Mason.") After the boy witnesses a murder his parents and the foolish police department refuse to beleive him until it is almost too late.The murderers are also well-played by veterans Paul Stewart and Ruth Roman (who also were in 1949s "Champion" with Arthur Kennedy and Kirk Douglas.) The husband and wife would have gotten away with murder if at not been for the young boy, . The ensuing chase and scary finale are very well done. The police in this movie were so ignorant you would wonder if they did not inspire the moron cop, Officer Barbrady on "South Park."This fine film was actually considered to be a throwaway "B" movie. It turned out to be quite popular even though it only runs for 73 minutes. The young actor, Bobby Driscoll received a special Oscar for his work in 1949 but soon found his acting career drying up as he aged and his life ended tragically from drug related issues in 1968 at the age of 31.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neo-Realism Meets Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little boy learns the value of truth-telling in white-knuckle, claustrophobic fashion? a memorably done movie in all departments. No need to dwell here on the consensus strong points.Seeing this taut little thriller in a small western town when I was 10 not only scared the heck out of me, but influenced my perception of urban life for years to come. Seeing the film again 60 years later, I'm impressed with producer Dore Schary's insistence on the grimness of the tenements, at least by later suburban standards. There's no attempt to glamorize or even varnish the family's dingy, cramped flat. Whether on NY location or on an RKO sound stage, the lighting remains dark and oppressive. Of course, that not only heightens the noirish atmosphere, but also lends an uncommon degree of realism to the family's working- class environment. After all, Dad works the nightshift, while Mom helps with the extended family, leaving little Tommy home alone. And that, I believe, amounts to more than just a handy plot device. And get a load of the on-location ruins where the kids play at the beginning?looks like something out of post-war Europe. No wonder MGM went after Schary in an effort to become more socially relevant in post-Andy Hardy America. There may be a lot of Hollywood in the melodrama itself, but the look and feel is definitely not Hollywood of the time. What a fine little film that's still edge-of-the-seat excitement. And, if I recall correctly, I was an especially good little boy for a long time afterward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boy Who Cried "Murder!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the fall of the career of Bobby Driscoll sort of puts a downer effect on all of his films. In the late 1940s and early 1950s Driscoll had a remarkably effective movie career, including the starring role in this classic film noir and roles in TREASURE ISLAND and LONG JOHN SILVER with Robert Newton, and the voice of PETER PAN in the Disney cartoon. His drug addiction and lonely death were a tragic waste of a talented actor.THE WINDOW is one of those unexpected classic films that were made without vast publicity campaigns or expense, with a simple and good cast involved, and a good script. It also has a classic pedigree, going back to the fables of Aesop. It is a variant on the story of the boy that cried wolf.Driscoll plays a lively little boy with a vivid imagination. His parents (Arthur Kennedy and Barbara Hale) are living in a lower class - working class district in a city. Kennedy has a job that takes him out of the house at night. In fact, this is a film that clings to the night.Driscoll happens to tell a whopper of a lie, and it blows up in his face because it embarrasses his parents. So his reputation for telling the truth has been compromised. While sleeping on the fire estate of his home at night, he faces the apartment of Paul Stewart and his wife Ruth Roman. Stewart has a business associate over at his apartment, gets into a quarrel, and kills the associate. Unfortunately, Driscoll sees this - but equally unfortunate Stewart sees that Driscoll witnessed it. So follows a long, involved cat and mouse game, with Stewart covering up traces of the murder (with Roman's assistance), and at the same time doing everything he can to dismiss Driscoll's claims of the murder as just his silly over-imagination again. As Kennedy and Hale are half-inclined to believe this, they too refuse to listen to Driscoll's arguments. But Stewart is also aware that at some point, somebody might just decide to double check Driscoll's stories, especially if he remains so insistent that he is not lying. So Stewart has to find the right moment to grab this annoying kid, and get rid of the only witness.There are problems though. Driscoll's youth also means he is more energetic and physically adept than Stewart. Also, although Roman is helping her husband she is not really keen about killing a little boy. Finally there is also the fact that, although they strongly doubt Driscoll's story, Kennedy and Hale love their son, and think he's a troubled little boy. Soon Kennedy's actions are gumming up Stewart's planning as well.Besides Driscoll's performance, Stewart gave one of his best villains in the film, being plausible on the surface, but as deadly in intentions as they come. Kennedy's father is a hard working man, struggling for a better life for his family, and tired of his son's tall tales. But at the right moment he does start wondering if he's been just too complacent about his son's "lying".The conclusion is a tense and exciting fight between Stewart and Driscoll in a deserted building. It is a first rate conclusion to this fascinating and scary film which makes us wonder how seriously do we ever take our kids, and in what ways do we show it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A belter of a B noir out of RKO. Story plays as a variant to the boy who cried wolf legend and finds young Bobby Driscoll as Tommy, a boy prone to telling tall tales. So when one night he spies upstairs neighbours murdering a man, nobody believes him...The build up to the crime is considered, we are privy to Tommy's home life in a cramped New York tenement, his parents loyal and hard working and they have plenty of love for their fanciful son.Once the crime is committed, a shocking incident compounded by the fact it's perpetrated by a normal looking male and female couple, a destitute pairing prepared to do the unthinkable just for cash, then things get real tense and the thrills begin to roll.Tommy is now under threat from the killers and he needs to be silenced, so as the cramp confines of the hot and sweaty tenement area are vividly brought to life via noir visuals, Ted Tetzlaff (director) and his cinematographers (Robert De Grasse &amp; William O. Steiner) excelling, the paranoia and tension builds to the point that the gripping finale acts as a merciful release.Very well performed by a cast that also includes Paul Stewart, Ruth Roman, Arthur Kennedy and Barabara Hale, this late 1940s noir is highly recommended. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE WINDOW (Ted Tetzlaff, 1949) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic noir about a boy&#x2019;s lying ways catching up with him has lost some of the edge it once possessed with the years (due to its low-key nature, but also a plethora of imitations); however, it remains a satisfying and very well-made &#x2018;B&#x2019; movie &#x2013; despite the simplistic attitudes displayed by some of the characters involved.Bobby Driscoll is impressive in the leading role, and deservedly won a Special Oscar for his performance; his parents, then, are played by Barbara Hale and Arthur Kennedy. The boy witnesses a murder from the fire-escape of his tenement building one night, but nobody believes him&#x2026;except that the couple responsible (Paul Stewart and Ruth Roman, who are both excellent here) can&#x2019;t take any chances and decide to silence him for good! As I said, some of the situations defy credibility &#x2013; though one has to take into account the fact that it was made in more innocent times: okay, so the boy tends to allow his imagination to get the better of him&#x2026;but his parents&#x2019; blind trust in their neighbors, the Police&#x2019;s apparent unwillingness to act, or the mere notion that people living in an apartment building would own a passkey seems a bit much! With this in mind, the second half makes amends with a number of solid suspense touches (often tinged with irony) &#x2013; such as the incident when a letter arrives necessitating Hale&#x2019;s absence from the house, which would leave Driscoll all alone (since Kennedy works nights): the boy believes it to have been sent expressly by the villains, but it turns out to be genuine. Similarly, at his wits&#x2019; end, the boy decides to run away but soon after hears a key turning in the lock of their front door &#x2013; fully expecting Stewart to appear, the caller emerges to be his own father who was worried about the boy and has come home to literally bar Driscoll inside his room!; then, when the neighbor really does show up, he even helps him (unbeknownst to the boy) to come out of confinement&#x2026;so that he can deal with him! After a near-escape for the villains when Driscoll causes a commotion in a cab with a police officer looking on, the plot resolves itself in a hair-raising chase inside a condemned building (where the murderous couple had previously conveniently hidden the body).To be honest, I prefer the fatalistic and denser approach to the genre &#x2013; but this nevertheless is given a real shot in the arm by its remarkable New York locations (having been a cinematographer, director Tetzlaff displays an enviable eye for detail throughout)&#x2026;not to mention the fact that its depiction of life-threatening goings-on behind closed doors resonated with me personally due to a recent tragedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film for the first time on BBC at 2 this morning and was very impressed. Some very fine acting by all the cast and and a good believable, terrifying story. Hollywood should have a good look at these old RKO movies and see how superior they are to the rubbish that is being dished out today. Bobby Driscol played an excellent role as the young boy and it was nice to see Arther Kennedy play a good guy. The black and white photography added to the suspense. Of course in latter years, there have been similar stories filmed, for example, Eye Witness with Mark Lester and Susan George and Witness with Harrison Ford. All very good in their own right. A must for fans of a good old fashioned thriller. Kevin Thomas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Window (1949)A totally classic film noir, fairly low budget, and unique for having a child at the middle of the story. The darkness of the mood and darkness of the filming combine to counterpoint the apparent cheer of this boy in New York City, creating something just short of a masterpiece. Perfect? I wish! But the best of it will blow your noir mind.The whole adventure here happens in an apartment building, one of those brick 5-story walk-ups with fire escapes on the outside. A boy, sleeping on the escape because of the heat, witnesses a murder. He tells his parents, who don't believe him (the movie opens with a summation of the Boy Who Cried Wolf). But of course, the murderer's believe him, and the boy is in danger.You might find this all a contrivance?and I guess it is, in a way, a plot too tight and compact for real life?but it works to create genuine suspense. The characters are all very realistic, from the nice, regular parents who want their kid to start telling the truth to the bad couple upstairs who seem on the surface to be rather like the parents. Even the cops are just regular schmoes. The dark stairway, the window nailed shut, the chases through an abandoned building next door (set up by the opening of the movie with a bunch of kids using it for play), and endless futile persuasion by the boy, who obviously means what he says all add up to for compact, intense ride. And filmed with energy and such dark shadows you can't see a thing. Director Ted Tetzlaff is more known as a cinematographer (including on his last film, "Notorious," which is a masterpiece). As a director this is probably his best film, and he knows how to make the cinematographers under him give him the visual richness the film in its simplicity requires. The plot carries the ideas, for sure, but the visuals carry the mood and intensity, and that's the best of it. And there's not a wasted minute?it's practically a textbook exercise in how to direct with economy, and the benefits of doing so.See it. The title doesn't inspire much?it should be called "Murder in the Window" or something more compelling?but the movie does indeed inspire much. See why. Oh, and a really clean copy is streamable from Warner Archive, which even has a free two week trial.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Off Kilter Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about this little film is the claustrophobic NYC tenement landscape that is realistic and an unfiltered urban underworld of dilapidated brick and wood with rooftops and fire escapes, collapsing beams and decay. The next best thing is the child star and the supporting cast delivering somber characterizations with a modicum of hope (the struggling parents) and desperate despair (the neighbors upstairs).A movie that puts you in a noir environment of shadows and heat. Oppressive and ominous the tone is that of a closeted existence and an overwhelming sense of suspense. It is quite a contrast to the upbeat suburban surroundings that would dominate the affluent air of the 1950's materialism.One doubts that you could have set this in a barbecuing back yard with cars in the driveway and kitchens full of appliances and maintained the fear and frustration that operates in this bleak B-Movie. It was Film Noir that dared dramatize the "other side" of post war America and this is one of the last great ones to have the courage to show the flip side of the dream, that for some people was still a nightmare. It is not surprising that the bad dream solution was utilized to explain what the little boy really witnessed.An off kilter thriller that is taut, tantalizing, and terrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a masterpiece. It's one of the best movies of all times. It might be very old and in black and white, but I don't care and that fact doesn't bother me at all - it makes perfect sense, considering the generation it is from. It's an excellent piece of cinema, appreciate it for what it is without thinking about its age. Plus, a movie in black and white is an art form, no matter how "primitive" it might be. Many times the most simple things are the best and this very interesting motion picture is a very good example of this.This film is simple yet masterfully done. The plot is simple, easy to understand yet unpredictable and there isn't a single boring moment. The movie is visually simple yet visually fascinating at the same time. It's a suspense noir film, carefully made even in details. The pace is simply perfect. They don't make movies of this quality anymore.This is a RKO Pictures's production. All actors are great in their roles, but Bobby Driscoll steals the show. He is simply superb. In fact, Driscoll's extraordinary performance as Tommy Woodry earned him a well deserved special Academy Award as the outstanding juvenile actor.Bobby Driscoll does incredible things in this film. He climbs up the building's fire escape, runs entire floors (up and down), runs in New York streets... all stuff that require not only agility but also good physical shape. Plus, the character he portrays is the perfect example of someone who is being sincere but nobody believes because of his habit of making up fantasious stories (although he doesn't do for bad). His eyes are very expressive, as well as his expressions. Bobby Driscoll's cuteness and charm matches the character he portrays: a lively, nice and adorable kid. We really feel bad for his character. He knows the truth about the homicide he witnessed (commited by the Kellersons, his upstairs neighbors) and desperately tries to make people believe and no one does, not even the police. To make matters worse, the poor kid is accused of being a liar and even forced to apologize the murderers, locked and left all alone at home (despite begging many times not to be left alone), punished, every time he tries to do something things only get worse for him and ends up at the mercy of the killers. All of this makes his good parents seem almost as evil as the Kellersons. As for the police, it surprises me how incompetent and ignorant they are. In fact, the movie is very tense, dark, thrilling, intense and creepy. It's a fascinating movie experience. There are some terrifying moments combined with small but significant details that makes them deliciously more sinister.A particularly frightening moment is when the criminals take Tommy in a taxicab and the kid screams in despair to the taxidriver (who doesn't hear and is unaware of what's going on) and to a police officer (who is fooled by the murderers - they pretend to be Tommy's parents and make the policeman believe that the kid is paranoid). And then the Kellersons punch him in the face and put him to sleep with chloroform... and their cruel intentions after that. The final minutes are also extremely tense and a producer of nerves. The movie is quite short. The only repair it'd deserve is a wee bit larger ending and not so rushed as it is. But that is just a minor detail, the movie is perfect the way it is and takes many elements from Alfred Hitchcock's work. And I love the look of NY in the 40's and all those details showing the city's daily life, such as the Subway trains. The music of the film is marvelous, perfect for it. Bobby Driscoll is so amazing in this film that it makes me feel even more sorry for the disgrace his life became later. It's stupid that he was fired just because of acne and just because he reached the curse of growing up. His film career ended way too soon, in a time when he was so young and talented and still had so much to give. Plus, he did so much for Disney that he didn't deserve to be treated this way.This should definitely be on Top 250.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunday June 11, 4:00pm The Egyptian'The Window', written by Noir master Cornell Woolrich, takes place in the sweltering heat of a New York summer. When Tommy Woodry (Bobby Driscoll) witnesses the brutal murder of a man by his upstairs neighbors as he tries to sleep on their fire escape, no one will believe him. Tommy has a long history of telling tall tales. " Stories? What kind of stories?" His parents Mary (Barbara Hale) and Ed (Arthur Kennedy) punish him for lying but he runs away to tell the police who also discount his story. When his murderous neighbors get wind, things take a frightening turn. Sensational camera work by Robert De Grasse makes brilliant use of the dark, forbidding stairwells and unseen corners of the apartment building and nearby derelicts to create a delightfully sinister mood. One scene in which Tommy's mother forces him to apologize to the killers for lying is particularly frightening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film, i watched it by chance late at night and had never seen anything like it. The small boy is brilliant and the enclosed community where it is set is brilliant and creepy. It was one of those films where you don't want to blink as it is truly unpredictable, the most gripping film i have ever seen and incredibly scary. The film is only about an hour long and this adds to the tension, scenes are not prolonged and suspicion and fear are created with a fast pace, and an urgency and despair of the boy. This is a film worth watching as it is different from the big budget, special effects thrillers. it creates fear through the intensity of the boy and his parents fear of his sanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this little psychological thriller apparently didn't impress then new RKO boss Howard Hughes, who shelved it, the public took it to heart when released 2 years later.And for good reason: this noir piece managed to stir up quite a bit of steam during its brief running time. Thanks to talented child actor Bobby Driscoll, "The Window" becomes an engrossing yarn.With Arthur Kennedy, Paul Stewart, Ruth Roman and Barbara Hale lending their strong supports, there's a good suspense tale that unfolds.If screenwriter Cornell Woolrich had embellished Mel Dinelli's original story to lend more verbal substance to support the physical action, especially toward the end, it might have been even better.As it is, it turned into a kind of standard chase thing that we've all seen before. Thus the film earns a "Good" rating. Young Driscoll delivers a solid performance that carries the film convincingly, and well earned his Juvenille "Oscar."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only problem is there is no mystery in the film. I recently discovered that "The Window" was filmed in New York City in November 1948 when Bobby Driscoll was 10. In the spring of 1948, billionaire Howard Hughes bought RKO Studios. His first action was to fire Studio Head Dore Schary because he was a Hollywood liberal. Schary went to MGM where he succeeded Louis B. Mayer. He enjoyed great success there. His second decision was to shelve "The Window" for being worthless garbage. It had been one of Dore Schary's pet projects. The movie sat on the shelf for nearly two years, finally when the studio was short of films to release, Howard Hughes was talked into releasing "The Window". Instead it became the surprise hit of the year. A B movie, which was supposed to make back expenses and a small profit became a huge top ten hit and RKO's #1 movie of the year. And all the credit went to Bobby Driscoll. His terrifying portrayal of "Tommy Woodry" was one of them most intense ever caught on film: he went on to win an Oscar at the Academy Awards Ceremony at The Pantages Theatre(generously donated for the occasion by Howard Hughes, after the Shrine Auditorium proved to small). Bobby was very convincing as the boy who witnesses a murder but can't get anyone to believe him....except the murderers. Bobby's character is viewed as a teller of tall tales because of his vivid imagination. Tthe one time he tells the unvarnished truth, he is seen as a liar, it that isn't irony, then irony doesn't exist. Cornell Woolrich, the great film noir novelist based the story on "The Boy Who Cried Wolf". Nobody, much less one ten-year-old boy, has ever been more alone than Bobby Driscoll's "Tommy Woodry". More a psychological terror than mystery, "The Window" is as intense a movie as has ever come out of Hollywood. By using a ten-year-old boy's point of view, when that boy is also the object of the murderer's mechanations, Ted Tetzlaff, the film's director, has let his audience into one boy's nightmare. It works brilliantly...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid B-movie, predictable but enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Woodry family live on a housing tenement made up of several blocks. Their son, Tommy, has a habit of telling wild stories he has made up and his parents can't seem to break his habit. One very hot night Tommy sleeps on the fire escape to try and cool down but hears noises from the apartment above and looks in their window. He sees Mr and Mrs Kellerton kill a man and dump his body. Tommy tells his parents but they don't believe him but when he tells the police the Kellerton's realise they must kill Tommy before he can tell anyone else.I taped this film solely because I wanted to see Barbara Hale before she became Perry Mason's secretary Della Street. I knew nothing of the plot but the opening title card telling the story of the boy who cried wolf basically told me everything. Basically you know what's going to happen and you can guess the outline of the ending from the first few scenes. However that didn't seem to matter to me. The film is short and manages to move along at a nice speed without dragging.The director has done a good job with the lighting etc and the dark streets and corridors all add to the feeling of tension. The black and white was a real nice brown hint to the version I saw and worked a treat in some key scenes. The finale is pretty good even if it holds no real surprises.It's nice to see Kennedy as a younger man rather than the roles I know him from. Likewise Hale is good in a role unlike her minor turns as Della Street. She looks so very different but when she talks you know instantly who it is. Driscoll is good with some issues. I didn't like his wide-eyed all American boy role, but then that WAS his role! Plus this was the 1950's where that's what child actors did (they still turn out the wide eyed stuff now a bit too often). His range is good even if his `gee shucks mom' performance is grating.Overall this has no shocks and is pretty predictable. However it is quite well paced and the director manages a good sense of tension and atmosphere in the dark tenement block. A little more plot and explanation would have helped but overall I enjoyed this for the 70 odd minutes it was on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie once, 50 years ago, as a 6-year old in Miami, Florida. It terrified me then and images have stayed with me all this while. It has a great plot--accidental witness to a murder with isolation of the witness (here, because he's a kid) putting him peril. I've wondered whether Hitchcock saw this and adapted the concept for Rear Window. I'd forgotten the name of "The Window" and found it by searching on the term "fire escape"--this archive is quite powerful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be a small movie, but it offers a lot during its less than 75 minutes length. This is truly one of the finest films ever.This preciousness of cinema deals with the old thematic that we mustn't lie, otherwise we may be telling the truth one day and nobody will believe us. That's precisely what happens to our Tommy Woodry, a very cute and harmless child with the habit of crying wolf (perhaps because he feels lonely and bored?). There's no denying that Tommy is smart and has a very big imagination: the story that he's gonna buy himself a horse, that he's gonna move to a ranch out west but not before shooting indians. Tommy's tall tales always put a grin on my face.Tommy's lies take his parents to despair. When he witnesses the Kellersons committing a crime, he can't manage to get anyone to believe him. No matter how hard he tries, he can't change his parents's minds. Even the police refuses to believe him.Although it's understandable that his parents won't believe him, they take such drastic measures on him that they fail miserably to protect him. As for the police, not only they seem unwilling to help him but they even go as far as playing in a situation when he is at the criminals's hands, also failing miserably to protect him. All of this makes you completely hate the police and almost loathe Tommy's parents. Tommy lives this urban nightmare all alone and cannot count on anyone to help him but himself.Even so, there is nothing I would really change in this movie in any way, except for a slightly longer length and perhaps a little more "action". Nevertheless, it's simply flawless. The plot is excellent, the characters are believable, all the actors are superb, the music is dramatic and adds emotion, the 1940's NYC scenario is amazing, the film is very tense and feels "hitchcockian" and the English is spoken calmly - calm enough to understand most of it, which means the lack of subtitles isn't much of a problem for anyone who knows and understands some English. The pace is always brilliant, both when the movie is more calm and when it is frightening, intense and suspenseful.A very interesting and fascinating movie. And to think that RKO boss Howard Hughes didn't want to give it a chance at first! We would have lost this pearl of cinema...Bobby Driscoll is fantastic as Tommy Woodry. Although he was a Disney actor, he was "loaned" to RKO Pictures for this timeless classic. A very clever decision, he was a wonderful actor. I hope he's not just remembered for his work at Disney but also for this noir classic.Title in Portugal: 'O Que Viram os Meus Olhos'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now here is a great little film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been wanting to watch this for a couple years now, but since it is unavailable on DVD or VHS, it was impossible. Thank goodness for Turner Class Movies! The story is simple. A little boy has a bad habit of making up wild stories to impress his friends and family. When he's sleeping out on his fire escape one sweltering summer night, he witnesses his upstairs neighbors murder a man. When he tells his mother and father, not surprisingly, they think he's making it all up or that he's had a bad dream. When the killers upstairs get wind that the little boy knows about their crime, the decide to kill him. So it's up to the boy to prove he's not lying and evade the killers.'The Window' has many things in common with the much better known 'Rear Window.' For one thing, they're both based off of short stories written by Cornell Woolrich. Themes of voyeurism, murder, urban paranoia, and being trapped and defenseless dominate both films. 'Rear Window' is clearly the better film all around, but 'The Window' deserves to be released on DVD so it can be rediscovered and celebrated for the tight, compelling, suspenseful noir classic that it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, Crisp Thriller -- Best You'll Ever See -- or Not See.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WINDOW does everything right, from the solid direction, to the outstanding production design, on-location sets, cinematography --- and wonderful acting particularly by Bobby Driscoll. It takes you inside the New York tenements like no other picture except maybe Angels With Dirty Faces. The filmmakers have a perfect grasp on the actions of children --- what they'll do and what they won't. The musical score is restrained like you'll never see today, nor will you anymore see a movie end after 72 minutes simply because the story's over.This was working class New York 15 years before the corruption of drugs brought an era of unrestrained crime, strikes, garbage, and the exit of 1 million of its population -- mostly the middle class. For 30 years from 1960 to 1990 New Yorkers lived their lives not only in fear but knowing their lives tomorrow would be worse than today.They didn't know this in 1949, but you need to know it to understand that tenement apartments were locked only with 10 cent skeleton keys, windows were open, and people didn't fear their neighbors (as only a few were murderers). In 1949 most well healed middle class people didn't have a window-fan --- let alone air conditioning. It was HOT in the summer. Sleeping on the fire escape -- as Bobby Driscoll does in this story -- was not unusual. There was no fear in 1949 of child molesters, as any such person would be torn to shreds by the neighborhood. The local-color of New York was 100% on target in this film.I was 11 years old the last time I saw THE WINDOW. Since VHS, it's been on my Most Wanted list for years. Never on eBay, I finally found a rare VHS for rent today. The film greatly exceeds my memory of it. I rated it a "10" and would like to explain this is an old fashioned work-hard-for-it "10." These days every parent I know has an honor student for a child. All it takes for an A is having a pulse. Similarly, any current movie regardless of quality will get a few thousand 10's. Pictures like VACANCY are both scary and entertaining, but they cheat to create the thrills. THE WINDOW relies on a plausible story, and that's the virtue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would Make Hitchcock Proud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was impressed with this film. It's quite a well made little movie for its type: well scripted and directed, and especially well acted. Child star Bobby Driscoll plays a little boy living in a New York City apartment building during a sweltering summer, who sees his upstairs neighbors murder someone. He can't get anyone to believe him, because he's become notorious for making up stories. But the killers find out that he knows something, and they come after him.The actors that play Driscoll's parents are very good, especially Arthur Kennedy, that old pro of a character actor, who makes the working class Joe he's playing here utterly believable. You'll recognize Paul Stewart, the male half of the murdering couple, as the crime boss with a pool in Robert Aldrich's "Kiss Me Deadly." And I should also mention Bobby Driscoll, who does not play his role in the precocious, cloying 40's child star manner you might suspect, but instead is able to come across as a normal every-day little boy.The plot's not complicated, but nevertheless the script writers take pains to make sure that there's a logical motivation behind every action, and you don't have to suspend disbelief while watching this film as you do with virtually every other crime thriller drama from this time period. And the movie does a great job at tapping into that feeling all children at some point experience of being all alone in their own home, when everything suddenly seems stranger and more sinister without the protective presence of their parents.A fine no-nonsense film from the last days of the 40's and well worth tracking down.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tenements of New York City come to life in this tense film noir where the protagonist is an adolescent who starts off as the antagonist. Pre-teen Bobby Driscoll makes up stories with the frequency of a gossip columnist, usually involving his innocent neighbors. This gets his parents (Barbara Hale and Arthur Kennedy) in trouble, and they wonder how to handle his tall tales. It goes from bad to worse on a hot summer night when Driscoll climbs up to the top of the fire escape where he witnesses the married couple on the top floor having an argument with the stranger, and the husband stabbing the man to death. Stunned by viewing this, Driscoll rushes to tell his parents who of course do not believe him. After running to the police to tell him of what he witnessed, Driscoll is forced by his mother to apologize to the killer's wife and he becomes paranoid that the neighbors will target him next. When he is left alone by his working father while his mother is tending a sick relative, Driscoll's worst nightmare comes true when real danger shows its ugly face.The dark set of the slums take on a look of character (and almost becomes a character itself) as Driscoll tries to save himself, and the photographer and editor work overtime to create a tension that is often frightening and seldom surpassed by other similarly filmed stories. Children rarely get the focus in such a tale, and of course, the psychological ramifications of why he lies in the first place is dealt with, and how his parent's daily distractions make him feel neglected. This is a "sleeper" of film noir greatness, an extremely short motion picture that shows good things come in small packages and that frequently, less is often more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Window (1949) Director: Ted Tetzlaff (Notorious (director of photography) Writers: Mel Dinelli (screenplay), Cornell Woolrich (based on his story "The Boy Cried Murder") Cinematography by Robert De Grasse &amp; William O. Steiner. Stars: Bobby Driscoll, Ruth Roman, Barbara Hale, Arthur Kennedy, and Paul Stewart. A unique Noir Thriller. A Family Noir. A Kid's Noir. But not just any kid, the kid who was a denizen of an decaying urban rat warren in a city that was constantly regenerating. A city before the Manhattan el's were torn down, before TV, before air-conditioning, where clothes were dried on clothes lines, where playgrounds were winding back alleys, tar beach roof tops, jungle jim fire escapes, and condemned buildings that became, clubhouses, forts or whatever you may imagine. The real habitats of urban man circa 1948, apartment - street, hall - alley, sidewalk - pavement, steel - earth, inside - outside, light - dark. What really hits home with this film is its realistic telling of the tale from Tommy's POV (Bobby Driscoll). Any viewer with an urban background will find some touchstones to his own childhood or to the childhood stories of his parents. I still remember trying to sleep on hot, humid summer nights, in a second story apartment, where, thanks to a corner bedroom and two open windows any slight cross breeze brought relief. But it also provided the city lullabies of traffic, distant and near, the rattle of the Connecting RR winding off the Hell Gate Bridge, the faint roar of the sunken Grand Central. Nature provided the rustle of a sycamore from a breeze or the patter of rain on it's leaves. My best friend who lived in a bigger apartment house actually did sleep out on the fire escape to cool off with an el down the block. The film begins brilliantly with one of Tommy's fantasies instantly drawing us in to his world. We see a condemned building, we see black window, lying face down, we see Tommy. He awakens looking somewhat in pain, clutching his chest. A child in distress. Crawling forward he grabs a cap gun and we are brought to reality. Tommy is fantasizing, playing/acting out, a "shot" cowboy crawling in a hayloft to the hay-door from where he spots the "gang" playing cards. He shoots and his older buddies ignore him, a new game has replaced the one Tommy was still playing, and a fire truck siren from the street trumps even that. As Tommy makes his way to his street urchin buddies we follow the relatively benign, maze like, cinematic urban landscape that duplicates in reverse a final reckoning that, taking place in the dead of night, turns it all very noir-ish and frightening, murderous silhouettes on window shades, illumination stabbed by slanting shadows. The city, especially in this film, is given equal billing. William O. Steiner (cinematography) a native New Yorker along with two of the three assistant directors, informs the visual compositions with a loving and knowing familiarity. Interiors (studio probably) Art Direction by Italian born Sam Corso, native New Yorker Albert S. D'Agostino and Kansian Walter E. Keller looks flawless. All performances are top notch. Bobby Driscoll was incredibly talented. He's thoroughly believable as Tommy. All his interactions and reactions with his peers, with his parents especially his father Ed (Arthur Kennedy), with his neighbors, and with the police, as he tries to convince them that he's telling the truth ring clear. Barbara Hale and Arthur Kennedy are excellent as Tommy's doubting parents ratcheting up the tension/horror level every time they attempt to reason with or placate Tommy's accusations with the kind of statements most parents faced with the same situation would make. They even make Tommy confront the upstairs neighbors the Kellerson's. Joe Kellerson and Jean Kellerson are one of the most despicable couples in noir. Their grift is for looker Jean (Ruth Roman) to lure single men to their apartment, probably for sex, where she slips them knockout drops, Joe (Paul Stewart) then rolls them for their doe and dumps them in an alley. On a hot &amp; humid night Tommy can't sleep, he wakes his mother Mary Woodry, (Barbara Hale) and asks if he can sleep out on the fire escape where it would be cooler, she says sure but be careful. Laying out in the sweltering evening with his pillow Tommy sees the towels hanging from the Kellerson's clothesline billow in a breeze, a breeze that doesn't reach down enough to give Tommy relief, so like any resourceful kid, Tommy grabs his pillow and climbs up to the Kellerson's landing to fall asleep there. He's awakened both by a shaft of light spilling across his face from the space between the bottom of a pull shade and the window sill, and the sounds of a grift going murderously wrong. Its a beautifully filmed sequence where the action is obscured, partially silhouetted by the shade and vividly focused through the slot. Though I've never read the Cornell Woolrich short story I have read that the story is even gorier. Lots of great sequences, watch for the police station cat. The original music score by Roy Webb even includes a leitmotif for Tommy. Great New York Noir 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young Bobby Driscoll (Tommy) makes up stories to his friends and to his parents. One night, he sleeps on the fire escape outside the apartment of Paul Stewart (Mr Kellerson) and Ruth Roman (Mrs Kellerson) where he witnesses them commit a murder. When he tells his parents Arthur Kennedy and Barbara Hale about it, they dismiss him. In fact, they punish him. Even the police don't believe him when he reports the murder to them. Poor kid. No-one believes him. It's not long before Paul Stewart and Ruth Roman find out that he knows something and set a plan in motion to silence him.There are many tense scenes as Driscoll faces his nightmare all alone. The audience shares his fear as the killers have him next on their list. The acting is realistic as is the dialogue. The film also has eerie sections (eg, Ruth Roman outside Driscoll's window with a torch as he hides in his locked room) and dramatic moments (eg, when the killers kidnap Driscoll and put him in the back of a cab and they encounter a policeman). The strategy that Paul Stewart and Ruth Roman use to shut him up during the cab ride is genius. It's very funny and demonstrates perfect teamwork.Children are usually annoying in films. Not here. A dramatic ending in a disused apartment block adds to the tension. Worth watching again. The way the movie is filmed and the location all add to the experience of a film that is actually quite scary in parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on William Irish's (aka Cornell Woolrich) remarkable short story " fire escape" ,this is some kind of "rear window" seen through a child's eye ;everybody knows that Woolrich also wrote the novel which provides Hitchcock with one of his best screenplays (and movie).With a much more modest budget,without very big stars (Arthur Kennedy and Ruth Roman were young at the time),"the window" compares favorably with the rear one.The differences between the short story and the movie are minimal :the names were slightly changed (Charlie "buddy" becomes Tommy and the Kellerman are the Kellerson -because the villain's name sounded too Jewish?-;the telegram is a true one ;the chase in the streets is shortened ,probably because it' s a black and white movie,and Woolrich's depictions and his stunning use of the red and green lights were impossible to film .The Kellerson woman shows some compassion when her husband wants to push Tommy off the roof :attractive elegant Ruth Roman is ,among the cast ,the weakest link :she was on the paper a rather crude heavily made-up woman the boy "did not find pretty"But the rest of the cast is exactly as Woolrich depicts them :Bobby Driscoll always acts naturally and Barbara Hale is the mom everybody would like to have.Aesop's lines ,which open the movie,and which everybody knows ,have never been so relevant.A fine film noir,with a splendid use of shadows and lights and buildings near decay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barbara Hale, Arthur Kennedy Ruth Roman, Bobby Driscoll and Paul Stewart star in "The Window," a 1949 film.In a takeoff of the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf, Tommy Woodry is an only child with a very active imagination. He is known among his friends and parents as being a teller of tall tales. One night, it's so hot in their New York apartment that Tommy goes onto the fire escape to sleep. There, seeing in the next apartment, he witnesses a murder. The problem is, no one believes him. Except the killers.Good nail-biter with lots of references to corporal punishment for kids, which was common back then. It's plenty of violence, too, as well as a dramatic ending.Arthur Kennedy was one of the most underrated actors in show business - though this is a good film, it's a small one, and he deserved something with a higher profile. Barbara Hale, just a few years later would achieve TV immortality as Della Street, Perry Mason's secretary. At 27, Ruth Roman makes an impression as Mrs. Kellerton, who was involved in the killing. She's both beautiful and frightened.The actor who plays the little boy, Bobby Driscoll was very good and continued to work until around 1960, when drugs and a criminal record kept him from getting work. He died at 31 of heart problems, penniless and homeless.Good movie, worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a time machine to New York of the 1940s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of the appeal of the film noir genre has always been its ability to freeze everyday life from the past and redisplay it faithfully to viewers many decades later. It's one of the reasons why I enjoy the genre so much, and "The Window" does its job better that most. If you want to step into a time machine and see what real life was like in New York City in the 1940s, this is the movie to see. I saw it at a local film noir film festival, and I hope it comes out on DVD.It's a bit jarring to see Della Street as a gritty Manhattan housewife with a coarse blue-collar husband, but it's also a lot of fun and she looks terrific. Barbara Hale is still alive as I write this, amazingly, and will turn 91 in a few weeks. At the film festival, this film was introduced by someone who had telephoned Barbara Hale and asked her for her memories of making this movie. She said the movie was supposed to take place in the summer, so the actors dressed very lightly, but it was really filmed in a much colder time of year and she remembers freezing as they shot scene after scene. Could have fooled me, the movie comes across as summery and hot with lots of sweat.Every detail fascinated me, especially of apartment life in the 1940s: tiny rooms, closet-sized bathrooms with dwarf sinks, and kitchens that looked like airplane galleys. Dark and sinister stairwells up to dingy apartments, fire escapes and alleys, cigarettes galore, and black telephones like my grandmother used to have. Every scene is richly textured, almost as if the director knew that audiences of the distant future would be watching his movie and be mesmerized by the detailed scenery, from the local police station to the pay phone at the corner drugstore.Others have reviewed the plot and I have nothing much to add. But I will emphasize that the plot develops along paths that I would never have predicted, and the ending will rivet you to your seat. The conclusion was deeply satisfying and caused the audience to burst into whistles and applause. Hope this movie comes out on DVD quick... it's a treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This story is not a lie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have recently watched The Window for the first time and found it very suspenseful and gripping.A 9 year old boy, Tommy, is noted for telling tales. So one hot night, he decides to sleep on the fire escape to be cooler and then witnesses the neighbours murdering a man and then hide his corpse. When he tells his parents, they don't believe him and nor do the police when he goes to report the crime at the local police station. When Tommy is left home alone another evening, the Kellersons break into the flat and try to silence him. While running away from them, stairs collapse which leaves Tommy hanging from a beam and Mr Kellerson dead under a load of rubble...The New York locations make the movie atmospheric. This was filmed in a run down part of the city and you often see Subway trains passing.The movie has an excellent cast: Booby Driscoll (Treasure Island) playing the part of Tommy brilliantly and the rest of the cast includes Arthur Kennedy and Barbara Hale as his parents and Ruth Roman and Paul Stewart as the murderers Mr and Mrs Kellerson.The window is a must see. Fantastic.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In its day (it was made in 1947 around the time Howard Hughes bought RKO and in his wisdom he had it shelved until, short of product in 1949, it was finally released) this must have been highly effective. Watching it today it is easy to compare it with Rear Window and watch it come off worse but Rear Window had a budget arguably 20 to 30 times that of The Window, it was shot in color, had Internationally known stars - James Stewart, Grace Kelly - plus an Internationally celebrated (albeit vastly overrated) director, Alfred Hitchcock. The irony is that both films were based on stories by William Irish/Cornell Woollrich. Okay, to rack up the tension it is necessary to have the father (Arthur Kennedy) work nights and the mother (Barbara Hale) leave the nine-year-old boy (Bobby Driscoll) alone in the apartment AFTER the two killers (Paul Stewart, Ruth Roman) on the floor above KNOW that he saw them kill the sailor. As well as this in 1949 no one was wondering aloud what a sailor was doing in a strange apartment in the first place (apart from getting rolled by Roman, that is); it's clear that Roman was a hooker, or at least had picked up the sailor and led him to believe she would have sex with him because nothing else makes sense. Chances are she and Stewart did this on a regular basis but this time it went wrong. It packs a lot into 79 minutes and the acting is, if anything, superior to that in Rear Window. Well worth the price of a DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Ten Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In film, there's two kinds of 'predictable'. First, there's the "I can't believe they'd do something SO INCREDIBLY OBVIOUS!!" type. Then there's the kind of predictable in which you know exactly what will happen next, but the suspense still literally tears you to pieces! "The Window" is definitely the latter and it's all the better for it. Featuring a great, if mostly unknown cast, this should be counted among the top film noir's ever made. Starring 12 year old Bobby Driscoll, there's also noir vet Paul Stewart, Ruth Roman, Barbara Hale and Arthur Kennedy who's probably the best actor to ever have been Oscar nominated five times without ever having won. Directed by Ted Tetzlaff, Jr., a seasoned and previously Oscar nominated cinematographer himself, virtually every frame is a beautifully crafted black &amp; white image of substantial texture and depth. Photographed by William O. Steiner &amp; Robert DeGrasse, the camera-work is brilliant. The direction of the actors is just as good. Every character comes across as a real, living breathing human being (even the killers) and every actor turns in nothing less than a terrific performance. As icing on the cake, the rundown tenement and condemned building sets are so perfect that they count as characters themselves. The climatic scene in the abandoned building is simply incredible. How they filmed such a realistic looking nail bitter of a scene in 1949 is beyond me. Today it would all be done on a computer, but not in 1949. I won't ruin it, but I felt like I was right there teetering on the edge of that failing wooden support beam about to plummet three stories along with the characters. Not a bit overdone, this particular scene is one of the best photographed, executed and outright suspenseful scenes ever put on film. And while there is a musical score, it gives way to the natural sound of the setting at key moments rather than to telegraph what's coming next.With its terrific combination of acting, directing, writing, photography, art direction and restrained musical score, this "little" film is the complete package. At about 73 minutes in length, it's all story and not a second of fluff or padding. I'd bet the farm that if "The Window" ever gets remade they'll add at least 20-30 minutes for fear that today's audience will feel cheated by such a short running time. "The Window" was produced by RKO Studios. Great Film Noir flicks were a specialty of theirs and this is one of the very best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An authentic "sleeper" of a finely crafted movie . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only do I remember this little wonder of a movie, if memory serves, I think I gave it a "rave" in the L.A. Daily News way way back then. And if I didn't, it would only be because first-string critic Virginia Wright had the privilege. It wasn't so much a "noir" flick as it was a straight-on suspense effort. The climactic chase scene in the derelict tenement is one for the books. Speaking of which, I just tried to locate IMDb references to French film director Charles David, whom Universal imported to direct a Deanna Durbin vehicle, and whom she married and followed to Paris? Whatever, David also directed a minor B effort while at Universal, titled either "River Pirates" or "River . . . " something. But, again, no luck. Not surprising, considering the literal thousands of titles, but I had expected to find SOME reference via Durbin. Sigh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Forgotten Morality Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Based on the old Boy Who Cried Wolf, cautionary morality tale this forgotten classic will surprise you with its intensity. It features scenes that could never be replicated today. Modern audiences may not care for the little boy being punched, off camera, in a taxi with the evil couple masquerading as his parents. The boy witnesses a murder on a hot summer's night fire escape; of course, he is the biggest liar for miles so nobody believes a word he says. The clueless mother even has him apologize to the killers upstairs tipping them off that he is a witness. The suspense is not just at the end; he is stalked by both the man and the woman the last half of the movie. In classic Noir fashion, almost all of the movie occurs at night. The daytime shots have plenty of Noir shadowing. The cast is excellent, especially Kennedy as the disbelieving father. If you wish to own the disc, brace yourself both of the movie disc companies want thirty bucks for this seventy minute movie. Still, I recommend it; do not be put off by the child in the movie this Noir is one intense movie. Wherever he goes nobody believes a word he says. The movie establishes this at the beginning with Tommy telling his little group that his parents are moving to a ranch prompting their landlord to knock on their door later that evening showing the apartment. The short introduction lends credibility to what follows: he is all alone all through the movie. Paul Stewart who always plays a Noir villain is at his very sinister best here. The close calls and near misses will have popcorn flying all over your living room with your guests yelling at the screen at the little guy. Unlike the Noir Atomic City, this one benefits from true Noir darkness both in the lighting and the characterizations. I own a huge Noir collection and this was worth every penny of the thirty bucks. A Great Noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Window is a story set in New York City in 1949, starring Bobby Driscoll, the child in the movie who played Tommy's character superbly. The nine year old Tommy likes to invent stories that land him in trouble with parents and friends. On a sweltering night, he goes outside on a fire escape to get some sleep. It is there that he witnesses a crime. He tries without success to convince his parents about the crime. We see a child who knows he has misbehaved in the past but is determined to set things right. The parents are just as determined to set the boy right.The characters of Tommy and his parents live in a crumbling tenement building that becomes the scene for a dramatic climax. We witness a cast of characters drawn from a neighbourhood at the time--police officers, mailman, reporter, superintendent etc. We see kids playing in settings that would never meet the standard of today's parents. We witness the hardscrabble life of the boy's parents with the father, played by Arthur Kennedy, working graveyard shifts to support his wife and child living in the small apartment. During this event, the wife/mother, played by Barbara Hale, goes off to help her ailing sister. All in all, a little nugget of film noir. We are transported to a way of life many can still relate to with characters and settings from the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot understand how the upstairs neighbors could step on the boy's pillow (going up to roof and coming down) without noticing it and realizing someone was probably there when they committed the murder.Also, it was strange that boy's dad did not see the boy's runaway note at all, but the neighbor seemed to see it right away.All the actors seemed well-suited to their roles.If Bobby did all the stairway climbing himself (likely) he did it very well and with speed appropriate to the timing of the plot.Arthur Kennedy got many good roles over the years, but unfortunately never a signature role that could have propelled him to the top of his profession.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget "Rear Window". This is he ultimate window movie. The plot is a bit contrived and manipulative and somewhat unsavory, as in all thrillers, but the esthetics of the film, the grim tenement environment is a real treat. I react more to the esthetic element than the dramatic per se. Whereas this great film is intimate, moody, subdued and modest, "Rear Window" throws stars, light and colors at you in a sad display of artistic insecurity. Bobby Driscoll and the other cast members are very good, which isn't surprising, as good movies tend to inspire good acting. I first saw it as a kid, and although I had trouble understanding the plot, I knew it was an exceptional film.</fullReview>

Perhaps the BBC will show it again in the near future...Does anybody know if this film is to be released on DVD?

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this film since 1949, but it left an impression on me. The idea of a child prone to tall tales who can't get anyone to believe him when he's reporting something serious goes back to the tale of the boy who cried "Wolf," but here it's presented well.Spoiler.To me, the most chilling moment was when the boy wrote a note of apology to his parents, but the postscript was carefully excised by the killers. Without the postscript, reiterating the truth of his report, the note read as if he was apologizing for making the report! It was torn off, using a ruler to make the bottom edge look natural, slowly enough so that the audience could absorb the import of the act.Not the best film of its kind, but really suspenseful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A near-miss, aided by young Driscoll's work...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bobby Driscoll, a child actor par excellence, lends a good deal of believability to this familiar and predictable plot concerning an imaginative youngster who can't get anyone to believe his tale about being the only witness to a murder. This "Boy Who Cried Wolf" in modern dress (from a story by Cornell Woolrich!) needed a stronger, perhaps multi-layered approach; it is far too straightforward and square, and the audience is always two steps ahead of the action. The adult characters are exasperating and foolish, though Driscoll's grounded presence is just what this scenario requires (he won a highly-deserved Juvenile Oscar for his work). Vivid black-and-white cinematography by Robert De Grasse and William Steiner also deserves praise, though the film isn't a noir. It's a family picture on a low-budget, aimed at the mass market. Overall results are decent, but certainly not superior. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Compact Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This second feature film is a thriller revolving around the accusations of a boy with a vivid imagination. Tommy witnesses a murder, but no one will believe him because he has a reputation for exaggeration and story telling.Filmed in black and white, The Window does a good job of creating tension as the killers are spooked into taking action against Tommy, played by 9-year-old Bobby Driscoll. The credibility of the film depends on his performance and he does not disappoint. This film is not up to the standards of Hitchcock, but it is not far off. Fortunately, the filmmakers did not try to ratchet up the suspense by asking Bobby to emote more. Instead, they allow him to convey his fears by having him deal with the darkness and shadows of the sets. This feels more believable.The adult actors all portray their characters well. Again, there is no over-acting here. The director does not have them express emotions beyond what normal parents would feel about a child who is lying, or beyond what the killers would feel if threatened by a youngster.Though The Window is worth seeing, for better tales of unbelieved witnesses, see The Bedroom Window or the classic Rear Window.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any Brits here remember films by The Children's Film Foundation ? CFF movies were quite popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s though were almost certainly only popular with the people who made them and what a pile of patronising middle class crap they were too . The plot usually involved a couple of career criminals played by Bernard Cribbins and Roy Kinnear hiding some stolen loot and some toffee nosed kids from some fee paying stage school ( No doubt the kids parents wasted a lot of money sending them there - GOOD ! )playing characters no one can take seriously saying " Gosh " and " Cor blimey " and the villains turn up and say " you meddling kids , give us back our money or so help me .. " then the kids make a getaway and inform the police who arrest the villains . The end ( Of the child casts acting career - DOUBLE GOOD ) . Talk about patronising the audience , these films didn't so much talk down the audience - They shouted When I read the synopsis in the TV guide of a young boy witnessing a murder and no one believing him I thought I'd be watching some American precursor to the CFF and it was very nice to be proved wrong because THE WINDOW is made by Hollywood producers who know how to entertain , enthrall and excite an audience and have turned what's basically a low budget B movie into something of a minor classic . It's inexpensive , contains no big name stars ( Though the cast in general and 12 year old Bobby Driscoll * in particular are superb ) but is so well written and tense you quickly become involved in the story and will remember it for a long time afterwards Perhaps the most memorable thing about the movie is the peculiar mores involving children in those days and ill received the film would be now if it was released . Tommy's father works night shift and his mother is away visiting a sick relative so Tommy is locked in the house alone . Bad enough but later when Tommy's father mentions he's locked the child up alone to a policeman the cop doesn't bat an eyelid at this arrangement . Even worse there's a scene where Tommy's abductor and a policeman discuss giving the boy " A good lickin'" and as for the scene in the cab where... This makes the story even more shocking and heart stopping because the audience realise that the cops aren't necessarily going to help Tommy in any way . Can you imagine the outcry if an almost identical scene for scene remake appeared in 2005 ? Social workers , parents groups , police chiefs , politicians and other assorted bleeding heart liberal elitists and social engineers would issue a fatwa against the producers and studio that released it . Watching THE WINDOW today you realise just what a dynamic piece of story telling it is * As a footnote please take the time and trouble of reading the very real tragic story of child actor Bobby Driscoll . I'm shocked that Hollywood hasn't made a multi award winning bio-pic of his life story . I'm certain they will one day in the future</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it's a film noir about a boy witnessing a murder but the scariest part of this movie is how it stands up as a sign of the times in 1949 and how children were treated. The parents have no qualms about leaving their nine-year-old all night, the murderous neighbour actually punches the kid unconscious at one point, and the cop actually advocates giving him a beating.Contrast it with modern children-in-peril movies like Home Alone and you'll see, though it's not a great movie, it's a real historical marker. It is helped by the fact that the doomed child actor Bobby Driscoll is such a great little actor.I think it's worth a watch.

		<fullReview>Opening with a quote from Aesop, this movie is about a little lad who tells so many stories that no one believes him when he witnesses a real murder. It takes an awful lot for me to forgive a film that centers around a child, especially an obnoxious one like this. The very similar TALK ABOUT A STRANGER couldn't do it, despite the talents of John Alton. I hated young Bobby Driscoll throughout the picture and he's undoubtedly its weakest link. His pouting and whining and "golly gee" demeanor are very grating. But director Ted Tetzlaff otherwise delivers a stunning noir. The photography is amazing, capturing the grittiness, desperation and danger of the urban setting beautifully. The script is solid, building tension at a steady pace, culminating in a lengthy and gripping chase sequence through a decrepit abandoned building. Tetzlaff clearly learned something about suspense as the cinematographer on NOTORIOUS. A great film with a lousy protagonist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this on TCM by virtue of its direction by Ted Tetzlaff, the cinematographer of one of my favorite films Notorious. Overall, the film I think is minor noir. Good performances by all the adults (Paul Stewart is always great to watch) but the performance by Bobby Driscoll is a bit affected (wouldn't be out of place on The Wonderful World of Disney, if you know what I mean). Great job by Tetzlaff in setting the gritty urban environment in an opening scene that perfectly encapsulates what is to come. The climactic escape through a crumbling condemned tenement is wonderfully exciting. The final shot of the redeemed City on the Hill was very Disneyesque (necessary for the use of Disney's Driscoll, I wonder??). When I read the bio of Driscoll, though, I couldn't help feeling that this film eerily presages his own tragic death - a corpse found by children in an abandoned building.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge classic film buff, especially of the film noirs, but I have to say that this 1949 "thriller" is an absolute disgrace. I became interested in seeing the movie because it was made in the 1940s, because it starred two beautiful actresses (Barbara Hale and Ruth Roman) and because it features a colorful character actor, Paul Stewart. But I was incredibly disappointed at what I saw. The story kicks off with a little boy (Bobby Driscoll) witnessing a murder but, because of the exaggerated stories he always tells, not being able to convince anyone (including his parents) of it. The movie goes to great lengths to show us how badly no one will believe the boy, and the killers even know that no one will believe the boy, and the kid doesn't have a shred of evidence on the killers, but guess what idiotic, brainless, stupid thing the killers decide to do. They try to kidnap the boy!!! And the kidnap attempt is probably the clumsiest one ever filmed for the cinema!!! This is an example of a forced story that is so ridiculous it is beyond logic. And on top of all this, Barbara Hale looks so drab and dull in this movie that she didn't even make it worth seeing. Ignore this one.</fullReview>
