		<shortDescription>Bluffnaster - Right Here Right Now !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bluffmaster ? Right Here, Right Now! Indian cinema finally comes of age! Actors living their parts, and not merely acting , the film maker who is not just telling a story but just portraying a honest , brutal reflection of our times. Instantly recognizable characterizations and everyday situations which one can relate to. Mind blowing performances and a directorial masterstroke! Chartering unexplored horizons, the movie has upped the standard for Bollywood forever.OK, that was the "Bluff "portion of the review! Bluffmaster is nothing close to what is written in the first paragraph. And the best part is it doesn't pretend or even attempt to be! That I guess is what makes Bluffmaster work! A movie where the maker and the actors don't take themselves too seriously and one in which they are having a blast and hoping that the audience would join them in doing so! Yeah, the plot is nothing earth shattering in itself. But the casting, performances, the dialogues (cant remember the last Hindi movie which had such witty one-liners), and the zany soundtrack with the remixes elevate the proceedings to a great extent.The obvious scene stealer in the movie is Nana Patekar. Often accused of being stereotypical with his penchant for mouthing heavy duty dialogues , Nana does a complete u ? turn , with his over the top, narcissist portrayal of the " Chuna " factory don who no one ever dreams of messing up with .He gets the best lines in the movies ( his intro scene , when he denounces Priyanka and Abhishek , his lap top , why his image has taken a beating etc). You just need to watch "Apaharan " to put to rest any debate on this mans versatility .Booman Irani is the kind who makes even the most mundane role look interesting and delivers his part to the T. The surprise packet of the movie is Ritiesh D. Clowning comes almost naturally to him given his looks, but he handles it without going overboard or being loud. The good old adage of loud is funny is thrown out of the window and the escapades of duo (Abhishek and him) are truly funny.And yes Aby Baby delivers. It almost seems that entire nation has been waiting for Abhishek to work! In the last few movies (Yuva, Bunty, Sarkar) Abhishek evolution as an actor can be seen and in a mad cap movie like this he even brings a touch of vulnerability to his character. He emotes , cries , gets drunk , does the " Dus Bahane " dance step to perfection , sports a stubble, a swagger and wears an unbuttoned shirt to claim the title of the official " Cool Dude " ! Priyanka doesn't have nothing much to do and thankfully for that. Himman Dhamija captures Mumbai in all its splendor, the by lanes and the skyline lending itself to the screenplay. Further the technical finesse which is becoming more the norm in Bollywood movies today is pretty much evident.The movie does have its share of flaws -the romantic interludes drag on, caricaturist, simplistic con games and the utter detachment you may experience. Tongue in cheek, cocky and ultra cool, this spoofy caper deserves a watch! You know you are being taken for a ride, just sit back and enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun film with some good tunes which will get your feet tapping.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roy Kapoor (Bachchan) is a career conman who excels in running the "perfect scam". He's in love with Simmi (Chopra) who he's been dating for 6 months and they're getting engaged. Unfortunately at their lavish engagement party, one of his most recent cons comes back to bite him on the proverbial when the victim turns out to be Simmi's uncle! Simmi had no idea her fiancé was a conman (she thought he was a stockbroker) and BOOM! The engagement is broken off and Simmi tells Roy that she wants nothing more to do with him. Six months later, a forlorn Roy still wanders around like a lovesick puppy and comes across Dittu (Deshmukh) another conman but rather new to the game who's pulling off a con with a doctor (Irani). Dittu and colleague drop a banger and Dittu grabs the doctor and he falls to the floor thinking he's been shot, Dittu calls an "ambulance" but in reality they're out to steal whatever they can from the doctor. Roy "rescues" the doctor and in return the doctor gives him some well meaning advice, and in the process they discover that Roy has a brain tumour and only has 3 months to live. Simmi gets engaged to another man, Dittu keeps hounding Roy to mentor him as he wants to be as good at conning people as Roy for been for so many years and he wants to avenge his father's downfall at the hands of another conman Chandru (Patekar), who is somewhat of a gangster too.The cons at the start and climax of the film were pretty brilliant and you really don't see the end one coming, so it is quite a surprise. I think it was very cleverly done but I'm guessing there's a Hollywood film out there with a similar storyline which has been copied because I'm pretty sure Bollywood didn't come up with this idea! If I'm doing Bollywood an injustice in that comment then I'd be the first to hold up my hand and admit I made a mistake.The film itself is reminiscent of the Michael Douglas starrer The Game but don't be fooled into thinking it's a direct copy... It isn't!All in all Bluffmaster gets a high 9 out of 10 from me. I'd recommend fans of comedy and/or con capers give this a watch. It's a slick fast-paced film with lots of eye candy for both the male and female audience with some good laughs thrown in along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather interesting and comedic plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I am not mistaken, this is Rohan Sippy's second effort at film-making, and I must say it is not bad at all. The movie is slick, funny and yet remains within its theme. Powered by good performances from Abhishek Bachchan, Priyanka Chopra, Ritesh Deshmukh, Boman Irani and Nana Patekar as well as a bunch of extras, the film stands out amongst the recent crime- thriller movies that all these new young directors are venturing into. The reason: It doesn't have style overpowering substance.That doesn't however mean that the movie doesn't ooze stylish and contemporary production values ? but just that along with that is a story that keeps you gripped. Using the old school (but very effective) formula of a decent masala mix of action, comedy, drama, emotion and music, Sippy has devised a lovely recipe to keep the audience's interest ? a recipe that more Indian directors and story-writers should stick to, since it works.About the movie a little bit. The story revolves around a conman, Roy (AB) who can pull off any con on any one. He has a girlfriend, played by Priyanka Chopra and at the beginning of the movie itself, he proposes to her. At the engagement party, however, one of the people he has conned is a guest and its not a surprise when everyone finds out his true identity and the engagement's off.In this terrible time, he runs into Dittu (RD), a small-time crook who tries to con Roy, but ends up in trouble himself. Through some convenient situation, they meet again, and Dittu ends up saving Roy's life. Now Roy owes him a favor and Dittu decides that he can become Roy's student in conman-ship and learn a few valuable lessons in crime. This is where the love-hate relationship begins. Added to that cast are Boman Irani, who plays a doctor (in the middle of the movie, Roy discovers that he has a brain tumor, and his time alive is limited), and Nana Patekar who plays an evil, narcissistic hotelier, with whom Dittu has an old refute to settle.The real hero of the movie is the script, however, written by Rajat Arora and it is kept at a smooth pace. The script does refer to Sholay every now and then (another Sippy production) as well as light inspirations from certain dialogs in Ocean's Eleven and Jerry Maguire (let's see if you can pick those!), but overall it's kept tight and entertaining.Although, at the end, the movie did seem somewhat "inspired" by Michael Douglas' "The Game", it had enough differences from the original, and in fact, in my opinion is a better movie. If you haven't watched "The Game" you could possibly enjoy this one better because then the end is a real surprise.Do go... it isn't a waste at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story of an overconfident conman !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A conman to the core who loves taking lethal risks for the joyride and the money finds it difficult to mend his ways after his lover finds about his reality. A rookie thief who bumps into the con-master, begs him to teach him the tricks of the trade and becomes his sidekick. What follows then is fun, adventure and a dangerous mission. You have to pay special attention to the events, characters and their dialogs. This is because all things have unapparent significance. Bluffmaster is shot entirely in Mumbai and surprisingly makes it look good. Abhishek is definitely matured and Ritesh is good fun. Actress Priyanka looks great and acts just right, nothing overdone. A thriller with a cool attitude and good music that keeps you glued till the end. Smart one liners, good aesthetics, pacey storytelling make this an offbeat bollywood flick. If you like good movies , don't miss this one. And yes the end makes sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abhishek Bachchan-Yeh Dil Maange More!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bluff Master is a fantastic piece of cinema with just the right amount of emotions, drama, comedy, thrill and about Abhishek Bachchan?yeh dil maange more! The star has finally become the actor with this film! When Abhishek started with his career, he seemed to have teething problems because of the mammoth surname attached to his name. Not only did his screen presence improved tremendously with each and every film, he has also let go off any inhibitions he might have suffered from when he began. If Yuva was the film, which brought him the critical acclaim and Bunty Aur Babli and Sarkar had moments where the son outshone the father, Bluff Master is definitely the film, where Abhishek comes of his own! Produced by Ramesh Sippy (Sholay, Seeta Aur Geeta, Shaan, Saagar, Shakti), Bluff Master is a brilliant piece of writing by Shridhar Raghavan, who is also credited with stories of films like Apharan and Khakee. The editing is razor edged by Amitabh Shukla and never loses its pace. Cinematography by Himman Dhamija is gripping and catches the right hues and colors of what is needed of a comic thriller like Bluff Master. Full marks to director Rohan Sippy (Debut-Dhai Akshar Prem Ke) for his dedication, passion and focus to make a product, which is not just good in few areas but excels in totality. Sippy's hard work shows in not letting the structure of the story fall apart like a pack of cards like the film made on a similar subject- Bunty Aur Babli. The plot is interesting and the climax keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing. The audio cd of the film may not be a collector's item but songs go well as audio- visual pieces choreographed with much punch and fervor in the film. The rap song ' Right Here Right Now' sung by Abhishek Bachchan rocks! The background score does justice to the screenplay. The costumes are carefully designed keeping the profile of each character. Talking of characters, the writer seems to have put extra time and efforts in shaping the characters, whether primary or secondary. The film has quite a few interesting con jobs, which do not strike as odd and on the contrary lends realism to the film and an instant identification with its characters. The dialogues are not rhetoric, and carefully mouthed, again to affirm the honesty with which the film is made. Associating people from different classes with different types of fish was refreshing and innovative work in dialogue writing. There is no unnecessary brooding over Roy (Abhishek) who is a professional at bluffing people as to why and what circumstances led him to join this line, neither does he let himself go ballistic over a vainglory accomplishment he achieves as a bluff master. There is a thin line between a con artist and a bluff master. Roy is a cool dude Bluff Master, lives in a swanky apartment and drives a chic car. Actors Ritesh Deshmukh, Boman Irani, Nana Patekar and Priyanka Chopra did full justice with their roles. The film is well crafted, and distinguishes itself from a buffoonery or slapstick, and is rather a sensible comedy that provides a much- needed comic relief, after absolute nonsense and trash films like Shaadi No. 1, Garam Masala and Home Delivery. Story: Roy (Abhishek Bachchan) is a professional conman, who has raised his work to the level of an art. He loves Simmi (Priyanka Chopra) who is unaware of his dark side. When his past catches up with him, she cannot forgive him for the deceit their relationship is built on and dumps him. That's when Dittu (Ritesh Deshmukh) enters his life. Dittu takes Roy as his mentor and wants to learn the tricks of the trade from him. As circumstances take turn, Roy must do one single most important thing in his life, which is to help Dittu get revenge from Chandru (Nana Patekar). What happens when the Bluff Master who wears so many masks is left with no alternative but to take them all off and finally reveal his real self? Watch Bluff Master to find out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abhishek Bachhan has come into his own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bluffmaster is a delightful movie. The dialogues are crisp and far above average from Hindi film sentimentality. Abhishek Bachhan is a natural and I do believe that he is a far better actor than his very popular father. His Hindustani diction is leaps and bounds better than all the Khans combined. Nana Patekar is at his comic best as his sinister character belies the poet at heart. I was able to tolerate Priyanka Chopra in this movie, far better than the Barbie character she plays in Krrish. Boman Irani is funny. I do believe that much of the film is a mish-mash of lifts from western films of the genre and even some of the dialogues are plagiarized. But the Hindustani play on metaphors and aphorisms is what makes this movie so very fun to watch. The English subtitles do little justice to the rich dialogue in Hindustani.The songs are a wonderful blend of Hinglish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bluffmaster is one of the popcorn entertainers of the year with fun fast 2 hours, fine performances and of course its unique MUSIC. I did enjoy it than any other comedies last year except No entry which was also hilarious. What makes it different is it handled every aspect with equal importance. Whether it is Drama, Comedy, Music or of course Love. Surprisingly what I loved most after its Music is its Luv Estory Part. There is a scene when Roy (Abhishek) telling Sim (Priyanka- Hot in 'Come to me' number) about love affairs ?"Biggest lie in this world is ? I LOVE U- Jaise Time Bitata Hai LOVE Nikal Jaata Hai and only left behind is I n U". Then she argues over this as on same basis when Roy proposed her with same line if it was a lie. Watch Abhishek's response- 'Vo such tha Sim. 'Vahi To Ek Sach Tha'. This is my favorite scene in movie.As title suggests Roy(Abhishek) is bluffmaster looting (fishing in his language) and after making good money retired from the line and planning to settle with his girl-friend Sim(Priyanka). Which didn't work out as on engagement one of his tricked one shows up and leading to heart-break of Sim and blah blah. Roy is now longing for Sim making every possible effort to make her believe that he is changed. There is a very nice scene when he is sitting in the restaurant, ordering coffee after coffee that eventually persuades Sim to talk to him but she refuse to forgive him at any cost.We meet various characters- Dittu(Ritesh) who is now getting trained by Roy as a favor- Now kahani me so called twist is Dr. Bhalerao (Boman) diagnosed Roy is suffering from some last stage Brain Tumor. He has only three months. Boman gives theory of life where he explains how we live for 30 years but Only 30 were memorable? So make these 90 days memorable and live for another 90 years kinda. Valid indeed. End of first half we are introduced to Chandu (Nana Patekar). Dittu is seeking revenge from Chandu and it can be possible only if Roy help him out. Well, Climax turns everything upside down but I find it is well come surprise ending.On Downside it fails to keep high on certain sequences but not too long.Talk about its Music-It is awesome- One of the best varied collections of songs the year. Both Original and Remixes are like hitting bull's-eye. Fantastically choreographed Right Here Right Now I can watch hundreds of times for sure. Same is with 'Bure Bure'. Both have topped pub and disco DJ lists to get crowd wild.Bluffmaster wouldn't be same if casting would have been different and who is irreplaceable in all is Nana Patekar. He portrayed such a flamboyant character stealing scene after scene with cheesy one-liners. Favorite is "IMAGE!!!" and "Kis Liye? Picture Bahot Acchi Chal Rahi Hai..Parade Pe Fekane Hai". Nana is utilized here 100 % as Nana and dialogs have developed a vada-paav kinda relation. He is offered very best lines here and his colorful character never misses a bit. Rithesh, Boman and Priyanka made a well supporting cast. And Abhishek Bacchan who is getting better and better with every outing. Check out how cool he is in 'Right Here Right Now' number. Same in rain drunk scene, in Sim's Coffee shop scene.Honestly I went this movie with no expectation but left hall Ekdum Paisav Vasool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Con film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the year 2005, there were many con films like the crap though hit Bunty Aur Babli, Chocolate, Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena which didn't work and finally BLUFFMASTER.The film again had AB Jr again play a conman just like B &amp; B. The film however is much more realistic(in comparison to B &amp; B), it starts off well with a sort of tribute to Amitabh's DO AUR DO PAANCH type films. The romance is well handled, Also the con acts are well handled here, maybe discounting a few. The turn of events after Nana's entry are well handled though the climax doesn't register that well, though it's well handled but leaves plenty of flawsDirection by Rohan Sippy is good Music is good, There used plenty of songs for background music including Amitabh's DO AUR DO PAANCh title song,Arush's Boro Boro is good, while Sabse Bada Rupaiya is good too, Abhishek's debut song Ek Main fits well and is decent Camera-work is superb, Mumbai never looked so beautiful Abhishek Bachchan is excellent in a role, unlike B &amp; B here he plays it more naturally and seems ideal for the part, though at times too serious perhaps Ritiesh is simply superb as Dittu, he endears himself and makes his act look likable Priyanka Chopra is decent, Nana Patekar steals the show as Chandrakant Parekh, he as always makes you laugh even with a straight face Boman Irani is underutilised but decent, Tinnu Anand and others lend good support</fullReview>

Actors have all acted well and dialogs are good. From starting till end movie has been carried well and songs are also nice. The movie is also decent and can be watched with friends and family without feel awkward. The movie also teaches some very important lessons about life and eventually leaves the viewer happy and satisfied. I hope the readers of this review like the movie as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the average Bollywood movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reviewers who claim this to be "exact copy" of Nueve reinas (Nine Queens) most certainly could not be making this claim if they had seen BOTH movies. There are some remote similarities with regard to a few aspects of the movie, but this is NOT an exact copy of any Hollywood or South American film. Overall it is a decent movie. Not the usual boring Bollywood melodrama or romantic comedy that are dime a dozen. However, it is a bit too slow at times and some scenes the movie could have done without (mostly the early Bhalerao scenes) and the sequences where Roy goes after Simmi attempting to make up with her. The soundtrack was weak except for "Ek mein aur ek tu hai..". Performances were okay, slightly below par. Overall the script is not focused, it tried to do too many things. Movie would be much more effective if it picked one track and stayed on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Abhishek's best performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bluffmaster is one unique masterpiece. When you think about it, it's a masala film. When you analyze it, it's not a typical masala film. It's nice blend of action, suspense, comedy and drama.Abhishek Bachchan is the star of the movie. Most of his roles are usually the supporting one and he is usually overshadowed by the Roshans, Khans &amp; Big B. It is very nice to see him as the hero of the movie. He played "Roy" with utmost sincerity &amp; tons of attitude. He suits the role very well, from the looks &amp; everything else in between.Priyanka Chopra's character blended very well in the story. Most heroines in Bollywood are just a "decoration" to the movies, but Simmi's character begs to differ. Her character is not a Barbie doll, rather, her role is very logical &amp; refreshing compared to others. Nice performance, indeed.Ritesh Desmukh has a nice timing for comedy. He knows when to make the joke. And he's also good at the dramatic scenes in the movie.Boman Irani plays his character very well. 50% serious &amp; 50% funny best describes his character here. It is challenging to portray and I can say that played the role very well.Nana Patekar is the show-stealer. Good transition from the bad &amp; dangerous gang leader to the tree-staying guy. He's very convincing as a villain and I can say he's really cool.Costumes - Love it. Very urban and modern.Dialogue - This movie has the wittiest lines in the history of Bollywood.Songs - The songs fit the movie well, which is very urban (and I'm a big urban music fan).All in all, 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Abhishek has come a long way. He can dance, sing, act, and entertain. If you have seen Michael Douglas starred "The Game" you will see the inspiration part and truly well inspired and not copied!The movie is very well made. Song and dance are well timed and consumed well in the movie. Interestingly, some of the background music is remixed old songs, which makes it really fun without mediocrity. The movie is not cheap and very well finished even though it has a lot of tapori factor to it, executed with class. Abhishek's rap is awesome, he has done it in style and he can do it.Actors are utilized very well and have done excellent justice to their character. Nana Patekar is hilarious especially in the end. Priyanka is beautiful and delivered her acting very well. One of the most interesting characters is that of Omar, he must have about 10 lines of dialog in the entire movie of which 2 you will hear completely rest are all beeped! In fact, as he appears on the screen the beep starts in a very hilarious way.On the whole I recommend this movie with no second doubts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The twist at the end lifted an ordinary movie for me to something slightly better then average.Pros: A couple of performances. Ritesh stole the show despite being underused. This guy hasn't looked back since Masti and is easily one of the best comedians in Bollywood today. Nana in his typical style owns every scene he's a part of(especially the climax). It's good to see him do something a little different. The look of the film is very 'Bombay' and I thought it gelled in perfectly with the subject matter.Cons: The Abhshek-Priyanka relationship didn't do it for me at all. They look good physically, but that's all there is to it. Abhishek's fixation with her is puzzling throughout the movie. In one scene he's talking to her abt not doing his thing anymore because he "loves" her, but we know that's a flat out lie. Makes AB's already confusing feelings for her look even weaker. His character in fact is very contradictory for the majority of the story. Tough to see his motivation for the stuff he does. AB Jr. gives a fairly good performance(if a bit dull), but I would prefer the leading character of any movie to have some likable traits and Roy doesn't really have 'em. This matters because the people AB's conning are GOOD guys, so why exactly should we like this guy or even root for him? He struck me as a real jerk.Priyanka's acting is strictly OK and even her appearance isn't what we've come to expect from her. Boman Irani's character reminded me a little too much of some of his previous ones. He's good, but NOT My Wife's Murder or Munnabhai good.Still, I would say BM is worth a dekho once for the novelty(Bolly "novelty", of course), a couple of very enjoyable performances and the great twist at the end. A lot of people have complained abt the slow pace in the middle but the story was good enough to keep my attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mumbai?cut to the size of the silver screen, an assortment of picture postcard shots, a lively score, and an able characterization is what makes this one of the most outstanding products this year. Oh ya, I know you are gonna say I missed the story. But frankly dear, I don't give a damn! All I know is that when I go see a movie, I should see the effort and the mindset and vision of the director right there on the huge screen in front of me, nothing else matters. From the first frame to the last, the movie exudes style, and not self-righteous style, an ingrained effortless style. I was in for this fare anyways even it would have been bad, but I was pleasantly surprised by the narrative, its more of a celebration of bollywood for me, bollywood of the seventies-the numerous references to the cinema of the yore celebrated in a universal way, which is so pleasing to the eyes the heart and the mind. A protagonist with multi-layered character, an able-skilled assistant, a merciless love interest and a lovable villain makes up this joyride-roller-coaster of a bolly-revelation-magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A take on a Hollywood film not watched by many Indians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have liked Bluffmaster for its "different storyline" heme... this movie is based on a Hollywood film called 'The Game.' In fact I feel the reason why the movie is called Bluffmaster is not Abhisheks profession in the film, but bcos of the movie itself. You will know what I mean once you see it for yourself. overall the movie is good. It is entertaining, and the dialougues, script and screenplay is good. The characters too have been developed well. The one thing about the film which struck me is its international look. Not only does it have a different style of editing (like the cuts, the fade-outs or the character introductions) but also the songs are mostly Jay-Z-ish. Unnecessary songs, but good nonetheless. Watch it if you are looking for a movie to pass your time. It will leave you feeling good, mainly because everything turns out just fine...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Rohan Sippy was written off for his 'Kuchh Na Kaho' this time he returns with Buffmaster..and from now onwards u can expect only better from him As we all know the story Bluffmaster is about 3 Conmans.While one is in deeply love.The triumph of Bluffmaster lies in its style and fresh story.The only thing which went wrong is love story.It drags the movie sometimes.Otherwise the movie is fast paced and stylish.Some scenes are beautifully placed like first encounter between Abhishek and Ritesh,hospital scene between Boman,Abhishek and Ritesh..and when Nana asks Priyanka..'kis kis position me kaam kar sakti ho'.. Laughing Abhishek Bachchan is improving with each film.His role is similar to Bunty aur Bubly.But here he needs to be emotional as well cause he is a loser in love.And he carries the role like a matured performer Ritesh Deshmukh is excellent again.The actor have gr8 coming timing.And almost all the scenes between him and Abhishek is excellent Priyanka Chopra doesnot have to do much in such movie but the story revolves around her.Inspite of not so strong role she sparkles the screen whenever she comes.Boman Irani is just passable But the real scene stealer is Nana Patekar.After his rocking performance in Apharan he is back again.He lits fire on the screen whenever he comes.He can be called 'powehouse of dilaogue delivery'.Its good to see he is coming back in form With fantastic music,good performances and nonetheless with its surprise and shocking end this is entertainment .You come to know Mumbai is beautiful too</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bollywood cant get enough of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was good in a way. When i first came in the theater i had the impression this was going to be a classy movie with likes of Priyanka Chopra, Abhishek etc. But it truly disappointed me. Just before this I had seen Ek Ajnabee and this was awesome acting, good plot etc etc, but it was a copy, of Man on Fire. Bollywood cant get enough of Hollywood. Back to Bluffmaster. Everyone acted well, agreed, the screenplay was good, and the songs were OK not like those boring line dancers you normally see in Bollywood,the jokes were funny,but u won't go home and comment on the jokes in the movie. They weren't great but there was a laugh here or there, but after i got out of the theater i felt i had wasted my money for both the tickets, both were through and through copies. Bluffmaster is a copy of Matchstick Men. Bollywood needs to come up with there own plots. They have actors, directors, producers, sets and money. They just need to sit down and think of a plot and not take one from Bollywood.Bollywood cant get enough of Hollywood</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashy but disappointing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instead of spending all their budget on Priyanka Chopra's wardrobe, they should have invested it in developing the script further, or at least do justice to the many Hollywood films they ripped off to make this FLUFF-master!Abhishek Bachchan stars here as Roy, the ultimate Bluffmater (Bollyspeak for Con man or swindler), he can con his way out or into any situation but he does one too many when he cons a man picking up bounty money and the man later shows up at his (Roy's) wedding engagement to Priyanka Chopra's character. The wedding is off when the bride's family finds out about the nature of Roy profession and it's downhill from there. Roy tries to win his lover back but to no apparent avail. To add insult to injury, he is diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor and given three months to live. Or is he?The only person worth watching in this film is Nana Patekar who never fails to deliver, even in a film as dreary and as over-hyped as this one! I only saw this film because of Abhi and the hit song Right here right now, and even Abhi wasn't enough to help me forget how mediocre the whole ride was. And to think that Priyanka Chopra bragged about her performance in this film. "For every Umrao Jaan I have lost, I have gained a Bluffmaster" No you haven't Chicka! No you haven't!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bluffmaster, where to start. Ah yes, Bluffmaster is a simple movie about a man who wants to be everything, and is a master of bluffing (tricking) others. Which means he is a fisherman who can reel in any type of fish. Of course in every Bollywood movie there is a love storyline involved too. Roy (Abhishek Bachchan) aka the Bluffmaster of the movie had a lover in the beginning of the movie, Simmi (Priyanka Chopra). Until one day Roy's relationship with her screws up because of his own undoing. While Roy is now a single, and bluffing one after the next, he meets Aditya "Dittu" (Ritesh Deshmukh) a youth who is also bluffing others. When Roy meets Dittu, Dittu sees through Roy as a brilliant bluffmaster, and becomes some sort of protégé to Roy. Abhishek, Priyanka, Ritesh, and Nana Patekar all do a fantastic job acting in this movie no doubt. Bluffmaster also features two songs that were actually sung by Abhishek himself. If I am correct the songs were the "Bluffmaster" theme, and "Right Here Right Now". Other than those two songs, "Bure Bure (Boro Boro)" was indeed a catchy club song my personal favorite of this movie. Other than the acting and songs. I'm sorry I have to say, but the ending was just dreadful. The ending was just too much, and far-fetched which really brought the movie down to a lower score. If it weren't for the ending, I would've given this movie a 9 or higher instead of an 8.0 Overall Bluffmaster is still a great movie, but the storyline really needs to be fixed around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nicely done and refreshing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is quite refreshing but it has a striking similarities with Nicolas Cage starer "Matchstick Men" maybe we can say Bluffmaster is inspired by this movie.The movie begins with a film producer (Tinu Anand) taking an anonymous call on someone's lost mobile he found lying on the road. In the call, he is told to collect a huge sum of money from a garbage can. The money is presumed to be the ransom paid to the kidnapper who lost his mobile.The producer tries his luck. He finds the money there. But then, the cops come. The head cop (Abhishek) begins planting more evidence at the 'crime site'. The producer begs and offers big bribe. The head cop relents. The bluffmaster has struck.Meet Roy (Abhishek Bachchan), a street-savvy bluffmaster who knows many a trick in the con game. The only thing he doesn't bluff is his romance for Simi (Priyanka Chopra).On his engagement day with Simi, Roy's reality is exposed in front of her entire family. The engagement is called off and Roy is left pining for Simi's love.In the meantime, Roy meets another connie. This junior connie, name Dittu (Ritesh Deshmukh), tries unsuccessfully to bluff Roy. He later becomes Roy's chela.While Roy is trying to regain Simi's love, he comes to know a shocking truth. He has brain tumor. His doctor, Dr. Bhalerao (Boman Irani), says he has just three months left to live.When Roy tells Simi this truth, she thinks he is playing another one of his tricks to get her back. A serene and spurned Roy decides to live his remaining life to the fullest.He wants to pull off one last big con on Chandru Parekh (Nana Patekar), who made Dittu's father a pauper after conning the old man. Dittu wants to even the score with Chandru by conning him in return.Roy teaches Dittu the tricks of the game and the two manage to dupe Chandru of crores. But Chandru won't go down so easily. It's not the money, but his "image" that has been challenged.As the climax draws closer, Chandru hits back. He abducts Simi and demands Roy to return the money to save the girl.Roy, who knows his eventual fate is to die, faces Chandru's gun...What follows next will certainly take you by surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roy is a conman out of choice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has hilarious one liners and the music is a fusion of east meets west. Bluffmaster has a well thought out twist to it, and a must see if you are after a night of comedy.Roy Abhishek Bachchan is a conman out of choice. The sole person he tries to be honest with is his girlfriend Simmi Priyanka Chopra. However, Roy hasn't really had the courage to tell her the truth about himself. But when his past catches up with him, she cannot forgive him for the deceit their relationship is built on. She walks out on him. Dittu Ritesh Deshmukh enters the picture here. He is the counterpoint to everything that Roy is as frantic as Roy is calm, as dumb as Roy is smart, as messy and untidy as Roy is smooth. They have only one thing in common: Dittu is a conman too. At least he thinks of himself as one. In Roy's book, he is an embarrassment. To take his mind off Simmi, Roy agrees to teach Dittu the rules of the game. But he soon realises that he doesn't have much time on hand: He has brain tumour. Suddenly, Roy, who prides himself on being able to cheat anyone and anything, is pushed into a corner from where there is no exit. Roy is ready to take on his final 'act': To teach Chandru Nana Patekar the lesson of a lifetime. Chandru is a shady character who owns a hotel. Roy and Dittu embark on a new journey? BLUFFMASTER! has its shares of highs and lows all through those two hours. Amongst the highs are a few individualistic sequences, which include the con jobs. Abhishek Bachchan excels in a role that demands a powerful performer. The actor carries off the part of a suave conman with style. Nana Patekar leaves you spellbound. He infuses life in the narrative with his sheer presence. Priyanka Chopra does an honest job. Ritesh Deshmukh is first-rate, a complete brat. The youngster is only maturing with every release. Boman Irani is always one to watch out for. His dying scene had the whole cinema fighting for breath.But on the whole, BLUFFMASTER! is too western a film for the Indian masses to absorb/soak up. Hence, its appeal would be restricted to the multiplexes of metros mainly. At best, BLUFFMASTER! might appeal to a tiny section of moviegoers that has an appetite east an west connection films. For the wide majority, who are used to the staple diet of entertainers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again it all boils down to expectations. I went in expecting a 5 and came out with a 5. The movie was just too predictable. One other thing that i think all bollywood movies suffer from is this western hangover. The movie has toooo much English to much COOL, and too much style. That makes it very difficult to identify with the characters, the plot holes are numerous, but are excusable in this sort of movie. by far the best and most lovable part of the movie is nana patekar who steals the show. even ritesh deshmukh is decent and i see a bright future for him as a second actor. abhishek bachan is victim of his own stardom and i constantly got the feeling that they spent to much time making him cool and stylish and using English dialogues (honestly which people who sit in the stall in India understands all that?) and forgot that there also is the story. Also this movie suffers from the all destroying factor of the predictable ending and gutless one at that ( just by making the ending with some more B*&amp;^s they could have improved the movie by 2 stars). But the movie is refreshing and original concept and the soundtrack and nana patekar make the movie worth seeing once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait for the DVD, get to soundtrack CD though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment I left the theater up to now, I still haven't been able to figure what feeling this movie left me with. It has several good things to speak about and some..well not so good. AB's baby has come a long way from the refuge of the Big B and has cemented his space as a star in Bolywood. Nana Patekar gives a splendid performance and nothing less could be expected from him either. There is little of Priyanka Chopra that people have not seen and in this movie they see even less of her which is actually a good thing. Boman Irani is a great actor in general but this is a performance which he would do good to forget. The surprise package of this movie, though, is Rietesh D. He carries his part to the T as the stumbling silly and lost protégé. He does seem to have a strange kind of charm about him which is easily noticeable in this movie. What leaves me dumb-found is the movie in itself. It is funny in parts and serious in all the wrong places. You keep getting this feeling being in a warp zone of some kind and you keep leaving your stomach behind. This is not for the excitement but just an uneasy feeling which makes you shift in your seat time and again. Sometimes the story tries too hard and at other times it just seems to not want to try at all. For instance the some of the gags are a bit much and the romance between Simi and Roy just falls flat. You begin to wonder somewhere along weather it would have been OK to just buy the soundtrack (which BTW is awesome) and pass up the movie but just then it pulls itself together and there you have it. Rohan Sippy seems to manage the last bit somehow again going a bit too far but just enough to make sure he rakes in the mullah. Not really a waste of money or time but I would much rather have watched this movie at home on a DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of the greg jacob;s movie criminal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indian movie makers seem to have to inspiration but Hollywood when it comes to making their cinema. This movie the bluff master is a scene to scene remake of the greg jacobs 2004 comedy "CRIMINAL".It basically revolves on the premise of the sheep eating the wolf! the movie is well acted but falls short on the script at many levels. Abhishek Bachhan is fabulous though an comes across as really natural in the movie. good time pass if you wanna see it once. The only way to come see the movie is if you come unintitated as to the ending of the movie. Most people would be bored for throughout the movie (just as in the original CRIMINAL) but for the last 10 minutes which make sense of watching the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another time-pass flick from Bollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who have not seen the original (and I suspect there are a lot of them in India) this is a copy of 'Matchstick Men' starring Nicholas Cage, Sam Rockwell and Alison Lohman.The story is about Roy (even the central character is identical as if they're giving us a hint!) who cons everyone until he takes a protégé, played here by Ritesh Desmukh. When Roy learns of his life-threatening brain tumor (how convenient for the scriptwriter!), he decides to pull off the last "big one" by conning hotelier Chandru (Nana Patekar). What happens next is what happens with every other B-movie. So don't hold your breath.Bollywood's gotten so brazen and shameless at copying it is appalling. Recently, Bunty Aur Babli was copied from Bonnie and Clyde, Dansh is a copy of Death and the Maiden, Kante was a mish-mash of Reservoir Dogs/ Usual Suspects, and on and on and on. And that Bhansali idiot never did acknowledge the credits for his Black, nor obtained the rights. After that miserable piece of crock, he's been 'Black'-listed as yet another bogus, B-grade Bollywood wannabe.Boy, when and where will these third-rate thieves stop??? This is worse than Chinese piracy where they just sell copies of the original but not try to re-invent it! At least you can try to enforce copyright laws if only as deterrent. How do you stop these so-called "slight adaptations" and "loosely based ons" Indian filmmakers are getting away with??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's the point in remaking a film from a different angle. The film seems to lack the integrity of the Hollywood original. But, let me tell you, I've no mind or mood to compare Abhishek Bachchan with Nicholas Cage. Although Sippy gets the plot different, the storyline is similar and Bluffmaster ends up as a ripped-off version of Matchstick Men. Priyanka Chopra! Your beauty knows no bounds. But the plunging necklines fail to captivate as the story is bland and easily predictable.Kay Kay Menon's megalomaniac-like act is actually boring. Mouthing dialogs irregardless of the situation, I wonder if Menon had tailored the role for himself. The three stars would later act in a fantasy- misadventure called Drona which would become another large scale disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...of course they had to change some scenes to make it suitable for an Indian audience... who they think are idiots and will not know any better.These bollywood guys have no conscience. They think no one will know. This time they copied an Argentinian film. They are full of crap. The original is much better and a lot more engaging as well as without all the rap music and other songs.When you find something inspiring, you don't go and copy it, rather you should get inspired by it and create your own work. I once saw a festival of Satyajit Ray films. A lot of his films were inspired by Hollywood films. With each film that was inspired, they showed us the original Hollywood film too. Ray was creative enough to make a film that did not look like the original at all and yet you could tell where the inspiration came from. It is not even that these bollywood guys don't have brains... it is just that they don't like to use their brains. The original was made in Spanish in 2000 and is called "Nine Queens".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Copy of "Nine Queens"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When will Indian movie makers learn to give up copying foreign plots?? This is a lift of "Nine Queens" an excellent Latino film I had seen some years back. I guess the writer / director had one thing in mind "how to get a 1:30 Hr film to be a 2:10 Hr film", for that they arbitrarily threw in songs and boring plots and scenes. Boman for e.g. when explaining to Abhishek to live life the fullest is rather a drag. Everything from story, theme and camera movement are copied and does not suit the movie or the actors at all. I hear this movie is a box office success - ah well that goes to show what formula works for Indian cinema. This is only going to prompt other Indian directors and producers to attempt copies. So when Indian cinema takes 1 step forward (Rang De Basante) it is also thrown back 10 steps by movie attempt such as this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AB jr riding high on success of his last three flicks, suddenly finds himself with a solo-release. Thankfully his support team helps him to to the balancing act. Snazzily shot, it starts off like a kid in a candy shop, not sure which candy to pick. After his first con, there's the wedding and the subsequent breakup. It happens too fast. But on the flip side, thats when the story starts. In a bid to leave his past behind Jr decides to groom a sidekick as his worthy successor. To see how the events unfold you have to see the movie. The ending is interesting but instead to ending where Matchstick Men ends, the director prefers to Indianize and justify the climax and falls flat. Jr is in fine form, but badly needs a shave. Its the same look now in a couple of films and he needs to take care. Lady love is a wasted effort. Sidekick is actually a pleasant revelation, playing with his parameters he comes up trumps. Patekar is brilliant and Boman Irani is surprisingly relegated to the sidelines What could have been a brave movie, ends up as an also ran.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie lazily zig-zags like a car with a sleepy driver.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another mediocre fare that Bollywood so consistently churns out. After watching this movie, one of my friends asked me what I thought about it. That is very difficult to answer, as the movie gives me absolutely nothing to think about. It's not bad that I may criticize it and point out all the places it fell flat on its face. Neither is it good that I may praise it. It walks a very thin line.The titular conman (Abhishek Bachchan) loses his love when she (Priyanka Chopra) dumps him upon realizing what he really does. The depressed hero, now a victim of Brain Tumour (haha!) with 3 months to live, takes on an apprentice (Ritesh Deshmukh) and teaches him to con the father of all con men (Nana Patekar). Boman Irani does a Boman Irani as the dying hero's doctor.This movie lazily zig-zags like a car with a sleepy driver. Just when it gets into masala-territory, the director (Rohan Sippy) wakes up and puts it back on track, comfortably falling into his snooze again. It ends up being neither a comfortable drive, nor a thrilling one. Rohan is a childhood friend of Abhishek - they attended school together. The director uses this understanding of his lead actor to ensure he gets a good performance out of him, but most of the other times, he's done really not much.From Refugee to Bunty Aur Babli via Yuva, AB Jr has performed well in all kinds of roles - from comedy to intense drama - except Romance. Here, Abhishek is good as a conman, but fails miserably as the loser lover. This man needs to go a long way before he can convincingly play a lover boy. Nana Patekar falls deep into his own dug hole - overacting. Priyanka &amp; Boman do a day's job.All in all, watching this movie adds no value, but doesn't waste the 2:30hrs either.My Rating ?&gt; 2.5/5 p.s. : Before the opening credits of the movie, the makers thank a host of people, most prominently Sanjay Dutt &amp; Aishwarya Rai. Both these actors were the first choice of the director for this movie, but the stars couldn't commit. It would be nice to know why the director thanks them.</fullReview>
