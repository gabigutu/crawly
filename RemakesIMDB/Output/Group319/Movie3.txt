		<fullReview>I think I've really enjoyed the movie "Gulumaal". I like VKP's film making style. But it was a surprise to find out that this is heavily adapted from Fabian Belinsky directed "Nine Queens" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247586) starring Argentinian actor Ricardo Darin. Despite the adaptation, Y.V. Rajesh has worked hard to localize the plot. Its good to watch movies with fresh themes. But not likely movies adapted from World Cinema. Inspiration is good to an extent, but translating the movie plot is not advisable. Fabian Belinsky impressed us with his thrillers. Do checkout his "El Aura" its another great movie by the director.</fullReview>
