		<shortDescription>One of my favorite Stage to film transfers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite feel good movies. I first saw it when it as the Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall when it first came out and loved it ever since. I ended up seeing it 6 times in the theaters, and if it was playing today I'd go out to see it again.Now a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads. Matthau was brilliant, but had the misfortune of being nominated against Jack Nicholson's Oscar winning performance of Randall P. MacMurphy in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest. Burns did win, though Richard Benjiman deserved at least to be nominated as well. Even the smallest roles were played to perfection, like Fritz Feld auditioning for the potato chips commercial. Which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film, the direction of the greatly underrated Herbert Ross. Ross who previously brought a two person play, "The Owl And The Pussycat" to the screen and made a full movie out of it, does it again. He opens the plays out without making them look like a photographic stage play. He fleashens out the story and the characters.Here we're 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play, where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special. Though there are dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes, the sequence itself is totally new. A few years ago I did see at the broadway revival of the play with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, which was wonderful. But I think that Ross and screenwriter, playwright Simon improved on it. It's just a wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Works from Matthau and Burns...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>in one of Neil Simon's best plays. Creaky, cranky ex-Vaudeville stars played by Walter Matthau and George Burns are teaming up for a TV comedy special. The problem is they haven't even SEEN each other in over a decade. Full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes, this story flies along with a steady stream of humor. Good work also by Richard Benjamin as the harried nephew, Rosetta LeNoire as the nurse, and Howard Hesseman as the TV commercial director. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller appear as themselves. Trivia note: The opening montage contains footage from Hollywood Revue of 1929 and shows Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards, and the singing Brox Sisters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE SUNSHINE BOYS (1975) ***1/2 Walter Matthau, George Burns, Richard Benjamin. (Cameos: Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller). Extremely funny and warm-hearted adaptation of Neil Simon's play about two stubborn vaudevillians teaming up one last time for a tv special despite the fact they haven't spoken to one another in years. Matthau is a riot ("Ehnntaaaahhh!") but Burns, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, resurrected his career and became an icon in entertainment. Incidentally, Burns took this role when his best friend, Jack Benny (who was initially cast), died. Look for small roles by Howard Hesseman and F.Murray Abraham.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matthau is hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember originally seeing this film at Radio City Music Hall when it came out. I didn't really understand the humor back then, but this movie can make me laugh out loud.With all due respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau really deserved the Oscar for this film. His performance is amazing--given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. His mannerisms are first-rate. ("You know what kind of songs he wrote? Sh*t!" and when speaking to the Spanish-speaking guy at the front desk: "No! No! No enchilada!!") Absolutely hilarious!Kudos to Richard Benjamin, who played straight man to Matthau.I just wish this was on DVD, because my VHS recording is getting a bit old.I had no interest in seeing the remake with Woody Allen, because in no way can it match the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Final "Voyage of Discovery" of Lewis and Clark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neil Simon's THE ODD COUPLE set up a model for many of his later plays. Felix Unger and Oscar Madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original, the former being picky and neat, the latter being slovenly and loose. Simon would rewrite (less successfully) the play in the 1990s as THE NEW ODD COUPLE, with female roommates. He made it a mixed couple (a woman with her daughter, and a man) in THE GOODBYE GIRLS. He also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with THE SUNSHINE BOYS, a Broadway hit starring Jack Alberson and Sam Levine as Al Lewis and Willie Clark, the aged, semi-retired Vaudevillians. Here the "apartment" problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who can't stand each other. The 1976 film starred Walter Matthau as Willie, and George Burns as Al.In actuality, Al probably does not think totally badly of Willie - Willie is pathological on the subject of Al. First Al had little habits, such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter "t", and slightly jabbing Willie with his index finger, on stage. Secondly, Al retired when his wife died. Willie was not ready to retire (and has been forcing his nephew and agent, Ben (Richard Benjamin) to try to get him jobs in commercials. But Willie can't remember lines unless they are funny, and keeps flubbing them. So he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial.Ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about American Comedy. He does bring Al to see Willie, and the sparks begin flying, as neither can figure out what the other is doing (and this is just in rehearsal. On top of that, Willie is insisting on changes (minor ones, but they throw off Al) such as saying "ENTER!!!" when Al knocks on the door. The initial rehearsal is a failure, but Ben manages to get them to the taping of the show. The question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will Willie wring Al's neck?The three leads, Matthau, Burns, and Benjamin, do very well with the one-liners, frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter (example: "Chest pains...I'm getting chest pains Uncle Willie. Every Thursday I come here and get chest pains!" "So, come on Fridays!"). Benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle, although Matthau's rough outer shell makes it difficult (he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville). Matthau has a little better grasp on reality (at first) than Burns, who seems senile by his repeating himself - but in actuality Matthau's sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly. Burns is not senile - he takes things slowly. But he seems far happier in accepting his retirement.I call this a final "Voyage of Discovery" for our modern Lewis and Clark. Al and Willie transcend their old skits, as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought. Even the irascible Willie admits that Al may be (to him) a pain in the ass, but he was a funny man.Burns was not the original choice for the part of "Al Lewis" (supposedly Dale of the team Smith and Dale). Jack Benny was. Benny probably would have done a good job, but ill-health forced him out (he died in 1975). Burns (whose last involvement in any film was in THE SOLID GOLD CADILLAC in 1956 as the narrator) turned in such a fine performance that he got the "Oscar" for best supporting actor, and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as OH GOD!; OH GOD, YOU DEVIL; and GOING IN STYLE. He died in 1996 age 100, having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife Gracie Allan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amazing accomplishment for George Burns. He had not made a film for almost 40 years and had never really acted before, and yet he gave one of the most moving performances I have ever seen in a motion picture. He was the oldest performer to ever win an Academy Award for best supporting actor and I think it would behoove acting students to study his wonderful performance. Neil Simon is one of my favorite writers and I think this is his best work. Burns and Matthau make movie magic and it is a delight from start to finish to see these two old pros at work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With All the Sunshine Willie and Al Spread..................................</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking over roles that Jack Albertson and Sam Levene played on Broadway, Walter Matthau and George Burns play a couple of old time vaudeville comics, a team in the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale who seem to have a differing outlook on life.Walter Matthau can't stop working, the man has never learned to relax, take some time and smell the roses. He's a crotchety old cuss whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin is finding less and less work for him. What hurt him badly was that some 15 years earlier his partner George Burns decided to retire and spend some time with his family. A workaholic like Matthau can't comprehend it and take Burns's decision personally.Benjamin hits on a brain storm, reunite the guys and do it on a national television special. What happens here is pretty hilarious.The Sunshine Boys is also a sad, bittersweet story as well about old age. Matthau is on screen for most of the film, but it's Burns who got the kudos in the form of an Oscar at the ripe old age of 79.Burns brought a bit of the personal into this film as well. As we all know he was the straight man of the wonderful comedy team of Burns&amp;Allen who the Monty Python troop borrowed a lot from. In 1958 due to health reasons, Gracie Allen retired and George kept going right up to the age of 100. Or at least pretty close to as an active performer.The Sunshine Boys is based on the team of Smith&amp;Dale however and if you like The Sunshine Boys I strongly recommend you see Two Tickets to Broadway for a look at a pair of guys who were entertaining the American public at the turn of the last century. The doctor sketch that Matthau and Burns do is directly from their material.And I do think you will like The Sunshine Boys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matthau-Burns-Simon--A Winning Troika</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simon's carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by Matthau and Burns. You can literally hear the script crackle. There are few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script. For example, the famed reunion scene could have been a lot duller with less-quality actors involved. Matthau seems to had been born to play Willie Clark (of course, Oscar moreso in the Odd Couple), and with all of the little idiosyncracies and mannerisms that Matthau crams into the character (the line where he is arguing that he is with it since he lives in the city whereas Lewis lives in the country that Lewis is "out of touch" is the quintessential example of this) make this one of the best performances I've ever seen of any actor in any role, be it comedic or drama or whatever else. Period. Matthau and Burns work excellently together; the contrast they portray accentuates Simon's superb knack at creating comedic conflict. This movie is simply one of the ultimate "must-sees" and does demand a rightful prestigious place in the pages of film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceedingly hilarious, very warm, and one of my favorite comedies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hilarious Neil Simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end. The late Walter Matthau is the grouchy ex-comedian who is persuaded to join together with his ex-partner (the late Oscar-winner George Burns) for a final reunion show on stage.Benjamin Martin is Matthau's agent and nephew, and the two have just as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love Matthau's grumpy character--he's just the same as he always is, and yet also very different.Burns, as the absent-minded old man, is just as funny as Matthau.Matthau: Want some crackers? I've got coconut, pineapple and graham.Burns: How about a plain cracker?Matthau: I don't got plain. I got coconut, pineapple and graham.Burns: OkayMatthau: They're in the cupboard in the kitchen.Burns: Maybe later.Or how about this:Matthau: When I did black, the whites knew what I was saying!You've got to see it in the movie to understand it!All in all, a refreshingly hilarious, sweet, heartfelt, warm, believable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. They just don't make them like this anymore! In a time when all the newest comedies are crude, juvenile and stupid, this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really is--funny characters, smart and funny dialogue, and grand entertainment.One of the best buddy comedies of all time, right up there with "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," "Lethal Weapon," and "The Hard Way."You may have a hard time finding this for rent or on TV, but trust me, it will be worth your time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fairly good film, but slack editing a and a rambling script stops this from achieving greater things. A good performance (as usual) by Matthau as a grump, but especially good was that of George Burns, with some fantastic one-liners and acidic put downs - his timing and deadpan delivery was excellent. Although maybe the physical side was a bit miscast (Matthau towers over Burns), the verbal performances were great and made up for it.After all the huffing and puffing the actual 'Doctor' sketch was not all that good, a shame that when compared to the rest of the dialogue, the wit was missing from it.Enjoyable for a one-off viewing, be prepared to fidget at times but perseverence is rewarded.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Wonder They Hated Each Other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise is simple: two old men were members of a vaudeville duo decades ago and broke up acrimoniously, but now the nephew of one wants them to reunite for a television special to showcase one of their acts. Reluctantly, they agree, though they had not met or spoken in twenty years. Once together, however, they find they still dislike one another.The big problem with the story is that it was written in the 1970's and takes place contemporaneously, while vaudeville effectively died out many years before the storyline's breakup would have taken place. Also, Matthau's character is a nasty man-nasty to everyone, even the nurse who takes care of him when he becomes ill. He's supposed to be the protagonist of the story, but I found no reason whatever to like him, or for anyone to want to have anything to do with him. The story would have been more credible if the televised reunion had fallen through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not a drop of sunshine in "The Sunshine Boys", which makes the title of this alleged comedy Neil Simon's sole ironic moment. Simon, who adapted the script from his play (which goes uncredited), equates old age with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for 43 years, which begs the question "how long did vaudeville last, anyway?"). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of Neil Simon's screenplays; here, Ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent Matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give "The Sunshine Boys" some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf. The picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace; one loses hope for it early on. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Neil Simon's Best Screen Adaptations...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE SUNSHINE BOYS was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of Neil Simon's play about a retired vaudevillian team, played by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that. The problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other. Richard Benjamin appears as Matthau's nephew, a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality. This warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainment...vaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of Neil Simon's better screenplays and outstanding work by Matthau, Burns, and Benjamin. Burns won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this, but I think Matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for Best Actor but didn't stand a chance against Nicholson for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST; however, in another year, this was an Oscar-worthy performance. Matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance. The scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and can't get the name of the product right is a classic. THE SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm and winning Neil Simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between Matthau and Burns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richard Benjamin's Finest Hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just because most of Neil Simon's work doesn't appeal to me doesn't mean he never hits the bullseye. I've always loved his brassier, vaudeville-inspired early work; this movie, for one, is just out to make you laugh. There are 'serious' moments, but they're not destinations, just short bridges to more one-liners. For some, this represents artistic laziness, but Simon doesn't do serious or introspective well at all: he's a seltzer bottle in an age of plastic Evian containers. SUNSHINE BOYS is one of the funniest films to have emerged from the 70s. Simon is here working with archetypes as familiar to him as an old shoe; comfortably in his element, he whips up a consistently hilarious 100+ minutes. Matthau and Burns are great, but you already knew that; Richard Benjamin, however, is the film's secret weapon. Some of the biggest laughs in the film are his, such as the closeup of his face in the elevator following Matthau's blown audition for the potato-chip commercial that opens the film. His face has an utterly blank, almost zen look of serenity-in-utter-failure. His scene at the Friars Club, desperately pleading with Burns on the phone while Matthau harangues him outside the phone booth, is perfection. The chemistry between Benjamin and the two leads is actually better than that between Burns and Matthau. (Although their scenes are hilarious, the climactic "Doctor sketch" is subpar burlesque, nowhere near the quality of buffoonery we'd been led to expect.) It's a disappointment, but a small one. The rest of the film is highly satisfying; as a bonus, there's great NYC location shooting (always a plus in any movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old and Grumpy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three themes running through this Neil Simon comedy: (1) Jokes about the forgetful condition and other deficits of old people, (2) Resentment between two Jewish ex-vaudevillians (Matthau and Burns), and (3) The problems inherent in organizing a presentation of their famous medical sketch for a reunion on a television special on the history of comedy.They're all reasonably well handled. It's like "The Odd Couple" forty years on, only this time with a mediator, Richard Benjamin as Matthau's agent/nephew, the harried young man with the chest pains.Both men may be frail and scatterbrained but Burns is at least sane, while Matthau's character is a bitter curmudgeon filled with dislike and sometimes outright contempt for everyone, even those who try to help him. He can be dangerously out of control too, hobbling around after Burns with a kitchen knife, crashing into the furniture.It's not as funny as "The Odd Couple" though, not in the same way at any rate. Some of the gags seem a little forced and others, not forced, aren't especially amusing. Example: Benjamin opens the door when Burns knocks and says, "Oh, how are you, Mr. Lewis? Come in." And Burns replies, "How are you, I'm Al Lewis." That's funny? The same kind of ritualistic exchange is derailed over and over.The vaudeville sketch we see has gags that are so crusty with age that it's difficult to imagine that people once paid to see them. And it ends with a deus ex heart attack, which signals not only a collapse of the body but of the writer's imagination.Still, Simon hasn't lost his touch with verbal gags. "I'm okay," Burns tells Matthau at their first meeting in years. "The blood still circulates. It doesn't circulate EVERYWHERE but it circulates." Matthau gets off this impossible tirade when Burns visits him in New York and demands that, in the sketch, Matthau use the phrase "Come in," instead of "Enter." "You know the trouble with you? You're out of touch. I look out this window and I see everything. I see people scrounging, running. I see traffic. I see car crashes. I see murders. I see fighting. I see jumpers off roofs! You sit on your porch and you see a lawnmower. You see the milkman!" Burns: "And that's why you won't say 'Come in'?"Matthau's minor cardiac spasm leads to a warmer, though ironic, conclusion. Matthau is finally convinced that he should set up his life in a new setting, a home for retired actors in New Jersey. He's convalescing at home and is visited by Burns, who informs him that, now that his (Burns') daughter is going to have a baby, he's going to leave her house and live in a home for retired actors in New Brunswick, New Jersey. "I hope you'll come visit me," he says. "You can count on it," Matthau replies, burying his head under the covers.It has more sentiment than "The Odd Couple" and its comedy, except for Matthau's outright lunacy, is less barbed. Matthau is great as he slouches around his cluttered New York apartment in a bathrobe, mumbling to himself.You'll probably enjoy it, and thank God Matthau's character doesn't die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Neil Simon's more accessible &amp; enjoyable screen adaptions. Two old style vaudeville stars agree to reform for a TV special, even though off-screen they hate each other's guts. And it's up to Richard Benjamin, (Matthau's nephew &amp; hard working TV agent), to somehow get them to bury their differences just for this one shot.A lovely story made perfect for both Matthau &amp; Burns. To my shame I haven't seen many of Burns' old movies and after seeing him shine so brightly here makes me feel I've missed out on a wonderfully talented gentleman.Matthau is always in top form in these kind of Simon comedies: notably Plaza Suite &amp; The Odd Couple. Matthau works best with Jack Lemmon but the exception is made big style in this movie with Burns sweeping the floor (and the honours) with all before him.The comedy is gentle rather than slapstick or too kinetic, which really matches the acting qualities of the two ageing stars. The script in general moves at a steady pace in spite of the fact the backdrop involves the fast moving, cut-throat world of TV programming.The last 30 minutes becomes slightly more dramatic and the satire is more biting than earlier. But the film never runs out of steam or moves out of focus. Neither stars dominate the screen although it's fair to say that Matthau's physical presence sometimes over powers the frail old man of Burns, and yet the elder statesman returns the favour with a much more intelligent &amp; humourous choice of lines.A great film which I heartily recommend to anyone who likes gentle comedies, great script and wonderful acting****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The word 'classic' is thrown around too loosely nowadays, but this movie well deserves the appelation. The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (possibly the world's best living comic actor), and the late lamented George Burns make for a comic masterpiece. It is interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been like had not death prevented Jack Benny from playing George Burns' part, as had been planned. As it is, the reunion scene in Matthau's apartment is not likely to be surpassed as a sidesplitter. Definitely one of my desert island films."Enter!!!!!!!!!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Modern day viewers probably won't catch much of a buzz watching this film today. I was a fan of the principals during their heyday and George Burns is one of my all time favorites for his understated style and whimsical humor. He was the perfect foil for Gracie Allen's zany temperament.However I had a bit of a problem with this picture because of Walter Matthau's characterization of Willy Clark. It just seemed too heavy handed for me since Willy and Al Lewis (George Burns) worked together for forty three years, and you'd expect that they would have developed a more amiable rivalry in their relationship. Say along the lines of Matthau and Jack Lemmon in "The Odd Couple". I was expecting at some point a genuine show of affection between Willy and Al but it just didn't materialize until the heart attack, and even then it seemed pretty one sided with Burns' character.Through it all, there was some good material buried under the dialog that would have seemed more clever with an upbeat delivery. I never thought about individual letters of the alphabet being funny or not. In it's way, the business about the letter 'K' was rather inspired, and the apparent random shuffling of the chairs in Willy's apartment looked like the ex-vaudevillians were improvising; I wouldn't be surprised if they were. If only the film makers had lightened things up a bit, I'd offer an extra dollar on the toll bridge to watch it again.</fullReview>

This is not a film for viewers who don't appreciate slow films. It is neither a slow film per se nor does it feature a quick succession of events. This Herbert Ross film starts in a slow manner but gathers pace as the story progresses. If one says that the life of an old person is difficult, one can only imagine how difficult would the lives of two creative old men be. There is a lot for audiences as a lot of questions are raised about actors especially their lives and acting methods. It is said that old people are left to fend for themselves. However, one has to appreciate the dedication with which a young nephew takes care of his old uncle. Lastly, a viewer would remember this film as an excellent creative endeavor aimed at depicting true feelings of actors who are past their prime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great biting relationship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) used to be a famous vaudeville comedy duo. Agent Ben Clark (Richard Benjamin) struggles to help his grumpy absent-minded uncle Willy. ABC wants to do a variety show of comedy history and they want both Lewis and Clark. They can't stand each other and haven't seen each other in 11 years. Al has been living the quiet life with his daughter in New Jersey. Ben needs to convince them both to reunite for just one night.I find Willy Clark more sad than funny. He is super grumpy and his bitterness doesn't make it easy to like him. He needs more loveability. It takes away from some of the comedy early on. George Burns is funnier. He's so deadpan. I love the Ah-stick. When the two of them get together, they are hilarious. Matthau's grumpy old man and Burns' biting remarks fit perfectly. The duo is a comedy master class. Their rehearsal together is comedy insanity. The movie with them apart isn't quite as funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without doubt, one of my all-time favourite funny men has to be the late, great Walter Matthau. That marvellous deadpan face combined with his unmistakable, gawky walk used to have me in fits of laughter. He was at his best in Neil Simon comedies such as 'The Odd Couple' ( 1968 ), and, of course, this, also based on a stage play. He plays 'Willy Clark' an elderly comedian who, back in the days of vaudeville, was half of a popular double act with 'Al Lewis' ( George Burns ). Lewis retired at the height of their fame, feeling the act had gone about as far as it could. Willy disagreed, and tried to keep working but failed to make it as a solo act ( an audition for a commercial for Krumpies' potato chips goes wrong when Willy nearly chokes on the things ). The two men have not spoken in years. Al is now in a home while Willy lives on his own. Ben ( the excellent Richard Benjamin ), Willy's nephew and agent, tries to bring the pair together to recreate a classic dentist sketch for a television tribute to the vaudeville era. But the acrimony has not died with the passage of time. Al annoys Willy in other ways, such as prodding him in the chest with his finger during arguments and unintentionally spitting on him. When they meet after all these years, the insults fly thick and fast...Directed by Herbert Ross, this lovely movie saw the welcome return of George Burns to the big screen. His laid-back delivery contrasts nicely with Matthau's more manic approach. "If you were on fire you still wouldn't be hot!" he tells Willy at one point. His Oscar for 'Best Supporting Actor' enabled him to make a long overdue comeback, appearing in, amongst other things, Larry Gelbart's 'Oh God!' ( 1977 ). Lee Meredith, the busty nurse in the dentist sketch, was 'Ulla' in Mel Brooks' 'The Producers' ( 1968 ).What you have in this film are two wonderfully funny men sparring on screen, each equipped with an arsenal of witty Neil Simon dialogue. What more could you want?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the film version of Neil Simon's play "The Sunshine Boys". According to IMDb, they originally wanted to cast Jack Benny in the film but he couldn't do it due to bad health. It sure might have been a very different movie had they been able to go with this original casting decision.The film begins with a young agent, Ben (Richard Benjamin), waiting for his Uncle Willie (Walter Matthau) to meet him at a tryout for a commercial. But, the elderly Willie has not shown--much of this due to his senility. When he does show, an hour late, he is totally unprepared and totally botches the ad. Yet, despite Willie being completely uncooperative and hard to like, Ben keeps trying again and again to help his uncle find work. Eventually, Ben comes up with an absolutely insane idea--reunite Willie with his old Vaudeville partner, Al (George Burns). The problem with this notion is that Willie and Al hate each other with an intensity that dwarfs the hatred between Lincoln and Booth! To make things worse, both are extremely senile and difficult--and seem to delight in tormenting each other. Can these two super-annoying men manage to put aside their animosity in order to make a reunion appearance on TV?While George Burns received an Oscar for his performance, he was clearly not the leading man in the film--hence his Best Supporting Actor award. The film's pivotal character was Willie--with Matthau clearly throwing himself into the bigger-than-life role. While significantly younger than his character, he managed to do a great job playing perhaps the most crotchety old man in history. While there were very, very few scenes of Burns without Matthau in the film, Matthau was in practically every minute of the film...and made the most of it.The film is a must-see for fans of classic comedy and Vaudeville. However, some viewers might be a tad put off by the film's 1970s sensibilities--with lots of cursing. However, the language was true to the characters--they were really nasty old #^$!(!!s. Excellent acting, script and also a lot of fun.By the way, Neil Simon and the rest really did a good job of re-creating the whole look and style of the comedy duo. So much of it was reminiscent of the act of Smith and Dale. Plus, I loved such snippets as the visit to the deli and the bag from Zabar's Jewish market--nice little New York touches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For any who are interested in learning the art of acting in comedy, this is the film to watch. And the performances almost didn't happen.Certainly, there is the Academy Award winning performance of George Burns. As many know, the role of Al Lewis became his after the death of his best friend, Jack Benny. Benny was set to start filming when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Burns struggled with his decision, but finally chose to do it as a tribute to Benny. Remarkably, his performance makes you wonder how anyone else could have been considered. Sans his usual toupee and cigar, Burns essays a deft performance as the quieter, more retiring half of the vaudeville act. His opening scene opposite Richard Benjamin is beautifully played, as he tries to shake off his befuddlement. His final scene demonstrates his very legitimate abilities as an actor. But his greatest accomplishment is not being overshadowed by a greater performance.Walter Matthau's Willy Clark is one of the greatest performances by an actor in a comic role ever captured on film. This is not a performance by a comedian. This is acting in comedy, something much harder. It is complete, filled with nuance, subtleties, and bombast all at once, but never losing its reality. The heat was with Jack Nicholson that year, and his performance in "One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest." Unfortunately, that meant that perhaps the greatest opportunity for the Academy to reward acting in comedy was lost. And the performance itself nearly didn't happen.A few years prior, Matthau received an Oscar nomination for playing an old man, the title character in "Kotch," directed by his friend and frequent co-star, Jack Lemmon. He asked Neil Simon to be considered for "The Sunshine Boys." Older actors, such as James Cagney, Phil Silvers, and even Bob Hope (as part of a Hope-Crosby pairing) were considered. Finally, Matthau and Benny were chosen. Ultimately, it became Matthau and Burns, a blessing for moviegoers.Matthau accomplishes a most rare and difficult feat for an actor: Making an unpleasant character sympathetic and even lovable. He often said he based the character on his mother, who was a very dour person. And Willy is ferociously - and hysterically - unpleasant. He is the quintessential show business has-been, a guy who had some fame, and can't accept that he's lost it. From the opening scene, where he asked by an old acquaintance what he's doing in Time Square and barks back, "I'm working! What the hell are you doing?" to his berating the Japanese for the failure of his television, to the all-out warfare with his former partner, Matthau is the most hysterical bully in film history. He is all posturing and poses, refusing to give up his only love: Show business. If he doesn't get enough laughs with his tantrums, he has plenty of low-and-inside lines. Matthau runs the complete range of delivery, never overplaying, never reaching for comic effect, but keeping it a real acting performance.Richard Benjamin has long held the reputation of being a great utility guy in the business, not only as an actor, but as a director as well - he helmed the superb "My Favorite Year." He does a serviceable job as Willy's nephew/agent, hitting the right notes of exasperation, dedication, and love along the way. And he has the great taste not to try and top his two co-stars. He wasn't the first choice, either.For years, George Burns told a story in his stand-up act about working on "The Sunshine Boys." He said that the director, Herb Ross, told the actor playing the nephew that, at a certain point, he would go into the bathroom."Why?" the actor asked."Whaddya mean 'why?'" Ross replied."Well, if I'm going into the bathroom, I need to know what my motivation is." "You just had lunch." "What did I have?" "What did you have? Why does it matter what you had?" "Well, I need to know how long to stay in there." "I've changed my mind," said Ross. "Don't go into the bathroom." "Why not?" says the actor.Ross replied, "There won't be any room. The actor replacing you will be in there." Burns buttons the story by saying: "From then on, whenever Herb Ross looked at me, I went to the bathroom." George never said who the actor was, but Harvey Keitel was originally cast as the nephew. He was replaced by Richard Benjamin, who apparently never asked why he was going to the bathroom.The key ingredient to it all, of course, it Neil Simon's screenplay. This is the best of Simon, the guy who gave us the Great American Comedy, "The Odd Couple," the Brighton Beach trilogy, the original Heartbreak Kid, and "Lost in Yonkers." He is firing on all cylinders here and doesn't miss an opportunity for a great, memorable line. He once said this was his favorite film of any of his plays. His cast and Herb Ross's firm direction are good reasons for that accolade. But, he had to have known that it was some of his best writing, as well.With every new comedian, television show, or movie being hailed as "Comic Genius," "The Sunshine Boys" provides an example of the real thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matthau and Burns...A Class Act!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Matthau and George Burns were a famous vaudeville comedy act, Lewis and Clark, who haven't spoken in over 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau took it personally and has held a grudge ever since. Such is the premise of this hilarious Neil Simon play made into a movie. Of course, what makes it so good is Matthau and Burns in their prime, and the material is funnier than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines as Matthau's nephew and agent. There's even old clips of actual stars of the golden era to get you into the groove of the film, and character actor Fritz Feld starts it all off with a "pop." Rosetta LaNoire, who started out in the 30s in theater with Orson Welles and later was Grandma on "Family Matters," is great in a small role.The only problem I had with it (and maybe I'm being too picky and/or serious) is the way Matthau treats Burns when they first meet. Granted, he's had a lot of resentment festering in all these years, but some of the things he does would be considered rude or just plain bad manners taken out of context. Also, I'm used to seeing Matthau act that way in other movies, but not to George Burns. And, Matthau's bellowing tends to get a little old. All in all, if you need a consistently funny film to help and forget your troubles, put in "The Sunshine Boys." They'll lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and way of life.Benjamin: "You have to slide it." Matthau: "Wait, wait. I think you have to slide it."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laugh Before They Kill Each Other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like the comedy duo of its title, "The Sunshine Boys" has become a forgotten classic 30-odd years later. It's hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the 1970s. This makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film, perhaps the best Neil Simon ever wrote.Walter Matthau plays Willy Clark, once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as Lewis and Clark, now a bitter 73-year-old solo act who can't get a job in a potato chip commercial. His nephew and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) is sure he can get work if Willy will only agree to reunite with his estranged partner Al Lewis (George Burns) for an ABC-TV celebration of show business nostalgia.Nostalgia is what "Sunshine Boys" has going for it in spades, right from the start when a series of 1920s film clips showcasing various entertainers from long ago flickers before us to the accompaniment of Cole Porter's "Be A Clown". Then there's the film's present-day setting in Manhattan, where flared trousers and wide polyester ties abound. The periods collide in Willy's glorious mess of a Manhattan apartment, where framed photos and cartoons of long-dead celebrities stare out from the walls at lurid tabloid headlines and empty Zabar grocery bags. If you were alive in the 1970s like me, you might even feel like you were in that apartment.Willy clearly has been living there too long. He's sleeping in front of the television when the kettle in the other room boils. Willy wakes up and picks up the phone."Hello, who is this?" A pause. "Never mind, it's the tea."Old men living alone can be sad material in almost anyone else's hands, but Simon's deft wit and unerring feeling for character turns this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit into comedy gold. The amazing thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is how much it rubs your noses in Willy's almost existential condition without turning you off at all. "89 years old and just like that, he dies of nothing'" Willy says of one old songwriting friend, before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed "lady" with "baby".Burns won an Oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but steely Lewis, but it's Matthau who brings this one home, his make-up and proud but ragged bearing really selling you on the idea he was already 73 when he made this. Willy is obnoxious in the extreme, fully deserving Ben's description "crazy freakin' old man", but you root for him throughout, enjoying his small victories even when they come at the cost of others' patience. His lines kill you, too, especially when he's trying to kill Lewis, for whom the TV reunion turns out to be a bad idea."You're out of touch!" Willy tells Lewis at one point. "I'm still in demand. I'm still hot!""If this room was on fire you wouldn't be hot," Lewis replies.Director Herbert Ross shoots everything in a very casual and understated way, with low lighting and mid-range shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the film's overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance. You never get the feeling you are watching a movie, one of "The Sunshine Boys" many charms, and Ross's direction, like the acting of the three principals, goes a long way toward achieving that end.Comedy is hard, especially when the subjects are people watching life pass them by, but "The Sunshine Boys" makes it all seem a pleasure, because, for us watching, it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two great comedians in a great Neil Simon movie based on his hit play.Great combination, especially when the comedians in question are Matthau and Burns. Small wonder why Burns won an Oscar for this; he's as sharp and as funny as ever. And Matthau is every bit his match, if a tad more crotchety.This is familiar Simon territory: two old vaudeville partners reunite for a TV special but still can't stand one another after all these years.It's a delight to watch these two pick at each other, their scenes together make this film an absolute delight. Myself, I especially enjoyed the "knock, knock, knock / ENTER!" scene. And if you're a fan of either Burns or Matthau, you'll enjoy it, too.In fact, you'll enjoy the whole movie. Ten stars.

		<fullReview>I have always liked Walter Matthau, so it was very disappointing to see him in this film, made up to look much older and overacting tremendously. George Burns was much better, with his usual deadpan delivery. I suppose that this was kind of a preview of Matthau in "Grumpy Old Men". Dealing with those in their dotage, with the hearing loss, and memory loss, etc. is quite tiresome, and watching it in this movie was also quite tiresome. It is too bad, but the funny lines were not all that funny. I expected more from a Neil Simon script. Richard Benjamin was okay as the nephew/agent, and the direction was done nicely. But I was impatient for the film to end, and that pretty much says it all.</fullReview>

The scene when they meet again in Willy's flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection. Walter Matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian as only he can, the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization. George Burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film, his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable. Watch for the scene near the end when Al and his daughter ask something of the Spanish caretaker, and Al's reaction - priceless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lead characters in this film are rather annoying bickering old men and therefore they are hard to like, however Walter Matthau and George Burns do a good job playing them. It is rather predictable stuff, and lacking in witty and funny moments, especially for the par of a Neil Simon script. Yet, the quality of the acting makes the film watchable, and there are some quite good humorous bits - just not quite enough, especially considering how slow the film is to build up. Burns won an Academy Award for his performance, and even if he perhaps did not deserve to win it, he certainly deserved the nomination. This is a film to watch because of the acting, rather than the plot or the abilities of the director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite of all Matthau's film performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, an explanation: Despite my headline, I'm giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is NOT one of the best films ever made. All the criticisms registered here have valid points. Also, be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate Neil Simon's brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter. He does have a distinctively New York ear for dialogue -- especially dry, Jewish, love-suffused sarcasm -- and if you have trouble accepting sarcasm as an expression of love, then you might have trouble accepting the optimism at the heart of this movie.So much for warnings. Here's my main point: Walter Matthau is flat-out perfect, even beyond perfect, in this movie. I have never seen him funnier, or more touching for that matter -- because at the same time that he shows us the hilariousness of this character who refuses to give up his Big Star self-image or insufferable attitudes even as his coherence is in decline, he also shows us the more vulnerable, maybe even heartbreakingly scared person inside the grouch. And he only barely shows us that sad part -- it's just enough to really get to you if you happen to be coping with your own father's or husband's mental decline right now (I mention this as a warning), but artistically, it's just enough pathos to give this character the most authentically deep roots I'm seen in possibly any film performance. This is beyond Method acting -- Matthau's performance is exquisite as character work and a pure delight as comic delivery. This is a masterpiece of comic acting.About Richard Benjamin: I personally find his acting annoying in general, and his work in this movie is no exception -- although he has some fine moments here. ("Chicken is funny...." is one of them.) So if you like him, you should like him here, and if you don't this movie won't change your mind.About the 1976 Oscars...I agree that Matthau was unfortunate to be up against Nicholson in "Cuckoo's Nest" that year. It was a killer year for leading-actor competition; if only there were separate Oscars for comedy and drama, then I think the Best Actor Oscars would have gone to Al Pacino for "Dog Day Afternoon" and to Walter Matthau for "The Sunshine Boys" -- not to dis Jack's fine work as McMurphy, but I think that Pacino and Matthau were each CLEARLY more masterful and astoundingly effective and downright legendary in their performances than Nicholson was that year. Also, I believe that Burns got the Supporting Actor Oscar more for sentimental reasons than for the quality of his performance -- I mean, he was good in this movie, but not THAT good. (Burns's fine-as-ever but unexceptional-in-itself return to show biz beat Brad Dourif's truly brilliant debut in "Cuckoo's Nest," not to mention Chris Sarandon's stunning debut in "Dog Day Afternoon" -- which I think proves my theory.) Oscar theories aside, here's my bottom line review: If you like Matthau's comic acting, then see this movie and savor his powerhouse tirades and wonderful grandmother-inspired gestures, fleeting facial expressions and seemingly unscripted asides. (But if you're currently dealing with the pain of watching an old person lose his grip, then be warned that this movie might either be the comic relief you need or a dose of reality too painful to watch right now.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I dislike almost all Neil Simon movies. But there is something about this that is unique, that draws me in, and I would say it is among the most entertaining comedies I have seen. The second time I watched it, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers? Ah, afraid they might sue, so he changed them into men. And how dull would it be if they were only housewives, show biz stars is more fun. Well this is a personal review, and my still living grandmother at age 97 (she even outlived Walter Matthau's magnificent impersonation of her!)would deny it -- but some of you must find resonance in these characters.Secondly, I have little tolerance for George Burns, but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances I can recall (and my late grandmother even enjoyed it, although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film character).Very ethnic in flavor, and over the top, you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off. For me, the pleasure lingers.</fullReview>

The two actors are very believable and real and the their harmony seems almost as they real work together for all that time and that realty they not bear between them.

		<fullReview>An old vaudeville team of Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) were one of the best known but they broke up hating each other. Over 20 years later they agree to get together for a TV special...but find out they STILL hate each other. Willy's nephew/agent (Richard Benjamin) tries to get them to work together.A big hit in its day and it won George Burns an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I (somewhat) liked it. It was written by Neil Simon so its non-stop one-liners. Some of it was funny but making jokes of Willy and Al's senility was NOT. Also I never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way. Also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly. All that aside this was fun. Burns is just great tossing off one-liners with ease and even Matthau was good matching him. Their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie. Also Benjamin is very good as Willy's nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other. For me it's worth seeing for Burns alone. This jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had ANOTHER hit with "Oh God". So, this is good. Just good--not great. Matthau's character really makes this hard to love. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two ex-vaudevillians re-team for a TV special...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I forgot to mention--two "cranky" ex-vaudevillians to be exact.It's the cranky humorous jibes between WALTER MATTHAU and GEORGE BURNS (in his Oscar-winning role at 79), that makes the film. The supporting cast does what they can to keep things flowing at a smooth pace, but it's really almost a two-character story with Matthau and Burns both on their toes delivering some ripe lines.RICHARD BENJAMIN makes little impression as the nephew who comes up with the idea for a TV reunion. Matthau is the least accustomed to retirement, grudgingly stating that Burns retired "in the middle of my career." He has no use for the sort of contented retiremenet in the New Jersey suburbs that Burns has assumed, sitting around and waiting for his grandchildren to come home from school, etc.When it's all over, and you're pretty exhausted from laughing at the jokes, you might realize there's nothing really substantial about the plot. It's sort of like The Odd Couple facing their old age. Only occasionally does it stop and reflect with a tinge of sadness about the ramifications of age--but then it moves on to the next gag.Summing up: Good Neil Simon comedy knows how to brighten up the screen for awhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walter Matthau...genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's stagy, but good...THE SUNSHINE BOYS is vintage Neil Simon. George Burns may have won a (very nostalgic) Oscar for his performance, but Walter Matthau is the reason to see the film. He's hysterical. And unlike Burns, he's actually acting, giving a stellar performance as a man many years his senior and he dominates the movie. The director, Herbert Ross, keeps the movie moving at a brisk pace while allowing Matthau scene after priceless scene. Whether sparring with his no-nonsense nurse or with his infinitely patient nephew/agent (a very restrained Richard Benjamin) or, as the topper, dueling with former show-biz partner Burns, it's his show all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first this looked like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I got into it it turned out to be a really funny film. Basically forgetful ex-comedians Willy Clark (Golden Globe winner, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar winning, and Golden Glove nominated George Burns) were a great comedy duo, and a brought back together to revive their hospital sketch for a TV show. Willy's nephew, Ben Clark (Golden Globe winning Richard Benjamin) is confident they can get together again with no hard feelings for each other, how wrong he is. They cannot get on all the time, they are both forgetful, especially during conversation, but they do it eventually. Also starring Lee Meredith as Nurse in Sketch (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise as Mrs. Doris Green, Al's Daughter, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, Willy's nurse and Muppets from Space's F. Murray Abraham as Mechanic. I think the best line of the film is Burns mentioning that Matthau called him "a son of a bitch bastard". It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted From Other Material, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!</fullReview>
