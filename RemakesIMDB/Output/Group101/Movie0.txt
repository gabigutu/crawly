		<fullReview>David Carradine stars in this classic cult creation. Deathrace 2000 is the 20th anniversary of the murderous trans-continental road race, or, in the words of the US president "what you all want". You could lose this film in the repertoire of John Carpenter. If you're a Carpenter fan, you really need to see this. Much is made of Corman's production of this film, but this is really not a Corman film in any sense - except for its very obviously low budget. Paul Bartel (of Eating Raoul fame) deserves the directorial credit here, and he really did well given the mediocrity of the material he had to work with. Ostensibly, the film is about a race involving five participants - Frankenstein (Carradine), Machine Gun Joe Viterbo (Stallone), Calamity Jane (Woronov), Mathilda the Hunn, and Nero the Hero - all of comic book stature. They are joined by navigators who double as concubines, which, I suppose, illustrates the trust and intimacy a driver must have with any partner involved in a high speed transcontinental race where the goal is to kill as many pedestrians as possible along the way. About a quarter of the way through the film, it becomes clear that the real story is about the connection between the US government, religion, mass-produced violence and a resistance movement, all focused on either promoting or ending the race once and for all. As despicable as the empowered elite may be in this film, the critique of the media is even more scathing.Carradine is race hero Frankenstein. Sly Stallone plays his arch-rival Machine Gun Joe Viterbo, and an ensemble cast of fellow racers, media mavens, politicos, and willing and unwilling victims of "the great race" lend strong support. The acting is predictably campy and sometimes just a little too B grade. But the occasional pacing disaster just enhances the humor-value of the film. Stallone is particularly amusing, and gets great support from his sidekick. Carradine is typically bizarre, and even parodies himself with a few poorly choreographed kung fu techniques during his absurd fight scene with Stallone. As short as he is, Stallone is still a much larger and more fit man than Carradine, but gets handily whooped. The cinematographer makes no effort to hide the absurdity of this scene.The script for this film is a series of well-delivered clichés strung together with cleverly choreographed racing action sequences. As such, it parodies tough-guy talk in films and in real life. The photography is excellent, and on par with John Carpenter's straightforward visual subtlety.This film appears, at first blush, as a comedic celebration of violence. But it's really a very campy comment on the use of violence in sport and entertainment, as a way to distract and desensitize the public from serious issues such as economic stress, collectivist totalitarianism, the enshrinement of mediocrity, and "minority privilege" (a euphemism for rule by an entrenched powerful elite). The film is dated and does not need to be seen ten times to get it (though I just completed about my 12th viewing).The political messages are worth hearing, the humor is worth paying attention to, and, if it's your first time, you will likely find this movie quite entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This hilarious exploitation classic puts a smile on my face EVERY time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Death Race 2000', like 'Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls', 'The Omega Man', 'Repo Man' and 'Rock'n'Roll High School', is one of those dependable all time favourite trash classics that I watch regularly and never fail to get a smile out of. Anytime you're down just put 'Death Race 200' on and you're guaranteed to be cheered up! Directed by the late Paul Bartel ('Eating Raoul', 'Lust In The Dust')), co-produced by b-grade legend Roger Corman ('Bloody Mama', 'House Of Usher'), and co-written by Charles Griffith ('The Wild Angels', 'Little Shop Of Horrors'), this is simply one of the most enjoyable and entertaining exploitation movies of all time. The setting is the near future where a totalitarian regime keep the populace happy with a violent and extremely popular sport of hit and run car racing. The champion of the people is Frankenstein (David Carradine - 'Boxcar Bertha', 'Q') who has to race against a flamboyant group of rivals, led by his mortal enemy Machine-Gun Joe Viterbo (Sly Stallone!) who is intent on knocking him off the top. The other drivers include such cult figures as Mary Woronov ('Chopping Mall'), Roberta Collins ('Caged Heat'), Martin Kove ('The Karate Kid'), Leslie McRae ('Blood Orgy Of The She Devils') and Fred Grandy ('The Love Boat'). This is a rip roarin' non-stop action-packed black comedy that is an absolute hoot! I can't recommend this one highly enough. Essential viewing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death Race parodies so many things it's hard to know where to begin. America-centrism (the government blame the French for everything), professional sports, pro wrestling (the drivers are badly acted "theme" types), Big Brother, and just about everything else you could name. At the same time it panders to the blood lust of the audience with cartoon violence. Sylvester Stallone is hilarious as a driver with the mannerisms of a 30's gangster, practicing on his accent for the Rocky movies. A must -see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Missing Piece From My Childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a dystopian future, a cross country automobile race requires contestants to run down innocent pedestrians to gain points that are tallied based on each kills brutality. Starring David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone.When I was younger and my family would go for a drive, my father would often make the remark that if he swerved and hit someone, it would be worth twenty points. In my youth, I never really understood where he picked it up from, but now I think it is safe to say that "Death Race 2000" was his source.While this movie is fairly cheesy, it is fun in a way most other films simply are not. I would not even call it a "dark comedy" because the violence is not dark, it is just campy. Beverly Gray calls it "comically macabre".There is some strong underlying message about American values that could be interpreted differently by different people: is America an inherently violent nation? Or are we a nation trying to maximize our freedoms? (This dispute comes into play when "rebels" show up who wish to end the race and restore the old America.) What is interesting is that Corman was known to be anti-authority, so he should be saying that this race is barbaric. Yet, he clearly understands that the viewer enjoys the death scenes... without them, the film would be nothing. What does this say about us, or about him?Stallone has a surprisingly small role, despite being the secondary character. He does not speak much and seems to be in the movie for no other reason than to use violence against women. In the vernacular, he "keeps his pimp hand strong".David Carradine, who never busts out many a karate move in this film, is the real hero. He plays the race's most popular character ("Frankenstein") who has allegedly been pieced back together year after year. His bondage gear outfit and smooth Carradine attitude make him a clear favorite for movie viewers, as well.All in all, this film is a cult classic and deserves to be. Corman wanted to compete with "Rollerball" (1975) for a fraction of the cost, so he purchased Ib Melchoir's "The Racer" and went from there. I think he succeeded. I do not know how much money each film made, but I know of nobody today who is out there calling "Rollerball" the better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death Race 2000 is the finest example to show how easy it actually was back in the seventies to come up with a timeless cult film. Honestly, anyone could have invented an outrageously exaggerated premise like this but the fact that it was actually Roger Corman who dealt with it just proves how eminently he ruled the B-movie circuit back then. Death Race 2000 is one of the most entertaining films ever made and I, for one, can't imagine someone not loving the severely ridicule story of a coast-to-coast car race where the contesters score points by wiping pedestrians off the road. Silly, yes?but even more ingenious, flamboyant and offensive. Pure cult, in other words, and fundamental viewing for every soul who ever showed interest in extravagant film-making! The script is stuffed with imaginative findings (euthanasia day at the hospital!) and downright UNsubtle protest towards the American way of life (a factor that determines Death Race 2000 as cult even more). Considering it's a Corman production, the film also contains explicit violence, provoking messages and a truckload of sleaze! All the elements that guarantee untamed cult success! Of course it has to be said that it could have been an even better film if Corman and director Paul Bartel focused on a more proper elaboration of the versatile idea. The rivalry between Carradine and Stallone, for example, should have resulted in a more intriguing sub plot and even though DR 2000 already contains much absurdity as it is, the premise surely had potential enough to add even more sick jokes and cynical situations. David Carradine acts deliciously as always and Stallone is excellent as well. Death Race 2000 is cinema that separates the men from the boys, people! Stop exploring the cult genre in case you didn't had the time of your life watching this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just exactly when bad taste ceases to be funny and becomes plainly cruel is a personal thing. However I have tried this film on a few friends and they did not enjoy it. That said I had rented the old VHS from the art-house vid shop 3 times before purchasing a cheap DVD copy when it popped up.Personally I thought some of this was laugh out loud funny and other parts frankly embarrassing to watch.I highly recommend Deathrace 2000 but take no responsibility should you decide to watch it!

		<fullReview>'Mad Max' meets the 'Running Man' and they both drive over miss Daisy. 'Death Race 2000' is a disconcerting smithereen job, but also fun. It is unprobable to say the least: 'Frankenstein' as the embodiment of national virtue? Nice thought over a dose of mescaline maybe. With unbelievable music too. Everything seems 2 B possible: ethical correct splatter comedies? You've got it. The acting in this supposed SF (caricatures of the immoral society of the future) is absolutely horrible (apart from Carradine and Griffeth). Add some black humor and non-existing emotions and you have Death Race 2000: the obscure cult flick in which Sly gets slapped around some as driver Machine-Gun Joe Viterbo. And retrospectively one of his best roles, besides 'First Blood' and 'Rocky'.Luckily there was room in the rating for some graphical splatter and nudity, which is why this has become a cult movie. And fat chance the uncut version will be banned where I live. It is more than questionable if the story is really about the fear of America becoming that chauvinistic and drenched in bloodlust. I get the impression that most of it is just a glorification of violence. But in a more thoroughly humorous way than e.g. Wild Bunch (1969) et al. Imagine the American president has a summer house in Peking, or driver Mathilda the Hun has a nazi-navigator Herman the German...DR2k was appropriately filmed by the great cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (Badlands, Silence of the lambs, Sixth Sense, and last but not least Ferris Bueller's day off). Good for Paul Bartel that he made Death Race 2000 before George Miller made Mad Max (1978), because it would have been a completely obsolete cartoon otherwise: something like Evil Knievel vs Dick Dastardly. Nevertheless DR2k is quite enjoyable. This movie may be inspired by 'the Cars that ate Paris' (Weir, 1974) and seemed to have inspired 'Carmageddon' (VG) and Mad Max of course. Guys, it's been real. Jesus Chrysler, I'd almost rate this 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb demonstration of why we need to keep independent cinema alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The B-film industry was once a thriving staple of Hollywood, with directors of all walks and ideals being able to make a film as long as they could raise the cash. Roger Corman, a producer and director among many other things, is one embodiment of the independent spirit. Producing over three hundred films in his career, his name is virtually synonymous with B-level schlock, and it is his productions that have given many of today's major stars their start. In fact, you will find three very familiar faces gracing Death Race 2000. Death Race 2000 is one of his more extravagant productions, but do not let that fool you. Even in 1975, the three hundred thousand dollars he spent on Death Race 2000 would have equaled lunch money on The Godfather Part II, released the previous year on a comparatively lavish budget of thirteen million dollars. While I like both films equally, Death Race 2000 impresses me more simply because it manages to entertain me from start to finish without spending enough money to fund an emergency ward for a month.Death Race 2000's plot is simple enough. Five drivers in customised cars drive across a repressive American dictatorship, starting on the East Coast before making their way to New Los Angeles. Along the way, they may run over any pedestrians for certain scores. Rather than simply being the first to cross the finish line, the winner is he who can accumulate more points than the others. It is this critical difference compared to other racing films from which much of the comedy is derived. Those who have seen the film before will remember Euthanasia Day with a lot of fondness, and the utter incompetence of the resistance movement is hilarious in itself. But the real comedy derives from the individual drivers and their personalities. By far the most normal driver in the competition is Calamity Jane, a woman with a cowgirl fetish and metallic bullhorns on the front of her car. Coming next is Nero The Hero, who will look very familiar to viewers of The Karate Kid. His whole shtick revolves around being a Roman Gladiator, but the film does not really give him enough time to develop it.Things get really interesting with racer number three, Matilda The Hun. Sporting Nazi symbolism and screaming "Blitzkrieg" whenever she scores a pedestrian, she is the least subtle indication that the makers had their tongues firmly in their cheeks during the creation of the film. Next are the two big rivals in the competition. Sylvester Stallone plays "Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo like a cranky adolescent who has snorted too much cocaine. There is literally nothing on the road he will not kill, and Stallone's trademark slurred speech suits the character to a T. But the real star of the story is Frankenstein, the other previous race winner and a friend of the President. David Carradine plays Frankenstein like a C-grade Darth Vader, delivering much of the comedy. His diversion on Euthanasia Day and the moment where he kicks Stallone's butt are worth watching the film for by themselves. Learning about why he wants to win the race, and what he will do in order to accomplish it, are hilarious in and of themselves. You can sort of see why Carradine and Stallone went on to become headlining stars whilst Kove enjoyed a brief career as the lead villain.Death Race 2000 is as dated as hell, let's not kid ourselves. The matte painting of the starting race track is more obvious than an undone bluescreen effect. The blood is so fake that it looks pink at times. The editing makes it very confusing to see how one is getting run over, or who is punching whom during the aforementioned Carradine/Stallone altercation. On the other hand, its story of a dictatorship America that uses sport as an opiate for the masses, its portrayal of the media, and its depiction of blind obedience are timeless. They are even more relevant thirty years on than when the film first premiered. I like to think of the incompetent resistance movement as an indictment of the fact that we would have a better government if we had a credible or even opposing opposition. Seventy-nine minutes is too short a time to go into these political subplots at all, but that Death Race 2000 touches on them at all when far more serious and lengthy films made years later cannot even consider them is a credit to Corman and his company. Death Race 2000 is one of those films that should be preserved in a time capsule for the edification of future generations.I gave Death Race 2000 a seven out of ten. Were I making it today, there are a few things I would do differently. The television segments would have been filmed using video or line removal rather than a camera at a television screen, for instance. Balancing this out, however, is the fact that so many of the shots are so effectively composed that it is no wonder Tak Fujimoto went on to become a multi-award-winning Hollywood cinematographer. In short, if you have not seen Death Race 2000 yet, then grab the new Roger Corman Classics DVD. It will be the best B-film, in fact one of the best films period, you will see all year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Race to Grab this Corman Cult Classic!! :?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while, Roger Corman, "a dear friend of mine" ;=8), comes out with a little gem among the tons of coal he produces every year, and "DR2K" is one of them. Kind of a poor-man's "Roller Ball", "DR2K" is about the ultimate in New America's blood sport in a fascist "near-future", with David Carradine("Kung Fu")as the anti-hero Frankenstein. Produced by Corman, and directed by Paul Bartell("Eating Raoul"), the film is fast-paced, blackly humorous, and well-made. Unlike many Corman cheapies, the stark, spartan setting of "DR2K" only adds to the bleak atmosphere, where Mr. President rules from overseas, and old folks are routinely euthanized as part of the game. The game, in this case, being the Transcontinental Road Race where anything goes, and where pedestrians are run over and assigned kill points. Carradine plays a darkly foreboding Frankenstein, so-called because of the many limbs he has lost as a result of running the Death Race. A pre-"Rocky" Sylvester Stallone is grand as Machine-Gun Joe Viterbo, Frankenstein's arch-rival. Also stars Mary Woronov("Eating Raoul", "Rock &amp; Roll High School")as Calamity Jane, Roberta Collins("Eaten Alive", "Hardbodies")delightful as Matilda the Hun, and 60's DJ Don Steele as a mincing little announcer. One of Corman's many little social cowmentaries, this one about the all-too American obsession for violence and sports; thankfully he allows Bartell to deftly and briskly direct. Still, it's a fairly low-budget affair; pedetrians get crushed, and things git blowed up real good, but it only makes you wonder what the film cud have been with a larger budget. Oh well, at least there isn't a giant evil pickle from Venus in this one... The MooCow says this Guilty Pleasure is definitely rentable, so just yell "Blitzkrieg!" and fire up that vcr!! :?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~Oh great American multitude and sports fans everywhere have I got a movie for you: Death Race 2000. The national and celebrated sport in the year 2000 is the transcontinental death race where racers compete not only for position, but for points as well. For every pedestrian hit, points are earned, depending on age and status of course. And of course it's nothing like the year 2000 but it makes for a great flick. Frankenstein (David Carradine), Machine Gun Joe Viterbo (Sly Stallone), Calamity Jane (Mary Woronov), Matilda the Hun, and Nero the Hero are the five racers vying for points and place. Stallone is a standout as the villain. Hilarious stuff takes place throughout the race; from euthanasia day at the geriatric hospital to the "French" air attacks. The best lines have got to be: "Is that a grenade?" "No, a hand grenade." This Roger Corman production has become a cult favorite, rightfully so, and one of the best films of the seventies."Hit and run isn't a felony. It's the national sport."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deathrace 2000 is one of the best films ever released by the Roger Corman organization, and in fact it's one of the best films ever released on the exploitation/drive-in circuit period. The film is not great because it presents us with interesting, realistic characters or a complex, well-developed story. Although it's often spoken of in terms of its brilliant political satire, for the most part its political ideas are on a very basic level. What makes it a great film is its total lack of shame and pretension ? in contrast to those who seem to see the film as a kind of veiled political statement, I think the film was pretty obvious about what it is. And I think its great strength lies in the fact that director Bartel was able to give us a movie that fulfills all our demands for an exploitation film, and not only that but is in fact a decent action film, while at the same time overflowing with sadistic humor and no apologies. I don't see the film as a satire masquerading as an exploitation film ? I see it as the ultimate exploitation film, free to be what it wants to be, telling us that it's OK to laugh at the darker things in life. We can enjoy watching a guy's head splattered on the road by a Nazi supermodel type. We can laugh at ourselves and our ridiculous cultural obsession with violence, and we can rise above and be conscious of just how ridiculous it is without sinking to the kind of pedantic moral-ism lampooned in the film in the person of Grace Pander (Joyce Jameson) and her morosely self-serious rebel clan.The pacing of the movie is another of its strengths ? never let the audience stop and think about whether they should be offended. It doesn't take long for the film to introduce the major characters and the central story concept. Frankenstein (David Carradine) is the all-time champion of the "Death Race", a cross-country motor race in which contestants score points for killing pedestrians. Each racer has a partner of the opposite sex whose job is equally navigation and sexual satisfaction; Frankenstein's new partner, Annie Smith (Simone Griffeth) has a third job: working as a fighter in Pader's resistance movement on a special mission to assassinate Frankenstein.The cars look very primitive today, and my friend who is a mechanic could easily identify the exact model of Volkswagen that was modified for the futuristic cars. But no matter. Each has been modified to fit a colorful persona for the racer, like WWF stars in the 1980sMartin Kove's "Nero the Hero" with his Roman gladiator trappings is memorable, Sylvester Stallone makes a good early appearance as the poseur "Machine Gun Joe" (a character I would guess is loosely modeled on Charles Bronson's early Roger Corman character "Machine Gun Kelly" ? this "Machine Gun" business might be good luck for aspiring action stars!), but Mary Woronov blows everyone away with her no-holds-barred uber-feminist Calamity Jane (best line: "nobody scores my co-pilot!").Carradine knows what he's doing ? he doesn't take the film any more seriously than it takes itself, but instead plays the character as two-dimensional par excellence. His best moment comes when he removes the scarred and disfigured mask that provides the persona of "Frankenstein" ? "what did you expect, another pretty face?". Carradine's laconic screen presence matches the character and the sterile futuristic world perfectly.Griffith's script is one of his best, and that's saying a lot because the guy was seriously funny (see his original "Little Shop of Horrors" and his masterpiece "Bucket of Blood"). It's based on a story by sci-fi writer Ib Melchior, who didn't like the movie (it didn't take itself as seriously as he wanted it to, as I recall). I can't say enough about how much I adore Paul Bartel's films, and this is one of his best (along with "Eating Raoul"). Paul Bartels doesn't feel like he needs to dumb down his films so that people will realize they are a joke ? he thinks that a joke SHOULD be potentially dangerous and has no fear of offending the audience. It's not that he's a provocateur, in my opinion, but rather he's a classic satirist ? he wants to show us how ridiculous our society is without wallowing in self-righteousness. His movies are always fun, and for that reason they'll never be fully embraced by the majority of critics who think that you have to throw a wet towel over your film in order to send a serious message.This is brave film-making of the highest order ? fast, fun, funny, sexy, uncompromising and intelligent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>most surprising: it's not awesomely bad, it's just awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman had one of his handful of real legitimate artistic achievements with Death Race 2000. This is not to say that it's Oscar worthy material or should get a whole lot of prestige, but it is definitely a cut above a lot of the intentional schlock that Corman and company put out over the years. Part of that is the intensity and panache of the film-making, of Paul Bartel and crew's filming action with the kind of automotive verve that Miller would have later in the Mad Max movies but put to a wilder edge by whatever means were available in the (low) budget (it's also a major credit to Corman, usually the penny-pincher, that this looks like a movie budgeted far beyond its actual means). Even today it contains a punch that, honestly, continues to out-do stuff like, well, the Paul Anderson remake.The other part is the writing, with a script that skewers what could be some sour material and creates this crazy landscape of degenerates, outlaws, crooked politicians (redundant, sure), madcap TV personalities, and the occasional bad-ass. The most occasional one is the star, Frankenstein, in one of his great parts by David Carradine, who is one of many drivers who in the Death Race go across the country (apparently, it would seem, in one day, since you know they have cars like that in the year 2000) racking up points by running over as many people as possible, with children and the elderly garnering the most points. How some of the logistical problems actually come off- why wouldn't people just stay indoors if it's the most highly anticipated "event" of the year to save their lives- is left up in the air, but by the time the story is really moving its hard to even care.This is, in essence, a near perfect exploitation flick, something grungy and rude and crude and featuring loud and crazily designed death-mobiles, plenty of naked women popping up, fights, explosions, goofy bits like Frankenstein's hand with a near-permanent grenade stuck to it, and characters with lots of meaty and fun dialog to work with (Stallone, in one of his first big performances, hams it up wonderfully and is actually not too hard to understand with his speaking voice). I also loved the totally tasteless political satire bits, like the mention of France as an evil super-power or just the nature of the President and the resistance movement to stop the Death Race by any means necessary.Watch it friends, grab a few brews, and be prepared to actually have a really fun time with exemplary film-making on a shoestring (yes, a shoestring); its attitude and action remain fresh, which is really hard to accomplish when usually looking at the Corman body of producing work which is varied and often full of total crap. Every so often there's a ruby in the midst of it all, and this is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the year 2000, Americans fervently support a cross-country car race in which the drivers pick up points by mowing down pedestrians (senior citizens garner the highest points!). The star of the show is Frankenstein (David Carradine), who has seen plenty of smash-ups and is now made of bones, metal and plastic; he initially chafes with his new navigator, a feminine blonde who is working as a secret operative. Low-budget black comedy from New World does occasionally look good (better than something like the original "Rollerball", anyway) and gets a terrific boost from Carradine, lean and no-nonsense both in and out of his black leather costume (his best moment comes when he dances gracefully with the blonde in his black Speedo). The race doesn't really matter, nor do the comical television commentaries or the limp political skewering. Director Paul Bartel doesn't seem to have his heart in thuggish behavior or pulpy violence--he's more of a cartoon-addict, and the film could really use more of his twisted humor and less of the macho swaggering. ** from ****</fullReview>

As there participates an assertive and charismatic masked man called Frankestein (David Carradine , the role was originally offered to Peter Fonda, who considered the movie too ridiculous for words) , Machine Gun Joe Viterbo (Sylvester Stallone did much of their own driving and wrote some of his own dialogue) , co-driver Annie Smith (Simone Griffeth was excellent as David Carradine's enticing co-pilot) , Mary Woronov as Calamity Jane , Roberta Collins as Matilda the Hun , Martin Kove as Nero , among others . In the final of the race the lives of the competitors , pedestrians , the President and the death race itself are in deep peril .This cult fave based on the 1956 story by Ib Melchior about a futurist international sport , a violent and bloody car race where the drivers score points for hitting other vehicles ; though the screenplay retains only the basic premises of the original short story ; the characters and incidents are all different . New World's Roger Corman wrote the original treatment of the film, which was serious in tone , but thought it was not right and, in his words, was "kind of vile" ; he decided the dark material of the story would be better served by making the movie into a comedy and had Robert Thom rewrite the treatment . This exciting movie is full of noisy action , moving scenes , thrills, chills , satire and lots of violence . The object is to race cars and kill as many competitors as possible , as it packs spectacular chases with skillful stunts and without computer generator effects . From the beginning to the end the unstopped action and the emotions are interminable . The surreal style of cartoon suffused all movie , outrageous in its subject matter and black zany in its treatment . ¨Death race¨ owes to ¨Tom and Jerry¨ cartoon and to Coyote's fruitless pursuit of the Road Runner . According to Roger Corman, film's producer ,several of the custom cars featured in the movie were later sold to car museums for considerably more than it cost to build them . The racetrack used for the opening track and grandstand scenes is the Ontario Motor Speedway near Los Angeles . The cars didn't run most of the time, so they had to be pushed down hills in order to get them to move ; moreover, the cameras used to film the cars were under-cranked in order to perpetuate the illusion that they were moving faster.The motion picture was originally directed by Paul Bartel . This American filmmaker's anarchic work was consistently more amusing than nearly all of his undergoing contemporaries . He began as a filmmaker of animated shorts , like Frank Tashlin , who also started in animation . Bartel's reputation rests most securely with ¨Eating Raoul¨ which took him ages to finance and almost as long to distribute ; he subsequently made a spoof western titled ¨Lust in the dust¨ and ¨Scenes from the class struggle in Beverly Hills¨ a wild black comedy as well as lusty lewd ; furthermore directed ¨Private parts¨ , ¨Not for publication¨ , among others . ¨Death race 2000¨ was followed by ¨Death Sport¨ (1978) with David Carradine , Richard Lynch , Claudia Jennings , Jeese Vint , William Smithers ; ¨Cannoball¨ mostly interesting for a plethora of cult cameos , not top drawer production but nonetheless acceptable , with David Carradine , Mary Wonorov , Joe Dante , John Landis , Martin Scorsese and many others ; recently has been made ¨Death race¨ with Jason Statham , Robin Shou, Robert LaSardo , Tyrese Gibson and Joan Allen ; ¨Death Race 2¨ by Roel Reine with Luke Goss , Lauren Cohan , Sean Bean and Ving Rhames ; and ¨Death Race : Inferno¨ with Luke Goss , Lauren Cohan , Sean Bean , Ving Rhames and Dougray Scott ; all of them no as good as the original , but still watchable .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid? Hardly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm astonished by the number of reviewers who see this film as "stupid". It has one hell of a witty script, with amazingly accurate jabs at everything from media hype to uber-patriotic propaganda. Just listen to the president blaming everything on "the treacherous French and their stinking European allies". Sounds chillingly like "Freedom Fries", doesn't it?This wonderful little gem is far more intelligent that it's usually given credit for, and certainly smarter than 99.9% of the films made today. Those who dismiss it as stupid junk because of its outrageous premise are missing the point. I haven't seen anyone write a film this smart in at least 20 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, those '70s!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The user comments I've read overlook a key element of this movie--its cultural context. 1975: just post-Watergate, the end of the Viet Nam war, wide-spread disillusionment with non-violence as a social remedy. Those who dismiss the role of the "resistance" in this movie thus miss the whole point. Their decision to turn from non-violent to violent tactics to stop the race, the satisfaction the movie incites when violence is applied, and the "plus ca change" ending capture a pivotal moment in American conciousness, where idealism and cynicism merged. Certainly an early example of post-modern sensibilities, although rife with sexism and really bad '70s hair. A classic slice of the cultural transition from the '60s to the "me decade."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun film of speed, crashes, death and explosions! A real treat a B movie classic a memorable gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally after all these years watched the 1975 B movie cult classic "Death Race 2000" as I'm now watching and dissecting the films of independent and B movie king producer Roger Corman. And I must say this was a thrill a fun classic that entertains never a dull moment and the movie moves quick as it states it's plot and the message of winner seek all is compelling and entertaining! Anyway this picture was ahead of it's time as in 1975 it portrayed a futuristic year that being 2000 and the country is a mess with corrupt morals and politicians being yes men and always at unrest(really that turned out to be true and continues). The only big things in this society is that hit and run driving is a national sport an event that is three days across the country, as with this high speed contest is won by the driver who collects the most points by running over and killing people like pedestrians and spectators. And to challenge things are a group of anti-race activists trying to stop racing for good.The all-time champ is the win at all cost rebel Frankenstein(the late David Carradine in a good role)who's so smooth yet intimidating in a rubber black mask of latex(makes a viewer thank of sadism)and out of the group of race foes it's the young and hot "Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo(in one of Sly Stallone's very early roles)that presents the biggest threat to knock Frankenstein from the race throne. Also to spice this dark sci-fi action up is the appearance of many hot females as plenty of skin is shown as the guys even make cross country stops at massage parlors! Overall "Death Race 2000" is one nice little cult picture a B movie gem that as you watch it's a fine feel good time it has it all sex, action, death, and the challenge of a corrupt political state, true not everything did come true in 2000 still much of it would as these themes shown in 1975 would ring true for the year 2000 and beyond. Plus the work of the late Carradine is A okay and it was nice seeing Stallone in some B movie work just one year before his "Rocky" classic.</fullReview>

Here is, perhaps, the best "death match" movie ever made! In the not-too-distant future, a cross-country auto race is held once a year. Participating drivers are given the opportunity to run over unwitting citizens. And score points based upon their age, race, social status, and so forth. In this year's current race, there's the ever-popular Frankenstein (David Carradine), Machine Gun Joe Viterbo (Sylvester Stallone), Calamity Jane (Mary Woronov), Matilda the Hun (Roberta Collins), and Nero the Hero (Martin Kove).

		<fullReview>For decades 'Death Race 2000' has existed as an abstract image in my mind. A dark, violent piece of dystopian 70s sci-fi that was perhaps best left unseen. Imagine my surprise when the sadistic bug-a-boo turned out to be a humorous romp.Though 'Death Race 2000' is filled with brutal, sadistic acts, it's all done with tongue firmly planted in cheek. This isn't the sort of self serious dystopian sci-fi of 'THX-1138' or 'Soylent Green'. Is there commentary here? Yeah, sort of. But it chooses to tickle with it rather than bludgeon.Filled with beautiful women, non-stop action and wonderful scene chewing performances, 'Death Race 2000' is a fun little romp.

		<fullReview>"Death Race 2000" is adrenaline-charged fun, a fast paced, funny, satirical, and bloody sci-fi action picture loaded with political commentary and a cast of B movie icons to die for. Produced by the legendary Roger Corman and directed with gusto by the late Paul Bartel ("Eating Raoul"), it has a wicked sense of humour and also benefits from a bunch of colourful characters and their equally colourful cars. It hits the ground running and rarely lets up, with a particularly delicious wrap-up.It's the future (at least, the future as it was envisioned in 1975), and a no holds barred, brutal cross county car race known as the Transcontinental Road Race is the national sport. The points are scored by running down pedestrians. This sport is used by a totalitarian government to keep its violence-hungry population satisfied. The star of the race is the peoples' champion, Frankenstein (David Carradine), who has had various body parts replaced over the years. His chief rival is the foul tempered Machine Gun Joe Viterbo (a hilarious, scene stealing Sylvester Stallone). Competing against them are Calamity Jane (Mary Woronov), Matilda the Hun (Roberta Collins), and Nero the Hero (Martin Kove). Seeking to put an end to the race are a group of rebels known as The Resistance.Carradine is lots of fun as the cynical Frankenstein, although Stallone is the one who really walks off with the movie. Simone Griffeth is lovely as Frankensteins' new navigator, Annie; she, Woronov, Collins, and the always cute Louisa Moritz all make for fine eye candy. Adding to the entertainment value are other familiar faces such as Don Steele (a riot as annoying announcer Junior Bruce), Joyce Jameson, Fred Grandy, and Leslie McRay. (Look for John Landis in a bit part as a mechanic.) Director Bartel has an uncredited cameo as a doctor."Death Race 2000" is full of high speed action, explosions, and a genuinely interesting script by Robert Thom and Charles B. Griffith, based on the story "The Racer" by Ib Melchior. It does make us consider our own appetites for destruction while sating them at the same time. It may strike viewers as being dated in some ways, but it has an undeniable campy and cheesy charm going for it, making it hard to resist, and entertaining to revisit on a regular basis.Nine out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a dystopian near-future, The United Provinces (as America is now known) is ruled by a despotic president who has developed a bloodthirsty 'opiate for the masses': Death Race, a televised transcontinental car race in which the drivers collect points by killing pedestrians. As the five cold-blooded contestants battle it out on the open roads between New York and New Los Angeles, a group of political activists attempt to bring an end to the event by any means necessary.Don't be put off by the crappy opening title graphics that look like they've been rendered in colouring crayon by a ten year old: produced by movie legend Roger Corman and directed by Paul 'Eating Raoul' Bartel, Death Race 2000 is a thoroughly entertaining cult classic that no fan of drive-in/exploitation cinema should pass on. A masterclass in how to make the absolute most of a minimal budget, this fast-paced film packs a surprising amount into its tight 80 minute runtime: outrageous graphic violence, imaginative design (the customised vehicles and crazy characters looking like something out of a seriously warped Wacky Racers cartoon), wanton sleaze and nudity, clever political satire, cruel black humour, and loads of bonkers high-speed race action (the likes of which would influence George Miller on his hugely successful Mad Max movies).The film also benefits from an excellent cast: David Carradine, the perfect choice to play surly race champion Frankenstein (I came face-to-face with the actor a couple of times and he was just as unapproachable in real life); a young Sly Stallone as Frankenstein's main rival, uncouth hoodlum Machine Gun Joe Viterbo; sexy Simone Griffeth, as Frank's navigator Annie, whose stunning looks and figure would make it hard for me to keep my eyes on the road; cult favourite Mary Woronov as sassy driver Calamity Jane; and Martin 'Karate Kid' Kove, as Nero the Hero, the terrorist's first victim. With a cool line-up like that, a good time is almost guaranteed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I avoided DEATH RACE 2000 for a long time because I thought it would be too violent and sadistic just like the remake with Jason Statham. But I figured that since it was made in the 70s it couldn't be that bad. And it isn't. Special effects have gotten much better. The blood in the remake looks real. Anybody can tell that the blood here is fake. The violence is also quite minimal. I mean, there's a scene where a guy's head gets crushed under a car tire but trust me, it really isn't as gory as it sounds. The movie is only around 75 minutes long, which is as long as it needed to be. There really aren't any scenes that I thought were unnecessary. I really liked the story and the political commentary. The action scenes were pretty good for a movie that cost just $300,000 (around $1.5 million in today's money) to make. I still can't get over the fact that this spectacular (and I promise I'm not using that word sarcastically) movie was made for only that much money. (By the way, I didn't give this movie 10 stars for being good AND inexpensive, just for being good. I'm just saying that the fact that it was inexpensive is amazing given how good it is.)Anyway, another thing that I really liked about this movie is that it is really funny. I don't want to give any specific examples since DR2K is so short and it's best if you watch it without knowing much about it, but there are some scenes that might seem sadistic at first but really aren't. This isn't a movie that takes itself too seriously, which I really liked. Here's the thing. Every dystopian movie has an absurd premise. I can't think of a single one that doesn't. So why are they so serious? (There are maybe a few exceptions, like LOGAN'S RUN, which is somewhat serious but not excessively so.) Take THE HUNGER GAMES for example. It's so serious but, ultimately, the premise is quite ridiculous. The makers of DEATH RACE 2000 knew they were making a movie with a droll premise and apparently didn't hesitate to make it lighthearted and humorous. I thought it was hilarious how Matilda the Hun, the Nazi driver, yelled "Blitzkrieg!" every time she ran someone over. Sylvester Stallone as "Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo has some really great lines such as "You lousy stinking dirtball. You've got two seconds to live!"I can't believe that the late Roger Ebert gave this movie 0/4 stars. That was another reason why I avoided this movie for quite a long time. Now don't get me wrong, I really liked reading his reviews and I agreed with his opinions on many of the movies that he reviewed. But go read his short review of DR2K:http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/death-race-2000It's really not a review of the film itself. It's more of a criticism of movie theaters that don't enforce MPAA ratings.DEATH RACE 2000 is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. You might think it's a movie that's so bad it's good but it's not. It's just good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what delicious trash!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, that's not quite fair. The movie itself is far from trash, although there is a lot that's trashy about it. But it makes a good sound bite, no? :-)As I write this, there are already 130 reviews of DR2K on IMDb. What could I add? With that many reviews in the hopper already, this is a vanity review. Oh well. Here's my take:This is cheap B-movie fare, but it reminds me of the Beatles in that its greatness stems from a nexus of circumstances unlikely to ever occur again. Everything came together here to make a really outstanding B-movie, and the trashiness adds to the fun (for those who let it). DR2K has wicked tongue-in-cheek fun while also throwing at us gratuitous nudity and slapstick violence, and always keeping us guessing at what in the world is coming next. I think only the 1970s could produce a movie like this; we grew up too much after that, and everything is too self-aware and self-conscious now to do this sort of zealous, devil-may-care schlock any more.It's a bit like Mel Brooks at his best, but doing it on a shoestring budget. This sort of production only works if everyone believes in it enough to put enthusiasm into their work, because it sure isn't going to make it on production value. Thankfully, in this case, they got terrific, spirited performances from just about everyone involved. (That's not to say that the acting was top-notch, just that it was lively and kept things moving and entertaining.) There's no mystery why some hate the film; you need a sardonic sense of humor and a tolerance for low budget antics. Those without should watch something else. For the rest of us this is a real gem.Simone Griffeth is enchanting in this movie, both for her beauty and seductiveness as well as for providing much of the best real acting; I find myself wishing she'd found a lot more success later. She seemed to have everything one could want in a rising starlet, but I don't think I've ever seen her before. The other gals are lovely as well; plenty of good B-movie eye candy, just as it should be, and they don't just sit there, they really get into their roles, as the guys do too.*** MILD SPOILER: *** what other movie offers you, with as straight a face as anything else in the film, a line like "Mr. and Mrs. President Frankenstein"??!? LOL!!If you're up for some campy fun and dark humor, don't miss DR2K!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Dystopian future of 2000 various race car drivers participate in a no-holds-barred cross country competition in which points are scored by running over pedestrians. Weary reigning champion Frankenstein (excellently played with perfect stoical cynicism by David Carradine) is bound and determined to win. Vicious 30's mobster-style rival "Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo (a pre-stardom Slyvestor Stallone gleefully sending up his own macho musclehead persona) gives Frankenstein a major run for his money. Meanwhile, a group of political activists try to stop the race and overthrow the current totalitarian government.Director Paul Bartel brings his customary wickedly warped and engagingly loopy tongue-in-cheek sensibility to the gloriously crazy premise, maintains a brisk pace throughout, and delivers plenty of over-the-top gory carnage and a pleasing smattering of tasty female nudity. The fiercely barbed and acidic script by Robert Thom and Charles B. Griffith pokes spot-on subversive fun at fascist politicians, cruelty as entertainment, inept revolutionaries, mindless fan worship, the duplicitous and manipulative media (all the resistance army's attacks are blamed on the French!), and America's wholehearted affinity for extreme violence. The first-rate B-flick cast play the darkly humorous material with tremendous lip-smacking gusto: the delectable Simone Griffeth as Frankenstein's luscious navigator Annie Smith, Mary Woronov as sassy'n'sexy cowgirl Calamity Jane, the always delightful Roberta Collins as fiery Swastika sweetheart Matilda the Hun ("Blitzkrieg!"), Martin Kove as the vain, preening, and effeminate Nero the Hero, Don "The Real" Steele as obnoxious reporter Junior Bruce, Joyce Jameson as obsequious commentator Grace Pander, Louisa Moritz as the ditsy Myra, Harriet Medin as passionate old lady resistance leader Thomasina Paine, and Sandy McCallum as the smarmy Mr. President. Moreover, this movie offers a wealth of choice sidesplitting campy and occasionally downright bizarre moments: skinny Carradine giving brawny Stallone a severe clobbering, a heated catfight between Matilda the Hun and Calamity Jane, Calamity Jane facing off with a matador, a devout female admirer willingly sacrificing herself for Frankenstein, a bunch of greasers playing a dangerous game of chicken, and Viterbo mowing down his own pit crew. Tak Fujimoto's bright cinematography gives the picture an impressive polished look. Paul Chihara's funky jazzoid score hits the right-on groovy spot. Plus you gotta love a film with the astonishing audacity to kill off both a priest and the President of the United States. Totally worthy of its substantial cult status.</fullReview>

Watching it, it is easy to see why it's hailed as a cult favourite, because it truly hit's the mark? with blazing force and snappy remarks. Along for the brutally roaring cross-country race in their gimmicky sports cars is an assortment of colorfully spicy personalities delivered by a terrific cast; David Carradine, Sylvester Stallone, Simone Griffeth, Roberta Collins, Mary Woronov and Martin Kove. Director Paul Bartel (yep the actor) does a pleasing, economical job with his low-budget resources, as comic-book madness is ensured with its flashy pace, murderously unpleasant streak (where it doesn't shy away from some graphic aftermaths) and exploitative tongue-in-cheek script.

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** After the disastrous stock market crash of 1979 the US was left with no means of economic support and degenerated into a fascist dictatorship. It was in 1980 that the unelected chief of state known only as Mr. President, Sandy McCallum, inaugurated the exciting and dangerous Transcontinental Road Race to distract the American public from the real crisis at hand. A dark and dismal future for themselves and their children.It's now 2000 and former two-time Transcontinental Road Race champ and national hero Frankenstein, David Carradine, is back fully reconstructed-after a number of near fatal crashes-and ready to defend his title. What Frankenstein is really interested in is to end the race in an earth shaking fashion. Not by just winning it but putting an end to Mr. President's fascist regime as well as Mr. President himself. Fast and furious racing action without the use of computer enhanced special effects makes "Death Race 2000" fun to watch even though the race calls for the running down and killing of innocent civilians in order to score points, as well as finish first, to win it. Frankenstein's chief rival is the Chicago mobster Machine Gun Joe Viterbo, Sylvester Stallone. Veterbo is nothing but a brainless thug who's had it in for the man of "nuts and bolts" since he beat him hands down in his two previous races against him.While the race in going on the great, to the tenth power, granddaughter of the American Revolutionary Thomas Paine the feisty Thomasina Paine, Harriet Medlin, and her band of modern 21th Century American revolutionaries are attempting to sabotage it and at the same time assassinate Mr. President when he hands out the winning prize, together with a handshake, to the winner of the race. Not as corny and unbelievable as people thought at the time of its release back in 1975, the same year that the similar movie "Rollerball" came out, "Death Race 2000" shows how a dictatorial regime can come to America by using both entertainment as well as patriotism as, like a Trojan Horse, its cover. ****SPOILER****Frankenstein despite giving the impression of being a company man was really fed up with Mr. President and everything that he stood for. But it took the grueling three day 3,000 mile Transcontinental Road Race, that almost cost Franknsein his life, for him to finally achieve his life long dream: At the winners circle in New L.A where the race came to its bloody and destructive end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Death Race is certainly not a classic, it does hold a high status in the cult industry. For those who haven't seen the film, it is recommended to watch it uncut. The film's cult look and feel are only existent in the uncut version, in my opinion. The acting from the drivers isn't anything special, but for me, the entertainment comes from the slick cars, quirky drivers, and stunt sequences. To be blunt, Death Race is a dark film that can be compared to a 1970's form of 'Grand Theft Auto' when it comes to the gritty driving. The film's satirical take on dangerous sports is like eye-candy to the average sci-fi film goer, who doesn't mind the low-budget feel.David Carradine is an instant cult-classic as Frankenstein and while Sylvester Stallone isn't the normal dope he is in other films, his performance was easily forgettable. Calamity Jane (Mary Woronov) also added some enjoyable tidbits and mannerisms to the race.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some fun 1970's Kitsch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie still holds up after all these years, even though we are well past 2000 and the future didn't turn out to be quite as bleak as they thought.The concept is that a tyrannical government uses a "Death Race" to distract public attention from how bad everything is, where colorful characters drive themed cars across the country mowing down innocent bystanders in the process. A group of plucky rebels plans to sabotage the race by bumping off the drivers.A note- There is a lot of female nudity in this movie, more than I think a director of a non-porn film would ever try to get away with today. I think it is interesting to watch, to see how attitudes have changed. It was like directors could finally use sex and nudity in a film, but quickly lost interest in it by the 1990's. Just an observation.This film starred David Carradine from Kung Fu and Sly Stallone in a pre-Rocky role. If one thing is disappointing, it is the fight scene in the middle of the movie between these two. I mean, it's Kung Fu vs. Rocky! That should have been an awesome fight, if Roger Corman had remembered to actually hire a fight coordinator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly but fun drive-in movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie takes place in the "future" of 2000. There is a race between 5 contestants from New York to New Mexico (I think). Along the way they have to run over and kill as many pedestrians as possible. For each kill they get points--children and baby kills get the most points. There's also a group who is trying to kill all the drivers to stop the races. Among the drivers are Calamity Jane (Mary Woronov), Machine Gun Joe (a pre-stardom Sylvester Stallone) and Frankenstein (!!!) (David Carradine).The plot is beyond stupid but this has a funny script that doesn't take itself seriously for one second. The cars they people drive are cool, the killings are vicious and bloody and the movie is fast-paced. It's also trying to make a statement about how society needs violence, but really--who watches this for a message? You watch for the violence, blood, explosions (there are TONS of those) and casual nudity (mostly female). Sometimes the movie goes too far--when a hospital wheels out all its elderly patients into the street to be run over, I almost turned it off. However that sequence DOES have a great (and fitting) ending. The acting is as OK as it can be--Woronov is easily the best (as always). This is a very low budget picture--note the hilariously fake backdrop showing a city of the "future"--but it's fast-paced and exciting. If you're into this type of movie it's worth catching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night, the band I play guitar for was out on the road. We were coming back from a gig several hours from our hometown. It was late already, and we were tired. We have a DVD player in the van, but we were out of fresh movies to watch. We stopped at a gas station, where there was a $2 DVD bin. Or course, we didn't recognize any of the films, but one title stood out to us: Death Race 2000. For $1.99, We had to have it. We had a GREAT drive home.The entertainment value of this film is high. Now, the acting is fairly bad, but of course it's always fun to watch Stallone and Carridine. The dialogue is delightfully clunky. A lot of people will be off-put by the somewhat tasteless violence, that is, pedestrians getting plowed down by murderous drivers; while some people will be entertained (think about the first Toxic Avenger movie for a reference). The premise is ridiculous but fun: in an apparently post-apocalyptic fascist America, Mr. President holds absolute power and has instituted a huge race across the nation where drivers strive to kill as many pedestrians as possible (old folks are apparently worth 100 points!) Carridine and Stallone play the two most popular and dangerous drivers competing in the year 2000. Violence and breasts ensue.Bottom line: B-film aficionados, go ahead and buy this. It'll be a cheap and fun movie if you like to drink beer and play Mystery Science Theater with your friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Death Race 2000" is a low budget genre melting pot from 1975 starring David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone as two of five feuding race car drivers competing in a futuristic sport that is won based on racking up points from killing pedestrians and others. Based on a 1956 short story, it's a highly satiric sci-fi actioner that uses ironic and downright sadistic touches to examine America's abhorrent fascination with violence.The ridiculously contrived and outlandish futuristic setting was put into heavy rotation during the mid-70's in several other films ("Westworld"; "Soylent Green"; "Logan's Run") as a means to tell downbeat and cynical stories that allowed the audience to escape their own reality, but still experience a certain catharsis.In the case of "Death Race 2000" the results are a mixed bag, as the over the top material races from dark comedy to "Sleeper"-like sci-fi to undercooked romance and back again. It works because of the tongue-in-cheek direction of Paul Bartel, who would go on to helm the brilliant dark comedy "Eating Raoul". The whole thing is great fun, and has a surprising innocence underneath all of the mostly cartoonish violence.This said, the main gripe would have to be the inconsistent pacing, as the race and the story took breaks between laps, which leaves the viewer peeking at their watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In all honest truth I should be giving this film a 1/10 but the story is so silly and bizarre that it works. In a 1970's 2000 death racing has become the sport of choice. Yes fans root for our racers to perform hit and run murders. A young David Carradine stars as Frankenstein the Michael Jordan of death racing who has survived countless injuries.A pre Rocky Sly Stallone plays the villain of our story. You have to respect this movie even if it is as bad is it is,it's told well even though even though it's horrible. Everything about the film is bottom of the barrel, if it wasn't for the cast or director this movie would be lost in forgotten 70's drive in flicks.

		<fullReview>It was recently announced that Paul "Alien vs Predator" Anderson will be directing a remake/ sequel to this movie, imaginatively titled Death Race 3000. I have to admit to being slightly excited at this news. This is one of the seminal action movies of the seventies, and it will be interesting to see how it is done today. However, I imagine the politics will be very different. Death Race 2000 is just about the most subversive film I have ever seen. "In the year 2000 hit and run is no longer a felony... it's the national sport"? The film really does live up to that tag-line.We are invited to travel across America with Frankenstein, the greatest racer of all time, who has had so many accidents and operations he is more machine than man, and the beautiful Annie Smith, a secret rebel desperate to bring an end to both the race and the regime. Along for the ride are other great racers, including a young Sly Stallone as Machine Gun Joe, and Calamity Jane, Matilda the Hun and Nero the Hero, all desperate to win the race and score as many points along the way. And what do points make? Funerals. That's right, for each pedestrian they hit, the more points they earn. What's great about this is it both horrifies and fascinates the audience at the same time. These racers are all sadistic murderers, willing to run over children, the elderly, even babies in prams if they think it will rack up their score. Even Frankenstein himself is a cold-blooded killer, yet slowly he wins Annie's heart, and reveals that he has a hidden agenda of his own.When watching all this carnage you can't help but laugh at the sheer audacity of Bartel and Corman. This is black comedy at its finest. It can be read as a satire on capitalism, nationalism and even feminism, but above all else it's a guilty pleasure; a film that you know you probably shouldn't be watching, let alone enjoying. But you do. It's well worth picking up the DVD, which features a fascinating interview with producer and legend Roger Corman, as well as some trailers for other New World productions, including women in prison and a young Ron Howard. What more could you ask for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is an anti-bureaucracy extravaganza</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would first off like to note that the only racism in this movie is that of some hateful characters who deserve everything they get. "Herman the German" and "Matilda the Hun" are American characters who are neo-Nazis cheered on by sportsgoers. Whoever called this movie racist is even more paranoid than me (feeling sorry for ya, pal). This classic is a scathing mockery of everything America now truly stands for, including the mass media, blaming things on other countries that are just convenient finger-targets, etc., right down to the love of violence as if it were a great sport (but not including freedom and equality and various other things that make good Halloween masks for politicians in ANY country). Regardless of how many people here tell me that they don't love violence, a good amount of them will shake their fists and chant for death of innocent civilians in other countries if the newscaster says so. I love everything about this movie, and David Carradine makes for one of the best antiheroes ever. Sure, he behaves robotically through the whole movie. The guy he's playing (very well) was practically created in a lab! I admit that this movie might seem hypocritical when it makes statements against the love of violence as it shows act after act of just that, but these are special FX, and it's not like there ain't a damn funny and intelligent sense of humor. For instance, the guy who gets practically castrated by a car with a huge knife on the front. A lot of guys can probably feel his pain and grab their crotches when they see something that horrendous, but it's still funnier than hell. When you think of people doing these nasty, hurtful things to each other while the majority of Americans cheer and place their bets, it seems pretty ugly, and rightfully so, but mucho political commentary and all, there is a huge sense of fun. I love everything about this, it is a cult classic that is just as important (or even more important) now as it was in 1975.</fullReview>

It's a cheaply made film, with shallow characters and lots of exploitation and violence to carry the weak plot. I thusly conclude that it's not a very good film.But I bought the DVD, and I don't regret it in the least. Once I shove that 'objective' part to the side, I remember that I love this movie. There's a lot of broad humor and excitement. It may not have the gloss that a big budget Hollywood blockbuster has, but it has action and drive and energy and none of the pompous attitude that many blockbusters have.

		<fullReview>How can one movie be so bad but so wonderfully good at the same time? Death Race 2000 accomplishes this. Set in the `future' of 2000, racers gear up to race in a cross county road race to see who can finish 1st with the most points. How do they collect points? By running people over of coarse. This movie is a far throw from the multimillion-dollar movies of today, but yet, tends to be as good, if not better, than some of the newer movies. It not only tells a fun and enjoyable story, it has fun sets and props. With a minimal budget this movie was able to make some *very* cool looking cars. This movie was meant to be taken seriously, but that is what makes it so good. It has laughable acting and a strange plot. If you enjoy older sci-fi movies, and David Carradine, you have to see this movie. This movie is a *must* see for all the campy movie fans, and sci-fi fans alike.</fullReview>

The cartoon-like violence and gore is good for laughs, but also supports the theme of the film as well - that America is no longer shocked by death, and the general public craves watching the suffering of others purely for entertainment. When the race begins, the President says "Once again, I give you what you want." I think this is a very relevant topic (especially with America's "war on terrorism" underway), and the comical way of showing America's obsession with violence was actually presented quite tastefully.

		<fullReview>Death Race 2000 is, without a doubt, a camp masterpiece. Paul Bartel's energetic direction and jet black humor speed the proceedings along like the racers' custom-made autos. The photography is razor sharp, done in vivid color that beautifully captures the landscapes, rushing roads, and splatters of blood. The phenomenal cast turns in spirited performances all around, with the top prize taken by the exquisite Mary Woronov as sexy cowgirl Calamity Jane Kelly. Whether gyrating on a dance floor or going after a matador in her Bull car, she effortlessly steals every scene she's in. The only flaw in the movie (and it's a minor one) is the resistance; with so many colorful characters and hilarious dialogue and situations, you really don't care one way or the other about Thomasina Paine and her opposition forces. Still, this low-budget (about $300,000) New World opus is an audacious, wildly funny, gorgeously garish delight and an essential classic. "Go for the baby, the baby!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERSDeath Race 2000 opens with a cartoon title sequence that looks like a child's crayon drawing on polystyrene. It's backed up with a theme tune that sounds as if the tape's chewed, and cuts to a poorly superimposed "futuristic" setting.The rest of the film is like this. Cheap, somewhat curiously directed, poorly acted and shouldn't work. Yet somehow it does. Is this the most subversive American movie ever made? There's occasional digs at other races (The Nazi driver "Herman the German" for one), but in the main it's U.S. culture that is being constantly lambasted. A future America where the Stars and Stripes are red and gold, and the President (Sandy McCallum) says things like "I have made the United Provinces of America the greatest power in the known universe." Even when slating other races, the finger points back to gung-ho xenophobia, as when the President hilariously states "It is no coincidence, my dear children, that the word 'sabotage' was invented by the French."Not only is this open season on it's country of origin's own culture, it also has some of the sickest humour ever seen in a mainstream movie. The central concept is of a car race where killing pedestrians gains the drivers points in the contest. "And toddlers, under twelve, now rate a big 70 points", explains a TV announcer. There's also a specially arranged "Euthanasia Day" at the local geriatrics' hospital, and the supreme sickness of the title quote.What adds to the film is its sense of unmitigated cheese. David Carradine is lame in the lead role, while many of the other ? equally lacklustre ? performers struggle with a third-rate script. Sample line? "You know Myra, some people might think you're cute. But me I think you're just one large baked potato." This combines with "pit stop" scenes which involve little else other than gratuitous nudity. Violence in the movie is shot and edited as if it thinks it matches the gore of Cronenberg or Tom Savini. However, it's merely tame and almost comical as badly staged red paint explodes everywhere. Some of the car racing is also sped up, which resembles less fast cars, more Keystone Kops. However, as much of this is overlaid with incongruous classical music there's every possibility that this is intentional. It's also fun seeing Sylvester Stallone beaten senseless by a skinny Carradine in a poorly choreographed fight. Imagine Mad Max involved in a fight between Wacky Races and Benny Hill and you're part way there to imagining what this unique film is like.Stallone is "Machine Gun Joe", described as being "loved by thousands, hated by millions", which is quite apt. While I'm a Stallone fan (apologist?) it's worth noting that this is less a Stallone acting appearance (Rocky, Copland...), more a Stallone by-the-numbers performance (Rocky IV, Judge Dredd...)Of course, while all this is thrown together at such a force and with such a delightfully hammy velocity that it makes it great amusement, there is evidence that it's one-joke satire isn't enough to fill it's paltry 78 minutes running time. Like the cars that are supposedly driving fast but are really puttering along at a snail's pace, the final quarter of the movie runs the risk of grinding to a halt. A final satirical barb by a racing commentator ("The race is the symbol of everything we hold dear, our American way of life. Sure it's violent, but that's the way we love it... violent, violent, violent!") seems to overstate the matter and falls flat.The ending is resolved with yet more poorly animated titles and a narration that talks about man's need for violence. One of the best bad movies I've ever seen, Death Race 2000 is within reach of absolute greatness, though doesn't - quite - manage it. 6/10.</fullReview>

Personally, I would have loved to see Mary Woronov (as Calamity Jane) a lot more.

		<shortDescription>A Racing Picture, With Some Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The seventies really did produce a wide array of films so unique to that decade. As a sign of the current times, I can't imagine anyone attempting such a subversive, offensive 'comedy' nowadays, not even in the independent arena. It's all too politically correct now, there's always some group everyone's afraid to offend. Running down pedestrians is OK in this flic, and not just simple hit-&amp;-runs: the customized racecars usually skewer people with large blades or take their heads off and then there's a quick cut to the sports announcer yelling exuberantly 'all right!' as if a soccer goal had just been scored (and we thought "Rollerball" was fatalistic). Like "Rollerball," I think this little picture was ahead of its time; it accurately predicted more violent spectator sports and a sapping of the population's soul by the crass media. With its dark humor, the film seems to say that we, the human species, will never outgrow our penchant for blood (bloodsports here), no matter how we dress it up in government-sponsored murder or new games &amp; rules (hm, aren't we having a problem these days with more bloody video games for the kids?).When the film begins, it comes across as almost silly, introducing the distinctive drivers in the race as little more than clowns, topped by Stallone bellowing like some modern wrestling star at his 'fans'(Stallone, just a year before he hit it big in "Rocky"). Carradine as racing star Frankenstein comes across as some weird S&amp;M joke and you're ready to turn the thing off as you see the dopey futuristic skyline in back of the stands, supposedly representing the year 2000 (an arbitrary year for the sake of the title only). But very soon, around the time Carradine removes his mask, you begin to notice some subtle jabs at the government, our social structure, our way of life, really. OK, some of the jabs aren't subtle but they're still hilarious. I wonder who 'Mr.President' is based on - Ford was almost out of office, Carter was just coming in; Nixon had a very different personality from this. A newscaster is obviously a version of the famous Howard Cossel (or maybe Walter Cronkite?). You find out a few things about the seventies, such as it seems we had something against the French a lot longer than just the past decade (ah, the more things change, the more they stay the same). Or, were they predicting our antagonism? In a way, this picture has something for everyone: dark satire for the grown-ups; exciting racing &amp; some T&amp;A for the teens &amp; twenty-somethings; and even treacherous nurses getting whacked for the older set. Yes, something for everyone, if they can stomach it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Race 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the fascist future of America, the corrupt President of the United States holds a special sports event for "his people", which consists of five drivers and their passenger-navigators in a race where you score points when running over pedestrians! Certain pedestrians, like infants and the elderly, bring the big points because it takes a pretty strong person to run through those kind of innocent bi-standers. The praised hero of this sporting event is nicknamed "Frankenstein"(the always-cool David Carradine)because certain car crashes in the past have supposedly damaged various portions of his body..various operations have mended his wounds and broken bones as Frank wears a completely black uniform to hide his supposed monstrous scars. There's an underground rebellious group, called the Resistance, formed to overthrow the President's fascist totalitarian dictatorship and end the deadly sports game that has slaughtered an endless supply of innocent lives along the highways.Potent violence is on display in gory fashion as bodies are run over/through. Sly Stallone re-defines "the heavy" as a highly volatile racer who wants to make mincemeat out of Frankenstein or anyone who mistakenly believes he is his arch-nemesis. Sly's nickname is "Machine Gun" for Petesake! He plays this nutcase to the hilt(..check out the scene where he's eating some sort of whipped cream snack smearing it in the President-adviser's face!)and has a car with a large hunting knife sticking from his grill! Oh, man, and Mary Woronov is a blast as "Calamity Jane", her car has bull horns that actually gore one fellow who dares to challenge her with a red cape! Mary is in a war with Roberta Collins whose nickname is "Matilda the Hun" with her car dressed as a Nazi German machine! You have to witness their little name-calling fight, nude, on their massaging tables! And, Martin Kove(The Karate Kid)has a small role as "Nero the Hero", a considered has-been racer whose fallen on hard times and becomes the first victim of the "Resistance" rebels, who set-up traps to kill the racers one at a time as a symbol of their challenge to stop this type of negative violence to the people of their nation. And, how could I possibly forget Simone Griffeth as Annie, the secret agent for the Resistance who is under cover as Frank's navigator hoping to set-up a trap to kidnap the greatest race-car driver.This could be a horror fans dream. Shocking, tongue-in-cheek premise, outrageous violence where people's heads explode as a tire drives over them, sexy female leads(Simone gets naked for Carradine), and plenty of satiric jabs at everything from sports fanatics to politics. There's even a scene where the leader of a group of Frank's cult-worshippers, who stands in front of her hero's car to be run-through as a symbol of her undying devotion! Oh, and there's even a scene where Frank runs through a religious leader! What's even more cool is that this is directed by Paul Bartel and was supposed to be a Roger Corman rip from "Rollerball." And, it winds up being a cult-favorite. It was only after I watched it that I started reading about it. I think B-movie fans who love Woronov will get a kick out of this movie and there's even a sportscaster who mimics Howard Cossel! Oh, and there's one scene where a nursing staff actually roll elderly cripples in wheelchairs in the middle of the road so that Frank could run over them! I'm not kidding you, this film is a sick gasss!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One day I was looking through alternative DVDs at a stand at the local shopping centre, when the title of a DVD - 'Death Race 2000' caught my eye. When I first saw Death Race 2000 I already knew it would be an el cheapo spoof type of movie so of course I bought it. An interesting side-note, the particular DVD I bought had a 'G' (meaning general - for all ages) rating. A bit strange I thought, considering the title. I suspected it might be a pirated copy, but since you can't get it anywhere else...I already kind of expected what I saw (before I saw it) and can say that, for what I was looking for the movie did not disappoint. There is an overwhelmingly cartoony feel about it; the gratuitous violence is nonetheless quite cartoon-like. This film immediately reminded me (and no doubt inspired) of such early video games such as 'Death Racer' on the NES and the like. Indeed, it is a mindless romp with a flimsy plot whose only attraction is seeing the brutal killing of people for sport (the same attraction of Gladiatorial contests). Indeed, there's a black humour about it. Don't expect any deep social commentary.Visuals/Graphics: Given the budget of the film and the time period it was made in, you can't really expect mind blowing CGI-style special effects of 'Independence Day' or modern movies. However, the racing sequences were extremely tacky and unprofessional. The cars moved like two dimensional objects just moving along the screen and the cars themselves looked toy like. The gaudy, desert-like landscape, however, provided an appropriate background to the story. Anyway, its safe to say that eye-popping visuals were NOT one of the films strong points.Filming/direction and Acting: Well, what can you say? The direction, shooting etc were typical standard fare for B-grade 70s sci-fi flicks. The acting was nothing special, but not great. Stallone's performance is of course amateurish in comparison to his later works (I've never much considered him a 'serious' actor) but he does come through as a particularly egotistical, obnoxious character. The scene where he sprays machine gun bullets into the crowd is a classic.Story: The storyline is predictable and feels very recycled and unoriginal: the 'death sport' idea has been done to death, although I always delight in the strange black appeal of such brutal pursuits. You basically watch the film for the various death-sequences. Memorable scenes include the scene when Machine gun joe chases and runs over a man fishing (the burnout/blood spurting scene), the bullfighting scene with the Cowgirl character and the final scene. Anyway, you probably know the story: it is the year 2000 that there is a great rally known as the 'Intercontinental road race' where contestants try to score as many points by running over people. You get the picture. I won't spoil the ending for you.Sound, other.etc: You've got to love the tacky early electronic music which plays every time someone is about to be killed. Of course the sound effects are primitive at best, but what do you expect?Overall, in one sentence (due to lack of space) a tacky, cheap fantasy with a delightfully sadistic edge. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew this rental was a winner the second the horrible warped soundtrack started playing and the amazing graphics with the Death Race 2000 logo appeared.As others have mentioned, the best part about this movie is its originality -- it's "Carmageddon" years ahead of its time. Aside from that, it is interesting that long scarfs and poofy pants were projected to be popular in 2000, Nazi racecar drivers are cheered on, the pit stop breaks are for oily massages and boob shots, and the fact that each shot looks like it was filmed in the same location -- no matter what state they say it's in. Add a very cheesy futuristic backdrop into the first scene that is never used again and you have Death Race 2000.I agree that the least interesting part of this film is Paine's resistance, but that is made up for by Sly's terrific performance. The best scene is where Frankenstein and his navigator are in the bedroom (which oddly looks like a high school gym with bedroom furniture) and he removes his mask, strips down to his leather underwear, crosses the room (cue sexy 70's music) and asks her if she cares to dance when he turns around and suddenly has his mask back on! Editing??So rent this one with your friends, sit back and be prepared to watch some very fake "gore," goofy dialogue, and sped up racing scenes as you yell "what the hell?!!" at your TV set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a future and very unlikely society, the protagonists of a world-known car race are admired. The race consists on how many people the driver can kill. The story per se is already quite ridiculous, but the way the characters flow is even more absurd. The fight scene couldn't be more pathetic; how can a skinny man fight a huge stud like Sly and get away with it? It must have been quite a challenge for Stallone to try to make the whole scene real. It was so extremely pathetic that it wasn't even funny. Let us not forget either the hideous clothing that the "presumed" hero of the movie proudly wears, or the idiotic sense of humor at which we are supposed to laugh.Maybe not the worse movie I've ever seen, but close enough. I don't think it's worth watching, or maybe yes, just once, to know for sure how lame it is with your own eyes. Personally, I found it horrible and even disgusting at some point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad film with a cult feel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This cheesy cult classic has a great premise which is unfortunately spoilt by poor direction and a whole "cheap" feel to the film, due no doubt to the low budget. For fans of cult films though, this one is worth a watch, and Roger Corman was also involved in its production, making it unmissable in some circles. It's one of those films where the fun comes from watching things get destroyed - lots of cars get blown up by explosives, pedestrians are continually splattered by fast-moving vehicles, and in an exciting moment a car is chased by a plane dropping bombs! Aside from the entertaining chase bits - which only become vaguely repetitive - a whole lot of other stuff is thrown into the script. There's a vicious streak of black comedy (the "hits" scored by the drivers as they run over the public are portrayed amusingly), and even a social comment in there somewhere on America's obsession with violence - a theme which became even more popular in the '80s. Intermittently there are bits of romance and drama, but these never get in the way of the trashy spirit of the thing. We've got gratuitous nudity and gratuitous gore (wheels running over heads, etc.), sure factors to appeal to any red-blooded male.As for the acting, most of it is quite bad, but in a fun sense. Nobody really takes themselves seriously. Sylvestor Stallone - in one of his first roles - isn't afraid to be the obnoxious, violent villain of the piece who's out for himself and himself only, and his portrayal fits the character very well. However, it's David Carradine who stands out as the crippled Frankenstein, a man who always wears a fetish rubber suit and mask due to his various limbs having been replaced by surgeons after many, many accidents. Due to obvious budgetary constraints, these mechanical additions are never seen but rather implied. It's difficult not to like a film which takes literally the term "hand grenade", a film which has an annual euthanasia day where old residents are wheeled out into the road and left to die, or where a band of rebels do their best to destroy the opponents. And watch out for that twist ending! Camp, cheesy and quite bad, DEATH RACE 2000 disappoints yet remains influential to this day, via the computer game CARMAGEDDON and its sequels.</fullReview>

Running over people scores the racers points. Annie Smith is Frankenstein's navigator and possibly plans to kill him as part of an anti-race resistance.It's a campy cult classic.

Just enjoy it for the classic camp it is, the car action, the biting social commentary, the early Sylvester Stallone role (which doesn't seem much different from his later roles in either scope or ability), and the occasional topless women. If nothing else, look at it this way, it's half as long as "The Hunger Games" and twice as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1970's B-movie At It's Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I continue to work my way through the filmography of Sly Stallone in order, today I sat down to watch "Death Race 2000" To start, I would like to remind everyone that this is, in fact, a B movie. For those of you who aren't quite sure what that means, I'll offer you this definition from Wikipedia: A B movie is a low-budget commercial motion picture. In a sense, the "B movie" genre just about refers to any film that might not be entirely mainstream or have a decent budget. They're usually OK/watchable but offer little in terms of screenplay or acting, "Death Race 2000" falls into that category, and it has been praised by many as one of the more entertaining B movies ever made.This is a 70's B-movie at its best. Corny, cheesy, a lot of violence, a lot of nudity, cheaply shot with some awful dialogue and performances, but amazingly watchable and likable. Plot In A Paragraph: Set in a future (fifteen years ago) the ultimate sporting event is The Deathrace. Contestants get score points for running people down as they race across the country. The sport has crazed fans who sacrifice themselves to the drivers. An anti government agency is out to bring an end to The Deathrace. Sly gets second billing behind David Carredine, and neither give inspiring performances (one of acts, one sleep walks through his role) and share one of the worst fights scenes I have ever seen (Thankfully Sly got a lot better by the time "Rocky" was made a short year later) Martin Kove shares the screen with Sly again as fellow racer 'Nero The Hero' Simone Griffeth is probably the best actor of the lot as Annie, and is also gorgeous, as is Louisa Moritz. Sly doesn't do much other than scream and shout a lot, but it kind of works, and he does a few things in this flick you don't see Sly do often in his movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do you define entertainment in a society that enjoys watching brutality?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People tend to compare Paul Bartel's "Death Race 2000" to Norman Jewison's "Rollerball". I saw it as more analogous to Sidney Lumet's "Network", Peter Hyams's "Stay Tuned", and the "Hunger Games" franchise. All these movies depict the United States as a society whose idea of entertainment is the lowest, cruelest material. The difference is that "Death Race 2000" and "Stay Tuned" are comedies. The former is the sort of movie that encapsulates the '70s, while the latter was probably inadvertently predicted the rise of reality shows. Another movie that loosely resembles "DR2000" is the Italian mondo movie "Cannibal Holocaust". In one scene a character says that the audience likes having its senses assaulted. Here we see the drivers killing pedestrians, and the race's audience loves seeing it.Of course, it's possible to ignore all that and simply accept the movie as a zany exploitation flick. It's certainly an enjoyable one. David Carradine, Simone Griffeth and Sylvester Stallone all appear to be having fun with the material. Paul Bartel later directed "Eating Raoul", in which he cast himself and "DR2000" co-star Mary Woronov.Really fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Corman is known for making ultra-low-budget, B-grade (or lower) motion pictures that have lots of violence and nudity. DEATH RACE 2000 is no different in that regard. Personally, I haven't seen any other Roger Corman pictures besides this one, but if this is any indication of what they're usually like than I'll just stop here. I know that this film was limited by its low budget, but it still failed to entertain me with what it did have. There was some attempt at social satire, but it was all surface and supported by some of the worst acting I've ever seen. David Carradine is given top billing (as he is the main character), but I thought that Sylvester Stallone's limited, one-note performance was more fun to watch. Overall, the film fails at social satire and only makes up for it a little bit with some decent racing sequences (considering the budget).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this film off of Netflix since its about to be taken off and was surprisingly satisfied as to what I had seen. The film is one of those films that takes on a humorous tone, while against a controversial possibility to happening. While the film was made in the 70's as a look into what the Year 2000 would be like, it still looks great. I found myself wondering if this was made by Stanley Kubrick, lots of long angled shot and bright empty areas. One scene in particular reminded of The Shining &amp; A Clockwork Orange, when Carradine's Frankenstein and his navigator Annie are first alone together, the scene has a presence as strong as the actors and that is what Kubrick was known for, making the scenes jump out as much as the characters. The film has lots of funny moments and each character feels like a live action cartoon character, especially when Martin Kove(of the Karate Kid films)and Sylvester Stallone(of Rocky &amp; Rambo fame). David Carradine plays the Evil Kanieval of the film, known as Frankenstein, this is due to many of his body parts being fake, due to many horrific accidents due to the races. He does an excellent job at playing in the role, a role he'll briefly reprise in the Jason Statham Remake/sequel/prequel. He's also looked at as a sort of unique character, wearing a special out to amplify his look. We get a bit of back story on him, but not too much, as the films focus is definitely on the hit &amp; run races. Sylvester Stallone, plays "Machine Gun" Joe, his main rival throughout the picture, he plays the role in an adolescent way, focused primarily on Frankenstein, because he wants to be #1 and doesn't feel like he is appreciated. He certainly we are made to hate him, as he is way out there, even as far as smacking around his navigator. The females of the film are strong(except the navigator to Machine Gun Joe)and have there own personalities, but I wanna focus primarily on the two leads and the idea of the film. The films plot about legalized Hit &amp; Run sporting events is again seen in the Schwarzenegger film "The Running Man" but instead of hit &amp; run, its a battle royal of sorts criminals. The driving stunts and the circumstances of some of the hit &amp; runs are performed well and hilariously. Stallone &amp; Carradine perform their own driving stunts, making for better scenes and less cuts to stunt men. I have yet to see the remake and the prequels to that, its weird cause while the director of those films stated his film was a prequel to this, all other evidence says its a sequel. Anyway, I've written enough and definitely recommend this, for the formats and editions, I'd say get the recent Shout Factory Blu-Ray or DVD editions as they have some great features.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Review Of "Death Race 2000"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1975's "Death Race 2000" heralded in my most celebrated guilty pleasure. The total futuristic gore fest dystopia bloodbath films. There are others that should garner more love but for me "Death Race 2000" left the most scarring and fantastical impression. The film gives us a future of cross country racing like no race before. The hit and run becomes a celebrated pass time to appease the masses and bring down the population totals. Points are accumulated and tallied based on pedestrian qualities such as status in society, innocence, health, and all that range between. Things that make our real society focus on proper road edicate are distorted into a festival of cruel brutality. It makes this vision of an unsettled future bizarre and fascinating all while forcing us to question our sensibilities of what is acceptable in society.David Carradine's character is cold and calculative while maintaining his humanity. While most driver's in the movie go for the easy scoring targets he goes for the higher scoring overlooked targets. This makes his character a more likable representation of a Death Racer. This film kept me captivated as a kid with it's cruelty and psychotic transformation of what I considered society consisted of. A set of rules and moralities that allowed for a safe and orderly existence. This movie threw all that out the window and there was no real reason for it other than society had become filled with blood thirsty madmen held high by corporate/government power and influence. The film took everything about the world as we knew it and threw it into the fire to listen to the sizzling of a fired carcass. To this day this movie runs through my mind as I slow for a red light while some one crosses the street. Even entering a hospital or shopping center parking lot brings images of altered metallic beasts souped up with claws and knives of steel jutting from every available point rushing through the car park wiping out those who where to slow to make it inside or into their cars. "Death Race 2000" is a total exploitation of violence and lawlessness that brings the gore. The dialog is minimal and the kills are gruesome. It is a fun ride into an apocalyptic hell where hero's are madmen in hot rods of horror. A great film that is easy to watch, filled with death and brutality. There is even a message about being too content with societal standards. For me this was the movie that made me fall in love with futuristic flicks about a near apocalyptic world where anything goes. Truly one of my most indulged guilty pleasures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Legendary B-movie producer Roger Corman was obviously doing something right back in the day because of the acclaimed cult status that many of his films possess today. One such film is Death Race 2000, a story about a dystopian future where the most popular national sport is a deadly race where racers travel across the country, running down innocent pedestrians in order to score points.It's essentially R-rated Wacky Races. It probably sounds sick... and that's because it is. Death Race 2000 is a dark satirical comedy that may seem silly and vulgar on the outside, but it's perverse genius on the inside.This film takes place over the course of one of the annual races, and right from the start we are thrown face first into this topsy turvy future where mutilation and violence are now the highest forms of entertainment. The film moves fast and wastes no time in developing its hilariously bizarre story. The film boasts a colorful cast of characters that include the racers, their navigators, the race officials who are all hilariously quirky, and also a group of rebels who add a layer of conflict to the film. The various perspectives from which we watch this race unfold make this a very entertaining film. The whole ridiculous premise just makes it awesome and a disturbingly fun film to watch.You'll be surprised to learn just how much is going on in this film when you watch it. There's so much more to it than meets the eye, even if it succeeds the most at just being a gratuitously goofy ride. There are plenty of people who will see this film as obscene and stupid, with no point and no center. Those naysayers likely have little grasp on satire or dark comedy, because that is what Death Race 2000 is all about. It's plenty messed up, and plenty disturbing, but in the silliest and most entertaining way possible. This film is ridiculous. Ridiculously awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Bartel's (EATING RAOUL) first film for New World Pictures is a campy, smörg?sbord of over-the-top violence, political commentary and dark comedy. Not meant to be an ultra-serious film with award-winning performances and quality production values. But then again, I'm a sucker for anything that's unusually amazing.The year is 2000, but not the actual 2000. It is a future where morals and ethics are tossed aside in favor of the annual three-day Transcontinental Death Race from New York City to New Los Angeles. The drivers of the competition are earning high points for running over innocent spectators and pedestrians. But this year, things are going to be very different.The legendary half man/half machine racer Frankenstein (as portrayed by the late David Carradine) is back behind the wheel with a diabolical revenge and a lovely blonde mechanic (Simone Griffeth) on his side. Meanwhile, a diverse group of crazy drivers are vying to beat Frankenstein to the finish line: the hotheaded thug "Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo (pre-ROCKY Sylvester Stallone), icy cowgirl Calamity Jane (Mary Woronov), tough-as-nails Matilda the Hun (Roberta Collins) and flamboyant Nero the Hero (Martin Kove).Running at an unbelievably short 78 minutes, the film contains some awesomely nice racing cars, including Frankenstein's reptilian-inspired turbo charger, which is not a bad-looking car by the way. The racer's costumes are tacky as hell indeed, and I dare you not to laugh at Carradine's S&amp;M leather cat suit.DEATH RACE 2000 is just as low budget as a Roger Corman production can be. I'm dead serious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascination For Sex And Violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cult hero Paul Bartel directed this low-budget satire in which America's passion for cars, violence, and sporting events are finally brought together in one convenient package.Death Race 2000 is a cult action film that stars David Carradine, Simone Griffeth and Sylvester Stallone. The film takes place in a dystopian American society in the year 2000, where the murderous Transcontinental Road Race has become a form of national entertainment. The screenplay is based on the short story The Racer by Ib Melchior.In the not-so-distant future or year 2000, the United States has become a totalitarian regime overseen by the charming but sinister Mr. President, who, in order to satisfy the masses' need for entertainment has created a new national sport -- the Death Race, a nationwide road rally in which the winner is not determined by who finishes first, but by who scores the most points along the way by running over hapless pedestrians. Aspiring champions Machine Gun Joe Viterbo, Calamity Jane , Nero the Hero, and Matilda the Hun are all looking to take the top honors away from Frankenstein,a half-man/half-machine who has been built to be the best racer on Earth and can outrun and outkill anyone on the circuit. However, not everyone likes the Death Race, and revolutionary leader Thomasina Paine wants to sabotage the event in the name of restoring democracy; her plan is to foil Frankenstein's expected victory by smuggling her daughter Annie into Frankenstein's race car as his navigator.The movie about the story about a road race in the not-too-distant future for which the drivers are given points for running down pedestrians becomes an elaborate and telling fantasy about our peculiar taste and love for violence as telling tales of our choices in popular entertainment.It also shows of what things will become of our movies the years after Death Race 2000 was shown back in 1975.Aside from violence,the nudity featured in this film also proves that provide the viewer's satisfaction for sex as well.Overall,this movie tries to become a prelude of what things will become in the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah... the 1970s. We were easily pleased. The furore this movie caused on its release is laughable now. This low budget shocker is quite watchable as a period piece, and its good to see large doses of humour lacing the largely non-existent storyline. The dialogue by Thom and Griffith is dreadful, and as someone else points out it is merely a series of one-liners interspersing cars driving very fast, and there is no tension created in the story, which is pretty unbelievable considering its premise.Its also quite something when some of the "best" acting comes from Sylvester Stallone!However, considering its only 76 minutes long its worth a watch...just.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orwell, Rand and Huxley's stain on my brain has been removed with this Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not laughed so much as I did while watching this classic in a really long time. The low budget, cartoon-ish characters are so familiar and predictably drawn, complete with signature costume, vehicle done up with hilariously childish paint and body work complete with appropriate "extension" weapon (and placement of it- the Nazi car was particularly funny to me but I am notoriously juvenile) or other substitute prop to complete the silliest version of US in each relevant societal subgroup the writer has so bluntly illustrated to show each equally predictable and accurate purpose they must fulfill for the lighthearted satirical commentary on the actual total acceptance (and participation)in acts of violence by every person despite the usual claims to more admirable intentions from the usual Douchebags. I was so impressed with the very simple but "watershed" event used here to give this race a new but deserved challenge for the drivers that hadn't been present before: Hypocrite "resistance" group of nuts that can be destructive but suck at driving begin to level the playing field by killing Nero while attempting to score 100 baby killing points in the first 10 minutes of the race. She knew the bait, while ridiculously early in the race to not be a trap, was too easy for these mostly blind and stupid sport killers. This driver was too old school ridiculous and vain to last long in this race so therefore was the logical choice for first cut. His female navigator was more mother than weaker ego support partner which gave them that icky Oedipus vibe- too obviously weak for killing people while driving a car competently. Frankenstein, easily shown to be the most intelligent yet totally silly amateur Mexican wrestler-with-a-condom-for-a-costume favorite has the win already but his actual theatrical effort and self created legends coupled with a cool, smooth Charles Bronson- meets- Pink before the Wall came down cocky act that is reason alone to watch this movie. He levels the field one more by killing the Deacon for obvious reasons. Now everyone is in it to kill or risk being a wussy sacrifice. Prison gang guys are too dumb to even escape through the hole in the road and are awesomely wiped out- one does a complete flip with side roll upon landing. He should have lived...the other two stupidly died while coming BACK OUT OF THE HOLE...Don't deserve to live. Stallone's character is so fun for him that I couldn't get over how great he was here. He really goes overboard with Gangster; a wife beating moron barely functioning with a toddler's tantrum every 5 minutes. He adds more difficulty to their race by taking out his own pit crew! Of course he would! It even looks like he did it on purpose. Calamity Jane is the coolest and least nasty female character. She's the driver while Pete is her quiet do-boy for most of the race until she hits the mine. The Nazi couple are obviously here for a short time due to the weak man/demonic yet stupid blonde wife combo. She falls for the cardboard prop snare and somehow never pokes anyone with that three-inch meanie before diving over the cliff like all arrogant females should. Back to Frankenstein.The boots! The Hand Grenade!What cape-tossing! He totally slips her a roofie too- eliminating the hilariously obvious second obstacle for the driver...Passenger distraction, if not the constant bickering my parents regularly engage in while driving poorly. He really puts in some patience and witty conversation to get himself laid by this chick, actually lets her drive and miss a kill once(!), kills the Wizard, the crazy grandmother is straightened out via manipulating the old hypocrite to accidentally shoot his girlfriend/agent/shameless lying opportunistic whore--her granddaughter. She somehow isn't badly hurt, Granny joins their team while Frankenstein sells out like the whore he really was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cheap, nasty and gloriously camp, audiences expecting any level of sophistication (or budget) might be disappointed. This Paul Bartel black comedy from the Roger Corman stables is a classic cult picture, featuring Carradine as the grotesquely disfigured (!) Frankenstein, a rally car racing driver revered by the masses in the national sport of "death race", where competitors earn points for mowing down pedestrians. His nemesis is Sylvester Stallone in a pre-Rocky role, and although his name is often headlined on DVD box covers for the film, his role is relatively minor.As is customary in Corman movies, there's a bevy of busty babes to saturate the scenery; Griffeth as Carradine's navigator, the lovely Roberta Collins as Matilda and director Bartel's frequent collaborator Mary Woronov (also see "Eating Raoul") as Calamity Jane. Bartel himself makes a brief cameo, while some might also recognise Collins' navigator as pre-Love Boat Gopher. I also found the running commentary by the real Don Steele wry and energetic.There's a ton of T&amp;A (check out the topless massage brawl), blood and guts (and exploding heads) and typical colourful dialogue, sets and props to stimulate the senses, but Bartel's fast-pace and edgy tone really sets it apart. It's unequivocally C-grade and so unlikely to appeal to mass tastes, but surely one of New World Picture's best for cult film aficionados. Followed by "Deathsport" in 1978.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>satirizing violence by being violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was originally designed as a demonstration that American society loves violence and an attempt to show just how bad it is. But you cant satirize violence with violence since it merely feeds the desire and raises the acceptable levels higher.On one level this is a humorless peon to stupidity, or course it has all the requirements of a cult classic and it has maintained its status in that club since 1975. on another level entirely it is hilarious and so funny it fills the description of low camp.While Roger Corman tells us that this was made for $350,000 and Caradine got $50k of that. David Caradine's profit participation got him over $1million so Corman did it again the king of the B movies. Do you want to watch such a movie, its up to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost everything about this movie, cries or even begs, for a bad rating. The budget (it's Roger Corman production, so what would we expect?), the script with some pretty crazy dialogue. The "special" effects (although for a low budget not that bad), the editing, even the acting ...So why rate it so high then you might ask (especially if you haven't seen the movie yet)?! Well for once, a movie that allowed Sylvester Stallone to go ahead and make Rocky (he used his salary to get Rocky started), must be good ... But seriously though, there are quite a few reasons, why this movie, is pretty good. The crazy plot developments, are so out there and campy, that you have to love them. The idea to hide a message in all that carnage is just awesome! The political and social statements that can be found here, are unfortunately nowhere to be found in the Remake! All that is packed into some dark humor (that's where I got my summary title from too btw). It hasn't aged well (see above for reasons why), but I still can recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Race 2000 could have been great but isn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's some great ideas in this low-budget dystopian car race film, a sort of cross between Rollerball, 1984 and The Gumball Rally. The Totalitarian government of a futuristic, post-Industrial crash USA has instigated a cross-country car chase in which drivers get points for killing pedestrians, and the less able to work the pedestrian is, the more points he/she is worth (geriatrics are worth most). The media is in on the barbarism, but some revolutionaries are trying to sabotage the race.Paul Bartel's film suffers both from it's minuscule budget (whatever the economic/social disaster that has caused the fall, it's left the whole of America looking like a deserted backwoods, where only cable TV exists), really obvious political satire and lame attempts at wacky humour. On the plus side, there's a real relish in the carnage and a total lack of humanism, which makes the movie particularly galling for liberals. But the cheapness in both budget and shots finally works against what is a marvellous idea - Death Race 2000 is a film better imagined from its plot than experienced by watching what ended up on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Death Race 2000" Never Runs Out of Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Eating Raoul" director Paul Bartel's "Death Race 2000" remains a film ahead of its time in more ways than its futuristic setting. This murderous marathon of a car race where the drivers score bonus points for running down pedestrians without remorse was unlike anything ever seen when New World Pictures released it back in 1975. Okay, "Death Race 2000" looks like a cheap, campy, hell-on-wheels outing with a lot of blood red gore, but it isn't the literal images of death that stick with you as much as the startling idea of such a war. Bartel's motor rally extravaganza appears at least five years before the Hal Needham comedy "The Cannonball Run" in 1981 and its own sequel "The Cannonball Run 2" in 1984. The Roger Corman produced escapade was ostensibly based on a short story written by low-budget Danish sci-fi filmmaker Ib Melchior. Melchior penned semi-classics like "Robinson Crusoe on Mars," "The Angry Red Planet," "Reptilicus," and "Planet of the Vampires." According to Roger Corman, Melchior's story was serious instead of satirical. Corman and Bartel steered their film in the satirical direction and it resembles in text?at least?Stanley Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove." Notorious racer Frankenstein (David Carradine of ABC-TV's "Kung Fu") returns to life after extensive operations on his shattered body and we see him rise from a sheet covered table to the astonishment of news reporter after he had been frozen. The tall Carradine wears a solid, black outfit with a cape and the only thing missing from his sinister costume are ears and a bat on the front. He is a world renowned race in the nationally sanctioned, cross-continental USA 'Death Race.' Frankenstein's nearest rival, Machine Gun Joe (Sylvester Stallone before "Rocky"), wants to overtake Frankenstein and he has no qualms about his aims.The action in Robert Thom and Charles Griffith's screenplay is fairly straight-forward. Drivers line up at the starting gate in New York and careen their way across America and try to hit and run over as many pedestrians as possible. As ghoulish as this premise seems?and it is ghoulish?the filmmakers undercut it with comedy because it is pretty ghoulish. Again, comparisons with Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" with its theme about the end of the world are inevitable. However, Bartel keeps things lightweight and this neat little comic book style picture never wears out its welcome. The cars look cool, especially Matilda's Buzz Bomb sedan, a Volkswagen Karmann-Ghia, which resembles the infamous Nazi rockets that rained down destruction on London during World War II.Naturally, when "Resident Evil" director Paul W.S. Anderson reimagined "Death Race 2000," he departed considerably from the original, in part?I suspect?because Bartel's original would have been too volatile from today's impressionable audiences. Nevertheless, the 35 or so years since Bartel's classic appeared have no eroded its potency and "Death Race 2000" is not only a brilliant cult film but a lot of fun to watch. So take a ride on the hard side with this imaginative, low-budget glimpse into the future.</fullReview>

I got the feeling while watching this movie that everyone from the Director down knew that they were making an awful film, and decided to have fun with it. There were too many cartoonish parts of the movie to think other wise (ex. the car driving through the painted cardboard sign of a road, and off the side of a cliff) It makes this movies fun, funny, and more than worth watching.

		<shortDescription>Campy fun -- not to be taken too seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was in school, my best friend saw this on TV and just raved about this flick where mowing down women, children and elderly people in your car got you tons of points in this game.... He never said who was in it, though I heard the title endlessly, but I was never able to track down the video. Years later (and two days ago) I was looking through a stack of cheaply-packaged Canadian-released DVDs for $5, and there was Stallone's mug staring at me, the only copy on the shelf. When I realized Stallone was in it, I wasn't sure what to expect (not a huge fan), and moments into the flick, I still wasn't sure what to expect.... It's obvious from the start that this wasn't aimed at the mainstream public, and I soon realized why when I saw Roger Corman's name and a few people that were in "Rock and Roll High School." What I soon realized was that it's 80-some minutes of cartoonish nonsense, complete with the ultimate cartoonish-actor, Stallone (who was perfect for the role). Very over-the-top with tongue planted firmly in cheek, I really can't understand why I've never been able to find this. Everyone in the film seemed to be in on the joke and played it to campy perfection (with the exception of Carradine, who seemed a little wooden compared to everyone else -- though he was effective). The low-budget special effects are above average, many made realistic through the aid of quick-editing. And the story is so outlandish that it was the perfect premise for a film! Only two complaints. First, the film was too short. You rarely find movies that run less than 90 mins, and when you do, it seems like there should me more. Second, for the lack of sex scenes, there was too much nudity. Not that I'm against nudity, but it seemed rather pointless that all the contestants were lined up in the buff getting massaged (and though he appeared to be nude, it was one of the few times you didn't even get to see Sly's butt -- not that I'm complaining there -- he's shown it too much). Actually, one final complaint -- avoid the "Digital Multimedia Limited" DVD release with Sly on the cover as the picture quality leaves something to be desired. Now I have to find the sequel....</fullReview>

Not as many people get run over as I had hoped when renting it. Sylvester Stallone plays his most hilarious character ever, a mob racing guy who shoots at spectators who boo him with a tommy gun. There's also a Nazi guy and a dumb racing commentator who is annoying. Plus enough female nudity to keep attention from wandering in between the racing/bloodbath scenes. Love the hand grenade.

		<fullReview>Roger Corman-produced low-budget classic, directed by Paul Bartel, about a future where an annual race is held where the drivers score points by running over and killing pedestrians. The reigning champion is a masked driver named Frankenstein (David Carradine), whose new "navigator" is a woman with ties to a resistance movement looking to overthrow the despotic President. In typical Corman fashion, the movie came about because Corman wanted to capitalize off of Rollerball, another movie about a violent future-sport. While I do like Rollerball, this one is more fun to watch, in my opinion. The movie has a great cast playing assorted colorful characters. In addition to David Carradine, there's Mary Woronov, Martin Kove, Louisa Moritz, Simone Griffeth, Joyce Jameson, and Sylvester Stallone (in one of his first big film roles). There's satire, action, droll comedy, and intentional corniness. Despite the futuristic plot, this is totally a product of its time. Probably not something for all tastes but few things worth enjoying are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hyperadrenalinized Cartoon Come To Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, this is one of the wildest movies that I've seen in a long time! "Death Race 2000" (actually made 25 years earlier than that) deals with a transcontinental auto race between five drivers; a race in which points are scored for mowing down pedestrians (babies and seniors being worth the most points, for some reason), and which is constantly being attacked and sabotaged by revolutionaries who want to stop the violence. The five drivers involved are Frankenstein (David Carradine), who's had so many crack-ups that most of his limbs are now artificial; Machine Gun Joe Viterbo (Sylvester Stallone, on the cusp of "Rocky" fame, and absolutely priceless in this early role); Western cowgirl Calamity Jane (Mary Woronov); Nazi fraulein Mathilda the Hun (cult fave Roberta Collins); and the effeminate Nero the Hero (Martin Kove). Anyway, director Paul Bartel and producer Roger Corman have here created one of the most purely entertaining drive-in crowd pleasers ever. The picture is like a hyperadrenalinized cartoon come to life; one of the more profitable films, too, for Corman's New World production company. The film is excellent, satirical sci-fi, taking sharp digs at America's penchant for violent sport, and throws off bright ideas, clever one-liners, outrageous situations and surprising plot twists like a Catherine wheel shooting off sparks. It may also feature the highest-velocity, most visceral racing stunts until "The Road Warrior"'s advent in 1981. You'll certainly remember this film the next time you take the car out for a spin. But just remember also that in today's American society, running over granny will NOT score you 100 points!</fullReview>

'Death Race 2000' is full of hilariously under-cranked race scenes, terrible dialogue, performances so over-the-top as to raise suspicions of pharmaceutical abuse, special effects that Tom Savini would have been ashamed of as a teenager experimenting in his garage, cheap sets, and bargain-basement costumes. And yet it all seems to work, thanks to Corman and Bartel, who manage to infuse everything they touch, however close it gets to exploitation, with an infectious charm and innocence that's just plain fun to watch. It's of equal interest to experience such a vivid time capsule of mid-seventies counter-culture politics. But despite all the veiled references to Vietnam, Watergate, government corruption and public apathy, any real satirical power is lost beneath the weight of such broad, slapstick comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took my children a month to convince me to watch this film---and boy am I glad I did. The original 'Little Shop of Horrors' had been a staple of 'late-nite' TV so long, I cringed at the thought of Corman---although I never forgot Seymor running through empty tires, or Jack Nicholson's bit part, waiting for 'dentist-pain'. And then Jack again in the truly funky 'The Terror', I recall it was Karloff's last effort. And Jack still needed a few 'acting' lessons.In high-school my friends and I would walk the 20-mile trip to see fine Italian art-cinema only shown at the old University of Tampa theater---'The Bicycle Thief', 'La Dolce Vita', 'Two Women', etc. Those films were so extraordinary vs. 'John Wayne' bunk, we learned the difference of 'art' vs. 'pablum'. This film took me by surprise---20 years later, I still watch it. Why? To spite what some may 'sniff' at, like the Race starting in New York, but obviously filmed on the very roads I knew as a 25-year Southern Californian---Stallone's magnetic,as all---the plot, full of surprise gut-laughs, the artistic nudity---simply magnifico! Such elegance from Mr. Corman? Paul Bartel's directing (Eating Raoul)---A+. And the ultimate, far ahead of its time, political stance of 'The elite's privileged rule' losing to true Democracy, at last---i feel all minor flaws just that---minor---this film will never die---all who miss it, by choice from its near total nude scenes, or for its liberal political Power, well, they simply lose. Considering this Nation's political disasters alone, makes this film both current and one lovable, hilarious bit of true satirical black-comedy art---it's not 'Dr. Strangelove', yet its positive outlook on the salvation of our Nation, outrageous humor(all done on a teeny budget)has made it a continuing 'cult-classic'---not to be missed---'nuff said---solid 10.

		<fullReview>This is a very good little cult film, that's actually quite amusing, even if it is sadistic, with a fun story, and amusing performances!. All the characters are cool, and there is plenty of gore and violence, plus while I'm not too sure if this is a film David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone are proud of, they were fun to watch!. While it's not really a good movie, as a cult movie it's top notch, and The races were quite exciting, plus it's pretty well made for a cult film. I had been looking for this film for a while, and I happened to find it in the rental section, and I was surprised to find that Carradine played the good one and Stallone was the villain, plus even though it is sadistic, I thought it was quite clever that you get points for running down pedestrians. I also thought all the cars were quite cool looking, and it also has some very funny moments as well, plus the ending kind of cracked me up as well. It's decently written, and there are lots of explosions to enjoy too, plus it's also very tongue in cheek too. This is a great little cult film,that's actually quite amusing, even if it is sadistic, with a fun story, and amusing performances, I highly recommend this!. The Direction is great!. Paul Bartel does a great! Job here with solid camera work, good angles and keeping the film at a fast pace. The Acting is fun if nothing else. David Carradine surprisingly plays a solid hero, he looked really cool, reminded me of Darth Vader in a way, and while he did look embarrassed to be out there at times, he still was fun to watch!(Carradine Rules!!!!). Sylvester Stallone is amusing but looked really embarrassed to be in this film, still he had fun with it and played a good villain! (Stallone Rules!!!!!!!!). Simone Griffeth is OK as the love interest and did what she had to do adequately. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall I highly recommend this!. ***1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should become a cult classic over time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never seen this movie before my husband pulled it out of the dollar bin at Wal-Mart. Really funny and a very enjoyable show of senseless violence. Got to admit some notable computer effects too, kind of reminds me of the effects in the first Star Trek movies. Also pretty amusing if you want to see what types of clothes we would supposedly wear and the crappy cars we would drive in the year 2000... Yet the technology is there for medical miracles like the healing of "Cryosleep"..Reminds me of the Conan O' Brien jokes of 2002 about the "year 2000." If you are a fan of Pulp Fiction, Rocky Horror Picture Show or Dirty Mary Crazy Larry you will undoubtedly enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when I thought I'd never see another movie that was so bad it was good, I decided to purchase Death Race 2000. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie's wicked sense of humor. It takes place over a period of one race where the main objective is to make it from one side of the country to the other. Points are given for running over pedestrians, especially those that are either infant or elderly. Costumed freaks are the bread and butter. You'll see: Superheroes, Cowboys, Nazis, and Capone like gangsters. And the cars they drive don't get any better, they include: A reptile themed car, A car that has two tommy guns on each side of its headlights and a gigantic hunting knife in the middle of its bumper, and a bull themed car with horns on its bumper. The film truly doesn't take itself seriously and that is a good thing because it certainly adds to the enjoyment. The sound effects are that of only the finest Flintstones cartoon, and the special effects usually consist of poor matte paintings. It's nice to see Stallone and Carradine in some early roles, before either struck it big. Particularly Carradine, who is horrible in this movie. It just comes to show you that some bad actors don't stay bad. I can't say Stallone got much better than he is in this movie, it's typical fair for him to shoot a gun or have a fist fight. So if you and a couple of friends want to play a fun drinking game. And you have a craving for the worst fist fight ever on film, Death Race 2000 is sick comedic fun for every one. The special effects are so bad that even small children would laugh. I give Death Race 6 stars simply because it's fun to watch, in a really sick way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bastard brother lost and found.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am really fond of DEATH RACE 2000 for bringing me back to an unforgettable video childhood experience. Being 9 and a certifiable ENTER THE DRAGON fanatic, I came to own a betamax copy (the one with leather-suited David Carradine and Warner Bros. logo) by reasons that seemed random and with no instant connection whatsoever. Like a monolith in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, I could see the art-covered box but was unaware of its content nor my evolution as a film buff.Kinky and violent as it was in those days, M decided I was too young to watch this futuristic tale about caricature-like drivers in a near future cross-country race. The rule? To run over as much pedestrians as possible for scoring points and, of course, to come first at the finish line. Too bad I got caught watching that death race too many times, because the video was confiscated for good. Memories could not be taken, though.Hence, the quest began. Scenes, lines and movie moments of DR2000 haunted my mind: Stallone shooting at the crowd, "What you expect, another pretty face?", the bullfighting, the high-speed roads, Machine Gun Joe's car, the naked ladies, Frankenstein's mask and helmet, the hand-grenade and split seconds of the ending! Not everything stayed in my mind years after, but I dreamed of what the movie could be, or even buying a copy of it (finally!) to wake up realizing it was just a dream. I became obsessed.Research went by. I came to learn that Bruce Lee was offered the lead in the TV show KUNG FU, but producers picked David Carradine instead. That was it! The repeated viewings of ENTER THE DRAGON surely led my folks buy another karate-themed flick on their way to the States. Assosiating Carradine (of Cain fame) in the cover must have taken an ironic Bruce Lee's bastard brother scenario.Eventually I bought a VHS copy while in New York a decade ago and nowadays I re-watch a pristine DVD version of it. Visiting this flick is a joy. Carradine is the bad-ass kind. There is no martial arts in it, though. It is a campy Roger Corman production with some wacky ideas and exploitation written all over it. Set in the future with a lame seventies fashion. Its technical and storytelling values, which are almost nowhere to be found in this cult classic, are too close of porn. Laughable dialogs, cheap action and bland acting... What is there not to like? This movie is genius! Definitely a Saturday afternoon feature. Movies can be made to please crowds, to win awards or to become classics. Films can be the ultimate tool for bigger-than-life directors. And then you have the flicks that are true to themselves, sometimes low budgets that take chances no matter how tacky they might become. DEATH RACE 2000 is all that. It means more than a movie to me. It's about the heart behind making it (Corman, Bartel et all.), the fun that is to come up with something that really turns out at least entertaining. And, on a much personal note, it's about my journey with the movie: watching it repeatedly as a child, then having it taken away only to imagine or remembering the way it was and the search of it until finally experiencing the flick again. This after years of hope and dreams.Well, guess what? The kid is really much alive and DEATH RACE 2000 still rocks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a Roger Corman movie, you can't get any better. An interesting, but not too realistic futuristic plot where the open road has become a race track of death. Death Race 2000 takes place in America's future.....the year 2000. Although the wardrobe from the 70's hasn't changed, the political system in America has. David Carradine stars in this "campy" action film, but it is Sylvestor Stallone that is the true star of the movie. Starring in a more comical role, Stallone is the funny villain. This 85 minute classic is just that, a Corman classic. It is filled with car chases, explosions, blood and gore, and nudity. It is everything you want out of a Corman movie. Even though the story could have been better, the movie wins it's audience over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>70's Cult Film Still Entertains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death Race 2000 is one of the cult movies of the 70's directed by the late Paul Bartel, produced by Roger Corman, and starring David Carradine in the waning days of his original Kung Fu television series. On the surface, it's about a cross country race between arch enemies, who mow down pedestrians for points in the process. It's so much more than that though. It pokes fun of celebrities, our glorification of youth, the media, politics, our obsession with and subsequent indifference to violence, and even cartoon violence. Carradine plays Frankenstein, a reconstructed racer injured multiple times in previous races. Sylvester Stallone is hilarious as Joe Viterbo, the rival out to beat and get Carradine, but who can't speak in anything but an angry/finger-pointing manner. The film moves quickly in 79 minutes, creating great effects the old-fashioned way by good editing. There are a few phony effects too though, but it's a B-movie. Highlights are the wheelchair scene and Stallone chasing a fisherman. Consistently entertaining throughout, despite the fact it was filmed for less than $1,000,000. Its sequel is Deathsport, 1978. **1/2 of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great. When Stallone started firing a tommy gun at the audience you knew this was far more different than anything else. Carradine, in a really unusual costume that makes him look like a skinny Darth Vader, pulls it off without a hitch, hilariously mind you, but the movie is great anyway so who cares? The cars are fast, the women are cute (even ravenous!), and The President is the type of person everyone loves to hate.It is the year 2000 and the annual Transcontinental Death Race has begun! Who will run over the most pedestrians and win?An interesting, smart way of looking at the future, DEATH RACE 2000 has many perspectives in its satire of America and the media. But what else is better than seeing Jane and Matilda threatening to duke it out and Frankenstein and Joe fight (badly, but this is a B-movie). Watch out for those French airstrikes! Clever and hilarious B-movie action at its finest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though now dated with its abundant 1970s styles, fashions, and music, Death Race 2000 still is a lot of fun to watch. This is a film that is not to be taken seriously, as it does take itself seriously. Set in the year 2000 (which was the future back in 1975), America is ruled over by Mr. President, who acts as a dictator and whose word is law; we learn that all the former members of Congress have been locked up in a penitentiary compound since he took power, and he uses his Secret Police to keep order. To keep the masses entertained, Mr. President lords over the annual Transcontinental Road Race, whereby points are scored not only by crossing the finish line first but also for running over anyone on the streets. Carradine does a good job as Frankenstein, though he looks like he longed for the years he spent on Kung Fu while making this movie. Stallone is fun as Machine Gun Joe, making this movie about a year before he starred in Rocky. The other actors seem to be enjoying themselves in their roles, and despite the limited budget this is actually an entertaining film. Not a classic by any means, but one of the better overlooked films of the 1970s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surely the cheesiest movie ever made. It came out in 1975, and it's got tons of bad 70's hairstyles, horrible 70's soundtrack music, cheapo stunts and special effects, and awful overacting by Stallone and awful wooden underacting by David Carradine, who looks bored to death to even have a role in this film. From the opening shots, where the race cars are leaving the Lincoln Tunnel in "New York" (in reality, the freeways of LA) to the ending, the pure cheapness of this project shines through in nearly every scene. The cars look like something an 8 year old glued onto his Hot Wheels toys, and the "gore" scenes look like cars running over department store mannequins filled with ketchup. In short, there's no way this movie should succeed, yet somehow it does. The basic concept is so idiotic it just grabs you and runs with it. It's the year 2000 and instead of the Super Bowl we have the Transcontinental Road Race, in which 5 drivers and their navigators race from New York to LA in a contest, not just to reach the finish line first, but to run over the most pedestrians along the way. It's full of campy dialogue "No one scores my navigator and gets away with it!" screams Calamity Jane as she races off in hot pursuit of Matilda the Hun and her sidekick, Herman the German. I suppose this movie could be seen as a serious satire on the American love of sports violence, but it's just too cheesy to be taken seriously. Instead, just sit back, shut off your brain, and watch two knuckleheads (Carradine and Stallone) and a nice bevy of babes (Calamity Jane, Matilda, and "Annie", Carradine's navigator and resistance secret agent) as they drive coast to coast, running over anyone in their path. Score this movie C- for execution, but a solid A for originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious satire often mistaken for something else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Death Race 2000", though somewhat dated now, is a raucous stab at modern cultural trends and social mores. The premise -- a new national pastime, in which select contestants race their specially-modified killing vehicles from coast to coast, scoring as many points (i.e. killing as many people) along the way as possible, is a powerful social commentary. Sylvester Stallone plays a fabulous underdog to the favorite, Mr. Frankenstein (played by David Carradine). The other racers are a hoot, as are the television reporters, who keep the viewer up to date on the action. The people's hero, Mr. Frankenstein, is even attacked by the "Treacherous French", a bit of propaganda which always struck me as hilarious. This film has many memorable moments. While it will never win any awards for acting or cinematography, its campy charm will seduce all but the most jaded film viewer. If you don't get a chuckle out of this, you're burned out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As it happens, I was just watching this film to while away the time before the NFC Championship game in Philadelphia. When I switched from the appalling carryings-on of Terry Bradshaw to the sports commentators in DR2000, it was difficult to detect any real shift except in the weather, the camera work and the wardrobes.Other than those production values, the similarities were remarkable. One might have hoped that 38 years would have rendered the satire's simplicity totally ridiculous and inane. Unfortunately, despite the film's sophomoric social commentary, it is still right on the mark. Not bad for an ephemeral medium and a low-priced entry.By the way, this doesn't represent the point of view of an elitist. I fully plan to get to the game once the hype is finished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I thought this was the worst movie I had ever seen. It has horrible acting, horrible writing, HORRIBLE special effects, the worst fight scene EVER (makes the WWF of the 1980's look realistic), and not nearly enough violence. Then I remembered the unwatchable monstrosities that are "Pay it Forward" and "Small Time Crooks." This is a different type of atrocious film than those two. Those were films that simply should be watched by no one, under no circumstances, with absolutely no redeeming qualities (aside from seeing the hyper-irritating Haley Joel Osment character get shanked at the end of "Pay it Forward.") "Death Race 2000" is along the lines of "Plan 9 from Outer Space" - a film so incredibly bad that it actually becomes a must-see in order to appreciate the depths to which the entire production managed to sink. Plus, it manages to work naked women into scenes for no apparent reason - how can you not appreciate a film that does that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the all time greatest movie experiences of my life. Serious. Dead Serious. If this masterpiece of absurdity doesn't leave you near death from laughter, if you have even one cell of your being that isn't entirely delighted, then there's just absolutely no hope for Mankind. "Death Race 2000" is to modern cinema what Beethoven was to fresh water fly fishing. Who the f@*# knows?! But they both kick total ass!!! David Carradine is not a lousy actor but you'll be cheering his horrendously lousy performance as the righteously cool Frankenstein. And working twice as hard at it is Sylvester Stallone in what is my all time favorite "Rocky" movie without boxing. He is hysterically ridiculous as the evil hearted, ultra nasty Machine Gun Joe Viterbo. "Give the people what they want!" he barks as he steers his race car's enormous hood ornament bayonet right through the torsos of silly bystanders. Bloody Brilliant! And his side kick navigator and nightmare nag, Louisa Moritz as Myra, is a bleach blond comedy bombshell.There's no expense spent on this monument to low budget filmdom. It's a race across the USA but exactly one foot outside of their "East Coast" start city they are careening around the Los Angeles suburbs. So what, it's not a damn travel log, it's a Death Race! And the "lavish" sets - including a luxury hotel room that is actually just an empty conference room with a super red carpet and a couple flimsy hanging screens - are the best expression of post-modern minimalism that any art school grad could ever hope to conceive. See, this fine feature has got culture coming out its wazoo. There's even a scene that pays direct homage to "Vanishing Point" (1971) - another classic tribute to hard driving American idealism.This one may not be for those sad, semi-intelligent drones out there who have not yet learned that the best way to enjoy the crap that Hollywood excretes on us is not to laugh WITH it, but to laugh AT it - A full throated, belly busting, spit-in-face roar of contemptuous satisfaction. I nearly threw up on this one, it's that good. She dares you to ignore her and then destroys anyone who admires her. This movie is such a total Bitch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential viewing less so for its 'cult' status or chance to see a young Stallone; but for its ideas and statements that still ring true today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are lots to be had out of Death Race 2000; a 1970s action, adventure, spoof, horror, comedy, sports film, that purposely lacks in narrative and character development but excels in some genuine laughs and a scathing, scathing message that we can only acknowledge now in the sense it was ahead of its time. This is the idea: a character in a gimp suit named Frankenstein (Carradine) is in a race with four others, one of which is a young Sylvester Stallone, and they compete in the death race of the title that crosses America in a future set dystopian world.Now, this idea when read on paper sounds like an absolute riot and there is definitely some fun to be had out of the film but subjectively, its problems lie in its basic approach and its gaping logistical flaws. Getting straight to the point and watching the film today, eight years after it's set, Death Race 2000 has something to say and it holds up. I think the overall idea that comes out of this film is in regards to what people are actually willing to label 'entertainment'. Here and now in the 21st Century, television plays an important part in our lives and is seemingly ever increasing with new expansion packs and digital services being updated and released ever several months or so. The endless number of talent shows and reality game shows that multiply second only to bacteria is incredible, as is the sure-fire way of getting noticed within the entertainment industry. One person can be a 'nobody', go on television and become a 'somebody'.It is this point that Death Race 2000 tries to make. The film is a cross between relatively recent computer game 'Carmageddon' and a film along the lines of 1992's Stay Tuned or 1998's Pleasantville with a whiff of 1982's TRON in the sense it is a gladiatorial driven competition set within a strange and dystopian world full of colour and bizarre features. The only difference being and unlike my film examples, the character know they are in the world and play out the game anyway. But the film has a political statement to make and from my reading, it is a negative one. Made in the 1970s at the height of the Cold War, the general feeling was that graphic violence and nasty deaths could well happen at any time and when you least suspect it. Such is the way that the public live during the race: you're having a picnic in your perfect Capitalist world on a sunny day in the park when disaster strikes.But the politics do not end there. The government itself resembles a sort of bloodthirsty and power-crazed dictatorship which holds a race every year for those equally bloodthirsty and power-crazed as themselves. If you match up to this ideation, you are permitted to take part in the race and kill for sport. Look at the characteristics of the racers, especially Joe (Stallone) and Frankenstein; Joe is a very angry and enraged person who is almost equally as domineering as he is overly protective of his co-driver. Frankenstein is not so much angry nor is he as obsessed with power but that's not to say he isn't hard bodied; thus when the 'New Order' arrives at the very end of the film, it's no surprise the new ideas introduced are done so by a certain character. Compare the other racers, one of which drives a car and wears a Nazi get-up. You don't need to be a genius to link power and blood-thirst to the word 'Nazi' and as a result, these neo-Nazi racers are qualified to race. Then you have the freedom fighters who adopt the actual 'stars and stripes' American flag; the true Capitalists and the 'should-be' rulers of America. It is no surprise their ideas and their approaches win through since it is their 'proper' ideals that should be in-force.Death Race 2000 is a very dark film that is dealt with in a very upbeat and cheesy manner but this is linked to our obsession with TV. When we watch a reality TV show in which someone is about to psychologically break down, that is supposed to be entertainment but you can guarantee that that episode of that show will end with the same upbeat and perhaps cheesy theme tune with which it has always used. This is Death Race 2000's coverage; announcing the deaths in-between friendly banter but maintaining a 'happy' aura; even rewarding the first widow with a prize ? the network will not change its tune merely for something bad that has happened.It seems strange that older people (who are slower than everyone else) would be worth more points since they would be easier to hit. Also, is it a race to the finish or is a points based game? Joe is sent down a dead end and is angry as a result but if they're had been a hundred old folks down that dead end, would he be so annoyed? Likewise, Frankenstein may be closer to the finish but Joe would've just earned a shed load of points so the joke would've been on Frankenstein. In addition, it seems really important to gain that extra lead early on, but every time a pitstop happens, everyone catches up with anyone anyway so what's the big deal? What the film lacks for in logic and narrative, it makes up for in politics and general statement; the idea that anyone will watch anything was not dealt with as well as this until 1998's The Truman Show. Now that's a compliment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death Race 2000 (1975) *** (out of 4) Produced by Roger Corman this is a prime example of a cult classic from the 70s. In a cross country race, drivers are given bonus points for running over anyone on the streets. The film is pure nonsense from start to finish and that's what makes it so much fun to watch. It's overly violent and over the top all the way through with fun performances by David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone. The movie never takes itself too serious, which was great considering today you'd probably have to throw political junk into the mix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wacky Races was never this much fun!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the low-budget films I've seen over the years, "Death Race 2000" is most likely the most enjoyable film I've ever watched (and possibly the most hilarious).The two main players who steal the show are David Carradine, as the dark and moody Franskenstein (who is not without his sensitive side), and Sly Stallone (in one of his earlier appearances) who is an absolute scream as Frankenstein's rival, the hilariously foul-mouthed, obnoxious Machine Gun Joe Viturbo.One of the things this film has going for it is that, unlike most films of it's ilk, it is not completely drenched in mindless, unnecessary gore-there are short, sharp busts of gory violence which just about manage to grab the viewer's attention. The film is also evenly-paced. There are also plenty of episodes of slap-bang action to keep even the most avid action film fan highly entertained."Death Race 2000" also works as a highly entertaining film on quite a few levels. Mostly, it works as a biting media/social satire. The issues it raises, such as the "no-holds-barred (to quote Mr. President), Roman games" mentality of modern TV programmes, are much more relevant today, as they were back in 1975. Another good thing is that this film does so without taking itself too seriously. It also comments on right-wing politics in America (also another relevant subject in this post-9/11 day and age) Overall, the production design of the film looks more than adequate considering its measly budget. The cars look pretty cool.All in all, "Death Race 2000" is an immensely enjoyable experience, which is truly well-deserving of its cult classic status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic That Should Be Left Alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot say anything about this film you don't already know.I always wondered why David Carridne did this low budget film at the height of his "Kung Fu" fame. Whn I am sure he could have done any number of big budget films.Also the appearance of the "unkown" Sylverter Stalone, hamming it up in one of his best roles, in my opinion.This is a classic of the B-Movie genre. This shows what you CAN do with a limited budget and a great idea. It also encompassed may issues/ideas of the mid-70's in a comic way that made you think also.I find it ironic the the society portrayed in the film is not too far removed from the actual world we now live in (minus the race of course!) I do know there is a plan to remake this as Death Race 3000. I feel that they should leave a classic alone. I am very tired of Hollywood remaking every film/TV show/comic book of the last 40 years. Have we run out of original ideas?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this was recommended to me. I like cheesy movies people regard as trash. I heard about this movie, had a little trouble finding it, and found it at Walgreens of all places for 3.99 when I wasn't even looking.If you have ever played Carmaggedon, this movie will seem familiar. If you haven't, the premise is to score points by running people over.Deathrace 2k is about race car drivers who race across the country. They get points for killing people, like children and teens are worth a specific amount, and elderly people etc.there are about 4 or 5 drivers. Each driver has a navigator, someone who tells them what roads to take. You have Sylvester Stallone, David Carradine as Frankenstein- a legend in the sport of death racing, a team of Nazis Herman the German, and Matilda the Hun, and a few others I forget.If the navigator for a male is a female...the male gets some err benefits. No need to explain, watch and find out.there is cool kills. A car tries to run over a baby for bonus points but something horrible happens to them. A cool glimpse of Stallone early on in his career.Carradine is cool as always.The french are made fun of in this movie. Id say, your looking for a cheesy, fun movie check it out. Also worth a look too for David Carradine and Stallone</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death Race 2000 is a film which I have seen only twice, both at the cinema (June 1981 and December 1991) but I remember it as being very original in many ways, it stands out clearly from all these bland films you get nowadays. The black humour, although in very poor taste (it is very unlikely that a film about people being run over would get made today) is done very intelligently and the whole film has a completely individualistic feel to it, right down to the credits at the end. The low budget (witness the cardboard backdrop of a futuristic New York at the beginning) actually makes the film more endearing. A must-see.One question I have - the BBFC website states that it had to be cut in order to get an 'X' certificate in 1975. I presume that this includes my cinema viewings in 1981 and 1991, does anyone know precisely what scenes were cut? Also, does anyone know whether the cuts were restored for the '18' certificate video versions?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first of David Carradine's "Collision Films" of the 1970s ("Thunder and Lightning," "Cannonball," etc.) and should have been the best. Even after 30 years, it is a genuine disappointment that it is not.I remember seeing "DR2000" in its element - at a drive-in long ago, when it was brand-new. And I remember the buzz at the snack bar afterward (it was stacked into a triple-bill) confirmed what I had noted for myself: That for most of the audience, this movie was more engaging than what was happening in our own backseats at the time. For a drive-in movie, this was remarkably unique.It would be fatal to take the movie too seriously. It is tailor-made for a fancy-pants critic to gibber on about its "dark satire" and "trenchent observations about America's underlying fascistic tendencies and love of violence," blah, blah, blah. Yeah, right...But Paul Bartel gives it too much of a swing from the other side. His incessant campiness robs "DR2000" of any impact it might have had. Characters talk past one another, plot lines dribble away into stupidity and it is impossible to care, in the end, about anything within its framework.The overall impression left by "DR2000" is just how good a performer David Carradine is. With a squint, he can add import to a scene that ordinarily would lack any. And he easily blows away anyone else on the screen.Ride on, Frankenstein.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Neither, actually. It's a fun S-F movie (A race where you score points both for speed and for every pedestrian you manage to run over) with some "serious stuff about violence-media-entertainment for the masses" thrown in just for kicks. Mr President is uncomfortably similar to Bush Jr (remember this film was made in 1975) and the Howard Cosell sound-a-like treatise on "the orgins of violence" it somewhat thought provoking.I'm presuming that the above is a just what some of the young people involved had fun with the concept that a movie should "mean something" - "Let's throw some fitting "serious social commentary" in, and if it makes someone think - all the better"You can think what you want of the "social commentary" - it's throwaway stuff that doesn't effect the basic cool things about the movie:1)A race in which one gets point by running over pedestrians - Now, I can (theoretically) realize how someone may not think that the idea is *cool as hell*... but only theoretically.2) The all too obvious 70's-80's S-F film nudity (not too much of it)3) A semi-reasonable plot, and decent acting.4) A pre-anything Silvester Stallone, over-acting, yelling at people (in the buff, at that!) and getting his ass kicked by David Carradine.All in all - a very fun little flick.And remember - kids under 7 = Double the points!</fullReview>

Carradine is Frankenstine, a racer who is reported to be half man half racing machine. he has an even more ambitious agenda concerning the president. Sly is machine Gun Joe, a gangster type racer who (*gasp* surprise) has a machine gun in his car. These two, along with other characters all are in this race. each one with an odd personality and even odder type of car. This satire isn't bad if youre looking for a laugh.

		<fullReview>The President of America has invented a new sport. Drivers race their cars from the west coast to the east coast; the winner is the driver with the most points. Oh but how do you score points? By RUNNING INNOCENT CIVILIANS OVER that's how.This film follows one of those drivers, his name is Frankstein and he wears a gimp suit, but that's not the most stupid part. For some unknown reason one of his hands has gone missing. So what does Gimpsuit Frank replace his missing hand with? A prosthetic hand? A hook? No, a grenade but not just any old grenade, a hand grenade.Throughout the film, the drivers are being killed off by the Resistance Fighters, a group of hippies who feel the race is morally wrong. But they don't just shoot the drivers, that would be far too non-funny. On one occasion, a driver is speeding down a bridge and there is a pram on the road! This driver is about to bag himself 70 points! For running over a baby! He hits it! He explodes! He! wait what?... It turns out, the Resistance Fighters loaded the pram full of dynamite and no babies were harmed during the making of the film.The drivers are paired up with a co-driver before the race. Unlucky for Gimpsuit Frank he is paired up with a female member of the Resistance Fighters. But not it worry, they both have sex and she soon finds out Gimpsuit Frank thinks the race is too morally wrong and that the only reason he has a hand grenade hand is because if he wins the race, he gets to meet the President and shake his hand...But the only way he can win the race is to run over as many people as possible, so really, the main character is a contradicting moron.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I vaguely recall, a few years back - it was late at night when people are too stoned to understand/care what is going on, and I was flicking through the channels looking for some nonsense to vegetate in front of. As it happened, "Death Race 2000" was about to begin on Channel Four so I thought hey, a crappy '70s B-movie set in the future (i.e. sometime around now), this should be good for a laugh. I kinda fell asleep halfway through.Not long after, I saw the DVD going for a fiver in Fopp so I picked it up, thinking oh yeah, I never finished watching that.Although it is too dumb to be moral and too tacky to be cynical, I think "Death Race 2000" carries itself quite well as a 'cult classic' in the mould of "The Running Man" or Russ Meyer's silly '60s sex comedies.A thoughtless movie, probably knocked up in a matter of weeks, insignificant acting on display (particularly from Carradine and Stallone who would go on to bigger things) and a poor attempt at science fiction.You might as well check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By the 1970s Roger Corman had quit directing in order to become an highly successful producer and it's a sad comment on the changing nature of the movie market that junk like "Death Race 2000" did so well during its intital release.It marked a turning point and the beginning of a rapid nosedive for a man who had previously created such wonderful films as "The Pit and the Pendulum". Even his less ambitious but equally entertaining quickies such as "The Little Shop Of Horrors" with their mild doses of black humour were streets ahead of the utterly mindless rubbish that he was churning out by the time this snooze fest splattered across the big screen. An endless and rather boring cavalcade of girlie and slasher pics became his only contribution to the cinema from the '70s onwards.Put simply, Roger Corman had officially checked out as far as quality film making was concerned. It was all a great pity .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in the (then) distant future, this mindless '70s action trashbag follows a corny, take-no-prisoners cross country sports car race that's earned a passionate, dedicated global viewership. In this morally lax futuristic derby, deception is expected, quirky charms are celebrated and pedestrian roadkill is rewarded; the only rule being finish first no matter the cost. When Peter Fonda turned down this leading role, he dubbed it "too ridiculous for words," and I can't find it in me to muster a more accurate description of the plot. In Fonda's place as the arrogant, bloodthirsty racetrack legend is David Carradine (fresh off his lengthy tenure on Kung Fu), with a very young pre-Rocky Sylvester Stallone as his primary foil. Carradine is a fish out of water trying to play it straight, while Stallone embraces the cheese and comes off as the much better fit. Incredibly stupid fare with awful effects, a paper-thin plot and a sado-masochistic Halloween enthusiast's wardrobe, it's precisely what the artwork promises: a big, idiotic, head-shaking joyride.</fullReview>

The plot takes place in the near future where the government keeps it's citizens pacified by providing them a deadly sport similar to the one in THE RUNNING MAN. The difference is that this sport is a deathrace. Four or fives driver race their flamboyant death cars across the country killing everyone they can along the way. Each death scores the driver points. Some of the death scenes are pretty graphic for '75 and it's got all the great elements you could wish for in a exploitation movie: blood, Nazis, nudity, explosions, etc. The pace is fast and we even get to see Sly Stallone punch a chick in the face!

A cross between Fritz Leiber's X MARKS THE PEDWALK and Harlan Ellison's ALONG THE SCENIC ROUTE (also to be found under the title DOGFIGHT ON 101), DEATHRACE 2000 boasts not only some of the coolest cars you're ever likely to see, but some of the coolest characters, as well. David Carradine (most recently of THE KUNG FU KILLER and THE KUNG FU KILLER II) is in fine form here as the patchwork driver called "Frankenstein." His smooth demeanor is perfect for the part; he comes across as low key but deadly, in the car or out. I loved this one when I was a kid, and I look back fondly on it now. I was surprised to find that it still holds up. Maybe it was ahead of its time in more ways than one...</fullReview>

Even if it's called and considered a "B" movie by the establishment and others (consider who the establishment and others are) it brings out the existing idealism as seen by the author which is still purely visible to so many others......No it wasn't squashed or completely sensored, therefore you are safe.

		<fullReview>This was a great movie for the 70s. It was odd to watch a movie where they talked about "The World Crash of 95" or the best line "I lost my taste buds in the crash of 97." Back in 1974, when this movie was made, that seemed like such a long time away.This movie was Stallone's first real hard-core action movie. He looks like Rambo when Frankenstein is pushing Machine Gun Joe's face against the KNIFE on the front of the CAR. Yes, he made that funny shaped MOUTH expression. It was classic. Machine Gun Joe, at one point, gets out a TOMMY GUN, and blasts the AUDIENCE in the stands just for cheering for FRANKENSTEIN (who looks like a poor man's Darth Vadar). I also like that helmet covered in white fuzz. Or how about that SABOTAGE crew? Those people could not sabotage their way out of a plastic bag!! In one part, the sabotage crew got on the WRONG side of the road block! I mean, HELLO!!?? Jesus!!! There was a LOT of nudity in this classic movie. That was interesting. There was also a classic FIGHT SCENE between JOE and FRANKENSTEIN. You could tell that David Caradine was in FIGHTING SHAPE for his role as Chang in Kung Fu. You could also see some fighting similarities between ROCKY and MACHINE GUN JOE!!! I was not impressed when JOE punched his NAV IGATOR in the face for just talking to FRANKENSTEIN. That was NOT COOL. Before that, I was actually ROOTING for JOE. He won be back though when he said he would win the race "IN THE NAME OF HATE." Was it me? Or was the film sped up? I mean, heck...those cars went SUPER FAST and took corners perfectly. Also, I am from ALBUQUERQUE, and that scene was NOT in ABQ. Shame on you Mr. Director!!! SHAME ON YOU!! I caught you!!

		<shortDescription>ANTI-THESIS OF A SCI-FI ACTION FILM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I must say that I bought this movie by chance imaging that it would be something like 'Fast and Furious'. But I must say that I was shock. I am fond of all about the 70's pop culture, movies, music, etc. (despite that i'm 25 years old today) but nothing could prepared me for this. Is obvious that the producers didn't meant to spend a decent budget on a sci-fi movie and that the writers wanted to take some time off to their sense of logic. In a few words, this film is a clear excuse to take some money out of Uncle Sam's hands.The plot involves a killer-car race (because the contestants score points by running over people to death) which has now become the sport event of the year of a twisted and sick society that lost the last bit of common sense by awarding crime. Settled in the so far away and apocalyptic year 2000 (let me mention that this movie was made in the midd 70's) the people is ruled by Mr. President, a dictator a-la-Hitler who has control over what people should say and believe, but think about a Barney way of dictating 'My fellows I, Mr. President, am your friend, and so I only mean want good for you. Thus if is say that something should be this way, then IT MUST BE this way. Thank you I love you all!'Now this movie shouldn't be taking seriously in certain issues, such as technical resources, because it is not I mean there is a poor development of the story because sometimes things don't seem to fit where they are, they just were thrown there (but as i will be mentioning later there might be a hidden message in such excuse of a story), there is nothing such as special effects (It was the 70's and the budget was about $12000 so you do the match!) the acting was really bad, not so much thing for dialogue more than 'which route has the more oportunity for scoring points?' or 'Come on, show me love', the sets were home-made based from 'The Jetsons' and the action? sequences where too cartoonish (in fact one runner is taking out of the race by a group of Resistance who sets a tunnel entrance on the edge of a cliff! Just like freaking WB Coyote &amp; The Road Runner!)Despite all of this this movie has some points that favor it (if such thing is possible!) First well if you are a big fan of 'Rocky' you can see his hilarious attempts to kick Kung Fu's David Carradine out of the race. Sly's staging of 'Joe Machine Gun', nemesis of 'Frankenstein' (Carradine) is a troglodite ironic-laughable representation of a macho-action man, so silly that you are going to laugh to tears. I warn not his best time but, hey! he had to start somehow don't you think?Something else that's worth the comment is the script of the movie. Despite that it has such an empty plot (a Death Car Race, for crying out loud!) it states the limits that the paranoia of a politic lifestyle like the US can reach: the jailed of the Congress, a twisted and weird President who claims himself ruler of the US and the world with a near-God attitude, the standarization of the people's beliefs and toughts, blaming the FRENCH?! for 'terrorist' acts against the contestants (when in reality it was a resistance force of citizens who want to restore the goverment). So what will be worth asking is that is this poor excuse of script a way to point out the weakness and sillyness of the presidential works as well as the US international politics? Is the pointless development of the plot in fact a well-organized cover up to reach to the audience (no matter how few!) a critic of the american lifestyle and sending a wake-up call? Or is just a coincidentally set of pieces?If you like very dark comedy, or if you want to look for an answer for these quiestions, or if you only want to shut down your brain for a while and watch WHAT SHOULDN'T BE DONE when filming a sci-fi film you better watch this movie. Just remeber to look behind the senseless plot and development of the story, is really that senseless and far away from our actual political situation? coincidence or ugly truth...?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this when i was little and thinking it must have been among the coolest things ever. Watching it today though is a different experience completely...In a grim future the most popular sport is a cross-country race called "Death Race". It's held annually and aside from getting from point A to point B the drivers can receive points by killing bystanders and also they can use dirty tricks on each other to earn advantages.The two antagonists in this movie are well known actors today, i guess they were not huge when this movie was made considering the setting. Probably this must have been one of Sylvester Stallones first movies, but his style can easily be recognized. David Carradine on the other hand was already well versed in the movie industry when this came out. And he is very entertaining as the mysterious driver "Frankenstein" who was won the race several previous years (and who has an uncanny likeness to Darth Vader!).The movie itself is unbelievable crappy really. The cars looks like the cars children make out of boxes. The action basically consists of cars driving slow with the film running at double speed to make everything look fast and action-filled. Many things will have you laughing out loud and far from all of it is intentionally funny. And that is what makes this movie so enjoyable. It's crappy and it doesn't try to be anything other than a fun b-movie ride. It's honest and good fun. A classic! Rating 6/10 on the B-movie scale.</fullReview>

David Carridine plays Frankenstein, the film's "hero," and he's way to inert to fill the role. He's a slight actor with only marginal talent who got lucky on TV with KUNG-FU and was somehow deemed bankable enough to carry this film. Apparently that was true since the film made a ton of money for producer Roger Corman. Nonetheless, DEATH RACE 2000 works pretty well as a satire on America's need to see --- and be repulsed by --- violence. Luckily director Paul Bartel has a keen eye for the absurd and keeps the action to the level of the average Road Runner cartoon, complete with a scene featuring a fake tunnel entrance. Stallone is terrific as Carridine's chief rival and the great Mary Woronov is dynamite as Calamity Jane. Martin Kove is fun as the fey Nero, Corman stalwart Roberta Collins plays a sexy Nazi and future LOVE BOATer Fred Grandy is the nearly silent Herman the German.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does score points (if you'll excuse the pun) for originality, but in most other aspects it's nothing more than Grade-Z exploitation fare, and will appeal only to a very limited audience. It's too amateurishly done to succeed as an actioner and too obvious and overacted to convince as a satire. At least there are some amusing gore moments and a genuine sense of perversity.

		<shortDescription>"Loved by thousands &amp; hated by millions..." Very overrated 'cult' film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death Race 2000 is set in the 'future' year of 2000 (surprise, surprise!) &amp; starts at the New York Memorial Raceway where the 20th annual Trans Continental road race is about to get underway. The rules are simple, drive to New Los Angeles quicker than your competitors, have a stupid name &amp; pick up bonus points for mowing down innocent pedestrians. This years five competitor's line up at the start line, Machine Gun Joe Viterbo (Sylvester Stallone), Calamity Jane (Mary Woronov), Matilda the Hun (Roberta Collins), Nero the Hero (Martin Kove) &amp; the infamous Frankenstein (David Carradine) the current reigning champion. The races gets underway &amp; America is gripped as every inch is covered on TV, however a group of revolutionists are determined to sabotage the race in order to stop it...Directed Paul Bartel who also has a small cameo role as Frankenstein's doctor at the start I thought Death Race 2000 was OK but far from the cult classic many would have you believe. The script by Charles Griffith &amp; Robert Thom was based on a story by IB Melchior is quite fun in a silly sort of way but it's rather repetitive &amp; it tries to be too clever for it's own good. It has a stab at a little political satire &amp; pokes fun at media stereotypes as a lot of the film is played out like a sports event with annoying TV show hosts popping up every few minutes, a running commentary &amp; interviews with victims loved ones who win prizes. To be honest I didn't find any of it particularly effective &amp; scene after scene of stupid looking cars driving along empty stretches of Californian highway became very boring very quickly. With a title like Death Race 2000 the film has obviously dated badly, we are seven years past 2000 &amp; this films vision of the future has been proved to be totally wide of the mark so in that respect it failed, as an action film it fails &amp; as satire it fails. Having said that it moves along at a decent pace, at less than 80 minutes long it doesn't outstay it's welcome, there are one or two fun scenes &amp; it provides a certain amount of undemanding entertainment, just don't expect the solid gold classic many would have you believe Death Race 2000 is.Director Bartel doesn't do much to liven the film up, in fact this film has some of the most boring &amp; unimpressive car chases ever &amp; as I've already said scenes of awful looking cars driving along empty roads is just totally dull &amp; there's no other word I can think of to describe it. The cars themselves are supposed to be futuristic looking but in actuality they look terrible, they look like their bodies are made out of cardboard &amp; they were painted by 10 year old's. Death Race 2000 sure was low budget &amp; boy it show's. The action scenes are lame, there's some violence &amp; a bit of blood but not much although there's a fair amount of naked female breasts on show if that sort of thing interests you. This being a Roger Corman production I'd have thought Death Race 2000 was designed as a rip-off of another futuristic sports action film Rollerball (1975).With a supposed budget of about $300,000 I told you it was low budget, to be honest one can question why the makers set out to make such an ambitious film on such a meagre budget, the film looks pretty cheap &amp; doesn't have any sort of style. The one thing that makes Death Race 2000 stand out is that it was a very early staring role for Sylvester Stallone who would go on to mega stardom in Hollywood, he's pretty good in this &amp; well worth the $1,000 a week he was paid! Carradine is pretty good too.Death Race 2000 is an OK time waster, some of it is pretty fun although for the most part it's rather dull &amp; cheap looking. Average at best in my opinion. Followed by the sequel Death Race (2008).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously who on Earth thought this was a good film I mean really. No sets, barely any backgrounds, the weirdest sex scene I've ever seen and to top it all off... Silvester Stallone. *shakes head in disgust*. Not to mention the storyline, "It is the year 2000 and the world has become de-sensitised to violence and so to fuel the country's (The country made up of about 3 poorly paid extras) need for blood they hold the annual death race. It's just poor. At what really gets me is the fact that they try to give the whole film a moral, where by Silvester Stallone's character turns out to be the good guy and save the day by killing the president. Surely this is the worst plot twist ever written. Shame on all of you who voted over 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pre-Rocky film with Sylvester Stallone starring alongside David Carradine very much along the lines of 'Cannonball'. This film is dull, and Carradine plays an unconvincing antagonist dressed as the black panther. No talent is displayed here by Stallone which suggests that he was a better writer and director than an actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The year is 2000 (the folks back in 1975 weren't that good at predicting the future) and the most popular sport is the "Transcontinental Road Race" where several drivers compete to drive from one end of the country to another, and killing any pedestrians they can find in doing so. That is, driving over everyone in their sight. Woohoo. Sounds interesting? Its not. Poor effects and a poor soundtrack, the acting is horrible and Sylvester Stallone was better in Rambo 3! (I hope that says it all) I guess most of the budget went on paying David Carradine so he could play in it. Well anyway, I gave this a 3, and you should avoid it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it's good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a terrible movie that is also a guilty pleasure! And that is because although it's a cheesy movie, it never takes itself seriously and is just plain stupid fun! The film begins in the distant year 2000 where the national obsession is a sport known as "the Death Race". This race is a combination of fastest times along with the number of pedestrians killed by the drivers (the more the better). And, despite it being violent and gross, it feeds the public's need for sick entertainment. In fact, the public is so fascinated by the race that they put up with a sick dictatorial government just because it gives them the race (sort of like Ancient Rome and and Coliseum). A small but determined resistance movement (lead by Thomassina Paine) vows to disrupt the race and restore peace and freedom to the ambivalent masses, but they don't seem to have a prayer of success.The public just doesn't care. What they do care about it the driver named "Frankenstein" (David Carradine) because he is not only the best racer but he's been injured and put back together so many times he reportedly looks like a monster. However, given that he always wears a black leather skull cap mask and dressed from head to to in tight black leather (along with a cute cape), no one really know WHAT he looks like--they just know he's the best (sort of like the Dale Earnhart of the picture).The other racers are all silly broad parodies--ranging from Matilda the Hun (dressed like a German dominatrix) to Sylvester Stallone as an uncouth lout who loves to slap around women and threatens to kill Frankenstein. There are a couple other drivers, but they, too are pretty broad in their portrayals.Once the race begins it's obvious that the resistance is serious, as they start wiping out drivers--and intend in killing them all. In addition, the public love Frankenstein so much they offer him a lot of help to win. My favorite part is when the doctors and nurses at the old folks home wheel the oldsters out into the street to try to help Frankenstein with his body count. However, Frankenstein being a true hero and gentleman, drives OFF the road to avoid the easy kills and drives into the facility to kill off the staff! Now that's sportsmanship!! The movie goes on from there from one violent encounter after another and with some very broadly played vignettes in between. I could tell you more but don't want to spoil the suspense. The film is funny, gross and you'll be ashamed of yourself for watching it but you'll also find you can't stop! A brilliantly cheesy and cool ending ties it all together and makes this a dreadful but must-see film for ADULTS OR OLDER RESPONSIBLE TEENS ONLY!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Distasteful and very dated early Stallone flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits In the year 2000, hit and run driving has become the national sport, with championships, commentators, the works. The national champion is the feared Frankinstein (David Carradine). But he's got some competition on his hands in the shape of up-and-coming new contender 'Machine Gun' Joe Vittorio (Sylvester Stallone.) The tagline basically describes the plot of this early Stallone vehicle (forgive the pun...) The year 2000 has rolled by and hit and run driving has certainly not become a national sport, it's still a despicable, cold-hearted crime that destroys many peoples lives. Some might think I'm being too serious and not seeing the joke, but I think I am and relatives of victims of such crimes might certainly not. As an apocalyptic, parodying vision of the future, Death Race 2000 simply fails where future films such as Robocop and Blade Runner did not. It also (kind of inevitably) looks very cheap and dated by today's standards, possessing a very tatty feel to it (Carradine in particular is hilarious looking like a bloke trying to be Darth Vader on 39p.) It's short and you gotta admire some of the futuristic insight, but for the most part this just completely fails to get off the tracks. **</fullReview>
