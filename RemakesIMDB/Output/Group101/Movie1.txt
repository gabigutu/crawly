		<shortDescription>who needs a plot when there's explosion and mayhem?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2012 the economy has hit bottom, broke through and has kept on descending. Along the way prisons have been handed over to the private sector that have chosen to make a profit by broadcasting gladiatorial style death matches starring the inmates, with the reward to the inmates after 5 victories ? FREEDOM Enter Jensen Ames (Jason Stratham) a recently unemployed steel worker and former race car driver who lost his license but no matter how bad things are, he's a happy man as long as he has his family.That is, until he's set up for the murder of his wife, imprisoned, and forced to compete in Death Race if he ever hopes to see his daughter again.But enough of the plot! A paragraph blurb at the start and 8 minutes of character development is pushing the limits of this flick and that's not why a person would see a W.S. Anderson/Jason Stratham action flick and besides, a plot would allow "plot holes" and who needs to deal with that headache? The rest of the movie takes place in the 3 days of Death Race. The first 2 days are competition/elimination rounds reminiscent of Mario Kart as if it was designed by some rogue member of GTA on a disgruntled day but who loved the hidden short cuts and power-ups.Amongst all the adrenaline filled action, Anderson makes sure to toss in the occasional character development or when he's feeling really daring he'll toss in some pseudo-dramatic realization our hero comes across which helps remind the movie-goer that the movie has a plot rather than just a string of explosive action sequence. All of this is done with the utmost use of cliché and designed to inspire the excitable little 12 year old boy in many of us to stay riveted in our seats as we wait for Jensen to strike with angry revenge for all he's been through.The movie is everything a modern day movie aficionado should not like. It's brainless, sexist, ridiculously violent, and lacks any redeemable qualities. These are also all the reasons why I had so much fun with the movie. I went seeing what I expected and that's exactly what I wanted to see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Listen to the Critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always hate it when all those high class critics from the newspapers and journals bash a film for not being what THEY want it to be and not looking at it for what its SUPPOSED to be.The title is "Death Race" after all. No-one ever expected it to win any golden trophies in the first place. So what if the acting was a bit bland and the plot was a little weak. That's not was the movie is supposed th be about.It's not a Martin Scorsese film where you sit back and think "Oh, that is very thought-provoking and I feel that I've truly learned something inspirational today." No. This is a film where you sit back, look at it, and think "Holy ****!! Did you see that ********** explosion?!"This is a film where you have fun in. Don't worry if you walk away with nothing meaningful to talk about at the end. Go ahead and laugh at its stupidity. I guarantee you you'll still have a much better time that watching something like Capote</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I shouldn't write reviews for movies like this because it feels like I'm lining up to kick a puppy. A movie like 'Death Race' can only be judged fairly through a set of lowered genre expectations. I'll try but I'm not making any promises. It is fun, very loud and unabashedly dumb. It was never envisioned to be anything other than an attempt at 'cool.' The average viewer will - without fail - be able to pick out every moment where Paul W.S. Anderson had an idea during the script writing and thought to himself "That'd be awesome!" before looking around the room for someone to high five. I shouldn't pick on him because I actually do enjoy his movies. He isn't trying to make 'Casablanca'; 'Robocop' is more his style. Just without the boring stuff like characterization and development. And as little subtlety, satire or nuance as needed. Unless unintentional or totally by mistake and ironic -- That'd be alright.This movie's lone strength is the special effects and it lives and dies by the car chase, the machine gun firing and the gory death(s). Michael Bay, eat you heart out. Anderson knows the art of kaboom and action junkees should be satisfied with his efforts here -- especially during the second race when the 'Dreadnought' enters the race. As long as you numb your brain into not asking serious questions about things like physics. Or how massive amounts of armour on a car wouldn't make flesh and soft tissue any safer in horrifying car crashes. Or how the American economy of the Dystopian future has crumbled, but 70 million can still afford the pay-per-view price to watch. Maybe some of the viewers are from Canada.If you were to put any consideration into serious film criticism where 'Death Race' is concerned, then you'd be the first one. The movie is so predictable, lazy and unambitious that it asks you to hand it the popcorn. In fact, have you seen the trailer? You've seen the film. Tyrese's character is homosexual, which I thought was stunningly inventive given the scriptwriter. Sliding back into predictability, it is used solely to make a few tasteless jokes before being forgotten about. Pretty standard fare for Anderson. If you've watched his other films, you know exactly what to expect. Except less. Brain still hurts too much to think about it. I think the annoying thing is that Anderson has potential. I wouldn't keep going to his movies if I didn't enjoy them. It annoys me when the problems at script level are so apparent. He has a tendency to go to predictable places: Requisite gay jokes for the prison? Check. Incredibly hot women on screen? Cue horny Rap music since I need a musical cue to point out the obvious. I'm annoyed when one character asks another if they think that they're really the best choice of parent for their offspring and the second character says later "Someone once asked me if ..." like they and the audience have forgotten the specifics of the first conversation. The audience doesn't need to be spoon-fed the obvious. It's a weakness that I hope Anderson can shed. He clearly loves making movies. Trusting the audience a little more and giving us some credit might let him make better ones.The crazy thing is that despite it all, I enjoyed 'Death Race.' It is flawed from top to bottom but wears the flaws so honestly and endearingly that you really shouldn't hold it against the movie. Need to go see a mindless distraction for an hour and a half? 'Death Race' isn't a bad choice. With 'Death Race' you get exactly what you expect and exactly what you deserve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now here's an exploitation film that knows what a solid B-movie is supposed to be: an action-dense, amped-up, gore-soaked killfest. It's the cinematic equivalent of eating that entire box of Red Vines you bought at the snack bar, using them as candy straws to suck down your extra-large Coke.As a fan of the original "Death Race 2000," I was pleased to see just enough of a shadow of the original movie inhabiting the skin of the new one. Roger Corman's name on the producing credits gave me hope at the start, and his seal of approval seemed to mean something, perhaps as counterweight to Paul W. S. Anderson's track record of shooting mediocre video game adaptations. Surprisingly, Anderson rises to the occasion, effortlessly elevating a cliché-rich but fast-moving script to the level of a satisfyingly adrenalin-fueled confection aimed like a bullet at the A.D.D.-addled brains of the short-attention-span generation.Set in an "Escape From New York"-style dystopic prison-culture (that sounds suspiciously like current American society), slaughter happens, stuff blows up, and the weak are culled like bunnies caught in the headlights of gas-sucking American muscle cars. Fans of the "Twisted Metal" video game will love the newest wrinkle in the race, the addition of weaponry ? a needed bloody bump for version 2.0. And what a bump it is, with each car's chugging machine guns indiscriminately spewing hot rounds at every foe, shredding Detroit steel like it was used Kleenex. It's unabashed gun fetishism at its gleeful best, and it makes you want to strap an M60 to the hood of your Prius in order to cut your commute in half.Jason Statham does his standard tough-guy job as the scowling Frankenstein, Joan Allen plays a ball-busting warden (perhaps a bit in the mold of Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched), and Ian McShane of "Deadwood" has a solid cameo as the prison-wise mechanic, Coach. Even Machine Gun Joe gets a new incarnation in the form of Tyrese Gibson, who thankfully is nothing like Stallone's blustering Italian meatball.I loved it, and can't wait to see it again in a theater with enough bass to pump up those impact crunches to the bone-jarring level they deserve.Yeah!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad At All!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely better than the ridiculous "Righteous Kill", that we had the doubtful honor to view today also, at the same press screening, here in Bucharest, Romania."Death Race" is a honest to God action movie, without any bigger-than-life pretensions. The script follows correctly an old tested and tried recipe, everything is at its place, and although you can easily plot out the whole course since the beginning, somewhat even this sounds good - you simply have the guilty pleasure of savoring again a story that you know from dozens of other movies.The influences from the racing video games are explicit, and well mastered - me, I fully felt as while playing "Death Rally". Even certain aerial shots are obvious quotes from the computer game imagery. The narrative is nervous and thrilling, the effects professional, the violence degree precisely balanced. Maybe the main virtue of the movie is the cinematography, with admirable chromatic and plastic values. All in all, what it promises, it delivers: a cheap show, well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Now that's entertainment!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't looking for anything deep, I wasn't looking for anything serious, no Oscar winning actors, no award winning script, I just wanted an action movie, this summer we got Death Race, a movie where the script and characters are just never explored, but the action is non stop and so exciting. I don't know why, but we just need action movies like that and one of the things that I did enjoy about this was that it reminded me of those old grind house films that have quick editing and fast paced stories that are just awesome stories to watch because of the stunts. This is a different form of The Fast and The Furious, only just not with all the fancy gadgets which I like. Also, Jason Statham, this guy is just awesome in action movies, he makes such a great lead in any action role and is such an awesome tough guy that you don't want to mess with.Based off the 70's film "Death Race 2000", it's 2012, the economy is in bad shape, employment is down, but entertainment is up, especially in prison where racing has become the new gladiator fights. Jenson's wife is murdered and he is framed for it, landing him him in prison, where he is approached by the leader of the Death Race program, Hennessey, and she offers him to race for his freedom if he can make it out alive. But there's something a little deeper when it seems like he was put in prison on purpose so he could race.Death Race is just pure entertainment, it's nothing original, we don't really know the characters that well or what their motives are, but the reason why this movie is enjoyable is just the awesome action that is endless. I loved the editing, it made the race scenes that much more exciting. I would recommend this movie if you are looking for fun, like I said before we just need a pure action movie sometimes and Death Race is a perfect film on that level. I had a great time watching this movie and am looking forward to seeing it again for a good time.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twisted Metal meets Mad Max</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was able to attend the advanced screening here in Dallas and must say I enjoyed myself immensely. While anyone going into this film expecting anything more then a thin veil of a plot will be sorely disappointed, it will definitely entertain those who have the right expectations. That said, this is a no holds barred, testosterone fueled thrill ride. Think of the game Twisted Metal, then throw in convicts, a greedy warden looking only at the profit and you have Death Race. While the movie has plenty of explosions, machine guns, armored cars, gore and beautiful females, there was enough humor and sentiment thrown in to make it all seem worthwhile. Definitely an entertaining film, and one that any over-the-top action movie junkie will surely add to their collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film last night at a premier in Portland Oregon.Im not gonna give away any of the story because there isn't much of one which is fine in this case. Explolsions and murder and hot women plus Jason statham equals good movie. I went into this film expecting it to be disaster,and i say this only because I'm anonymous... it was good. Plenty of wow moments to cringe at and not just me but the whole audience. The driving does get a little repetitive but kudos to the director Paul w.s. Anderson for mixing it up. Plus it is a revenge story which everyone loves. BOTTOM LINE if you want to be entertained and don't mind a some violence see it it is worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Death Race with really no idea what to expect from it. I am a big fan of Jason Statham movies but the concept of this movie hadn't really made me too excited to see it. Nevertheless this is a great movie, the humor is spot on throughout the movie, though this is definitely no comedy. The action is fast paced throughout and they come up with some pretty creative ways for characters to get killed. I found the story to obviously be a bit far fetched with it being people racing in a prison and all but never that didn't ruin the movie at all and I ended up loving the storyline. Overall, the acting was great, and it had great effects and a good storyline. I consider this a must watch for those who love action movies. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The death race!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many comic books, games and original movies are being remade, director Paul W.S. Anderson is not new to those remakes. He adapted Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat and AVP. Now he remakes the original movie Death race 2000. Not surprising. While watching this movie, I realised that he still has his habit of making games plots. Death race plot is quite similar to those racing or survival games plot. It reminds me of DOA (Dead Or Alive) which Paul produce. The story: Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is framed for murdering his wife. He is then sent to jail. Hennessey (Joan Allen) picks him to join the brutal surviving game. He has to kill the other inmates who join the game. The prize is to get his freedom. Every inmate will get his own partner. The partners are mostly some hot chicks. From there, exciting vehicles chases scenes and blood ooze out. There isn't much gore but there are blood and language. The plot is so simple but the idea and the chase scenes make my heart pound. It is like watching a survival game unfolding by itself.It just explode the screen and your time and nothing else. And you won't care about the plot, you will just care about the thrilling game. Overall: Those expecting a move to kill time, this is one. Those who want to watch another "The Dark Knight" movie, this is not the movie. It is not bad for mindless action flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Death Race" a lot of death, some racing, and a lot of fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Death Race" puts me in a moral dilemma. Its deliberately trashy, shallow and inept, and for some reason I still like it. Making my feelings even more conflicted is the fact that it was directed by Paul W.S Anderson, a director who tries to turn movies into video games, and always fails. But as they say in Hollywood "you're only as good as your last picture" so Anderson is as good as anyone right now.Not too far into the future our economy has collapsed (maybe McCain won), poverty reigns supreme and crime has become unstoppable. The prisons are filled beyond capacity, and Americas number one form of entertainment is watching the inmates fight to the death. The fights to the death got old and America needed something new. Death Race was invented. The concept is the same as death fighting, only you slug it out in an armor plated car with machine guns. The last man alive wins, and if you win enough races, you win your freedom.Enter Jensen Ames, a former Nascar driver prior to his prison conviction, who loses his job when the local steel mill is closed. He goes home to his wife and infant daughter, only to have a masked man break in and kill his wife. Ames is framed for the crime and sent to prison.Ames is sent to prison, where the warden Hennessey, played with excellent restraint by Joan Allen, informs him that he must replace Frankenstein, the most popular death racer, if he is ever to leave the prison. Ames agrees, and the games begin.As a satire "Death Race" completely miss fires. The opening prologue informs us of the downfall of American society, and its never brought up again. Were informed that Death Race has become more popular then the Super Bowl with more then seventy million viewers but we never see one of those people watching. For some reason the drivers are paired with sexy women to navigate, even though they have a pit crew to do that. The women are in it for ratings, to make a statement about our own for sex as well as violence, but the viewers cant see the women inside the cars, so how do they help ratings? Just a few examples of the missed satire.But this isn't an Oliver Stone movie. When you buy a ticket to see "Death Race", you want to see some death and some racing. And you get both, but mostly death. The racing scenes are electrifying. The combination of great stunt work, special effects and art direction give this films action the boost of adrenaline it craves. Andersons vision is to immerse us in a "Twisted Metal" video game, and he pulls it off with magnificent results. He captures the sadistic mentality of "Twisted Metal" perfectly. One driver turns his car around just to shoot another driver."You cant drive backwards" his partner remarks?I beg to differ. That scene will remind "Grand Theft Auto" fans of many rampages.Anderson keeps his eyes on the finish line and "Death Race" moves towards its conclusion in a heart beat. Despite my immersion in the story, it was way too predictable. The framed for murder set up is too obvious, and before you can even figure it out for yourself they give it away. And as for the ending, only a few things can happen at the end a prison movie, and you know what they are. But despite the twists you can see coming a mile away, they're still satisfying. "Death Race" is one of the few examples where a bad script can become a good movie.The acting is wonderful all around. Jason Statham is a read deal action super star. He's got the physique of Van Damme and a million times the acting ability. His character's quest to see his daughter gives the film its only sliver of humanity, and all a prison movie needs is a sliver.Joan Allen as the warden plays her character so tightly she could probably crack a cashew with her but cheeks. Hennessey is so tightly wound I often wondered is she was going to implode. And towards the end she gets a chance to deliver some perfectly timed profanity. Maybe the last four letter words you;; ever hear out of her mouth.Newcomer Natalie Martinez has infinite sex appeal as Case, the sexy vixen who rides in the passenger seat beside Ames. But more then a pretty face she gets a chance to act, and proves shell be around for years to come. Ian McShane is perfect as the simply named Coach. His job is to coach. His weathered face and gravelly voice perfectly fit's the prototype of a man who's spent a long time in prison. But he was good in a stinker like "Hot Rod", so its no surprise here.Director Paul W.S Anderson has always attempted to make his films into video games, and "Death Race" really does play like a video game. That's the films intention and it works. It satisfies the blood lust lurking deep within us all. Society hasn't gotten to the point where we watch snuff films but watching fictional people kill each other is still loads of fun, and so is "Death Race".? stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ebert Is Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big fan of Roger Ebert one thing I have quickly noticed about his reviews is that the worst insult he can give to a movie is " that it resembles a video game " . Click on the external reviews on the left and look up Ebert's review and you'll find in one short paragraph of his that it's impossible to add anything because he has all the angles covered Still I may as well contribute something to this page . At least one thing the producers of this remake have got right is if you don't like the opening sequence then at least they're putting their cards on the table letting the audience know where the movie is going . If you get invited round to a friend's house for them to show you their new racing game on their play station and you're not very entertained merely watching a game then you probably be too thrilled by watching this remake of DEATH RACE 2000 One can't help thinking that after casting Statham and McShane perhaps the producers should have just made their own film instead of doing a remake of a film that far from being a masterpiece was at least very entertaining . The first third of the movie is by far the best part . Blue collar worker Jensen Ames receives his pay packet at the end of the month and goes home to his wife and before he knows it he's in a rough tough prison where inmates are beaten up for infractions such as swearing or because the guards feel like it . Looking on the bright side inmates are still allowed to smoke so it's not all bad . Good news too if you're a lesbian in a female prison because the inmates make Angelina Jolie look like Freddy Kruger Since the film then needs to justify it being a remake featuring car chases and a large body count logic gets thrown out of the window . It's only the roughest toughest meanest mother crushers who get to take part in these gladiatorial racing games . Anyone doing time for minor crimes such tax evasion is not considered so it's okay for Ames to go on a race killing members of the Aryan brotherhood and other assorted violent criminals because Ames is really a good guy . It's never revealed why the state would think it's a good idea why all these psychos get armoured cars complete with 30mm cannon to race about in but one never questions the internal logic of a video game</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jason Statham plays one type of character, but he almost always plays it to perfection: the suave, stubbly, and sometimes smarmy would-be Bond from madcap B movies like "Crank" and "Ghosts of Mars." Casting him as the lead in any film brings certain expectations?basically, that our muscled mofo will deliver a smackdown to the badguys while delivering some catchy one-liners.Paul W.S. Anderson is a director who makes one type of movie (granted, his "Mortal Kombat" is my only point of reference): the uber-rotten video game warm-over shot like something even more ADHD than a music video. His masturbatory editing makes the works of Michael Bay look patient and subtle by comparison.So, after a year of being perpetually disappointed in Hollywood blockbusters and franchise revivals (oh, Indy, how could you?), "Death Race" has given me something worthy of hate, and deserving of the dishonor of being the worst film of 2008. When Statham is stripped of his predictable (yet consistent) charisma, someone has messed up something awful.Inspired by the cult classic "Death Race 2000," this is a prime example of a remake done wrong, where ear-splitting sound and migraine-inducing camera moves make one feel trapped inside a two-hour earthquake. The action doesn't thrill, and the characters are developed through egregious one-liners and cliché events. In 2012, the economy has collapsed, and an American public (the upper-class only, I guess) eager to let off some steam finds their opiate in "Death Race," a pay-per-view event where prisoners condemned to die on Terminal Island vie for the ultimate prize: freedom. It's an old premise, but one that has been retooled to entertaining effect in other films.Even lousier than the dialog and Anderson's attention-deficit technique is the characters, who are not only a catalog of bland stereotypes (Family Man framed for a crime he didn't commit; Stuttering Nerd; Hardened Old Sage; and the token Hip-Hop Styled Badass), but utterly fail to convince us for a second that they're hardened killing machines deserving of their sentence. As a result, the bloodshed that ensues is pedestrian and ineffectual (and even worse when played for ironic effect); while the outcome of "Death Race" is as predictable as you would expect, the total lack of B-movie charm (and fun) is simply unforgivable.Stranded in this murk is Joan Allen, who, as the black-hearted warden Hennessy, seems to be channeling an androgynous cross between Louise Fletcher and Keanu Reeves, but is relegated to standing around watching monitors while delivering Anderson's subpar dialog. What should come across as icy, methodical menace (with maybe a bit of tongue-in-cheek irony) is instead sleepwalking boredom, proving that great actors cannot always salvage terrible scripts. When even the head villain is a cliché devoid of personality (to the point where her eventual fate elicits total indifference), you know you have messed up something awful.For all its efforts to pummel on a miserably superficial level, "Death Race" left me feeling nothing?not empathy for the characters, not excitement at the alleged "action" (which is cut so rapidly it's next to impossible to tell what's happening, and where), just a void left unfilled by anything resembling experience. It's a waste of time and talent, plain and simple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Car Crash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason 'one-dimensional' Statham appears in another film of brainless action and mind-numbing car races. The script is cheap recycled material, which exploits the unimaginative crash-bang-wallop of the film.The films key audience is the young-gamer, gizmo's generation. The film is created as a fast-paced action computer game hoping lots of crashes, burning cars and weaponry will entice. For the majority Death Race is way too brash, ugly and destructive to appeal, indeed the car scenes are messily edited and repeated.If the stereotypical and annoying characters are not enough to halt proceedings the endless one-liners should do the trick. This is where I can give Statham credit, he does have the ability to churn out cheesy and ill-opportune 'one-liners' with an ounce of believability and authority, which his co-cast cannot do.Death Race is unashamedly one-dimensional and the idea that placing a few guns on tops of cars will appeal and make this an engaging film is hard to fathom. However, nowadays if you want to make money throw in some cars, guns, girls and booming hip-hop and you seem to generate an odd following.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Statham as assertive and charismatic convict in a televised death race</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The picture is set in the near future (2012), there the ultimate sporting is the Death Race where contestants get score points for running drivers down and sacrificing themselves. It's a futurist international sport , a violent and bloody car race where the drivers score points for hitting other vehicles. Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is the hero behind the wheel, posing as Frankestein, and his nemesis the various killers drivers. He's a good guy wrongly accused of killing and locked on Terminal island. Jensen is coerced by warden Hennessey(Joan Allen) to enter Death Race , a gladiator-like televised fight-to death. A race against dangerous prisoner-drivers, as Machine Gun Mason (Tyrese Gibson), Pachenko (Max Ryan), Gunner (Jacob Vargas) and several others (Robin Shou, Robert LaSardo). Jensen is helped by coach (Ian McShane) and accompanied by a gorgeous eye-popping youngster (a sexy girl Natalie Martinez).This exciting movie is full of noisy action, moving scenes , thrills, chills and lots of violence. Spectacular race cars with skillful stunts and barely computer generator effects. From the beginning to the end the unstopped action and the emotions are interminable. Stirring and lively musical score by Paul Haslinger along with a colorful cinematography by Scott Kevan . The motion picture is professionally directed , produced and written by Paul W. S. Anderson ,a noted producer and director of super-productions ( Resident Evil saga, Alien Vs Predator, Soldier, Event Horizont, Mortal combat). It's based on the classic B movie (1975) with the same title directed by Paul Bartel with David Carradine, Simone Griffeth and Sylvester Stallone , a cult favorite that here is correctly adapted adding much more action and violence. Nowadays Paul W. S. Anderson is preparing its following with similar technician and artist equipment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite All The Prison Clichés, It Was An Entertaining Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless of the politically-correct finish to this film and the predictable prison stereotypes, this was a fun film to watch simply because it entertained. It was a good diversion, filled with total nonsense mayhem and testosterone-gone-wild. In other words, this was a typical Jason Statham film. No matter how many of these ultra-macho men he plays, he gets away with it with charm and likability.In this story, Statham as "Jensen Ames" is like David battling Goliath but with no slingshot and Goliath having a flame thrower and AK-47, too. Yet, you just know "David" will a find to defy all odds! Here are some movie clichés of today. See if they sound familiar.Not only has our hero suffer with his beautiful and loving wife murdered, but he's framed for the kill. Sent a brutal prison, he finds the female warden is responsible, and the killer of his wife also is in the jail. Too add salt to the wounds, that guy taunts "Jensen." Filmmakers haven't made a nice-guy warden since the 1950. Here, the sadistic boss is a woman: "Hennessey," played by Joan Allen, who I thought had some class before I saw this film. Spewing the f-word, "coc-sucker" and a few other choice words, sort of ruined that image I had of her.Anyway, the mean old warden got our hero in prison there so he can be the new "Frankenstein" race driver. The races at her prison, it turns out, are filmed live and are big internet moneymakers for her. "Frankenstein" is the favorite driver of the computer-audience but he's too injured to go on, so "Hennessey" recruits Mr. Ames, whom she knows is a great driver.Mostly there are nothing but bad folks in here and a lot of ultra-violent scenes, one-after-the-other. You also have other cliché prison characters, the kind you see in all prison films since "The Longest Yard." Beware of jiggling hand-held camera scenes, if that kind of thing gives you a headache.Having said all that, I admit the film is interesting start-to-finish, the racing scenes terrific, the film effectively manipulative, and overall qualifies as a decent means of entertainment. Statham is the new Steve Seagal, Jean-Claude VanDamme, etc - but that's okay; some of their movies were fun to watch, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought I was seeing an action movie . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you know you're going to see another pointless action movie, and you know it will have little to no redeeming value minus the action, and it STILL sucks, the problem has to be the action.From start to finish, the movie was bland and boring. I wanted to leave after the first 5 minutes as it was, and after that it was like sitting through one of those bad documentaries at school for the other 2 hours. The action was predictable and just downright boring, generic, and pathetic. Add to that the utterly ridicules dialogue scenes that told you things you already know from the credits mixed with clichés from every single action movie ever freaking made, and it felt like I was watching a made-for-TV drama, not an action movie. You've seen this movie before. Hundreds of times.The acting, as well, was horrid. The chick they got to play the cliché "bad prison woman" reminded me of Martha Stewart . . . dumbed down and made even more cliché than the real woman. At one point when a "bad man" character came on screen I had to say:"Look, it's Mr. Evil!" as he cackled with his huge nose casting a cliché shadow. Everything that could have been menacing in this film was laughable.There is no more blood in this movie than PG-13 fares like Cloverfield, and it wasn't as violent as the PG-13 The Dark Knight. Every scene was a cut-off scene without anything graphic happening, and at some points even the fist fights were cut-off scenes. I cannot think of any movie with "violence" as utterly pathetic as this one. It barely earned its R-rating through a minimal amount of blood, and the rest was PG all the way.I do not know why anyone would find anything in this entertaining. There was maybe a couple action scenes, and the rest was your mother's cliché TV drama. Am I the only one who wishes action movies were, you know, action-packed anymore?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The title "Death Race" tells it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis - In 2012, the United States economy collapses and life for everyone is not the same. Once a NASCAR champion, Jensen Ames, (Jason Statham), hits rock bottom and spent several years in prison. His life was improving and changing for the better after meeting and marrying Suzy (Janaya Stephens) and having a baby girl. Then the steel mill closes, and he loses his job. But that was not the worst thing to happen to Jenson that day. Suzy is brutally murdered, and he is framed for her murder. Jenson is sent to Terminal Island, the worst and toughest for-profit prison in the country run by Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen). She has created the country's most popular pay-per-view sport, a kill-or-be-killed car race where the inmates race to win their freedom from prison after 5 wins. Every inmate driver is driving a monster car that they built which is loaded with machine guns, missiles, flamethrowers, napalm, and no rules. Warden Hennessey convinces Jensen to secretly take the place of the late 4-time superstar winner, Frankenstein, and wear his metallic mask in the race. If Jensen wins just one race, he can go home to his baby daughter. To get to the finish line, Jensen must kill his competition before they kill him.My Comment - This is kind of a remake inspired by the 1975 movie, "Death Race 2000," in name only. This movie stands on its own. The title "Death Race" tells it all. If you want to see an action pack race where all the drivers go through a gauntlet of death, then this movie is for you. There are some scenes that take the race to the max. If you ever had road rage, I am sure you would love to be driving one of these cars. You can see why the for-profit prison puts on these races, because I calculated that they would make a tremendous profit of $12.5 billion for 3 pay-per-view races. Jason Statham played his usually part as the tough kick-ass Jensen Ames very well. I know everybody will like the ending. (Universal Pictures, 1:39 minutes, Rated R)(8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blend of "Mario Kart" and "Twisted Metal" and it's a solid fun thrill ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If "Mario Kart" was a movie and it had characters similar to the video game "Twisted Metal" this movie would be it. I really don't see why critics bash this movie so much, yes it isn't a Oscar worthy movie nor is it a very intelligent movie. But it sure is entertaining and was so stupid to the point it got irritating. People that decide to see this movie should know what they are getting into or else they might dislike it. Overall when I saw this movie in theater I really enjoyed it and had a blast with it, sure some of the plot holes are obvious but this is still a solid thrill ride. Personally I had a blast with this movie and Jason Statham was good in this role since he fit in with his tough guy exterior and I bought it. There is good amount of sex appeal and Ian McShane is just right as well while playing the character named Coach. This is a thrill ride that is like watching a actually entertaining video game movie. However if the script was a bit more intelligent it would have been better though although I didn't expect a solid script from Paul W.S. Anderson.7.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no one I would rather see in an action movie than Jason Statham. Put him behind the wheel of a car and you have a formula for thrills and excitement that cannot be beat, even if it is on a track that resembles the boring NASCAR.Statham is his usual cool and tough self in this film which really doesn't have a lot to offer outside the race itself. Pairing him with Natalie Martinez just makes me want to know when her next movie is going to be made. She was so hot.There were other great performances from Joan Allen, Ian McShane, and Tyrese Gibson.There was also a very satisfying ending - but you knew that was coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jensen Ames (Statham) is set up for killing his wife and goes to prison. The year is 2012 and the USA has collapsed and the Prison Death Races are the biggest thing on TV.I was sure I wasn't going to last long with this as it looked like it was going to be another video game movie and was all set to change over to Judge Judy. I was wrong. This is a good story, with good acting, dialogue, and cinematography. However, the real winners are the actual stunts performed on the race track. No CGI. Hard to believe, but no CGI that I could tell and at the end of the movie there is a statement that professional drivers did everything under controlled conditions. And, all I can say is WOW! OK, maybe there was a little CGI in here??.or not.Now, you have to understand, this is a race where there are few rules. Some of the things allowed are machine guns, rockets, smoke, oil, and spiked balls of iron to flatten tires. The winner is the one who is alive at the end. If any contestant wins 5-races he gains his freedom. Wanna play?I will say that Ian McShane is such a presence that he needs to be in more movies.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes</fullReview>

From the films opener to it's drooling and exceptional ending, Death Race is a man's movie. Jason Stathem, Ian Mcshay and Joan Allen also make this action movie worth watching. Watch for the humour, and believe me there is some, the fast paced story line that develops very quickly but without being rushed and of coarse the thrilling and viscerally brutal action.Jason Ames(Statham) who is wrongly accused for the murder of his wife is forced upon to take part in a deadly race that takes place over three days on a remote island.

		<fullReview>This single line from the film is the perfect analogy for this review. This is an adaptation of the Paul Bartel directed, Roger Corman produced, 1975 schlock, exploitation trash classic. Way back when B grade was actually entertaining. With a cast like David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone how could it not be? Yes this was simple formula stuff (oatmeal) and it worked. So how do you @#$&amp; it up? Paul W.S. Anderson.This man couldn't whip cream with an outboard motor. Abysmal dialogue that telegraphs any possible spoiler to come, wooden acting, clichés galore and a soundtrack that sounds like a 12 year old's mix tape. The camera moves so much you can't even see what is happening. What's the point of action sequences if you can't even see them properly? Just stop shaking the camera, and editing shot after shot into microseconds. For the love of god, just stop.Yet somehow two thirds of the way through it retains a Z grade charm. It's silly, implausible stuff, but engaging. Of course it runs out of steam completely in the third act and you forget you were actually enjoying it at all. The end is flat and schmaltzy and completely out of character to the rest of the film. The whole thing is pointless, so turn off your brain and enjoy what you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You sure are lucky a driver like me just happened to turn up in your prison when I did" For Joan Allan's psycho bitch prison manager maybe but for the audience, I highly doubt that. So, this is yet another film trying to become a cult classic through the basis that it was pitched as a Grindhouse picture, its exploitation and therefore they apparently have an excuse for making a bad film on purpose. Let me start off by saying I loved last year's 'Grindhouse' flick, both 'Death Proof' and 'Planet Terror' but here, I just couldn't enjoy this movie. The characters are undeveloped, the dialogue some of the worst I've seen since god knows when. It's a terrible movie, but it won't fall into that pile 'So bad its good'.This is mainly because you can't make a bad film on purpose. Cult classics aren't made from the ground upward, there the corpses of films made to be serious film and that have failed. Even the action jolts, its shot so scattered most of the time you can't tell what's going on. Not that you'd really care.The Transporter star Jason Statham takes the wheel in director Paul W.S. Anderson's remake of the Roger Corman classic about a hyper-violent cross-country race that breaks all of the traditional rules of the road.The time is the not-so-distant future, and as America's prisons begin overflowing with violent criminals, the powers that be devise a grisly game that will free up space in the cells and entertain the masses at the same time. Jensen Ames (Statham) is a three-time speedway champion with a dark past. A survival expert and ex-con whose sordid history comes back to haunt him when he is framed for a murder he didn't commit, Ames is forced to choose between donning the metallic mask of a mythical racer known as Frankenstein or languishing away on Terminal Island -- America's most notorious penitentiary.There's no smooth transition with this film, much like 'Step Brothers' it beats you repetitively across the head with just how loud and incoherent its being. Though in its defence there are some engaging race sequences. But there's the ones where the explosives and guns are excluded which to be honest is about 1% of the movie. Paul W.S. Anderson isn't quite Uwe Boll, he's close. And this garbage certainly hasn't helped his chances from redemption but we expect More from him. I enjoyed 'Event Horizon' upon release but with the 'Resident Evil' garbage and 'Alien Vs Predator' two of my least favourite films of all time, its easy to see why the film tanked. It's because its shot with no flair. The colours are drab and unexciting. Think 'Speed Racer' without the entertainment value. Its audience mainly consists of young teenage boys. Its go cars, girls and explosives. Anybody looking for some style and substance should look elsewhere.Verdict: Its 90 minutes of sense-less violence depicted in such an unlikable manner that it borderlines on offensive. There's little to no substance and the character are so undercooked that you won't care when the directors decides to off them. Death Race, isn't a winner.</fullReview>

If ever I've seen a film which is a video game wannabe in disguise then Deathrace is it.Without any worthwhile plot or 3 dimensional characters the car races and explosions very quickly become boring to watch.Since my girlfriend doesn't speak English fluently and has to read the Thai subtitles she often enjoys American action movies because they are so easy to follow. She said she found Deathrace to be pointless and dull, that about sums up where this flick stands in the great scheme of things.Good graphics alone don't make a good video game, and good stunts alone don't make a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer seemed to suggest that this is another take on the Running Man theme. Actually, the original Death Race came out before the RM novel, but I did not see it, so I do not know how close the 2008 version is to the one from 1975. However, I do know that the main plot of the 2008 version is essentially identical to that of RM---a guy wrongfully imprisoned and exploited for his skills in some gladiator contest, this time with tank-like cars. The RM featured some over-the-top characters and action that was clearly tongue-in-cheek, and was essentially a media satire with an action theme. I interpreted Joan Allen's involvement as an indication that perhaps this would be an update of that idea.Turns out, I was wrong. This is not "Running Man with cars", it's Running Man with cars, no brains, no humor, in the form of a video game (including ridiculously video-gamish sensor pads that cars have to drive over to get "weapons" and "shields"). Gone are any of the elements that could endear RM to a post-adolescent person, or anyone who can read and write: the media satire, the humor, the (mild) political angle. What is left is a lame-brained video game turned into a movie---I can almost see half of the audience manipulate imaginary game controllers in the cinema...In an online Q&amp;A on mtv.com, the director has to face complaints about the lack of random killing of pedestrians, and does so by mounting a feeble defense around the observation that at least one person who left his car and was subsequently killed should count as a pedestrian, and that in his movie they went much further with the use of vehicle-mounted firearms. I suppose that kind of debate between the audience of a movie and its director is a fairly clear indication of just what to expect and not to expect from it.Another complaint in the same Q&amp;A is that the trailer gives away the "entire plot" of the movie, in response to which Anderson reveals that he has seen the movie, and that it's not so. Well, I have seen it, and it is. The plot, of course, is paper-thin, and the fact that it can actually be revealed in its entirety in the trailer really says all you need to know about it. Plot is not what you should expect from this movie.But then what should you expect? It's not really funny (the funniest moment to me was when one of the characters discovers the essential uselessness of the co-pilots his creators have written into the script, and consequently throws out his co-pilot), it is not really sexy (all we get to see is a little bit Ms Martinez' cleavage---c'mon, if it's already R-rated, and considering the audience of adolescent boys on sugary caffeinated drinks, one could at least have thrown in some solid nudity, but no such luck), it's not funny, and the acting is non-existent (I can only hope for Ms Allen that this is the low-point of her career, and that things will be looking up from now on). It's really a ham-fistedly strung together collection of video-game sequences. If you own a game console, you could just put GTA or something like that in demo mode, and watch that instead. Saves you the annoying dialog and embarrassing attempts at plot as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These muscle car action films are beginning to become indistinguishable from the video games they either inspire or rip off: the same pounding music, the same roaring engines and squealing tyres, the same nubile eye candy in skimpy top and skintight jeans. The only difference is that in the film it's the likes of Jason Statham who has all the fun while the rest of us are slumped on the sofa with a glazed look in our eyes and crumbs of popcorn stuck to our tee-shirt. Then again, maybe that isn't such a difference...To be fair to Death Race it's never trying to be anything other than mindless entertainment squarely aimed at a recognised target market. This market isn't interested in characterisation - all it desires is the trigger for some visceral emotion (in this case - as in so many - Statham's thirst for revenge when he is framed for the murder of his wife) which will enable it to identify with the hero, and enough speeding cars, crashes, explosions, etc to give them that vicarious thrill that keeps them reaching for their games consoles.The film's one redeeming feature is the fact that it largely eschews CGI effects for the real thing, so that mostly what you're seeing isn't some technical art graduate's handiwork but some madman strapped into a hollowed-out, souped-up racing machine driving at insane speeds towards often immovable objects. It's all good fun, even though a small part of you feels guilty for enjoying it.The story has holes large enough to drive a dreadnought through, but again you get the impression that the filmmakers know that but don't care - they just want to have a blast and put what they consider to be very cool images on the screen. Sometimes they succeed, sometimes they don't. Either way, the movie would have benefited from less rapid-fire editing (no shot lasts longer than 3 or 4 seconds), and less use of the shaky-zoomy cam directors are so fond of these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a future time and prisons are now run by private companies for profit because the economy went to hell. Hmmmmm. --And this future time is not far from now either.This is a better than average action-entertainment or "popcorn movie". The concept is one we've seen a couple times of late about the ruthless greedy villain who manipulates a bunch of people into participating in some dangerous game or sport for internet viewing and profit. In this instance, a man is framed for the murder of his wife so that he will go to prison and participate in a "death race".This movie is one of the best of it's kind: action-entertainment. And to be fair folks, should be judged by that standard. The acting and the action is very good. It seems more like a guy-flick to me, maybe not. There is a good looking latina in it who plays our hero's driving partner. Her acting abilities surprised me because at first glance she seemed like she was just going to be "eye candy". She also got behind the wheel and was impressive. I'm thinking that all she needs is a little martial arts training and for someone in Hollywood to give her a chance and she could be a really good kick-ass heroine. (Who doesn't like women in snug outfits beating people up?) The ending also surprised me because it was--shall we say, "impersonal". I don't want to go into what that means and spoil it for you. Suffice to say that movies usually don't end that way. At first I was a bit disappointed, but then I said "why not?" --Do things a little different for a change. Anyway, put this one at the top of your "to see" and DVD list. No one is pretending and intending that it's art (in the "snooty" sense), it's just pure entertainment. Love, Boloxxxi.</fullReview>

When it said rated R for strange violence and language, I was anticipating really heavy blood and violence like when I saw the new "Rambo," which I didn't expect to be like what it was...Jason Statham plays Jensen Ames, an ex-NASCAR driver who finds himself framed for murdering his wife in 2012 United States. He's sent to prison, but not just any prison. It's the jail used for "Death Race," a popular race where convicts race for their freedom -- and kill or be killed. The warden is this cool, cold, sadistic in a smooth way woman who wants our poor guy to race as "Frankenstein," a popular convict who won four out of the five wins needed to get free. But will Ames be able to win? This is a pretty good movie to be honest. I'm not a huge fan when it comes to gore. Yes, it has gore people. How else will convict play on the track? If you like Jason Statham and 89 min action, then see this movie. highly recommend it.A total of 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, Race cars. Gotta love 'em. I'm not a huge fan of NASCAR myself, but hey, whenever I'm over at my Grandpa's house sometimes, I'll sit and watch. It's fun, and it sure is better than being bored when your laptop can't get any internet (which is true, though I'll use their desktop sometimes). Watching those shiny little cars race down the racetrack at full speed sure is exciting, and is an edge-of-the-seat pastime activity, because it sure gets your adrenaline going.And it's also nice to see every single tiny space of the seating capacity packed 'till there's no seats for more people is nice, because it's interesting to see how many people would have spent hard earned cash to see this big event. I've never been to a racing course myself, but I sure as hell hope that next summer I can go to the Edmonton Indy. Sure as hell looks fun. I'll see if I can check it out!But now that I got my NASCAR crap out of my system, racing cars can be fun. But has anyone ever thought of racing cars... while in prison??? With extra guns and shields added to your car, so you can kill any son of a bitch that gets in your way? Well, if anyone has ever wanted to see that, come one come all to DEATH RACE- the new film from Paul W.S. Anderson. That sounds dumb, doesn't it? Well guess what- IT AIN'T DUMB TO ME!!!!!! Having wanted to see it since the trailer showed with Wanted, I was excited when I walked into the theater to see it because it looked fun and cool. I think Jason Statham is a great actor. He has given us performances in some of my favorite movies like Crank, The Transporter Movies, and Ghosts of mars.*WARNING: The following may contain spoilers* Jason Statham (Crank, War, Ghosts of Mars) stars as Jensen, a hard-working construction worker whose company has been shut down for good. When the SWAT team arrive and start forcing people to get out, Jensen comes home to his beautiful wife and baby, and his wife is just making dinner when the baby starts to cry. Jensen goes upstairs to calm the baby down. While this happens, Jensen's wife turns around and sees an assassin behind her. Oh noes! This doesn't sound good! When Jensen comes down the stairs, he finds that his wife has been murdered (and I tell you, it ain't a pretty sight). The assassin is still in the house, to make things even worse, if that's possible. Jensen is knocked out and the police mistake him for the killer, and is sent to prison on charges of murdering his wife. It's sad, isn't it?Prison ain't such a fun place. Especially when getting your food spat in. That is made true when he gets into a fight with some tough guys there, and after that spat, he is sent to Hennessey's (Joan Allen, The Bourne Supremacy) office, where he is told that he has one chance to get out: DEATH RACE, a game in which you win 5 races to get out of prison for your own life. A previous racer, Frankenstein, has played and died. Jensen takes Frankie's place, and joins Coach (Ian McShane, Shrek the Third) and 2 other people, who help him get set up and other stuff. While racing against 14K, Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson, The Fast and the Furious), he gets a hot chick named Case, (Natalie Martinez, breakout actress) who is his partner, and together they race and try to find a way out of there. However, what Jensen finds out is that the man who killed his wife is in there, and he'll do whatever it takes to get back at him while still in there!Death Race is a fun-filled romp through violence, blood and gore, and so many other things. Jason Statham is great and well cast in the movie, and he is a great actor too. Tyrese Gibson gives a great spin to the film himself. Joan Allen is pretty scary as Hennessey, and even has the movie's best line: "OK, c-cksucker, f-ck with me. See who sh-ts on the sidewalk." How that line was conceived, I don't know. But it sure is a great one liner. The race scenes are edge-of-your-seat fun. Great camera-work, and great explosions as well. The only thing I didn't like was that the movie was too short. It felt like it was only 40 minutes to me really, but otherwise that must be a good sign, because it's a fast paced thrill ride that will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. If you ever wanted to see cars racing in prison, this is it, baby!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Death Race" was written and directed by Paul W.S Anderson, a filmmaker whose toiled away trying to make the perfect movie based on a video game. I'll give you a few moments to process that before I say?yeah, that's right, he's made some really terrible movies. "Death Race" actually looks sort of fun though, definitely a racing film that will erase the memory of the "Speed Racer Technicolor Dream-Coat" at least, and Jason Statham is usually so good in movies like this that he'd make "Fast and the Furious" look like "Beach Blanket Bingo" all by himself. This may be Anderson's first real entertaining movie, but there has been some question as to whether it really is his movie. Writer Adam Stone says Anderson stole his work, leading to some speculation of plagiarism and possibly to a denied wide release. So there are two questions, one of course will be answered if your reading this review and the other will be is this movie even worth stealing in the first place? Statham stars as Jensen Ames, a former professional racer turned Steel-mill worker. It's the future, 2012, and work is hard to find. Ames is laid off from the steel-mill and when he comes home, his wife is murdered by a masked assailant and he is framed for it. Months later he finds himself in Terminal Prison, the bitch to a domineering warden named Hennessey (Joan Allen). Since the prison system has become overcrowded, the prison participates in a death race, a pay-per-view event that allows people to watch cons in cars equipped with machine guns, rocket-launchers, napalm, and other goodies try to kill each other for sport. Hennessey wants Ames to drive and wear the mask of a famous and much-loved competitor, Frankenstein, so that her viewer ratings can stay up, and she makes the promise that if Ames wins the race, he can have his freedom. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that Ames will become the new Frankenstein and its not long before he is going up against violent and vicious competitors, including three time winner Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson). Watching this movie I could just imagine a group of 13-year old boys sitting behind me, each wearing his WWF and Stone-Cold Steve Austin shirts, having a gay old time with it. So much so that I'm surprised the movie actually went for an R-rating. It's incredibly dumb and for the most part un-involving, but going back to the R-rating, it does have some decent carnage. The movie is shot in a dreary blue setting, letting us know that the world is no longer a warm and loving place but a cold, violent and ugly looking cess pool. The story means next to nothing and is mostly a three-stage race that gets increasingly redundant as it goes along. Cars go around in circles really fast, blood, bullets, and explosions ensue, people meet grisly deaths and then everything happens all over again. "Death Race" does have a few actual dramatic car duels however, one where Ames goes up against the man that killed his wife and another when he and Machine Gun Joe go up against a tank. The rest is take it or leave it stuff that will interest you only if your really gung-ho about your blood, guts, and souped-up killer cars.Statham is perfect for this type of role though, giving Ames a gruff, hardcore quality that's even more high octane than the cars. And Joan Allen is his perfect antagonist. Icy, manipulative, and devious, she makes Hennessey one of the better villains to come out this summer. Its just too bad she's not apart of a better movie. And like always, Ian McShane is gravel-voiced testosterone. I think that Tyrese Gibson is falling into a pattern here and I hope someone takes him out of it soon. As he showed in "Baby Boy", he is a much better actor than being the sidekick in racecar movies."Death Race" has some fun and the actors do what they can, but its not so much a movie than an excuse to watch carnage and fast cars. When you see an action movie that's this dumb, you know the summer is pretty much over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little bit disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My expectations were a lot higher. The film has everything you need for a good action: fast cars that have a weapon on them, racing, prison and Jason Statham. Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is a former driver, who comes to prison for the murder of his wife, which he did not commit. They received an offer to race under the mask Frankenstein, the famous prison racer who died in the last race, but nobody knows. Races that were supposed to be the best part of the film, turned out the worst. Literally they were boring. There was more dialogue in the car, than the action on the track. The movie has really had the potential to be a good move, but they screwed up. As I said, I was expecting much but got little.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was plenty of racing and shooting, though most of it was out of context and had little riding on it. The movie's purposefully simple premise is easily excused but the smaller details are roughshod - sexy women forced unrealistically into the story and two-toned villains filling out the necessary clichés. That all of the death racers had accumulated long and successful records was made laughable by the fact that 90% of them died in this one race - talk about an unsustainable franchise. This may seem like excessive criticism for a B-movie set in a fictional world, but it still needs to be grounded in a certain amount of realism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taking an old movie and redo it again because it was either a big hit or a classic I like the idea but I never really approved it because 90% of all remakes are often bad and have never really something new to tell. That's why I find this movie boring... I didn't have any expectations to this movie and I didn't wanna watch it. But since my friends were watching it and I was bored and had nothing to do so I watched the movie, I'm not gonna say it wasn't all bad the car chases, the fights, the one liners were OK and the actors and actresses were not that bad.But this is a remake, you don't really get anything new and they are often bad. But at least Death Race got some audiences and I recommend it for guys that just wants to see some action, hot girls and nice cars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Race Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an action movie starring Jason Statham ---&gt; You know it'll be about a righteous badass guy kicking the butt of all evil doers he finds. In this movie's case, that happens both behind the wheel and in face-to- face encounters. If you don't care for raw fighting nor violent races with modded vehicles, then don't bother watching Death Race.The main character is framed and ends up in prison. There, the warden offers him the chance to be free once again - all he has to do is partake in the dangerous Death Race alongside other convicts (who are also competing for freedom) and emerge victorious. The story then develops (as much as stories usually develop in movies of this style) as the movie rolls on and you end up finding out the reasons behind the framing, a little more about the characters, main guy fights for justice and so on.For its genre, I give it a 7 out of 10. It's an interesting concept, there's barely any boring moment and good entertainment if, like I wrote in the first paragraph, you're into this type.</fullReview>

Tyrese Gibson was also right on the mark in his role . the two main driver's Frankenstein, and Machine Gun Joe have to battle it out to the death in order to win their release from Terminal Island Prison. it's set in 2012 and prison's are overrun mismanaged , so private corportations run the prison's now,, the have advanced from cage matches to the death, via the internet, to racing death machines around the prison,, every is web cast over the internet and you pay like 300 dollars to watch it on TV. what a racket for the warden,, but unfortunately the main driver dies and the warden is up the creek with out the paddle , enter Frank our main character he is recruited to drive by the warden, frank ends up in prison for killing his wife ,, which of course he didn't do. now the fight is on for frank to get out of jail, and find his wife's killer or killers'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is strictly recommended...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... to turn your brain off before the show starts. This is one boring movie. It has some plot - poor and predictable like every other B-action movie, you see one, you've seen them all. The characters are generic, flat, shallow. There is some action, of course. Most of the tome it's one car shooting at another in front of it with multiple heavy guns without any visible effect. The action scenes are wildly cut and too fast paced to enjoy. There are some two or three moments where the movie surprises you, but overall you better pass it. The worst thing is that it deliberately ignores all the laws of physics. The "tombstone", 6 inches thick steel shield on the rear of main character's vehicle, weights more than 2000 kg, which means more than the car itself. And, on the other hand, this shield gets "ripped" with 0,5 cal. bullets. Even 13 years old are not stupid to believe this. The cars violently crash into each other without any visible damage (well, some scratches and dents) - most modern video games are better than this. Just pass it, it's not worth your time, unless you got plenty of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A screaming hoot! Brilliant mayhem and a perfect balance of fun, thrills, and humanity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was shocked at how much fun this movie was. Terrible reviews, of course. I went hesitantly, but had seen everything else, and desperately needed a cinema break from work. This was over-the-top mayhem, and pure adrenaline, and pure enjoyment! Note I am a bloke, so I cannot speak for the ladies, but the ones in my cinema audience seemed to be enjoying themselves.As you have no doubt heard, it is a frentically paced film. And, given all the action, which usually only bores me, I was surprised to find it was a hoot. A screaming hoot!Two of things this movie did showed a lot of subtlety and a very deft touch on the director's part. One, it did not take itself too seriously, and was not as grim as you might think. Two, it never descended into "camp." It was not winking at us, nor playing anything for laughs. And yet one must throw logic and plausibility out the window as well. Maybe one could say it was a "down to earth" fantasy? I don't know how the director did it--- as I thought about it, I marvelled at how difficult that must have been.A perfect balance of excitement, mayhem, fun, thrills, and even a happy ending! Wow! Go see it, you'll be grateful for it if you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Loud Movie (too bad I can't shout)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, Death Race is maybe more worthy of a 9.5/10, but I will round up my number. First off, let me just tell you that many kids aged from 12 to 14 will probably want to see it, but because it's rated R, they'll ask you (the parent) to bring them. If that's the case, I recommend you to refuse the offer, as Death Race is one of the most brutal, violent action movies I have ever watched. Heck, this movie is rated 13+ in my country, still, I find it deserved a 16+. Take them to Tropic Thunder instead, if they really want to see an R-rated movie. However, I have no trouble recommending this movie to the parents, because it's one hell of an adrenaline ride.Many people are going to critic the movie's lack of story. This is a Paul W.S. Anderson movie we're talking about, not a Steven Spielberg classic. This is a movie from the same guy who brought us Alien vs. Predator, Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat. This movie, to me, is probably one of his best movies and I enjoyed it. This is the first time I saw Jason Statham as energetic and as captivating in a movie. This is the movie that proves that Jason Statham doesn't only give punches and kicks, but that he can also act. Tyrese Gibson and Natalie Martinez are also pretty good in this movie, 2 other reasons to go watch it.Back to the lack of story, it's a simple plot, but a totally different story. There is a twist that I won't reveal but that is quite surprising. One last thing before I end my review, the sound in the theater room is very, very loud. I saw this movie Thursday and quite frankly, the sound was pretty loud and I only got off it yesterday. So this is how my review ends, with a good 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admittedly, I did not want to see this film. I had no interest in a movie that is basically Twisted Metal, minus the franchise and Happy Meal tie-in. I sat in my seat, preparing to be bored for the next hour or so. My best friend Rick giggled in anticipation. The movie started and boy, was I wrong! Death Race was actually good! I also went to see Tropic Thunder that day (Tropic Thunder being the movie I wanted to see) and found that Death Race was so much better. While Tropic Thunder made me wish I'd save my money; Death Race made me feel alive again! It's the kind of movie that has shitty acting; some sort of plot but in the long run, it's only going to be watched for: Violence, Cars and Hot Women. You don't even have to like the main character the most. For me, my favorite character was Grim, the cholo with a heart of gold---until he's decapitated. So see this movie with your friends or when you're sad. It will entertain you...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An fun, underrated, action-thriller set in the not too distant future.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the death of Prison's Pro Race-Car driver known as Frankenstein (Voiced by David Carradine) died violently during an race. The Prison Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen) needs an new race driver to replace Frankenstein. An former pro racer Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is framed for the murder of his wife (Janaya Stephens). While he's sent to a maximum security prison, the prison warden asks him to join the race to win his freedom. But he has to compete with other pro racers like Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson) and others. But there's something not right about the race and the racers have to fight each other to stay alive.Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon, Mortal Kombat, Soldier) made an entertaining action/adventure/thriller that is a sequel/prequel of sorts of the cult classic B-Movie titled "Death Race 2000"... starring David Carradine and Slyvester Stallone. Director Anderson knows how to create good looking action sequences and he has fun with his casting choices like newcomer Natalie Martinez as Case (She plays Ames' navigator), Allen and especially Ian McShane as Coach. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an informative commentary track by the director and the producer &amp; as well for two entertaining featurettes. DVD has both the original theatrical version and the unrated extended version. Although an box office disappointment, this should do extremely well... once it is released on DVD and Blu-ray. Don't miss your chance to see it on the big screen. Screenplay by the director. Based Upon a Story by IB Melchior. Based upon a Screenplay by Robert Thom and Charles B. Griffith (The Little Shop of Horrors). Super 35. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jason Statham is framed for the murder and sent to the prison where they run the Death Races on Pay Per View. He's promised that if he becomes Frankenstein (killed at the start in a vocal cameo by David Carradine) he can win his freedom by winning what would have been Frank's fifth race. Of Course Joan Allen (in one of the best villain roles ever) will never allow it.Mean ugly nasty popcorn film update of the cult classic from Paul Bartel and Roger Corman.Its another dystopia story of circuses provided for the unemployed masses. Some people hate it. I like it for what it is. Its big loud and violent. You either go with it and its updated look at how far we've gone from the first film. There it was a warning about how far we may go in the name of entertainment, this is the clear announcement that we've arrived at the violence as entertainment point. Yes it IS another case of the story being the very thing it is trying to rally against-but thats whats so great about the film, it is the very definition of an exploitation classic. I mean come on I'm defending this piece of utter trash-and it IS utter trash on moral grounds. I love it.Roger Ebert called the film immoral. And he may be right if only from his perspective. Clearly he refuses to see how low the lowest common denominator is here.Recommended if you are willing to take it for what it is and nothing else. Remove your expectations and go for bread a circuses- or in this case popcorn and car crashes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I went into Death Race with really no idea what to expect from it. I am a big fan of Jason Statham movies but the concept of this movie hadn't really made me too excited to see it. Nevertheless this is a great movie, the humor is spot on throughout the movie, though this is definitely no comedy. The action is fast paced throughout and they come up with some pretty creative ways for characters to get killed. I found the story to obviously be a bit far fetched with it being people racing in a prison and all but never that didn't ruin the movie at all and I ended up loving the storyline. Overall, the acting was great, and it had great effects and a good storyline. I consider this a must watch for those who love action movies. 9/10 " Was commented by someone else and I totally agree. Loads of Action, don't think to much about the story line, there is a bit of a story but nothing great. Good movie to just sit back, stop thinking &amp; enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that it is a remake of a 1975 film of the same name, but after seeing it I'd compare it too those two films. This movie is a guilty pleasure for anybody that likes edge of your seat action. It is set in a Mad Max like future, Where laid off worker Jensen Ames(Jason Statham) a once promising race car driver, is framed for the murder of his wife, and six months later is sent to a prison that produces a T.V. show called Death Race, where convicts race. But unlike regular racing, in this it's kill or be killed in order to win. The warden(Joan Allen) strikes a deal with Jensen that races and wins for the show, he'll go free. Jensen agrees to do it, but what Jensen is gonna find out, that even in the prison world of racing, things are not what they seem. You should know going into a movie like this to expect, a good time action film. That is what Jason Statham delivers so well in all his films, although he is not a totally great actor, but he manages to avoid becoming annoyingly one dimensional type of hero like some action stars are best known for playing. He knows for now he is best at playing in these type of movies, but who knows maybe he'll do a comedy one day. Joan Allen is also great has the evil warden, a great departure from those other roles she's known for playing. And it also had a great supporting cast like Ian McShane(T.V.s Deadwood) and Fred Koehler(Mr. Mom, and Kate and Allie), Tyrese Gibson, and let's not forget newcomer Natalie Martinez, talented and beautiful, no I mean so beautiful, one day she is gonna give Salma Hayek a run for her money. This movie is one enjoyable thrill ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this movie, for reasons I cannot explain, I didn't expect to really see anything that resembles the usual quality films I try to only watch. I have seen Jason Statham in The Italian Job and The Bank Job and liked both of those. I think he needs to stick to caper films rather than over-the top action movies that may have a sleek look to them, but have ultimately no plot and no reason to see them. Statham plays a former hardcore car racer who is trying to live straight, but ends up in a huge jail after being framed for his wife's murder. He is then drawn into the Death Race, an Internet phenomenon showcasing wild prisoners drive even more wild cars in a race that features the winner killing off the others.To be frank, this movie offers no new insight to its genre, the performances are lackluster, especially by Joan Allen as the tough-as nails warden, and Tyrese Gibson as the supposedly gay inmate that is Statham's rival. Nothing here works very well and the ending is predictable and lame. Save your money and go see a well-made funny movie like Tropic Thunder that may not be one of the best of the year but is a heck of a lot better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest murder frame-up in the history of film - and the ugliest prison warden of all time. What more can one want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"2012: The U.S. economy collapses. Unemployment hits a record high. Crime spirals out of control. Private corporations now run correctional facilities for profit." Yes, the clumsy, incompetent reign of B.O. is over and things aren't looking good. You can say all you want about the movie, but it's prophetic.Never give up on your dreams. Joan Allen has all but given up on the ambition of starring in an even more idiotic movie than Oliver Stone's fantasy/biopic "Nixon", but she has finally done it. She has pulled it off, and now serves as an inspiration to us all. The message is simple: no matter how low your standards are, never quit on making them even lower. Where there is hope there is a future. Where there is hope, there is always the possibility of getting worse and worse as the years go by. I've got tears in my eyes as I write this. I am moved.There are so many other things to learn from a retarded action film such as DR: 1. I've learned that a "tenth-generation triad" can have an MIT degree. Why a triad member would want one is beyond me, but I implicitly trust this movie's judgment.2. I've learned that hip-hop "music" still remains the best soundtrack to accompany any movie that lacks intelligence, and in which things get broken at a rapid pace.3. I've learned that Jason Statham has tried to make a more moronic action flick than "Transporter 2" - and failed. He has learned that even a Roger Corman film cannot compete with the infinite imbecility of a Luc Besson production.4. I've learned that in the year 2012, prisons are run by ugly, middle-aged women with plastically altered mugs that only have one facial expression: the snide grin.5. I've learned that in order to "pump up viewer ratings" of a reality car-race show it's best to include a monster train-truck vehicle that will kill off all the participants. I don't know how that should please the viewers but I have nothing but the highest regard for this movie's logic. I trust they know what they were doing. Implicitly.6. I've learned that when you're a gay black prisoner and you drive a car very fast while planning to escape jail, it's best to light a cigarette. This will NOT distract you in any way as you go 150 miles per hour.7. I've learned that prison wardens in the year 2012 let their most dangerous inmates get inside racing cars - each armed like a Death Star - but then get totally surprised when these criminals try to escape.8. I've learned that criminals in the year 2012 need Jason Statham to tell them that they can escape with these racing cars armed to the teeth.9. I've learned from Jason Statham's elegant exit from a speeding car that large muscles act as a reliable safety cushion when jumping out of a 100 m/h car.10. I've learned that after all the 100s of hours spent in Acting School, Joan Allen still hasn't learned that playing a villain does not mean smirking 100% of the time.11. I've learned that some action films have characterization that is on par with the "Teletubbies".Whenever a movie starts off with a muscely tough guy going home to his wife and baby, you can expect: 1) the wife to be killed off within minutes, and 2) the child to be kidnapped and act as motivation for the hero's adventure. This movie's predictability level is right up there with "Saw 2". I almost fell like a mini-Nostradamus watching this turd of a film. Is anyone out there retarded enough not to smell the "major plot twist" miles away? Yes, Statham had been set up from the very start by Allen to race for her reality show. There are blind bats in the caves of Mozambique that have never seen a movie in their life, but smelt the stench of this amazing surprise twist.After 30 minutes of stupid dialogue the action finally starts - and it's mostly dull. Your average bumping-of-cars-into-one-another drudgery. Nothing excites me more than the 23,483rd movie with car chases in it. "Escape From New York" meets "Mad Max 2" meets the writer's tiny brain.Allen: "In this prison we get the worst of the worst". Did she mean actors? Oh, criminals... Like the nerdy, chubby Lester. What's he in for? Terrorizing people with spam email? A hardened criminal indeed."Death Race 2000" was almost as retarded, but at least it had that grainy 70s feel. What does DR 2008 have, apart from a prophetic prologue? P.S. I thought about it a bit, and changed my mind. "Nixon" is much dumber than DR. I got so carried away by the sheer cretinousness of this movie that I almost forgot how laughable "Nixon" was...</fullReview>

Repeat. REPEAT. Those race sequences really do represent a new low for contemporary Hollywood movie-making. When shots aren't cut into spastic, nonsensical visual slaps that last less than a second, the camera is quaking violently and zooming in and out furiously, as if being controlled by a well-caffeinated mute, trying desperately to let the director on the other end of the monitor know that his testicles have just caught fire. At one point, following what appears to have been a gigantic car accident, Joan Allen (Joan Allen!) turns to a colleague and bellows, "What the hell just happened!?"You tell me, love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure f'cking insanity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I could describe this movie in one phrase it would be this: pure f'cking insanity. Everything from the action, to the plot, to the dialog, is absolutely ridiculous beyond comprehension. But...It doesn't really matter...Because Death Race may just have the craziest and most explosive action of the year.Death Race knows what it is and does not disappoint. It doesn't take itself seriously and try to be existential and have a point. There is no point. Suspend reality (because even in desperate times, we ALL know that this will never happen), and sit back and enjoy the high octane adrenaline action. Few movies have as many explosions as this one. It's insane.Don't worry about the acting, as there isn't much to act. Jason Statham delivers yet another nuanced and subtle performance, filled with rage. Although 85% of the film's action sees our characters in the steroid pumped racecars, true Statham fans should be pleased with the amount of hand to hand combat as well (a lot was kept out of the previews, so it was surprising). Tyrese Gibson gives us more of the same, while descending into a darker role with ease. It's basically as if his character from Waist Deep was murderous instead of heroic. Joan Allen is the lone real performer in this movie, and she provides quite the presence as the Warden of the prison.Destined to become a cult classic just like the original, Death Race gives us some of the most exciting action of the year, while reminding us that we will never be as cool as Jason Statham. While the lack of iconic lines and characters is bothersome, the memorable action somewhat makes up for it. I do take points away from Death Race for being the most predictable movie of the year, and I'm not talking about the ending, which tries to be clever (*slaps Paul W.S. Anderson across the face*). I was able to predict lines of dialog, how action sequences would play out, and which characters would die. Actually, the latter one isn't that hard to figure out...If you're looking for your typical mindless action vehicle that is sure to leave an explosive impression, Death Race will fit the bill. Don't expect greatness, because the film is all about low expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very fun action ride from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death Race was a perfect movie in my opinion. It was action packed, bloody, gore, and even sexy. It was a lot of fun to watch. I really enjoyed this movie because the story was great and it had a lot of meaning. This was a great movie to start ending the summer with. The acting was very good. Jason Staham played a perfect role maybe his best role yet. Tyrese Gibson added a good performance as well. The stunts and driving that was performed in this movie was amazing. The visuals were so cool and so were the special effects. the movie really was entertaining and a wild ride from beginning to end. Just strap in and get ready for a really fun enjoyable action packed film. This movie holds nothing back it goes for it all. The blood was crazy and their were a ton of people dying. I also loved the originality of this film. I don't think there are to many maybe no movies that are anything like this movie. The title for this movie describes the movie perfectly. This was definitely worth seeing for a couple dollars. I will see it again and again. It is way better than what I was expecting it to be. It isn't boring for one second in the movie at all. Another great thing was the movie was very unpredictable. Twists and turns kept coming in every scene in the movie. The outcome was very good. Overall this movie was great and you will be very happy in the end after you see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindless action but fun if that is what you are in the mood for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a near future United States the economy has collapsed and the most popular entertainment is the 'Death Race'; a pay-per-view spectacular where convicts race around a deadly course in heavily armed and armoured cars with the promise that they will be released if they win five races? something nobody has done. The closest is the popular 'Frankenstein'; a masked driver who has one four races so far? the only problem is he died in his last race as he crossed the line. Wanting a replacement to wear the mask, prison warden Claire Hennessey has former racing driver Jensen Ames framed for the murder of his wife. Once inside the notorious Terminal Island prison he learns that he is to become Frankenstein; it isn't long before he realises why he was set up and by whom? he doesn't just want to win he wants revenge.This film may be inspired by the 1975 film 'Death Race 2000' but its execution is quite different; the race takes place in an enclosed industrial landscape and the drivers only target each other rather than racing across the country getting bonus points for people they kill on the way? this may make this story less tasteless but it also robs it of a certain sick humour. The action is loud and brutal but as we don't get to know many of the characters their deaths don't have that much impact. Jason Statham does a solid job as Jensen and Joan Allen is suitably unpleasant as Warden Hennessey without becoming a pantomime villain. Also of note are Ian McShane, who plays 'Coach' the leader of 'Frankenstein's' team; Tyrese Gibson, who plays Jensen's chief rival 'Machinegun Joe' and Natalie Martinez who plays Jensen's sexy navigator. Overall I wouldn't say this is a particularly good film but nor is it particularly bad; if you are looking for something loud with lots of action you could certainly do a lot worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DEATH RACE is a noisy film. From the second the movie begins, we're in over our heads in a world of explosions, high speed pursuit, blaring and expletive-ridden rap music and muscled men shouting at and intimidating each other. Forget subtlety, the traces of a genuine script, and acting: what we have here is a cartoon or video game put up on the big screen to be enjoyed with popcorn and then discarded afterwards as a noisy, violent snack. It's a guy's movie through and through, unashamedly based at the male demographic in every respect, from the tacked-on gore scenes to Statham's appealing hard man hero and the presence of numerous 'honeys', dressed in impossibly tight clothing and heaving cleavage at every opportunity.Of course this is a remake of the '70s drive-in flick DEATH RACE 2000, which was a low budget effort and one I didn't particularly like that much. There's a nice cameo from Keith Carradine at the very opening of this film, and Roger Corman's credited as an executive producer, but there the similarities end. The new DEATH RACE is very much par for the course: hyper violent, over edited and often noisy and confusing. It starts off as the usual prison movie and couldn't be more clichéd if it tried: tons of movies kept coming to mind, from Van Damme's IN HELL (even one of the actors is the same, playing the same role) to Stallone's LOCK UP and many more besides. Statham's tough and taciturn, bad guys spit in his food and there are a bunch of mechanics hanging around in a garage, led by Ian McShane, turning up for his paycheque as Statham's mentor.So far, so inane. Then the races begin. Great! There are three of them, and they're the highlight of this movie. They're super-fast and super-violent and feature excellent stunts of vehicles flipping over, crashing and flying into the air. Everything's captured beautifully and the addition of insanely powerful weaponry adds to the fun. The first two races are the best parts of the film, especially when the 'dreadnaught' makes an appearance.What of the actors? Well, they're there to drive the cars, nothing else. Statham does his patented tough guy shtick without breaking a sweat, Tyrese Gibson barely registers, and Joan Allen is slightly embarrassing as the film's villain ? she was so much better in the BOURNE films than she is here. Robin Shou, whom we kind of remember from the '90s MORTAL KOMBAT movies, is big and bald, and one of the chief villains is played by Max Ryan, a bad guy I like who starred in KISS OF THE DRAGON.This movie is pretty entertaining, if you're in the right mood and don't expect too much. The presence of Paul W. S. Anderson as director is a black mark against it but the good news is that this movie's far better than both RESIDENT EVIL and ALIEN VS. PREDATOR. The only thing that I didn't like was the climax, which is so predictable and unexciting in the face of what's come before. There's a ludicrous 'twist' involving a bomb getting through all manner of security which has clearly been tacked on without having been thought out beforehand, and a cheesy happy ending that'll make you gag. Still, this ending can't really spoil the fun races that have come before it.</fullReview>

On the day he loses his job, Jensen Ames is arrested for his wife's murder. Sent to Terminal Island, he's offered a chance of freedom by Warden Hennessey, race as the popular mask-wearing Frankenstein, or rot in prison. But as the three-stage race approaches, he realises that the whole thing may be a set up.......It's directed by the guy who gave us the ridiculous Resident Evil movies, and the overblown AvP. And it stars Jason Statham.But the Resident Evil films were fun, and Statham is watchable in anything, so anyone who's anyone should really know what to expect when switching this movie on.Action, gravelly voices, comic book villains, and questionable acting........apart from the two seasoned actors who are in it for a healthy pay check.It would be pretty topical stuff if it wasn't for the small matter that The Running Man had already done it twenty years prior.But that film was all about the private company getting money from sponsors and betting, whereas this movie is all about that wonderful thing called the internet, and generating money from the sales of 'snuff' like streaming.It's all pretty perfunctory stuff, and if you were the type of person who rented out movies on a Friday night with the words Cyborg, American, Kickboxer, or Tiger, then this will be right up your alley.It doesn't try to be anything other than what it is, a nuts n' bolts action movie with big explosions and fast car races, and that's what makes it so enjoyable, it just entertains.It's not going to win lots of fans, the sequels are as bonkers as you'd expect.But I had a lot of fun with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death, destruction, hot hate, and Stratham</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love it, how remakes can be approached, differently and use a different style to the original. Although some of the character's names are retained, Death Race is just cool great fun, one cool remake, with action you just suck up. Frankenstein the chief driver, and all time winner, died a much tragic death out there on the closed circuit, monitored by video cameras, and one cold hearted and snaky prison governor (Joan Allen) who's just awesome, stealing the acting honors here. All in the name of sick entertainment, a handful of prisoners are forced to race each other, on this well manned race zone, where there can only be one winner, hence, one survivor. Sounds like Running Man, yeah? Now in the drivers seat to replace Frankenstein is Stratham, who was set up for murdering his wife. You can add up the dots, and I did love Stratham's vehiculur revenge, pre head snap, on this guy. Stratham is of course Stratham, and he does what he does best, and it's not acting. He has a hot female prisoner navigator too, (yes much sexier than Simone Griffith). Ian Mcshane was really good too as Stratham's weary prisoner mechanic. The acting though was better in the original. How the story resolved itself, I really liked, something I don't anticipate as far as convict love goes, good again, triumphing over evil. Just let's say Allen's last words, were "I always win". Death Race really surprised me, with action aplenty, not losing the humor either, as after each sorry played loses, where they're X'd out on the board, fresh bloody smear prints, cover it. Yes we do have bloody moments, as judging by today's standard, but you should check out the sick violence in the original. In all, what has eventuated here, is a killer fun time in front of the tube, in a successor of a remake, with a killer performance by Allen.</fullReview>

I mean it doesn't require a huge amount of brain power to watch but its still fun, the stunts are fantastic and there's a good cast attached. Statham -doing his thing, Tyrese Gibson, Ian McShane, the always bad and recognizable Robert LaSardo, a bunch of hot chicks for the guys. I also liked (Joan Allen) as the Warden, extra bitchy and amusing as the antagonist.And while the whole movie culminates towards the actual "death race" and it was super cool it also went on and on and I just kinda glazed over after a while, with all the bullets, explosions, near misses, gory deaths and bloodshed. Cool stunts though, very video gameish. 02/13</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the bonus feature "Start Your Engines ? Making a Death Race," Anderson declares that he meant for this movie to be a darker, more serious, believable version of Death Race 2000. I've never seen the original, so he may have succeeded, but I found this film to be hokey in a few parts, including the ending. All of that being said, it is one of my favorite hokey car films. There is actually a compelling plot behind the race, plenty of great action, and a solid cast, including newcomer beauty Natalie Martinez, whom I'd like to see more of. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that you need to see this flick, I will say that you probably wouldn't mind watching it more than once, either.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com</fullReview>

Story is simple but well balanced, directing professional (see the title of this review - Gorge Miller in his "early" years with "Mad Max", and Paul Verhoeven in his Hollywood years, like with "Total recall" - this means that Mr. Anderson has done his homework very well), editing just perfect, acting just with the proper measure for the occasion. No lack, no surplus. Of course, the pattern has been seen before many times (although it's not The Green Mile, mind that) but it's nevertheless exciting and fun. After all, it' just a movie :) And a good one. Recommended for good entertainment retaining your self respect as an intelligent and experienced watcher (who occasionally loves to play video-games).

Two-thirds of the combatants die but the winner may earn his freedom. On the day he loses his job, steelworker Jensen Ames is arrested for his wife's murder.

Jensen makes the bargain. As the three-stage race approaches, he realizes that the whole thing may be a set up - can an anonymous man behind a mask get revenge and win his release?As Far As Movies Go This Is Basically One That Has A Very Specific Target Audience, If You Think About Showing This To A 15 Year Old Metalhead Then I Say "Do It!, Go". This Movie Is Packed As Hell With Gore, Female Porn Stars Playing The Female Cons And Of Course Racing. I Personally Liked This. It Is Not Something I'd Watch Again But If Someone Asked Me To I'd Answer "Sure". If Your In The Mood For Something That I Call A Modern "Con Air" Or "Godzilla (1997)" Then I Recommend This Highly.This Movie Is Also Followed By A Prequel That I Also Recommend To Any Fans Of This (I Also Liked But Its To The Same Extent Of This One).Overall The Movie Is One I Recommend To Anyone Who's Ready For Violence And Profanity...If Your Not In The Mood For That Type Of Movie Then Go Watch Something Else...I Mean It Like Anything Else.</fullReview>

That way you get the mesmerising blur of fake broadcast idents in the film followed by a channel ident followed by a sponsor ident - which in this case, beautifully, was for a video game.Because that's what it is. A nonsensical, violent extrapolation of a game that involves the perfect amalgam of cars and guns. Hang on though, no women? Yes, there are the requisite women, all far too scrubbed and svelte to have survived as law abiding girls, written into the race as navigating co-drivers.So why's it worth a star or two? Well anything with Joan Allen is worth watching for a start. Then there's the extraordinary invention with which a dozen individuals (whether wearing a ton or two of internal combustion engine or not) get killed. And finally there's the charisma of Jason Statham who knows exactly what he's suppose to do in this role and just gets on with it. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun and entertaining action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death Race is a movie about Jensen Ames (Statham) being set up for killing his wife and goes to prison. The year is 2012 and the USA has collapsed and the Prison Death Races are the biggest thing on TV. The plot is pretty simple but the entertaining and explosions make up for that. Action movies like these don't really need complex plots, though I can see why some people hate it for this reason.Death Race seems based o a video game and was a little similar to The fast and the furious (a racing car movie). This is a good story, with good acting, dialogue, and cinematography. However, the real winners are the actual stunts performed on the race track. No CGI. Hard to believe, but no CGI that I could tell and at the end of the movie there is a statement that professional drivers did everything under controlled conditions. The stunts are what makes this movie. I liked how they made the actual "Death Races" like a paper-view type event, similar to Nascar or WWE paper-view matches. This is a race where there are few rules. Some of the things allowed are machine guns, rockets, smoke, oil, and spiked balls of iron to flatten tires. The winner is the one who is alive at the end. If any contestant wins 5-races he gains his freedom. The characters were great. Statham and Tryese delivered, also same with Joan Allen.</fullReview>

It's the typical boyish, sweary, loud, plot less, car-filled, action flick that I'd normally hate, but while the "Death Race" scenes were too long I actually started to enjoy them. I cared about the main character, I actually wanted him to get out of the prison and back to his daughter. There's something about Jason Statham that I just like, he kind of charms me and I could watch him in almost anything. He plays a kind of no-nonsense action hero who gives the bad guys what they deserve without losing the human touch or going too far, and he always gives them a chance first. The villain in this film, the prison warden, was drawn purely from The Shawshank Redemption, and there were numerous other clichés throughout, but overall I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

That's Death Race in a nutshell.Jason Statham plays Jensen Ames , a factory worker who gets send to prison because he presumably killed his wife. There , he gets to compete for his freedom in a popular sporting event : Death race. If he wins three races , he gets his freedom. The story is really basic so don't expect much.Statham's performance is not one of his bests but it does the job. The other performances are quite solid to , but one performance is just great : Joan Allen as the warden. She just acts great, as usual, ad lifts the acting to a good level.Now here's mu main complaint. This is a movie where you are supposed to be excited when you watch it. I don't have this feeling. Sure , the action looks nice, the cars are cool , but never in any of the race sequences do I feel excited. The fight scenes out of the car , are ironically better in my opinion , than the car scenes. So that holds back the movie in a way.So overall , the movie is decent but could have been much better.Rating : 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul W.S. Anderson is a talented filmmaker with the pure blood of a die-hard gamer running through his veins. And DEATH RACE is proof that this can be a good thing (Eat that, Uwe Bollcock! Haha!). If you're up-to-speed with the recent racing games out there, you're bound to get a kick out of this re-make. Virtually the whole film is constructed like a racing game, and this will undoubtedly be an added value to those who enjoy gaming.So, technically DEATH RACE is a re-make of the Roger Corman produced kitschy camp-fest DEATH RACE 2000 from 1975. But in reality, both look and feel like very different films. So if you like them both (like I do), you're bound to like them for different reasons. I might even add that neither of them are actually really good movies (each has their own, various shortcomings in different fields), but both are the kind of "What the hell!"-movies, where stuff just doesn't bother me that much and I can have fun with.DEATH RACE is all about speed, adrenaline and not giving a damn about showing any sign of intelligence. At least not on screen. Behind the camera (from production values, over set design, special effects &amp; directing) enough talent is shown to make things look great. The film is - more or less - one big race, divided into three chapters (which gives us a bit of time in between to catch our breath with some minimal plot- &amp; character-development). Good way of structuring this film, because after the first chapter (race), you'll be going "Crap! There's two more races like that coming up? Awesome!". Well, at least that should be what you're thinking. Otherwise this movie already failed for you after the first chapter and you might as well switch it off.DEATH RACE is loud, wild, hard-boiled, sexy and blood-soaked. Things go splat! &amp; boom! at high speed. A testosterone-driven fun ride you can only enjoy or get the hell off the first chance you have. Take it or leave it. And don't try to do this in the streets where you live, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that really delivers entertainment. The producers deserve credit for heavily investing in the cars and special effects that are truly exciting to watch. Death Race has been criticized as being nothing but senseless violence and the negative remarks are not without merit. It would have been a challenge, but feasibly the same action could have been encased in a more meaningful scenario. Still, the film, for what it is ? and that is extreme action ? achieves its goal admirably. It is riveting to watch from beginning to end.Jason Statham is fully convincing as the violent hero with a soft touch. He's bad, but sometimes good, and one can't help but like him and care about him. Ian McShane, a distinguished British character actor, has the two best lines in the move and delivers them so that not a nuance of juicy meaning is missed.The action sequences are wonderfully staged and edited to intensity. The audience at the Circus Maximus would definitely give this film a thumbs-up! Everything the characters do with their cars is outrageous, impossible, completely thrilling, and a real treat to watch. One feels satisfied after the crazy races, as if something has actually been accomplished! The DVD has interviews with some of the actors. It is fun to see how different they are from their brutal characters in the film.</fullReview>

The camera work and angles make the races exciting. There are some violent deaths but they are not shown close up. Ian Mcshane is a good supporting actor.

As with most Jason Statham films, this one has a cookie cutter ending, wrapped up nice and neat.FINAL VERDICT: Perfect for action enthusiasts, as long as you are old enough to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, perhaps Mad Max and Death Race fall in to two different categories, but they both have something in common; futuristic chaos, dangerous cars and amazing stuns. It's 2012 and the US economy has collapsed rock bottom. Private corporations have taken control of the penal system and have converted the penal system into a gladiatorial arena, broadcasting live through the internet and making millions. Jensen Ames, (played by Jason Statham) a former race car driver, was framed and accused of murdering his wife. Later, after being imprisoned, he is forced to participate in a deadly gladiatorial game called Death Race. There he finds out that he was setup and that the person involved is closer that he expected. Death Race is a remake of the cult classic Death Race 2000 (1975) movie. This movie is packed with amazing stuns and racing action. The vehicles are packed from machine guns to rocket launchers. Don't expect to see great acting or a complicated story, this movie goes straight to the gut. If you like the action of the Transporter and the car mayhem of Mad Max, you will love this one. Again, like I mentioned before, don't expect a complicated story line or award winning acting, this movie is just another action movie with the only purpose of fun entertainment. So, on a Saturday night buy a pizza, a few beers and invite some of your friends and enjoy this flick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death Race accomplishes the task that it sets out to do, even if that task is something that has been done over and over again since the summer of 1975 when the blockbuster trend started with Jaws, the task of entertaining the masses. The film is slick and sexy in the Hollywood tradition, but it never pushes too far over the line to the point of gimmicky, the violence is gory, but with a fun disgusting quality to it, and the camera work is sensational. Even if Death Race is nothing more than eye candy, it is among the tastiest of the year.Jason Statham plays an average worker who is framed for murder and sent to Terminal Island, America's worst prison in the year 2012. The Warden (Joan Allen) knows of his past as a racer, and promises his freedom if he joins the Death Race, in which the prisoners do three rounds of machine-gun, explosion-laden racing around the prison campus. The acting is nothing special. Statham pretty much plays himself, and Joan Allen does nothing but sneer. The best role is definitely Ian McShane as Coach. Obviously he chosen because of his unparalleled acting in the drama series Deadwood.There is not much else to say about Death Race, It's fast, it's thrilling it's stupid, and it's hot fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not funny enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to make a confession. I love dumb action movies. I really do. I have always liked movies like 'Commando' or the Lorenzo Lamas movies or... You get it. They don't make this kind of movies anymore. The closest thing to a real TRUE dumb action movie that I saw in the past six or seven years was 'The Transporter'. Actually I liked it a lot - there were very good action sequences, good one-liners, cool leading character. Everything you need. And it even was not that dumb. And here I am waiting for the new dumb action starring Statham.The sequels of 'The Transporter' were quite disappointing but there was also 'Death Race'. The trailer was great - action, blood, "Welcome to the Jungle"... But what did I see? At least the action and the blood were there. But the movie just wasn't fun enough. Sorry. I guess Anderson thought he is making a serious movie. He was pretty wrong. Too bloody, too gory, too serious, a complete lack of the coolness that you need, no one-liners and, the most important, no "Welcome to the Jungle". I am not a fan of Guns N' Roses but I like this song and I think it sounded great in the trailer. Why wasn't it in the movie? The movie's soundtrack was terrible actually. When it comes to action it is big and loud and mediocre at best. Sometimes it is funny but it is nothing special. I prefer watching 'Van Helsing' again, sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul W.S Anderson (RESIDENT EVIL &amp; ALIEN VS. PREDATOR) provides the script and directs this 2008 remake of the Roger Corman produced 70's film DEATH RACE 2000, this film was exactly what I was expecting, big fast cars with big mounted machine guns, just blowing the living hell out of each other.Among the all the violence you do grow to like a few of the characters, Jason Statham as Jensen Aims carries the film with an intense performance, Joan Allen as Hennesey couldn't have been cast better, and Ian McShane as coach the most likable guy in the yard, need I say more? The fact that this doesn't score big with critics is simply because its not artsy fartsy, the reason it scores with people that like to be entertained even if it is only mindless violence, is because its not artsy fartsy, and if you like this film, it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you, but if you do like these so called art films (taking into account the subject matter of most of them) then there might be something wrong with you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was recommended this movie from my brother, who knows I am big into auto tuning. The premise sounded weak, but I figured "fast cars and guns: how can you go wrong?" The fact is, while this move started out with promise it quickly turned into something that was nearly unbearable to watch. The only thing that kept my attention was the fact that I was extremely curious as to how it would end. I am not a fan of Jason Statham ('Transporter 2' for Christ's sake!) and this movie did not sway my judgment in the least. If you want straight up action and do not mind the story leaping off a cliff 20 minutes in, then this is not a bad movie. If you're looking for a half-decent story, 'Death Race' is not for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Framed for murder, his one shot of freedom is to enter the infamous Death Race, where convicts drive cars tricked out with guns, rockets, spikes and napalm to race for gory glory.Sure it sounds a bit stupid but it's entertaining to say the least. It's more influenced by video games like Burnout and Wipeout than the old movie, especially with the weapon activating pads on the track.To be honest the 'one-track only' location on the oil-rig-like prison isn't as exciting as civilian locations would have been (like the original). The track itself is a long, tall 0 which reeks of a lack of imagination. Especially after watching Speed Racer.Fans of the Statham machine can also look forward to Crank 2 and Transporter 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, as a rule, I am not a fan of remakes. If something was good enough to stand on its own, there was no reason to remake it. If it wasn't good enough, it simply didn't have enough merit to be remade.This film, which is a remake of the kitchsy Roger Corman classic, "Death Race 2000", is the exception. The major difference is while DR2000 had its tongue firmly implanted in its cheek, this film takes it premise as plausible in a real world way.Ex-stock car racer Jason Statham is framed for the murder of his wife so he can be the replacement for Death Race champ Frankenstein (voiced by David Carradine, who played the role in the original.) His pit crew, led by Ian McShane of Deadwood fame, does a very nice job of preparing him for the race by rigging up his vehicle with weapons.There are more action scenes and less character development. Instead of colorful characters like Matilda the Hun and Nero the Hero, we get uninteresting racers with little personality other than being wiped out in the various stages of the race.Let's take a minute to talk about sex, shall we? I think it is interesting that the 1975 version had gratuitous sex and nudity, yet this film, despite an R rating, goes nowhere near it. While they keep the concept of mixed gender racing teams, there is no sex between the pairings. More interesting, although there are supposedly female convict navigators in every car (except "Machine Gun Joe's", who takes male companions because he is supposedly gay) we only really see two female navigators in the race, only one of whom we see meet a violent demise. (Although a total of seven racers are supposedly killed in this film.)They have no problem showing us the violent deaths of the three male navigators who have the bad luck of riding with MGJ. I think this goes back to my rule of violence, where the graphic nature is tempered by gender and age.All of that said, I think this is a pretty good popcorn movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic, frenzied flurry of flying sparks, blood, and metal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be absolutely, brutally honest, when I saw the ad for this in the theater, I scoffed a mighty scoff and almost verbally announced my predetermined hatred for what I was sure would be a horrible shaky camera-fest interspersed with sex, guns, and violence to cheapen the thrills and draw in the lowest-common-denominator audience, ripped directly from some race fan's Death Race 2000/Mad Max crossover fantasy.Suffice it to say, I was tremendously surprised when I liked this movie. No- scratch that- I loved this movie, the same way that I loved Death Proof and Planet Terror for their kitsch value and fun-loving nature. Death Race was to me, like a friend that you don't spend too much time with because of his dangerous behavior and habits, but is loads of fun to be around in the few times you share together for exactly that selfsame reason. I was quite amazed at the production quality of this movie, considering the quick cuts that are a necessity during high-speed race shots; with everything that can go wrong in a shot, there's simply not enough time to do a long take. Each grind, hit, and bullet fired was filmed with impeccable timing, generating a fantastic sense of frantic pacing, while also giving you just enough time to admire the gorgeous drifts and swerves around tight corners; the weaving cars performing their twisted metal ballet of destruction.There was one element in particular that pulled me in within an instant: the in-road power- ups, like something taken right out of "Carmageddon" or "Burnout" (video games). These were introduced early in the movie, and so they didn't take precedent as a primary plot device, but they added such a "spice of life" kind of variety to the race that for a moment, the kiddie gamer inside of me was (metaphorically) holding the TV with both hands, eyes glued to the screen out of sheer amazement for the art I beheld. It's an understatement for me to say that I always thought there were a lot of racing video games that would have made incredible real-world sports (despite technical problems, eg. physics), and this tangible connection between the film and a distant fantasy of mine had me enthralled.As for the cars? They're fantastic. Whoever did the model work for these beast really put their heart into it. Every one of them looks exactly the way you'd expect such a vehicle to look: like a gladiator on wheels. Armor plates, reinforced windshields, rams, and chain-guns all came together to make a rolling war machine, complete with every prerequisite dent, bump, and bullet-hole. While a point of criticism for some, I felt that the film's grey-brown color treatment accentuated the details of the vehicles marvelously, and made them seem just all that much more grittier and deadly. To have been standing in front of the real-world cars they made for the film, listening to their engines revving, would be downright intimidating, and that same feeling comes through the screen full-force as you watch these metal monsters prepare to do battle in an ever-moving, ever-changing coliseum.As for the writing, I can only really make one note to the viewers, and especially some of the reviewers. Stop taking yourself so seriously. This movie is meant to be fun. It's meant to take you into a NASCAR Monster Truck rally of the future, and you're supposed to feel the same thrills that anybody at such an event would feel. Bring your cooler cap. This isn't the kind of movie to view with pencil and notepad in hand, jotting down all your quirks and complaints regarding the shallow characters and their stereotypical archetypes. Turn down the lights, crank up the amplifier, and let yourself be blown away in a fury of flying metal and blood.In short: the characters have the depth of a puddle, the cars are ferocious, the action is gripping and frenetic, and the movie's generalist, somewhat predictable ending means that it'll still be fun to watch the second time, and the third after that.Also, be sure to pay attention to the disclaimer/warning after the movie's over. Good for a chuckle that it's on a film (very rare), but they mean it. Let Jason Statham do the death- driving.</fullReview>

As soon as the movie starts your put in the drivers seat and driven into a world in the not to distant future. Basically 8 drivers who are picked in a prison are are put through 3 stages of racing to win there freedom. with fully equipped weapons and metal shield's the drivers must battle it out to the finish. with twists and turns around every corner our lead actor played by jason stratham (wrongfully accused) must take the identity of a recent racer (frankenstien) and use it to win his freedom. but it wont be that simple especially when one of the race car drivers killed his wife. so sit back and enjoy the ride easily one of the best car racing movies since fast and the furious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I avoided this movie for so long simply due to its title, I mean c'mon when you name your movie 'Deathrace' you're bound to get a few raised eye-brows..But recently I was bored beyond belief and so I decided to watch a mindless action movie..so naturally Deathrace came up.Jensen is an ex-racer who ends up in prison after being falsely accused of killing his wife, in prison he is offered an opportunity to leave..All he has to do is enter a racing match named Deathrace. Deathrace is essentially a race to the end line, however there are traps around the race track and the fact that your enemies have machine guns attached to their vehicles! I was pleasantly surprised. The action scenes are quite brutal, which is intertwined with the high octane racing sequences, the overall story has been done yes...(Innocent man ends up in prison, receives a way out) But the action scenes in 'Deathrace' separate it from the rest. Jason Statham plays the main role as he has done countless times before with a dodgy accent and angry look upon his face however it works wonders in this situation, then course you have Ian Mcshane who finally plays the good guy in Hollywood as the 'Coach' a man who has become institutionalised by prison, Ian adds a little credibility.Overall the action scenes make this movie an action flick to remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lazy success is better than a lazy failure... ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death Race really overcomes some serious obstacles to get a solid result.The director is all flash and little substance Paul W Anderson (of Event Horizon fame. And Resident Evil 4 infamy), it is a remake of a 70s low budget exploitation film (remember Rollerball?) and perhaps most troubling is the plot which is essentially "mean guys race cars".Now I'm not worried about Oscar potential but that hardly even sounds like something with any entertainment value.It is 2012 and the global economy has collapsed (they were a bit late on that one! But I'd rather a dystopian violent 2012 than a "everyone learn to tread water REAL quick film like "2012"), prisons have been privatized and are now run for profit, with prisoners being used as test dummies in violent contests to be filmed and sold on pay-per-view.Jason Statham is Jensen Ames, a hard workin', hard on his luck hard-man who loves his family ? then has them taken from him in brutal fashion and is framed for the crime.Upon arriving in prison he is almost immediately conscripted to take the place of famed race driver "Frankenstein", a guy who is responsible for many deaths and always wears a full face mask, enabling Ames to take his place without anyone knowing. Unfortunately the real Frankie has died thanks to injuries suffered in the most recent race, but as he was so popular with audiences that such a switcheroo seems the only option.With the promise of a release with full pardon if "New Frankenstein" can win just one more series of races versus the prospect of a long painful life in prison ? or a quick death in prison ? Ames reluctantly accepts the female Warden's offer.Now the tenuous premise has been set up let's not bother with what happens next, after all it should be fairly obvious that Ames will be targeted and doublecrossed before even having the chance to triumph.Let's deal with the obvious clichés: Ames is teamed with a pit crew of guys who know his true identity and are sworn to secrecy. There is the meek but smart one, the older wise one, the well meaning but na?ve one and the hip carefree one. His secret identity somehow never comes out.Ames's adversaries are a hodgepodge of tough guys and shady types with "cool &amp; dangerous" sounding names, violent pasts and various ethnicities.The warden is the real bad guy (gal here though), manipulating the races and racers to maximize ratings and make sure no-one can truly win. It is inevitable that they will come to blows at one point.Now the things that made no sense whatsoever: At the start of the first race Ames is told that his windows are mirrored so he doesn't have to wear his mask while racing, yet the racers gesture and taunt each other through the film, obviously fully able to see each other.Everyone swears and says clever things to each other throughout the race even though they can't hear each other.Remember the mirrored windows? Each driver is assigned a navigator from a nearby women's prison. The navigator's role seems to be little more that sit still and say obvious stuff like "there's a guy behind us". In reality the chicks are there for one reason and one reason only, the super slo-mo sequence as they disembark from the bus wearing tank tops and sidle sinuously towards the camera in one epic lineup of Victoria's Secret model criminals. The film suggests they are there for ratings, but the telecast doesn't start until after they are in the car and if the windows really weren't see-through no-one could see them anyway.Once the race is underway Ames' navigator (whose name I can't recall but she was insanely hot) gives him the lowdown on the race rules. All well and good but perhaps easier if Ames was told the rules in the days prior to the actual race rather than on the fly with ruff n tuff guys shooting at him? The race is run in three stages, the first two simply to knock out also-rans ? and show big crashes and flashy explosions ? so why "race" in the first two legs and risk death? Surely it would be easier to cruise Miss Daisy style and enjoy the scenery? Anyway after all that Death Race is good as disposable trashy fun, lousy as a coherent piece of cinematic story telling, but who in their right mind goes into a move called Death Race for the storytelling and narrative? So with that in mind I must give it points for doing what it sets out to achieve. The explosions and deaths are suitably violent and well choreographed, the dialogue inane, tough and over the top ridiculous, and the chicks? that one pointless scene stays with me.If only they had post race group showers, Death Race might then have been truly Great, for now it will have to settle for big dumb entertainment. Like Jessica Simpson during her fat phase, you watch and enjoy, but you probably don't brag about it much.Final Rating ? 6 / 10. This was never destined for Oscar buzz but it sets the bar low and clears it without logic or in truth much effort, but a lazy success is better than a lazy failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twisted Metal Meets Escape From New York, Cool Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for escapism fun, you've come to the right place, Death Race! When I saw the opening I was a little bit into it not knowing what was playing on a friends TV. Then the opening credits started and I saw Roger Corman's name prominently displayed about 4 times, even though he probably had little to do with the film, it was still cool. And some plot loopholes started to flash to me, like if the USA is in such dirt, and people are making $150.00 a week working 60 hours, how can 75 million afford a $250.00 pay per view? And why is a wimpy guy sidekick in this prison for hard core offenders? Well, the Death Race itself soon made me forget about all of that (and thankfully, it comes up very quickly), because it was a lot of fun to watch. How Twisted Metal does not get any credit for inspiration beats me, but Twisted Metal is one of the few video games I played all the way through and this was definitely a Twisted Metal movie more then a Death Race 2000 movie! After watching this I want to go re-watch Death Race 2000 but my memories of it are that it was kind of lame and definitely Corman low budget cheesy. After watching about four Jason Stratham movies and loving all four I'm definitely a big fan, the guy knows how to pick movies that guys like to watch. For pure escapism fun with fast cars and trucks and lots of weapons, good villains, and a cool good guy, Death Race delivers the goods, 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though the story line is incredibly thin, Anderson still managed to leave open a number of plot holes. Copying from 1975 the film "Death Race 2000" and the 1987 Schwarzenegger film "The Running Man" as well as computer games like "Carmageddon" or "Destruction Derby", Anderson's "Death Race" has little new to offer besides some 21st century special effects.The only ones who can really look forward to something new and refreshing are fans of Tangerine Dream's Paul Haslinger. Haslinger's soundtrack adds a grim industrial feeling to the film, making the brainless movie bits a bit easier to swallow.Still, the film consists of little more than monotonous car chases with lots of bullets and explosions added to them. If you're interested in a dumb and unoriginal action film filled with plot holes, then "Death Race" might be your thing. Otherwise, watch out you don't fall asleep.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...albeit that isn't saying much, since he has utter crap behind his belt like Mortal Kombat or AVP: Alien vs. Predator and several decent films like Soldier and Event Horizon. In general the movie is slick and fast-paced, thankfully not cluttered with the fast editing that made AVP a snooze fest. Stunt car racing is enjoyable, although it sometimes tends to be very repetitive with one car driving straight and the other car shooting at his behind... Surprisingly the drivers in the Death Race seem to have no idea about evasive maneuvers and steer the wheel like suicidal maniacs.The storyline has some nice, if extremely predictable touches, especially the whole wife murder thing. Some touches seem unnecessary and forced, when the baddies just HAD to get their just deserts, even though the solutions weren't always plausible.My biggest issue is the race itself, which has two very stupid preliminary phases, where to progress you don't have to win it. All you have to do is finish three laps. Apparently all participants of the race are extremely stupid and go on killer rampages during this phase, even though there are almost no benefits of such action. As far as I see it the only sensible way to behave in these phases is to drop back and quietly cross the finish-line, while the imbeciles up front kill each other... But well... Suicidal maniac does as stupid script says.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, I enjoy this remake for its cheap thrills and decent car chases. I don't think I have much to comment on this film but I will mention that Death Race is a very straight forward action movie which doesn't beat around the bush with any type of suspense. This is not a thinking man's movie and rightfully so. Anything that this movie tries to hint, a person with average intelligence can already figure out beforehand. The plot is very simple but has some fine details to it. The acting with all characters were used sparingly and none of the flaws were too obvious for me to pick at. The cars and the weapons are nicely intimidating and entertaining to watch as they blow each other up. The settings and its contraptions and the modern version of the story make Death Race a worth while watch and I recommend this as a man's movie. See this with your drinking buddies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is actually a phenomenal movie. They manage to turn up all the lovely violence and beautiful action of the original (Death Race 2000), and renew the story so that it actually HAS a story woven throughout the beautiful display of gratuitous violence and corporate greed. At least, on the surface, that is how it seems, but once one has achieved immersion, the core emerges from within the story. It is one of taking risks in order to further one's better interests, of finding cooperation in a seemingly friendless environment, and redemption even when no redemption is necessary.But this is a big, block-bustery KABOOM flick seemingly designed to showcase Jason Statham's physique, talents, and on-screen presence - a job it does well. I have to say that, as usual, I seem to be in the minority, however, in that I cannot see why this performed so miserably at the box office, and failed to generate the appropriate level of interest. This is exciting, well-written, and exhibits a fine slick production style which flows succinctly throughout the entire execution, lending an epic feeling to the work, overall.All in all? I love it! Although, it's far too graphic and visceral for the kiddies, and possibly some adults will have problems with the unrated version's graphic qualities. WOW! was this ever raw! It rates an easy 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have to recognize that not all films that are considered as classics or as "cult cinema" survive the test of time.Some of them are really good and I do not deny it (for example,the excellent The Wicker Man-1973-) but other ones only work as historical relics which represent the idiosyncrasy of a time (like The Apple or Forbidden Zone).The film Death Race 2000,from 1975,belongs to both categories because,besides being very entertaining and exciting,it represents social aspects which evoke our days.So,a remake of that brilliant movie,should take the ideas of that film to our future,to speculate about the development of the human society on the following decades.That should be done by an audacious and visionary filmmaker which entertains us at the same time it makes us think.Or,that homework,could be given to Paul W.S. Anderson.I do not belong to the group of haters of that director.Alhough he has wasted unique opportunities (Alien Vs. Predator and Resident Evil) because he could not recognize the potential of that projects,he has also made interesting and entertaining movies (Event Horizon and Mortal Kombat).This remake,Death Race,belongs to the second group.This movie is hollow entertainment which has some good ideas which are not completely well exploited.I had a good time watching this movie,although it is completely forgettable.The actors were perfectly chosen for their roles and Anderson made a dynamic work in this movie,something which is appropriate because that complements its tone.I think in the only point Anderson's direction failed was in the action scenes.They are entertaining but Anderson exaggerated a little bit with the edition tricks on there so it was a bit difficult to notice,on some occasions,what was happening.I think the main fail of this movie is that it completely lacks of the social commentary which was in the original film so,as a final result,Death Race is a hollow movie.In spite of that,I can recommend this remake because I had a good time watching it,although this experience is not memorable at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Statham stars as an ex-race car driver framed for the murder of his wife in a time where the economy in the world is shot and people in prison are being shot at?legally?in a prison where the ultimate winner is the one who can walk away from the track alive.This is one "kick-a**" movie! It's been so long since I've seen the original that I can't even remember it (review on that film sometime in the future). I found myself glued to the screen, waiting for the next sequence to evolve, and I didn't have to wait long, either, as this film kept moving?all 89 minutes of it! The only thing I have to say about the film is to cite the lead, Jason Statham. I think he's a little overdue to show some of his acting talent, as his main big-time films feature a car alongside him ("Crank" and the "Transporter" films in particular), but it's time to feature more than just his ability to beat someone up or beat them out using a car.8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this one on a plane. I was not expecting anything, especially considering the movie director (did Mortal combat, resident evil...). I gave "death race" a try because I read somewhere that Steven King liked it.Surprisingly, this movie really delivered the goods. Fast, bad-ass film, with lots of action scenes but not over-the-top like many movies nowadays.Definitely worth watching (it is not a masterpiece, just a really entertaining action flick). I just saw "Wanted", which scores better on IMDb and had a much larger budget I assume, but I found it so boring that it reminded I should comment on "Death race".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this on DVD last night, and had to post my thoughts. I loved this movie! I thought it was entertaining as hell, and I was really impressed considering it was made by Paul Anderson, who hasn't exactly blown me away with his recent work. I thought the film was completely over the top and ridiculous, but that's exactly why I loved it. The action is intense and bloody while the whole concept is just too great not to love. I really wish it was based on a video game, because I'd finally be able to say that a good video game movie exists. Well, it might as well be considered a video game movie, because it's got every element of a car combat game such as Twisted Metal: on-road power-ups for offense &amp; defense, a cast of wacky characters with funny names, 3 stages, and a BOSS character that the contenders must face! This film is a game geek's dream come true!! Don't miss it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, I wasn't planning to watch Death Race. I wasn't even planning going to movies, but I figure why not watch a movie about cars with guns. Plus we have Jason Statham and his crazy action movies as usual. I just wanted to watch a fun and entertaining flick and Death brings much more than that.The basic story is about prisoners participating in a brutal sport event called "Death Race". But these are the most dangerous prisoners racing and they will anything to win. Whoever wins all the races, wins his freedom. There is a whole lot more story in the movie, but you see it for yourself.I was surprised on much story there is in the movie. I was just expecting action packed flick, but there is a good plot just to keep it more interesting. Now the story has its flaws, but for the most part, it was good enough. There is a bit of humor in the, which was good at times and not so good at others.There is nothing surprising about the performances in the movie. Jason Statham always delivers in his movies and I think he did in this one. It was not a great performance, but a good one. Joan Allen did a great job, but I think she better in the Bourne films. Tyrese Gibson was also good as playing Machine Gun Joe. I think he was the perfect actor for the role.The action in the movie was great and it was one of the best this year. Every action sequence was great and I don't think there is one that I didn't like. The cars really cool looking, specially the mustang. I love how bad-ass it looked. The weapons on the cars are also cool: from machine guns to flamethrowers to grenade launchers and much more. I thought the action is the best thing in the flick and the audiences won't be disappointed.Death Race is a great action packed movie. If you are a Jason Statham fan, then I think you will probably enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein! Frankenstein! Frankenstein!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman produced "Death Race", film based on the 1975 picture "Death Race 2000" also produced by Corman. This time the director was Paul W. S. Anderson and this time David Bill Kwai Chang Caine Carradine only provided his voice to the character Frankenstein. The 1975 "Death Race 2000" is still one of the films that are part of my "must wanted list", I thought this version was quite similar however my cousin said to me that it was not after. And was cousin the other one interested in this film and also in look for the DVD of the 1975 version and certainly last weekend I went with him and a couple of friends to watch "Death Race" on the big screen hoping to watch a damn fun thing.If you read some of the IMDb comments for this film and the "professional" reviews then you can read how predictable this is, how it is oriented to the male teenage audience so it has cars and sexy girls, how it is like a video game or how it is an assault on all the senses including common, that is you read Roger Ebert's review (Ebert gave this film half *, by the way), and if you watch the film you can know that the people who wrote that stuff are right. So why I gave to this film a full 9, well simply because I loved it so I think this is a "chance" to use the term "guilty pleasure".Anyway, Frankenstein is a character who dies just when the film begins, the mask is the character, itself can make excitement and money and it can be used by anyone. Everything is as simple as that the bitch that controls the prison just cares about her business and that the rest of the characters are part of that business. Nothing is a secret, nothing is a surprise and everything is fun. Jason Statham is Jensen Ames and is like the character he always plays so like always he will end just fine, in Mexico. The game is the issue, the result of people tired of watching people killing people and the overpopulation of criminals, now is people in cars killing people in cars with some special stuff. You will laugh since the game, the death race is an extremely successful PPV event and it offers to its audience many angles of the many cameras, repetitions and three different stages, obviously you have to pay for each stage. Was impossible to me not to have in mind the "Fast and Furious" movies since we saw the trailer of the upcoming one (Diesel is in it so I will not be watching it), also the trailers of "The Spirit" (not familiar with the comic book but I really want to watch it for certain reasons and for Scarlett) and of the new version of "The Day the Earth Stood Still" with Keanu Reeves, but there are at least two scenes that separates "Death Race" of that movies yet the final sequence and other things are "Fast and Furious" but anyway I really can't wait to watch "Death Race 2000".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertainment for the boys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original movie, directed by the acclaimed Roger Corman, was made in 1975 and set in 2000 for no particular reason than the date seemed futuristic (how times change). Now the remake, both written and directed by the British Paul W S Anderson with Corman as one of seven producers, is released in 2008 but set only four years ahead when the world is facing financial chaos (guys, you're behind the times!). Actually I preferred this hard-edged remake against the more satirical original, although the plot this time owes more to the superior 1975 "Rollerball" (itself remade in 2002).Shot like a grand video game, this is a testosterone-fuelled film for young men (or, like me, young at heart men who sometimes like a bit of pure escapism), full of guns, girls and gasoline. Beefy British actor Jason Statham - who first came to our attention in "Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels" - is physically fine as the heroic central character Jensen Ames, a former driver who is framed for the murder of his wife and sent to the maximum security prison at Terminal Island. The only real acting comes from the icy Joan Allen as the prison governor looking to maintain the hit ratings for her pay-per-view, three-stage, ultimate reality show. You get to see the whole exercise in driving, destruction and death for the price of one ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quick description:Entertaining movie...for an action movie with cars and sexy girls, it does a decent job... as others state, first half is awesome, until the second car race, which is REALLY awesome...but then we get to the third chase...ANALYSIS AND SPOILERS:::the Horrible third chase...come on ppl, that is all you can come up with for the final, to-the-death chase?? they just blow up a wall and go free? I mean, what was the use of the fuel tank drop at the end? the police cars could never dent their cars! the choppers were also useless...anyway, learn from Mad Max II...do NOT introduce the big giant awesome tank-trailer until the final chase, have more and more cars in each subsequent chase ( a championship race system would have been so cool...each race against TOUGHER opponents, instead of the same and fewer ones). For F Sake, the last DEATH-RACE-CLIMAX-OF-THE-MOVIE was 2 cars against each other...with one malfunctioning. That is not exciting. The heroic escape of the island was them blowing up a wall and going over a bridge...come on...is that really all you can come up with? ( sorry i am repeating myself, i cant get over that...)It was cool they got free, but the movie would have been better if the obnoxious boss of the prison would not even care about it, since she made her money. She took it way to personal to be truly evil. Why was she so annoyed with Frankenstein?! he drove her popularity up, did exactly what he was supposed to, but she acted as a teenage girl who was just dumped by her bf, with no logic. An evil, calculated boss who doesn't really give a damn about common people and only about the money is much more scary, and realistic. Also she should have never been killed. End line could have been : " What? They escaped? Oh I am sorry, i was too busy watching myself become rich to notice...oh well, are the new drivers i ordered here yet? "It was weird, but the ACTING was the best part of the movie! Coach(Ian McShane)and Frankenstein (Jason Statham) were really cool, the crew was funny, the evil guys were evil and comic-book like (which is how this movie should be) and everyone spoke very little. The characters were exactly what one would expect from a movie called " Death Race ". Overall, interesting movie, had some smart ideas and good images, really cool characters, sexy girls, awesome cars...etc. However, the racing sequences were not properly handled and that was the downfall of this movie, making the ending rather trivial and idiotic..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty bad movie about racing with weapons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a somewhat enjoyable film with terrible...well, just about everything.What makes this film enjoyable besides explosions and racing throughout, if that is your thing, are some of the funny things they did with it. For instance, there is an Asian character who speaks in his native tongue with English subtitles but at a later point in time he says "F__k me" in English but with Asian language subtitles.I say the film is somewhat enjoyable for the funny things, that is what I liked about the film. Everything else is to appeal to a mass audience, but not necessarily a smart one. There is a giant tanker truck with all these guns shooting these racers, yet these "race cars" can't just speed away from a huge, heavy semi truck??? It has a tank barrel on the back, for Christ's sake.This is the kind of film where there is dialogue, and then the camera focuses on another character who says nothing. What I mean is, this is the kind of film that is pretty stupid and that you can easily make fun of because it makes little sense.Currently this movie has a 6.6/10, I believe it deserves about a 5 out of 10 so I give it a 1/10 to balance this out.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from the shamelessly copied title and perhaps a few fundamental story lines, I wouldn't at all refer to this movie as a remake of Roger Corman's 70's B-movie milestone "Death Race 2000". It would be too much honor, really. I honestly enjoyed this film in a brainless and rudimentary masculine fashion, like probably most people did, but it reaches nowhere near the ingenuity, satirical impact and playfulness of the original role model. The new "Death Race" is a testosterone-packed and nearly indescribably violent action movie. That's perfectly fine to me, but please don't compare it with the original film which masterfully combined action, black comedy, social mockery, Sci-Fi and controversy all into one low-budgeted production. All the priceless creativity of the original has here been replaced with hugely expensive hi-tech special &amp; digital effects, so the two films definitely don't race in the same league. That point being made, I want to state clear that it is absolutely not my intention to write only negative things about this new movie. "Death Race" is fast-paced, loud, bloody, spectacular beyond words and it stars one handsomely cool Jason Statham and one perplexingly ravishing Nathalie Martinez in the lead roles. I had a boyishly good time watching this film and the playtime rushed by like an out-of-control race car, so it would be rather hypocritical now to only point out the flaws and shortcomings. The main difference with "Death Race 2000" is that this concerns a prison movie. Whereas the other revolved on a coast-to-coast race with innocent pedestrians as potential road kill victims, this movie entirely takes place on an island prison resort and the drivers are all unsympathetic convicts with the exception of Jensen Ames. He's an ex-racer framed for murder by the evil principal Hennessey, only because she needed a talented driver to replace the deceased top-favorite Frankenstein. For you see, the titular race is a giant media event and the public demands for Frankenstein to participate. He's called Frankenstein because he wears a mask to hide his horribly scarred face and he already won four races in the past. I've seen a lot of Frankenstein movies in my days, but never one where the monstrous being kills his opponents through a race car. Innocent Jensen has no choice but to accept, but he quickly sees through Hennessey's corrupt management and rebels through manipulating the race. "Death Race" is a nearly non-stop spitfire of fighting, death sequences and car crashes, but beware of the few scenes that attempt to draw characters and/or build up atmosphere. Whenever there's no racing going on, director Paul Anderson reverts to the most dreadful clichés of prison movies, like the elderly inmate with a fear to return to the outside world and the head warden's docile sidekick. Joan Allen's character is exaggeratedly depraved. She's practically worse than the Nazi wardens in those late 70's/early 80's exploitation prison movies and she hasn't quite got the looks for it. Her performance isn't bad, but the character is just too much. Other than that, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend "Death Race" to undemanding fans of hardcore action cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the past several years, Jason Statham has amassed a dozen films which has established him as an exceptional actor. His caliber performance is ferociously exciting and is the solid foundation of any thespian who wishes to succeed. In this film, " Death Race " director Paul Anderson, not only writes the story and screenplay, but also directs this action packed feature. Anderson is quite adapt at fusing the unbridled talent of Statham, with the the experienced and supportive Ian McShane as 'Coach.' Furthermore, he releases the pent-up energy of Tyrese Gibson as 'Machine Gun Joe' and Joan Allen who plays the heavy, to be semi-sadistic antagonists against our hero. The story is not all that original, but does offers a riveting, pop-corn eating, theater-wide explosive atmosphere. It begins with a hard working man, who's lost his job, then his wife is murdered and he's accused and convicted of it. After a quick trial is rushed off to a brutal, barbaric and extremely lethal imprisonment. There the warden offers the prisoners a chance to 'win' their freedom by 'volunteering' themselves for a 'Death Match.' The race consists of super-charged racing vehicles, guaranteed to destroy one another and their drivers with everything from flame-thrower's, machine guns, to mini-guns and missile launched rockets. The film will easily keep one riveted to their chair and promises to be another triumph for Statham. Well done. ****</fullReview>

Movie offers fast pace action and adventure. Natalie Martinez (Elizabeth) looks damn hot &amp; busty (she keeps the glamour mood of the movie on) and Jason Statham (Jensen, Frankenstein) gives his best too (he keeps the action part rocking).

To start my comment on this movie let me separate the different kinds of movie that Hollywood produces, there are the Oscar Movies (not for sell just for the art), The B-Movies(B for bad)(and there's a lot of these nowadays), and there's the ones like Death Race the entertaining, it ain't got a Superb cast, or an Huge plot, but it as a lot of action, stunts, explosions, Weapons, and all together in a Deathly Race. Jason Statham is the New era for bad asses (Swharzie, Stallone, Seagal is time for retirement), Tyrese is building up for the Bad guy/good guy paper (remember 2Fast 2Furious), Natalie Martinez i don't wanna be bad for her but on this one shes only extra, better where the supporting roles of Joan Allen and Ian Mcshane giving a good performance. So for final i give this one 7 out of 10 because its entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul W.S. Anderson doesn't disappoint. Death Race is his goriest film since Event Horizon and definitely right up with his most impressive looking films. Compared to some of the more serious films he's made (Shopping, Event Horizon, Soldier) Death Race perhaps falls behind in its substance but makes up for it in texture.The driving sequences were varied and colourful to watch. The atmosphere is excellent and the fact that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously helps you accept the film's ludicrous setup. The gore definitely also makes the movie stand out but luckily not in a bad way. All the Paul Anderson trade-marks are here: the look, the sound and even the slightly over-the-top dialogue.Where the movie manages to pull through definitely is the closure. The casting also proves interesting and satisfying and the performances luckily have a little bit more colour to them than in some of Anderson's past films.Death Race is an interesting, action-packed film with enough serious weight behind it to keep the film's more ridiculous aspects from distracting the viewing experience. If Anderson was looking to make a great homage to a cult film, he's done it, but he's also managed to crunch out one of my personal cinematic highlights of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good B-Movie shenanigans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action movies what are they good for? Well it depends how seriously you want to take them really. Let's face it this summer we have been spoiled by a few intelligent well acted block busters in 'The Dark Knight' and 'Iron Man' but you have to remember that these are very much the exception to the norm. What we normally get are films that try to take themselves seriously and do not manage it, or films that try to be satirical and also fail. Maybe it is me getting older but good action movies seem to get fewer and fewer. I struggle to think of more than two great Hollywood action movies in the last 20 years (stand up 'Die Hard' and 'Face Off'). So what does a director do? Well know your market for start and this is where Death Race succeeds. From the outset this claims to be nothing than a b-movie and is a better movie for it. Paul Anderson I once had high hopes for you and I am a genuine fan of 'Event Horizon' but you really have made some awful films in the following 11 years become video game boy in the process (but hey I suspect it has more than paid your mortgage of). Jason Statham is excellent here in the lead role of Jensem Ames (great action movie name) an disgraced ex-nascar driver who ends up having to compete in the death race, a prison sport / reality TV show where one can win there freedom. There are good actors in supporting roles with Joan Allen excellent as the warden, and Ian McShane giving a by numbers performance as the wizened old time con. The action sets are excellent with lots for the male target audience including the obligatory women, explosions and guns. Statham carries the movie well and shows he has real leading man potential, and the movie hurtles along at a good pace, the only detractor being an unsatisfactory ending. A good enjoyable b-movie romp that I would never purchase but would watch again on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May "Death Race" fade away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a discussion with my bud Dustin, who said you should only remake bad movies?as opposed to remaking great movies. One in the latter category we both agreed upon was "The Manchurian Candidate". I misdirect, intentionally. "Death Race" is a contradiction of the former maxim?remaking a bad movie.What possessed Writer and Director Paul W.S. Anderson to remake the C-movie "Death Race 2000"? His "Death Race" is also really more like a sequel of the 30 year old movie starring David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone. This time around Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson reprise their roles. Absent are any innovative twists or character examinations in this rudimentary predictable retread. The most telling indictment of "Death Race": The most captivating moment of the movie was watching the trailer for "Transporter 3"?the next Jason Statham star vehicle. Statham, although remarkably effective in his tough guy walk through, really needs to be more discriminating. His missteps will not always be forgiven. The last indictment is the convoluted writing credit that acknowledges the original screenwriters. Disturbingly, Anderson's story seems more a rip-off of the amazingly horrible WWE production "The Condemned". Bottom line: Statham fans should wait for "Transporter 3". For everyone else, don't even bother."Death Race" is set in the near future of post-economic collapse. Given the current financial climate that may not be as far off. Jason Statham plays Jensen Ames, a factory worker and former professional racer, imprisoned for the brutal murder of this wife. Jensen is locked up in infamous prison that broadcasts Death Race to a world wide per view audience that generates billions of dollars in revenue. Of course Jensen is wrongly accused, and he desperately wants to get back to his young daughter.Evil edgy Joan Allen plays Warden Hennessey, who operates Death Race. Her star racer Frankenstein secretly died in his last race?unbeknownst to his vast fan base. Hennessey extorts Jensen into assuming the role of Frankenstein. Jensen also inherits Frankenstein's deal. In Death Race, the man who wins 5 races goes free. Frankenstein won 4. Therefore, if Jensen wins one race, he becomes a free man able to reunite with his daughter. However, all is not what it seems?which is shocking. Jensen is mentored by Coach (surprisingly effective Ian McShane). His Death Race navigator is the gorgeous and tough Case (Natalie Martinez). Case is also wrongly imprisoned. This is a tiresome recurring thread. Anderson seemed to be on holiday with his script. Jensen's deadly nemesis is the brooding Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson). Rival Joe underneath it all has a sense of honor. "Death Race" is all cliché, telegraphed plot, and completely predictable. The carnage is nearly inspired if not clumsy. Perhaps, the biggest CGI feat is making Statham look taller than Allen. True, this is not fair.In acknowledgment of Statham, he is incredibly ripped for this movie, and he is an amazing athlete. The few fight scenes he has are spectacular. However, the movie really could have used more of his kick ass martial arts action. For an action movie, "Death Race" is amazingly talky. The action also lacks any emotional resonance. I was really interested that Oscar nominated Joan Allen was cast. She does her best to salvage the role, but there is too much inertia in Anderson's ill conceived homage. Particularly, Statham and Allen deserve better. More precisely, did they actually read the script? "Death Race" should rest in peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly at first I had serious doubts about this movie. I've always been a big Statham fan but he can be in some horrible stuff. And being a fan of the original 1975 version I knew this was going to be a though bullet to take. Of course after the trailer and poster my expectations were getting lower and lower. And then came movie night. And what I can say is this movie started out right. It gave a good introduction to the game and a good tip of the hat to the original by having David Carridine reprise his role of Frankenstien. The rest of the movie followed through accordingly. The filmmakers did make sure that the highlight of this movie was the race not so much in back story or answer but it picked them up as it went along. All and all if you like Jason Statham, Fast and the Furious and Gladiator you're sure to love this modern B-movie remake of a classic B-movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great guy movie that delivers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The key to enjoying this movie is in your expectations. After seeing cars with guns and a wide array of other BAMF weaponry attached to them in the trailers, I didn't expect Death Race to have much depth. I went in hoping to see the lovechild of the Fast and the Furious and Mad Max, and I saw just that--and I loved it! There are plenty of things in this movie that normally would have annoyed the crap out of me, but giving it a lot of leeway made it a hundred times more enjoyable.The acting is, dare I say, somewhat decent for a Paul W.S. Anderson film. The actors give the performances they need to give, while still having fun with their roles. The cold, awkward acting that plagued Resident Evil and AVP is kept to a minimum here, if at all present. Jason Statham is the typical tough guy protagonist, while Joan Allen is the usual one-dimensional villain. They play their parts well, as does the rest of the cast.Death Race is pure escapism. And, oh, is it fun escapism! This is the first Anderson film I've seen that I've been absolutely satisfied with. It never tries to be anything more than what it is and it shows the audience everything they want and expect to see. If you're not into ADD action and gore glorification, this one ain't for you! Otherwise, catch this one in the theater while you still can!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You already know its Jason Statham</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You already know it's a Jason Statham movie, as did I going into it. Also, following Paul W.S. Anderson's career, helped me decide what movie I was going to watch this weekend.Most Statham movies aren't going to contain any character or plot development. That's just his track record now as an action star. And with a title such as "Death Race," no one in their right mind should expect an epic of Oscar-worthy proportions.That being said, I really enjoyed this movie. I hate to use the term, but it really was a "no-brainer." It was very predictable. It had cars with machine guns and armor, that's what was shown in the trailers. It could be construed by some as a corny movie. But, it was what I fully expected. There are also some really bad one-liners in the movie. So bad, I just had to laugh a few times during serious scenes. But at 90 minutes, it was just enough time to get the point across.The beginning was a bit slow, but once the racing started, it never let up. The chasing and racing, and all of the loud gun-fire and explosions make me want this on DVD or BluRay real soon already. It was like a video game made with live actors. If you like a ridiculous amount of explosions and machine gun fire in a movie the typical Statham hero, this is your movie. If you want to be moved by any of gratuitous emotion, skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty fun ride, with lots of action and somewhat interesting deception</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll cut right to the point. Death Race, seems similar to the game twisted metal on Playstation. Yes the characters also use weapons, and cars that the every day consumer tends to drive. Nothing really ground breaking in what I've said so far. This movie doesn't attempt to have any crowd rising epiphanies or such a twisted plot that it doesn't seem to capture us. Although, some of the speeches made by Joan Allen's character are questionable considering she is addressing convicts. Nevertheless, the movie is designed to be a source of car action entertainment.It is similar to the movie Shoot Em Up with Clive Owen. Purely unrealistic entertainment and that my friends is the beauty of this movie. It's nice to be able to sit in a theater and have a few chuckles, watch some mind boggling car chases/crashes and have a sense of where the story is going.I went into the movie with little to no expectations of how "good" the movie would be but purely as a source of entertainment, and fascination of "car functioning." If you get a chance to go see it with a group of friends definitely do it! It's not a movie you want to watch alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of Fun. Don't expect anything else (but why would you?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK let's get something out of the way: this movie is not about introspection of the human soul or whatnot. It's a movie you go see for three basic human needs: sexy sex opposites, cars and stuff blowing up.The movie doesn't aim at any more than this either. There is a small backstory/revenge episode with the main character but what is really interesting are the set pieces, the action, the unprecedented frenetic car combat that takes place.Let's be honest here, if you've been a fan of Mad Max, Death Race 2000 and its ilk, there hasn't been much to your taste in the past, oh, 20 years. Death Race remakes the original without any sense of self-righteousness. It gives the audience big explosions, crazy chases, a lot of bullets, sexy damsels and a satisfying end to one wild romp of a movie.It won't redefine your perception of a good movie, but it may stay with you as one of the most entertaining movie of its genre, if you can call it that. Car Combat movies don't get much better than this and quite frankly, I don't see why they should. They're all about the action after all.So unless you terribly mind turning your brains off to enjoy the show once in a while, chances are you'll have a blast watching Death Race. So for what it's worth, I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better then the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is basically a action-movie at its finest. It severally lacks depth and story but compensates that with its action. It surprised me (even for a Paul WS Anderson movie) how mindnumbing it is, but it never leaves you bored and thats why this movie is better then the original Death Race 2000 in my humble opinion. Although that isn't really saying that much since this movie really doesn't have much in common with Death Race 2000 other then the title.Jason Statham is perfectly casted as the actionhero. The movie also lends a few nice video game-like aspects but Paul WS Anderson knows how to handle such things, and really sets himself apart with this movie from directing-failures like Uwe Boll.Overall there isn't really much else to say. The ending is great so I'm not going to spoil it, just see it for yourself. If you are a action-fan you will not be disappointed. Don't expect too much storyline though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genre film with all the genre weaknesses but is still entertainingly noisy and violent fun for the male target audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The country may be in chaos but one time NASCAR champion and recent convict Jensen Ames is trying to get his life together with a wife, child and badly paying job. However when he is framed for the murder of his wife he finds himself back in prison. The prison system has changed from the one we know now though, and televised violent sports with inmates has morphed into Death Race ? a deadly cross between NASCAR, a demolition derby and murder, whose leading star is a masked prisoner known as Frankenstein. Unfortunately this star died after the last race giving executive Hennessey a ratings problem. Jensen is offers a simple, no choice opportunity to mask up and race as Frankenstein. Meanwhile, innocent of his crime and wary of the amazing coincidence that his conviction coincides with Death Race's need of a top class driver, Jensen starts to suspect who was really responsible.It has been years since I saw the original Death Race film and, although I never reviewed it, I don't remember it being much cop ? so the idea of a remake of sorts from the dread Paul Anderson didn't interest me at all but yet still my movie-OCD saw me going to see it. Perhaps it was my low expectations or the part of my thirty-something male brain that has never let go of my inner teenage boy, but I was surprised to find an entertainingly violent film that delivers on what it sets out to do just as much as it fails in the areas it doesn't care a fig about. The latter areas are obvious from the start. They are the plot, the performances and the fact that it has no interest in any viewer who wants anything more than violence and sexy women. The story is obvious from the start and goes just where you expect it to. The characters are mostly macho and cardboard for the men and lithe and mostly sensual for the women and Anderson pushes all the buttons across the film for the target audience.So far this is as expected and what I am describing are qualities that I have hated in other films. The difference is is that Death Race wears these qualities unashamedly and concentrates on making what remains really effective. So the violence is hard-hitting and exciting, the special effects are gritty and engaging as well as being overblown (minimal, or at least not obvious, use of CGI helps this). The cast also help as they are solid names and all come to the film with a real good presence. OK this is not the same as giving good performances but they all work within the context of the film. Statham has found his market and he plays to it well with a solid but charismatic action figure. Allen slums it but her mean, cold performance fits. McShane, Tyrese and a few other familiar supporting cast faces back them up, while Martinez is effortlessly sexy and is only badly exploited a couple of times by Anderson's letchy camera (we don't need the slow-mo pans down her body when she is so sexy in every scene).None of this really makes the film great when you apply fair standards. The plot is poor, the performances lacking depth and the focus is entirely on the violence, music-video-isation of cinema, sexy women and everything else that the young male target audience want. The problem is though that it manages to be a lot of fun despite all this ? noisy, violent, entertaining fun. Unmistakably a genre film to sit with 2 Fast 2 Furious and countless other "toys for boys" action films but it is a superior one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Race is a guilty pleasure that doesn't let down in the entertainment department.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based upon an exploitation movie from B-Movie King Roger Corman in the seventies, which was in turn based upon all sorts of other exploitation flicks of the time, Death Race is all exploitation, and for what it's worth, it's actually quite fun. The skeleton of such a movie is simple: guns, cars, scantily clad women, explosions, blood and lots of cursing; such is the exploitation movie's philosophy, and much like Death Race's main premise, it was all about the ratings, or, bringing in the money. There's no denying that sex and sleaze sells, but the question nevertheless still does remain: can sex and sleaze, that is, a movie based around not much other than pure testosterone-fuelled violence and a hammy, science-fiction plot actually be culturally viable as a means to genuine, fulfilling entertainment? Well, the answer, is probably no, it cannot, in most cases. Yet with Death Race, Paul Anderson manages to make it clear that all he wants to do here is thrill, and when the foot is down, the engines are revving and the guns are blazing, it all comes together quite nicely, in an ironic kind of way. To be sure, the perfunctory drama and characterisation present is slim and without much value at all, yet for a high-octane, no-brainer piece of morally twisted cinema, there's some fun to be had here for those who crave such a thing.Following wrongly-accused convict and ex-racer Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) as he attempts to win his freedom by winning the Death Race (A competition set up to help the American Economy pull in money, keep the masses entertained and get rid of dangerous criminals), the basic story here is not without some imagination. Although a little hard to grasp and accept, the way in which the script deals with the required exposition is balanced enough in that both facts and fiction are kept at a safe enough distance to maintain the illusion; there isn't any elaborate discussion on how or why America has ended up in this state, but there is at least enough to satisfy the setup for the main meat of the story. Following from here, Death Race attempts to sell a story of justice, revenge and betrayal, which for the most part, succeeds in getting across its message. Ames, obviously out of place, but not unfamiliar to the concept of a cell, struggles to keep a hold of himself when confronted by the local bullies. Sure enough, it's not a new idea, and neither Statham or his character seem to care much about the rough treatment, and as such, it's hard to truly feel for Ames, which can hurt the film's biggest payoff moments on the tracks.As emotionally stunted as Death Race may be however, there is no denying the callous, raw edge that Anderson creates here to portray his races. Shot in dark, blue huess that accentuate every piece of dirt that flies by the camera, this isn't Speed Racer by any means; this is dirty, low-brow, high risk racing fuelled by fire and brimstone rather than LSD and candy. Explosions, gruesome deaths and some great stunt manoeuvres mixed with hard hitting pyrotechnics are abundant here and while it's easy to get lost in all that is going on in the movie's fastest sequences, Anderson does well to always reaffirm what is taking place. It's pure adrenaline and seedy entertainment at best, and yet that is what is so refreshing about it all.Performances from the cast are largely forgettable, but adequate for the job. Statham in the lead role is typical Statham; always looking like he's going to punch someone and talking like he's just swallowed a jar of razor blades, you couldn't ask for a more suited Jensen Ames. Joan Allen makes a much more surprising and interesting appearance here as villainous temptress, and mastermind of the Death Race itself, Hennessey. Of course, it's never a role that's going to demand much of even the most mediocre of actresses, but Allen does well to make it her own here and fleshes out a rather underwritten antagonist as best as she can. Ian McShane among others make up the remainder of a talented but underused cast, and this fact is only made too obvious from the fact that McShane in two hours, fails to bring to the screen anything remotely close to what made him so ingloriously interesting to watch on the similarly seedy Deadwood TV series in which he starred.So while Death Race is not without its problems by any means, at least in terms of Paul W.S. Anderson films, this is a step in the right direction. The dialogue is satisfactory at best, and characterisation along with plotting always feels like its playing backing to the film's main focus of action and ladies, but strangely enough, that doesn't feel like a problem here. With a title such as Death Race, one must know what one is going into, and as such, Anderson delivers frequently and with the relentless sense of conviction that is required to sell such a movie today. With a capable cast that do their best with the material they are given, plenty of great race scenes, and a silly but nevertheless well paced story, Death Race is a guilty pleasure that doesn't let down in the entertainment department and knows what its good at to the point where it sticks mainly to that which works. No pretence here, just no brains, eyeball popcorn with no incentive to eat other than that it's tasty. So chow down.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK I just got back from watching a pre-screening of this film, OK basic synopsis is that the years 2012, USA's economy has hit the pits (talk about good timing for release) and Private companies control prisons and make profit from Gladiator like events...one being Death Race..Basically a race to the death as the name suggests.As for actors, Jason Statham leads the cast and does a good role in doing so, Ian McShane provides a strong supporting role adding a little humour of which the film could have had a little more of. In general the acting is above average to good, the characters are interesting and not to complicated.As for enjoyment,,, FUN! FUN! FUN!, this film doesn't set out to win Oscars so going into plot holes etc isn't needed in my opinion, the films action scenes are fast, furious and dam exciting to watch, reminded me slightly of Need for Speed underground (the races) with GTA and a old PS1 game vigilante all thrown into one.The action is fresh and stays away from most of the old "classic tricks" the cars are great to watch and most importantly the scenes are not too fast for the eye and are very enjoyable to watch.So in conclusion this film does what it says on the tin, entertain with a simple enjoyable plot, great action, amazing women!!! And cool characters.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oronically way tamer than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the original; I can safely say it's much more meaner, badder and demented then this new vamped up version for the 2000's First of all, we have here a politically correct movie. Paul W.S. Andersons clearly leaves out the most crucial aspect of the original. Running over pedestrians for points, so naturally Death Race must be set up in a prison so we don't get too attached to it's racers as they get eliminated by each other. Ironically, this time the racers are the victims as opposed to the original.Now we have the key players.Hennesy; a soulless, cut throat female warden who will go to any lengths to keep the legend of Frankenstein alive and put out the highest pay per view ratings around.Jason Stratham, who plays Jenson Ames is framed for his wife's murder in order to provide entertainment for millions as he takes over the persona of the deceased Frankenstein. He does great as his role and he is without doubt the actor to fill the shoes of action greats like Swartzeneger and Stallon, but he still needs to find that one character that will provide him with the blockbuster franchise.Next we have Tyrese Gibson as Machin Gun Joe. While many will admit that Stallon's original role was that of a whiny Italian sausage; you can't say he didn't have charisma. Gibson does provides Machine Gun Joe with a more bad ass attitude,but does not necessarily make him a better version. He talks the talk, races the car, but will he be consistent or soft up at the end? Next we have coach. Ian Mc Shane does a great job, but really, who wouldn't have rather seen Stallon play this role? He has matured and his character really would have showed some wisdom. Plus you got the perfect link to the original.The rest of the racers consist of Hoodlems and Cholos. I know this takes place in prison, but a little diversity would have been better. The original had Calamity Jane. Attila The Hun and even racing great Don Steele play himself.One character form this new version; Grim Reaper never once reflects his persona and is even the first to die.Finally, I must not forget the navigators. Beautiful female convicts who add nothing more than spice to the show.To sum it up, I enjoyed the movie a great deal. I'll definitely get the DVD or Blue Ray or whatever, but doesn't compare to the real massacre of the original. David Carradine would take all these jail birds to Death Race 101 old School any day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My observation listed at the end here, may be a spoiler, but not really sure about that as I could be imagining something that wasn't really there. How's that for a save? I found this film to be a variation on The Longest Yard as much as it is similar in plot to The Running Man. Then again, the respective story lines to those films are pretty much the same. It doesn't much matter though, as this really is fun visit to a theater. There are few action/adventure movies made these days with an original theme. It's a moot point being that this is a re-telling of the original film of which I also enjoyed. What no one here has mentioned is Frankenstein. I believe the voice of Frank (pre-opening crash) is that of the original Frankenstein - David Carradine. He's not listed in the credits, but then again...no one is listed. A fun little homage if I'm right about that voice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent action movie. Joan Allen gives a tremendous performance. Jason Stratham is great. Good story, to the point, uncomplicated. Special effects do not get in the way of the story. Production design is consistent with sense of foreboding and danger that permeates the movie. Most characters are two-dimensional but for this kind of movie, it's okay. The movie is overtly violent, but not gratuitously so. The movie has an interesting and upbeat ending and serves as metaphor for the individual's vulnerability to manipulation. The production crew exercised creativity in casting Ms. Allen in a role that is unusual for her and she once again proves her more than ample theatrical talents. Kudos to Ms. Allen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rap Music Kills This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I am going to apologize because during this discussion on the movie "Death Race" I am going to be venting a bit.What can I say about "Death Race"? It was a typical action/race movie: simple script, not a lot of intelligent dialog, no need for Shakespearian acting, a lot of big accidents, and a good bit of blood and gore. Nothing new that has not been filmed before. The one distinct positive was Jason Statham. Statham chooses some of the worse movies to be in, but his scowl and his brooding attitude would make him a good action hero--if only he could get out of direct-to-DVD-movie hell.Based upon what I had just written, I normally would give "Death Race" a 6 or 7 star for entertainment. But alas I am only going to give this movie a 3.Before I go on--imagine the atmosphere Ennio Morricone set in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" when the three stars faced off in the graveyard, remember the feeling you had when John Williams' music embraced "Jaws" when the young girl was swimming, or better yet--feel the tingle you get every single time you hear the soundtrack to John Carpenter's "Halloween". A great composer can add something spectacular to a movie and give it an identity of it's own for all time. What "Death Race" does is add gansta rap to it's soundtrack. What a stupid, idiotic, moronic thing to do. There is nothing more insulting, degrading, foul or unbearable than gansta rap. None of us want to hear the normal lyrics "MFer, MFer, N****, MFer". First of all there is no talent whatsoever--it is just a bunch of people who disrespect every single one of us in society and the lyrics are the same couple of words over and over again.Can I honestly recommend this movie to anyone? No. I cannot have a family sit down and have their children exposed to that garbage music--I cannot have my work mates listen to that stuff. That kind of music is an insult to all of humanity and whomever approved it took the big step of isolating the audience to a certain aspect of the population.Think of this: I am sending this out to my friends, pasting on IMDb, NetFLIX, telling everyone at Christmas about it and everyone at work. WOW!!! How many possible viewers did you just remove from the view list by adding gansta rap to your movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, it's not a dramatic masterpiece, but it is a hard driving thrill ride and the most enjoyed movie I've seen at a theatre in months, maybe over a year. While the plot is a bit "out there", once the movie gets going it sucks you in and you mostly forget about that. Plus, the ending was great and the visuals were right up in your face which was great and really exciting to watch.It was not the type of movie I would usually go see but I went because it was adapted by P.T. Anderson (still think he was robbed) and because I always enjoy seeing J. Statham beat up on people-heh. I really had a blast throughout except for the rap music I had to endure on occasion (personal pet peeve). I gave it a 10 because of the enjoyment factor. Very, very well done.Now if I could just get the movie theatre to stop playing crappy pop music while I wait for the previews. :-/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To tell you the truth, i was excited about this movie from the moment i saw the first previews mainly because i like to check out movies that are mindless, straightforward violence movies just to enjoy the explosions and check out the special effects but i have never really cared too much about the actual story or direction of the film. To say the least i was not expecting a whole lot more than explosions and gore from this movie but i was pleasantly surprised. While this movie had it's fair share of violence and gore, it is one of those rare movies that knows exactly what it is and delivers in flying colors. While maintaining a story-line that does not put it's audience to sleep and keeping the level of acting far above the generic summer action movie standard, there was almost never a moment of being bored of the action or wanting a scene to end. Just about every scene in the movie kept up the intensity of the last but it never seemed to drain the audience or make itself boring and that's hard to do when you have as many high intensity, jaw dropping, "no way did that just happen" crash and explosion moments as this movie did. Overall if you love action and don't mind some graphic violence, this movie should actually surprise you with it's overall quality and i hope that many of the directors ideas are copied in action movies to come so we're not stuck watching the same tired old crap of yesterday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't let the movie title fool you, this movie has nothing left from boring 1970ish "original", except for the name and prison-arena with drivers fighting to death with each other for their freedom ;) The spirit of it belongs to the Carmageddon and Twisted Metal series of video games. Smart concept, no-nonsense, full graphic violence and pleasant action sequences will give a good entertainment for all fans of the genre. Minimum plot, minimum story, just cars, guns, gore and FUN :P Clear 9/10.p.s.: P.W.Anderson did it again - after 13 years since The Mortal Kombat, we have another solid game-to-video flick ;) Kudos to him!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film so bad it motivated me to come out of retirement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typically, when I contemplate offering my commentary on a film, the one question that always comes to mind is what difference I will make by making my voice heard. Sometimes, with dehumanising propaganda like Mozart And The Whale or Rain Man, it is not so much important to convince anyone to stop watching as it is to simply voice objections. Sometimes, with masterpieces like RoboCop or Night Of The Living Dead, convincing a skeptic who might have otherwise not seen the film to do so is its own reward. And then there's films like Death Race, where commenting seems like something you do out of obligation, kind of like when you file a report after being raped or robbed. The irony here is that some commentators seem to think Roger Corman's approval of this remake somehow indicates quality. What they do not know is that Corman wanted the original to be approached as seriously as this bloated turd, and it was only Paul Bartel's knack for making the most of an opportunity that saved Death Race 2000 from being the complete disaster that Death Race is.Death Race 2000 was made on a budget that likely amounted to a few hundred grand at the most. And more than likely half of that budget went up the filmmakers' nostrils. So when I tell you that Paul W.S. Anderson's remake is not only rightly compared to the original, but is on the losing end of such a comparison, that should tell you all you need to know about what went wrong here. Themes and ideas fly by the screen in an almost manic fashion. In one shot, they are trying to satirise the concept of reality television. In the next, they are trying to give a shout-out to the original. In another, they attempt poor jokes based on a character's sexual orientation. And they get every single thing they attempt utterly wrong. Where Bartel's original shone in particular is also where this Death Race is an epic failure. Anderson attempts to sell the idea that authorities will allow a gladiatorial racing sport in the prison system due to the collapse of the economy. Which could have worked if the person running said sport was not made out by the script to be functionally retarded.Not helping matters any is that the structure of the race itself makes absolutely no sense. Cars run over lit markers in order to activate their weapons, but absolutely no concern is given to how their activation works for the story. Guards switch the markers on and off like crack-addled children in the hopes of giving favoured contestants an advantage. Racers detach armour plates that are helping to prevent their fuel tank from exploding. Racers leap out of cars that are moving at speeds in excess of a hundred miles an hour without suffering so much as a broken collarbone. Any competent director would have sent this shooting script back to the studio and told them to shoot its author in the head twice. But possibly the worst aspect of this film is Machine Gun Joe, an inferior rip-off of the Machine Gun Joe Viterbo character Sylvester Stallone made his best ever performance. Not only is the new Machine Gun Joe a urination upon blacks and homosexuals the world over, but how often do you see actors compared to Sylvester Stallone and finding themselves on the losing end for aspects other than action-heroism?My father was a semi-professional photographer once (he mostly did weddings and the like). I photograph things both as a hobby and as a vociferous protest in favour of my own civil rights. I shoot my video footage with an interlaced HD video camera and painstakingly edit it on a computer that is not even the top of the line for home consumer use. And I can heartily attest that if you made me drink enough vodka to kill a bodybuilder then held a gun to my head as I cut together footage of races, I could easily slap together something both more cogent and exciting to watch than the drivel that passes for race footage in this mess. If I could go back in time with two bullets and the exact locations where Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini will be at certain points, I would take a detour and shoot the monkey who invented shaky-cam twice before bashing his head in with a brick. Considering that Paul W.S. Anderson used to shoot films so that the audience could actually see what the hell was going on, my disgust with him is getting ever more severe.Joan Allen looks completely lost trying to follow the direction of a director who clearly no longer knows which end of the camera to point at her. If I were to spit on Tyrese Gibson for his performance in this film, I do not doubt for a second he would cry racism. In fact, I would like to film him doing just that for the benefit of the homosexual community. Natalie Martinez is quite apparently frustrated by a role so underwritten it makes the sacrificial lamb in Death Race 2000 look like Scarlett O'Hara. But the biggest disappointment of the lot would have to be Jason Statham as the central hero. Where David Carradine was so deadpan and smooth that he made the most absurd material work, Statham plainly cannot give a stuff about what he is part of. It literally seems all he can do to not ask where his paycheque is. Everyone in the film save for Gibson has that patented "I am in a bad film and I know it" look.Death Race is the embodiment of a two out of ten film. If Roger Corman had the slightest bit of sense, he would disown it. Defenders of this puke be advised: your opinion regarding the colour of the sky is of no interest to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Statham cant be far from landing a superhero roll, assuming he learns to open his mouth a little more when speaking, was this guy trained or just lucky when Guy Ritchie found him.... we even have him talking through a mask, gee could any of you understand it. The movie as a whole is a poor modern day Ben Hur without a story, disappointing as I guess they spent a few quid on the FX and car repairs.... My advice, miss it at the cinema and the rental shop too, otherwise Universal might just go wasting more money on Anderson, Director, Screenplay and writer is just a little too much for this man, "running before walking" comes to mind....stop reading so much trash Paul and thinking this'll make a good movie or maybe bin the XBOX it influences you way too much....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nuanced. Thoughtful. Subtle. These are but three words that don't describe 'Death Race', a fast-paced, slow-witted remake of the 70s B-movie cult classic.Star Jason Statham has less range than a sling shot, but he remains a likable and dependable B-movie action anti-hero. The rest of the cast is made up mostly of anonymous sleazoids, but it's sad to see a three-time Academy Award nominated actress like Joan Allen slumming it here.Ultimately, though it boasts almost non-stop action, 'Death Race' is more tedious than it is fun, and never manages to reach "Guilty pleasure" status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than most action movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of an old 70's movie set in the future. The characters where all dripping with attitude and anger. So there wasn't a whole lot of range of acting going on. What do you expect from an action flick though?The race scenes were quite exciting to watch. Lots of collisions, machine gun fire, and the occasional missile being launched. There was some hand to hand action, but it wasn't as prevalent as some of Statham's other action films.They did skip the entire hook of moving down pedestrians like in the original. However, I think that was so far fetched to work for today's audiences.Bottom Line: If you like tough looking men trying to kill one another with cars with weapon systems, its worth a look. However if your looking for a "feel good movie of the year" keep on truckin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good remake keeps the message of its predecessor intact, just altered to fit and reflect the times that influenced its own production. Since Paul Bartel's and Roger Corman's original exploitation movie Death Race 2000 didn't pretend to have a message to speak off, but instead aimed to be a simply entertaining action flick hellbent on giving spectators a gory thrill ride filled with absurdist jokes making fun of politics for the heck of it, there was room for negotiation in that regard when the time was deemed right to tell the story again. The good-humoured gags and slightly satirical and subversive elements were brusquely traded in for a more serious approach, as the new Death Race is set in a bleak world where the economy is in such a shambles the huge masses can only be appeased by watching other people, worse off than they are and pushed into a life of crime, engage in excessively risqué driving behavior. Inmates are offered a chance to reclaim their freedom in return for surviving a race where they must win by avoiding lethal obstacles and more importantly, each other as the goal is to viciously dispatch other contestants. Enter Jason Statham, who by now is well known for playing tough characters who won't tolerate such conditions and fight back with a vengeance.Statham plays Jensen Ames, an honest man skilled in driving who lost his job and subsequently his wife, quickly framed for her death and sent to serve for life in jail. The wicked warden of the prison, an ice cold Joan Allen, obviously with a sinister agenda of her own, offers him a potential way out by competing in her 'Death Race' programme under the guise of a recently deceased racing legend called Frankenstein, a favorite of the crowd. Of course Ames turns out just as efficient a driver as he works his way through the game, brutally taking out many an adversary along the way and annoying his most fierce opponent, Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson). As he discovers there's more to his inclusion in the race than simply his established skill set and the warden may have been involved in the murder of his wife, Ames' objective evolves from winning the race to escaping it. Names and a general premise are about as much as this film and its Seventies' counterpart have in common. Very different in style, the modern version is an effective popcorn flick of an action film, but lacking a character of its own and feeling a tad generic overall. No poking fun at politics here. Prison clichés cannot be avoided, as is the case of sidekick typecasting (an old mentor, a nerdy technician, a hot dame as co-driver, you get it). About as inventive as the character set-up gets is Joe's status as a (black) homosexual, a notion with which nothing is done in the course of the film. Why would it anyway? The film is all about racing kick-ass cars making kills.What Death Race lacks in terms of characters it more than makes up for when it comes to its real stars, the four-wheeled (or more) monstrous machines that form its main attraction. Various grizzly hot-rods adorned with all kinds of deadly accessories have been assembled by a clearly enthusiastic design and stunt team, guaranteeing quite the spectacle as they are pitted against each other in road racing, asphalt blazing fury. The plethora of grotesque vehicles ? including an impressive monster truck loaded with ingenious weaponry ? steering and hacking their way through a course of rusty, rundown warehouses makes for an eerie, hopeless post-industrial look reminiscent of such classic action fare the likes of Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, except with the constant attention of the panoptical media at its back dominating every move of the race to ensure audience attendance. And despite the blandness of their characters, the cast does a solid job making this grim world feel convincing, Statham doing what he does best (and we wouldn't have it any other way). However, under the direction of action specialist Paul W.S. Anderson (not that Paul Anderson, as this one is not known for his carefully balanced quality storytelling), the movie never conveys the idea that it might revolve around more than just decently dynamic action scenes. If it's spiffy cars you want, it's spiffy cars you get, might as well have been the film's tagline. All else is merely secondary.As a whole, the major differences between this latest Death Race and the original are the result of a bigger budget and scope. A true message is still not a thing of note. The 2008 version simply looks cooler and feels slicker because it had the money at its disposal, but it plays it safe by staying in its comfort zone, solely delivering action while devoid of surprise, instead of throwing oddities and black humour in the mix like the original could afford for being a smaller, independent production. Nevertheless, its tactics proved successful enough to spawn two direct-to-video sequels, and so the premise returned to its more exploitative roots (just not in a particularly good way).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the favourite actors of the genre action, Jason Statham, here it comes again in an impossible situation.In Death Race, British actor must support a scenario arch-known, not only because we are dealing with a remake of a film from the '70s. Somewhere in the near future, the hero is put in jail (wrongly of course) in a maximum security prison, whose main difference from other such "establishment" is the mobile film: a "Death Race" with more cars with weapons of all kinds. Everything is allowed, and prize survivor is even much-needed freedom.An explosive film, full of action and suspense, twists and beautiful women, what to say, Jason Statham plays only films that you keep you eyes glued to the screen from the first second to the last sound in the film. Sensational video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DEATH RACEYet another remake? only this time they did a good job.The movie is about a guy who is in jail for murdering his wife, the problem is he is innocent. Whilst in jail, the warden makes him an offer he can't refuse? drive in the Death Race as a famous masked driver that died in the last race. If he wins, he gets his freedom. The Death Race is a car race like no other? not only do they have to win the race, but they have to survive. All the cars have weapons and every convict driving is racing for their freedom.The action in this movie is really good. There is not just great car chases, but the fighting scenes are also really well done. But then that is Jason Stathams best quality. The man knows how to kick butt in a movie. I thought the fight scenes were really well choreographed, but the camera work was not great. The action scenes seemed very shaky. They probably shot it that way on purpose so you can't see them missing each other. Still, I thought it was very off putting and sometimes hard to see what happened. This also goes for the driving scenes. There were a few moments in the racing scenes where I had no idea what was happening as the scenes just kept changing far too quickly and were very shaky. It didn't ruin it too much though. It was still very enjoyable.The acting was surprisingly good too for a cheesy action movie. The movie stars Jason Statham as the guy who gets falsely accused. Jason does a great job playing Jason Statham. Every one of his roles seem the same to me. But all his movies are very entertaining. Other cast members are Joan Allen, Ian McShane, Tyrese Gibson &amp; Natalie Martinez. Everyone did well. I can't really fault anyone's acting.The cars in the movie looked great. I loved them and really liked the weaponry they had on them. There were some amazing crashes and some great driving from the stunt drivers.The thing I loved about the original was the violence. There was some violence in this, but to me the original had more. I loved the fact that in the original they were racing around the streets and the general public was getting killed by the racers as they raced around? with this one they are racing on a track in the prison. It lost the edge a little bit because of that. But in general, the movie is a lot of fun and well made.I will give this film 7 out of 10."The United States economy collapses. Unemployment hits a record high. Crime rates spiral out of control. The prison system reaches breaking point. PRIVATE CORPORATIONS now run all correctional facilities for profit. TERMINAL ISLAND Penitentiary streams a series of Cage Fights live on the Internet. Prisoners fight to the Death, creating a ratings sensation. They are the new Gladiators and Terminal Island is their Coliseum. But like the mob of ancient Rome, the modern audience soon becomes bored. They demand more... DEATH RACE is born."For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 2012. It's a dystopian world where prisons run gladiator-like competitions for profit. Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is framed for the murder of his wife. In prison, he is coerced by warden Hennessey (Joan Allen) into racing for his freedom. If he wins one race, he can walk.Paul W.S. Anderson is the driving force behind the Resident Evil franchise. He has built a pretty good resume of top notch big budget movies from B-movie ideas. That's what this is. You get cars, action, and T&amp;A. It's a B-movie idea done by good actors and good director. Jason Statham does his best bad ass. Natalie Martinez provides the T&amp;A. The action is fun. There isn't much else that can be expected. The race being split in 3 is probably a mistake. It makes the last section not as compelling or as fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Driving and shooting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie covers two basic ingredients of what is an action movie. A nice way to combine driving and shooting in an iconically bad environment - a prison. Not at all boring to watch, I'd say. A fight versus good and evil. David vs Goliath. Pure entertainment. The film contains fast moving scenes, not much talk and a few original scenes as well inside a plot, which in itself doesn't take too much of an imagination. It is a boy's dream: a mean-looking supercar with 50 cal machine guns. Add in pretty-looking girls as well.A fantasy element is at the core of this picture. Despite the fact, what I've recounted as familiar elements of a fairy tale, this doesn't actually happen that often, even in films. I don't remember seeing any 'fight-to-a-death' movies, fought in cars equipped with weapons. So I think this genre requires some replenishment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My summary of Death Race</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death Race is an action film. All of the story happens over a few days and nights.A few guys that are in prison want to escape from it and the warden of the prison thought of an idea. She wants to make a race with guns on the racers' cars. Whoever survives the race without getting killed gets the chance to leave prison.The background soundtracks are mostly rap, hip hop, and a few rock songs. There are a lot of special effects, such as explosions and shooting.I liked the movie. It has a lot of action, cool cars and an interesting story.The character that I liked the most is Jason Statham. In the beginning, his wife was killed by one of the racers in the prison. Then, the racer knocked Jason out and put the knife in Jason's hand. When the police arrived, they thought that Jason killed her because of the knife. When he's in the prison, he takes revenge and kills the murderer of his wife. Jason is a serous guy and fits in fast with the guys at the prison. This is why I like him.Most of the audience who will like this movie are teenagers and/or people who like action such as shooting, explosions, and a lot of special effects. the movie is for 11+ only. This is because little children will think that this all can happen in real life and they will be affected by the violence in the movie.I give the movie 9/10 stars, because the violence in the movie isn't recommended for under the age of 11. There are some scenes that are not real. For example: There is a scene where someone is jumping out of a car with an "escape chair", etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 2012, the economy collapsed(...I guess that makes this movie psychic), the crime rate went through the roof(presumably as a direct result, as in, people could no longer make an honest living... but the film never connects these dots, the prisoners are shown to be hardasses who don't care if others die... actually, that's everyone in this, the characters get no development and are barely even distinguishable from one another; and our hero isn't even in jail for having turned to illegal activities, so it's not even a necessary part of the backstory), penitentiaries are turned private, and, just like in real life, they try to make money from the inmates. Although here, it's not directly from them, rather, they have them engage in the titular "sport", and the profit is from audiences watching it(and this doesn't seem to distance itself from that, the tone is vague in that regard) from home. Wait, I thought people were low on money? Also, are they forced into driving? Are there competitions to "win" a chance to? Some would be certain they could complete it, others would be terrified and prefer to ride out their sentence. This could make for interesting scenes, yet it's not even brought up. Anyway, a steel mill is closing down and can't pay the workers, so they... get riot cops sent against them...? And Jensen Ames(hey, that's almost a name!), a skilled driver, played by Statham(who, along with Gibson, are enjoyable in this kind of thing, in spite of the bland nature of the roles), beats up some of them, and isn't arrested for it. Yup, the unanswered questions and gaping holes in logic and plot just keep on coming. Instead, that happens when he's framed for the brutal(...? We barely see it, and it's not like this tends to shy away from stuff like that) murder of his wife and burning their dinner(well, they get equal attention). In order to get out and raise his daughter, he will have to get through it in first place(since he's pretending to be a masked man who already did that four times, and the fifth, they release them). Meanwhile, he wants to find the man who did kill his spouse, who is in this for two minutes of running time and then never seen again(nice how this man is so true to her memory that it takes him no time at all to get with the female who's... in his car with him, to... run the weapons, that's it, yes, a "navigator"), since that person was considerate enough to do a hand gesture that will make him easy to recognize without his disguise, and he can try to get some unsatisfying revenge(well, it is). Convoluted enough for you? Well, that's just what I can say without spoiling it. Get better it does not. Acting is poor, but a lot of it is on account of the material they're given. Martinez is primarily eye candy, and she is likable enough(I'm looking at you, Megan Fox... well, when I can stand to, without being overwhelmed by how arrogant, unlikable human of a diva you are). The dialog is uninspired. Humor is almost all bad, with a couple of genuine laughs. Exposition is either sparse or thrown at us continuously - Paul seems to think that it's a positive for his viewers to remain confused. And while he avoids some Hollywood clichés, he again brings his own, which are sometimes worse(if people keep approaching the same thing in the same way, it's probably because it works and is popular, and just doing something else isn't automatically a superior method). He builds "something" up(references to "something large being constructed"), and it has a disappointing payoff - in fact, when it finally arrives, it feels like Anderson has gotten bored with the movie he was making, in the middle of filming... what, the racing flick(that never makes it clear how close anyone is to the finish line, an obvious way to add tension to that situation, where it's kind of lacking) with the armored vehicles that hold machine guns and rocket launchers wasn't cool enough? If so, maybe it's the way you're handling it. The bleak, not futuristic("modern" is a better term) visuals aren't bad, and this does stick with the slammer once we enter it, leading to a sense of isolation. This was done with practical FX and stunts most of the way, with very little CGI, and that does aid it. There's also very little slow-mo, and some of it is actually well-used. Regardless, the action(chasing and the few physical fights alike) is incomprehensible, if there are a few moments that are awesome and present images that (may) stick with you. It doesn't help that it is clearly filmed and edited by someone who spends the first third suffering withdrawal, and then gets their fix and spends the rest of it high and frantic. The majority of the time, I didn't even notice the soundtrack(differing opinions, sure, me, I feel like it should get me pumped for the excitement, have me humming along), the exceptions being when there were lyrics and there shouldn't be(it drew attention to itself, as it shouldn't in something like this). Heck, the main musical theme comes off as "warm-up", someone testing their instruments, and it's oddly repetitive. There is a lot of strong language and a bit of disturbing, bloody, gory and violent content in this. The DVD of the Extended Cut comes with an informational commentary by the director/writer, and producer Jeremy Bolt, two documentaries that are up here on the site(and I will review them separately on their individual pages; they are the 20-minute Start Your Engines: Making a Death Race and Behind the Wheel: Dissecting the stunts, coming in at 8 minutes) and trailers for Frost/Nixon and Fast &amp; Furious. I recommend this purely to fans of those who made it, and people who want something dumb and loud and aren't big on discriminating taste. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Bartel's 70s cult classic Death Race 2000 is legendary amongst B-movie fans for its colourful characters, camp cars, cartoon violence, and dark satire; sadly, only the brutality successfully makes it into Paul W.S. Anderson's big-budget remake, the original's flamboyant contestants, distinctive vehicles, cool scoring system and subversive political subtext scrapped in favour of video game style action and an excess of machismo. The result is a spectacular, bloodthirsty and very loud popcorn crowd-pleaser, but one that sorely lacks the edge, wit and cult appeal of its more humble predecessor.Rather than tearing down the highways looking for innocent passers by to plough down for points, the drivers in Death Race battle each other on a track within the confines of a maximum security prison, the action broadcast worldwide over the web for the pleasure of paying viewers. Jason Statham is Jenson, an ex-racing driver framed for the murder of his wife by corrupt prison governor Hennessey (Joan Allen), who wants him behind bars so that she can replace popular masked champion Frankenstein, who died after his last race.Anderson ensures the film's commercial success with plenty of gear grinding, metal mashing mayhem packed with impressive stunts and gruesome death scenes; I imagine the majority of Statham fans will be more than happy with the amount of carnage on offer. The script, on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired: the plot becomes more and more unbelievable as matters progress, the characters are all uninspired action movie stereotypes (there's even the predictably smoking hot babe as Statham's sidekick), and the dialogue is utterly atrocious. As mindless, testosterone-fuelled fodder goes, I suppose Death Race is an enjoyable enough time-waster, but I doubt very much if it will be remembered as fondly as the original in decades to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death Race is set in the near future where the American economy has collapsed, prison's are now run by private companies where the Death Race tournament is held &amp; broadcast for the general publics viewing pleasure. Terminal Island is the toughest prison in the US, run by the sadistic warden Hennessey (Joan Allen) she controls the Death Race, various inmates drive around a track in heavily armoured cars trying to kill each other while staying alive &amp; of course trying to win the race. Any prisoner who wins five races gains their freedom, the nation's favourite racer Frankenstein has won four races but was killed during his last race, Hennessey needs a replacement to keep the public hooked &amp; turns to wrongly convicted wife murderer Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) to wear the Frankenstein mask &amp; fool the public into think he is still alive. With the prospect of going free Ames agrees but finds that the odds are stacked against him as no-one wants him to win the fifth &amp; final race...This American &amp; German co-production was written, produced &amp; directed by Paul W.S. Anderson &amp; is a loose remake of the Roger Corman produced futuristic action thriller Death Race 2000 (1975) which I personally think is a vastly overrated film, it's by no means a bad film but just not as good as many make out &amp; while this remake isn't exactly a masterpiece either I thought it was watchable enough. Apart from the title, the character's of Frankenstein &amp; Machine Gun Joe &amp; the racing of cars this remake has almost nothing in common with the original which saw the contestants race across American running innocent people down for points, here the action is confined to a prison where inmates are forced to take part in the race which is broadcast worldwide. In some way Death Race has more in common with the Arnold Schwarzenegger film The Running Man (1987) in which he is also sent to prison &amp; forced to take part in gladiatorial style games which are broadcast live. So Death race is part action film, part thriller, part reality television satire &amp; part prison film. For what it is Death Race is quite good, there are enough explosions, car stunts &amp; fights to keep most action junkies happy &amp; there's just about enough plot here to maintain ones interest when there's nothing being blown up. It's never made clear why Hennessey chose Ames or quite what Hennessey gets out of the race (Money? Power? Both?) &amp; she gets a weak send-off too despite being the main villain.While the plot of Death Race isn't much to write home about there are some good action scenes that maybe feel like a computer game too much (the icons the cars have to drive over for power-ups in particular, the announcer &amp; on screen leader board also) but there are enough screeching tyres, explosions, crashes &amp; near misses to to satisfy. The film doesn't look particularly futuristic &amp; the cars look rather tatty at times but the gritty, dirty look was probably intentional.With a supposed budget of about $45,000,000 this was filmed in Montréal in Québec in Canada. The acting is alright, Jason Statham is his usual likable action hero self, Ian McShane seems a strange choice while Joan Allen is wasted.Death Race is a watchable enough futuristic action thriller that delivers just about enough to please without ever really excelling, I quite liked it but wouldn't want to watch it again. Followed by the straight to video Death Race 2 (2010) while it was also ripped-off in the utterly awful Death Racers (2008).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul WS Anderson takes Roger Corman's cheap and cheerful exploitation action black comedy from the 70s, rewrites a variation of the Running Man movie into the script, loads up with industrial quantities of ordnance and explosives, and lets 'er rip.Ace driver Jason Statham ends up in jail in the near future, framed for killing his wife, and is press-ganged into driving in a televised high-earning car race, the popularity of which is based on lots of deaths. The race is manipulated by prison governor Hennessy (a reptilian Joan Allen, slumming it, but adding a touch of class nonetheless).There are no surprises in the story (well, maybe there is - at least one character survived who I expected to die), the action is extremely well staged, and the whole thing is big dumb fun. I enjoyed it a lot. In a dumb kind of way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film in All Ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film can be described in one word - awesome. The action and SFX are incredible, and Jason Statham just makes the film tick (for me that's the main problem with Death Race 2). For me though the real genius of the film comes in the underlying current of the corruption and profits of big business. What really made me think in this film was the fact that I think they probably would get that many viewers for a show like that. I'm sorry to say I would watch it.It's my opinion that this film works on 2 levels - flash flash bang for those who just want to sit down and get blown away by effects and pure action (not to mention hot girls!), and then there's the level that can make you ask real questions about our modern world. The way Hennesey (I think that's how you spell it) manipulates people's lives to boost profits and ratings is an extreme example of many things that happen in big business today. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I can honestly say it takes a lot to impress me. There are probably only 3 other films that have ever got me thinking like this one.Can I say well done to the producers. They've made a film that deserves a lot more credit that it seems to have got. I'll be watching and enjoying it for long time to come.PS: Please excuse any missing "a"'s - my keyboard is a bit snickered :/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death Race really surprised me. I was expecting utter garbage but the movie was actually quite watchable and even entertaining. Keep in mind that it's not real heavy on plot, it is an action movie after all. In Death Race Jason Stathem plays a man framed for murdering his wife by a corrupt warden in order to boost ratings for her Death Race, which is basically NASCAR with machine guns, rockets, napalm, and death traps. The drivers are racing for their freedom but the warden isn't keen on letting anyone go. Most of the film is filled with gunfire, explosions, fast cars, and mindless violence of all sorts, but it is rather fun to watch and I must admit I was able to get in to the movie. Don't turn your brain on or the film will completely fall apart on you. Death Race looks and feels very much like a video game, one that I would happily buy (the game, not the movie it is just average after all).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start this review by explaining my rating of 6/10. The race scenes were very fun to watch, but the story was weak in a few places and toward the end it seemed that they were trying to wrap it up a little too fast. the acting was very tolerable as the cast selected seem to fit their characters. I was especially pleased with Joan Allen's performance as the icy warden who is responsible for the creation of death race in the movie.My favorite racer (even though he isn't in the movie too much since he is only is a very minor character) is Hector Grimm. That guy seems to get off on killing during the race more so than the other racers.I strongly recommend this movie for entertainment, especially if you watch it on blu-ray. Don't look for award winning performances from anyone but an enjoyable mindless action movie. The subplot of the story of putting the races on PPV for people to watch convicts battle to the death is a good idea by the writers identifying the sign of the times that people will watch anything on PPV if there is violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I return to my life, which has been co-opted for the last month by posting Halloween movie reviews, I wanted to squeeze in this action picture. I suppose it could be classified as Science Fiction or even Horror, but that might prove a stretch.I loved the original "Death Race 2000." It was hilarious and extremely well done. Not that we would expect anything less from Roger Corman."Death Race" dumps the humor and substitutes action sequences. And while I was very suspicious of this approach, as it appears many others were, the truth is that it works effectively in this context. There are some truly exciting races. Explosions galore. Splatter and mayhem. All the things that make life worth living.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You need the right attitude to appreciate this movie. It's not as dumb as The Fast and the Furious, but it's a lot dumber than the Transporter, and way way dumber than Crank, which I love.The premise is ridiculous, the acting bad, and Joan Allen is not very scary. I'm sorry, Joan. I said the same thing about the Thin Man in Charlie's Angels, and the badguy / robot in Terminator 2. The way they include boobs in the movie... I'm sorry, women, not that they're given anything real to do... is ridickle-dockle also.However, enough stuff blows up for me to be able to appreciate the film. That being said, the ending while a surprise I just didn't find very satisfying. I was really expecting something like Total Recall, a film not quite as corny. You're supposed to react to dystopian worlds by overturning them (Total Recall) or tragically dying (1984, Planet of the Apes), right?Anyway, I gave Death Race a barely 7 out of 10, the lowest rating I'll give a film that I actually enjoyed watching. A good rainy day film unless you're a car enthusiast. And if you have a girlfriend who can withstand this film, marry her!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing I can say about 2008's remake Death Race is it certainly knew what it was and didn't lie about one aspect. The worst I can write about it happens to be attached to one of my favorite actors of all time: Joan Allen. How incredibly miscast and it was an embarrassment to see her here. Her nasty prison character might as well been played by Rosie O'Donnell.That said, I actually enjoyed the feature. I was looking for an action movie I had not seen (and speaking of which, I still have yet to see the original) and I am a huge Jason Statham fan. (Of which, he gets a pass for his role, unlike Allen. Not only does this fit his resume, he did a great job on what he had to accomplish.) Also, I knew what I was getting into. Like I said, it knew it's audience and showed what it needed to, no holds barred. It didn't seek out Oscar buzz or ever attempt to take itself too seriously. But, was it predictable? Yeah. Unoriginal, of course. Horrible dialogue, definitely. But, was it enjoyable for what it was? Absolutely. And on a personal level, this The Fast &amp; the Furious knockoff reminded me a lot of one of my all-time favorite video games: Burnout Revenge. So, it was exciting, for at least me, to watch a live-action version of the races and "secret shortcuts &amp; hidden items" as portrayed in the film.Synopsis: In the far, far, distant future of 2012, there is no economy and privately run prisons run reality shows (originally a gladiator/type fighting ring, possibly a lead-in if they made a prequel) that show a race for freedom, literally. If a prisoner wins five races, or subsequently survives five go-arounds, then he/she will be set free. Wow, whoever said things too good to be true aren't just that? There's just no way they're lying, or that this isn't fixed, or things happen specifically for ratings. I believe in corporations, such as this one exploiting death on humans. They'll never lie or try and be unethical.Along comes Jensen (Statham) minding his own business, trying to make a living off $300 for over a hundred hours of hard labor and caring for his wife and daughter. In another benefit of the movie, they fast forward to the inevitable framed-murder of his wife so Jensen could be sent to this particular prison and race for dame Hennessey (Allen.) In this type of movie, the attention span of the stereotypical macho male who would watch this is, at best, a few seconds long, so it was nice they just plowed through to get him in place to race to the freedom he should have anyways.Now?what everyone waited mere minutes for, the races. They're bloody, fast and as the title indicates deadly. Unfortunately, this is where I felt one of the biggest downfalls. Spoiler: though we're supposed to root for the wrongfully accused Jensen, he kills one prisoner in absolute cold blood. To keep up with this "rooting for" him, it probably would've been better for them to go with the accidental/but just-deserved death of this man. But, I'm guessing they just wanted the audience to get some of his revenge, the barbaric way.Throw in a few "plot twists" hardly any that work, but one did, you have the remainder of the film. Again, a film that, though critically (and apparently audience in reference to box-office) panned is actually good for its target audience.I'll repeat myself, though this is not an award winner, and made specifically for one reason: live-action video game, Allen thoroughly disappointed me. Every great actor has their embarrassments, such as Meryl Streep for She-Devil, Ben Kingsley for A Sound of Thunder (wait, amongst many more, but he's still great,) etc, etc. But here, I just felt there was no excuse. Luckily, I still enjoy her, and always will, in better movies, such as The Bourne 2/3 movies, The Contender and Manhunter.Death Race (2008) isn't for everyone, and usually, this wouldn't be for me either, but for what it was, a mindless slur of action and death (boy, they had zero compassion human life) it's enjoyable as a throw-back. Recommended for the target audience only.</fullReview>

It is also reminiscent of "Running man", starred by Schwarzenegger.The plot is quite silly: world is messed up, economic crisis, Jason S. is a worker in a factory, factory closes. His wife is killed, he is blamed for the crime and incarcerated.He is called to participate in an event broadcasted from the prison to the entire country in which convicts have to race in armed cars. First to win 4 races gets a get-out-of-jail card. The rest is quite predictable.Although mediocre and silly, the movie delivers some action and a dose of black humor.

		<shortDescription>A B-movie with a big budget, just lacking the quality - 64%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been in the mood for something dumb and violent for a while and without thinking too hard, I guessed this would fit the bill. It had Jason Statham topping the bill, it was a remake of cult classic "Death Race 2000" and it had Roger Corman's influence as producer. In fact, it wasn't going to be anything other than a big-budgeted B-movie and I'm happy to report that it is exactly that. But unless you're a fifteen year-old boy who enjoys big bangs of every variety in his films, the chances are that this will turn you off quicker than a power cut. Yes, it's fun but childish and not exactly a classic.Statham plays former racing driver Jensen Ames, living in the near future where chronic unemployment has led to an overcrowded prison population forced into competing in televised Death Races. After being framed for his wife's murder, Ames finds himself taking the place of the masked driver Frankenstein by prison warden Hennessey (a miscast Joan Allen) in the latest race. Assisted by prison mechanic Coach (Ian McShane), Ames must risk his life to win the race and his freedom from the clutches of Frankenstein's arch rival Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson).As deep and meaningful as a teenage boy-band, "Death Race" doesn't pretend to be anything other than an explosive, balls-to-the-wall action flick and to be fair, it does exactly what it says on the box. The races, largely devoid of CG, are genuinely exciting and well staged if a little derivative - machine guns on the bonnet and oil slicks coming out of the back a la James Bond. Performances are also surprisingly competent, led by McShane and Gibson although the less said about Allen as the ball-busting governor, the better. She's about as good for this role as Pierce Brosnan was in "Mamma Mia!" but unless she wanted to avoid being typecast after "The Bourne Ultimatum", I can't see what attracted her to the film in the first place. The film also has a slight comedic edge which only tends to weaken the gritty tone of the film overall instead of making you chuckle with it.However, before you grab your leathers and dash off to buy the DVD, hold your horses. "Death Race" has a number of flaws - it is utterly predictable, filled with unintentionally hilarious dialogue (including a gut-wrenching line from Allen - you know the one if you've seen this film!) and the whole thing is delivered with a raised eyebrow that kinda distracts from the film's otherwise dark tone. But as I've said, nobody would watch this for anything other than big explosions and noisy car crashes and this is what "Death Race" delivers in spades. You don't watch a porn flick for the plot or if you do then you should be locked up. If you're looking for excitement and action then welcome to the party. If you're looking for something clever, a plot that grips from the off, a mystery that keeps you guessing until the end and a wonderful performance for a heavyweight lead actor then look elsewhere. But then again, you knew that already didn't you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death Race is probably Paul W.S. Anderson's best movie, of course that isn't saying much. Although I thought the movie was stupid, and the plot was equally ridiculous I was entertained throughout. Being a fan of the original Death Race 2000 I was expecting to hate this movie, and although it's not as zany or inventive as the original DR2000, it manages to keep the action rolling steady from beginning to end. I wouldn't say it's a "So bad it's good" movie, but Death Race is never dull. Overall I can't recommend a purchase or rental, but if it happens to be on cable and there's nothing else on, Death Race will fill the bill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jason Statham stars as Jensen Ames, an ex-racing star set up by a cruel, cold-hearted warden, Hennessey(Joan Allen, a real cold-blooded monster with no redeeming value whatsoever)for the murder of his beloved wife. Sentenced to her prison, Hennessey offers him a way out if he agrees to take the place of racing legend, Frankenstein, killed intentionally by her unbeknown to him(..although, he later discovers everything, with designs on getting even), in her extremely popular "Death Race" where inmates combat each other on elaborately designed tracks within the fortress(..the prison is located in an isolated island with only a bridge connecting it to the nearest city). Working with "pit crews"(..inmates with expertise in keeping their drivers' vehicles heavily modified/fortified against gunfire and other potentially dangerous arsenal), the drivers compete in a no-holds-barred race where their vehicles can use various items supplied to them(..such as oil, machine guns, napalm, and smoke) against their opponents if they drive across markers whose signals are operated by Hennessey's control room(..if she so wishes, and it does happen, Hennessey can disarm these devices to harm drivers). Jensen uncovers Hennessey's plot to hold him prisoner, going against her promise to release him if he races in Frankenstein's place, and will do whatever it takes to get even.The delicious Natalie Martinez is Jensen's co-pilot, Liz Case, who reveals to him her betrayal of Frankenstein due to Hennessey's orders promising her release if she purposely sabotaged his car. Case will assist Jensen in his desire to get revenge while Hennessey concocts a scheme to kill him. Tyrese Gibson has a flashy role as Machine Gun Joe, a great racer with an attitude who carves a mark in his face after every murder committed by him on the race track..he wishes to get out and needs two more races(..or so he thinks)to have his freedom. Hennessey wants ratings and profits, willing to bend the rules and, through underhanded methods, harm whoever she must in order to succeed. Ian McShane has a plum role as Jensen's crew chief, Coach, providing him with a possible way of escape. Jason Clarke is Hennessey's sadistic guard Ulrich, also behind Jensen's framing, with a smile that cuts right to the bone. Max Ryan is racer Pachenko, the one responsible for knifing Jensen's wife(..using his fingers as a gun, he communicates his horrific deed to Jensen as a taunting method, paying big for his act of teasing).The adrenaline junkie I am sometimes, Paul WS Anderson delivers the pulse-pounding death races with a full-throttle, anything-goes style that hit the spot. I didn't compare this with it's past incarnation, but Death Race has a visual verve and desire to please action junkies who want their car crashes, explosions, and hand-to-hand combats. This is quite the popcorn actioner that will repulse critics who will undoubtedly attack it's willingness to flamboyantly present ultra-violence in enthusiastic ways featuring cartoon characters and races that defy logic in favor of thrilling their target audience. This is a guilty pleasure to me, nothing more or less..100 minutes of unpretentious testosterone, geared towards fans of crazy thugs with colorful personalities, behind the wheel of souped-up vehicles whose armored plated steel reinforcements withstand heavy bullet-fire and damage.Wait until you see Hennessey's massive Dreadnought machine which has a built in tank, chains with spikes, and tires that unleash spinning thrashers that tear through cars, rocket launchers, and gunners firing machine guns. Statham perfectly embodies the modern hero with a cool confidence, his character conveying a determined will to focus on his objective at hand, despite the obstacles in his way and emotions burning inside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small road, big Warrior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With barely recognizable cars and characters with every known personality anomaly, this film is a distant relative of its precursor: "The Road Warrior." The implicit difference is"Death Race" actually has a plot.Given that prison inmates with access to and use of rocket propelled grenades, Gatling guns and napalm is not a strong correctional probability, this film is not a prison cliché. Rather it portrays an innocent man's retaliation for the unspeakable act of framing him for the murder of his wife in order to create entertainment value in "a world gone mad."Jason always pleases as the contemporary tough guy, and Joan is the ultimate alpha female with a diabolical taste for the decadence of amorality fueled by a Cheney-like quest for dirty money at the expense of others.Jason is smarter than she thinks. He quickly unravels her sinewy intent and her conspicuous misuse of power. He deftly eliminates the foes with whom he is surrounded, wheedles the truth and devises a plan to set himself free by playing to her greed and misguided motives.The action, the casting and the directing creates an apt conclusion to a riveting story that kept my attention throughout. Not perfect by any means, I enjoyed it enough to watch it several times, each time more rewarding than the previous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best action in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I have to confess that I'm a major video game freak and it might have something to do with why I like Death Race so much. The plot in two lines (filler plot in brackets): (Jason Statham is framed by someone for killing his wife and is sent to prison) where he is forced to participate in a vehicular race using highly modified and armed classic cars (by the prison's warden who is an evil woman with issues). As you might have already guessed, Death Race's concept isn't the most complex. This, however, doesn't matter. Whatever little story there is is taken care of quickly and about 80% of the movie consists of cool killing machines driving fast and using inventive weaponry and tactics to get rid of their competition.IMDb's trivia on Death Race says that each car cost 250k$-300k$ to modify and it shows. All of the modifications look real and functional and you can't shake the feeling that you are watching Carmageddon the movie. The look and sound of Gatling guns going off and heavy armor taking the punch seem real and spectacular at the same time which is a really good combination. The single most impressive thing in the movie is definitely the huge wagon called Dreadnought which is armed with a harpoon-like weapon and artillery cannons.Vehicles are not the only part of the movie that looks great. The tracks are well designed and the scenery is gritty and almost otherworldly. Factories and rust all over the place kept reminding me of the Unreal and Blade Runner universes.There is not much to say about acting except that it's good enough. Statham pretty much plays what he usually does and Joan Allen plays the heartless witch part well. Ian McShane acts the best of the bunch and makes his minor part memorable.Death Race is so packed with action that I can understand why some people will not like it but if you find yourself often playing games of the racing or action genre then you should give it a shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning With the opening title cards telling us the film is set in a future where the American economy has collapsed, with everything that's going on at the moment, the re-make of 1975's Death Race 2000 presents a grimly prophetic view of the future. It's themes of reality TV going as far showing actual death crashes is also becoming ever more possible, and yet 2008's Death Race is a simple dumb action film. Paul Anderson has presented a typical video game style movie, with Jason Statham as believable an action presence as ever as the man framed for his wife's murder, whose chance at freedom by racing in the titular deadly racing match leads him to discover the real reason behind her death, and it's involvement with the corrupt female warden (Joan Allen.) It's all slick, stylish and polished enough, but none of it leaves much of a lasting impression and is even more of a none event than I personally found the original. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit it right up front: I'm not the biggest fan of Mr. Anderson. I actually didn't enjoy most of his movies. Then I heard, he would remake a "classic" (sort of). Wasn't excited then either. I got more skeptical, when I heard, that the original concept was thrown overboard and the "Death Race" would play out ... in an entirely different way as the original.Since it was the last movie of 2008 Frightfest, I even watched it in theaters (otherwise I'd have rented the DVD/Blu-Ray). Which by the way, might actually be better, because there will be some more angles from the races and other stuff (even unrated if I'm not mistaken). The movie itself is pretty much popcorn fare ... you have Jason Statham playing the leading man, without even sweating, you have your cool characters throwing in a few funny lines here and there and you have your uber-villain. Well what else would you want then, right? This movie is watchable, especially, if you're looking for something that looks good and makes loud noises, without you having to think too much ... well this is a good movie/choice I guess!</fullReview>

However, as the organizer and instigator and perpetrator of a confined Mad-Max-style racing contest called Death Race, during which she won't pull her punches when it comes to dirty tricks, she will get that righteous revenge on herself toward the end of the film, as the protagonists break free from their dystopian gamers' island. Considering the director has directed "Resident Evil" films, this movie is a step in a more authentic and less horrific direction, since every now and then a character in the film appears to be "real" and say also something "real".

This film is no "Deer Hunter" (1978), "Mad Max II" (1981), "Oz" (TV series) or "After the Sunset" (2004) but it has incorporated a bit of each one into itself.

Anderson (of the Resident Evil films) and is a remake of the 1975 release "Death Race 2000", in which ex-nascar driver Jensen Ames (Statham) is framed for the murder of his wife and sent to a prison where the main pastime is watching heavily armoured cars with machine guns bash the living crap out of each other while also being broadcast round the world to generate a nice healthy profit for the head warden. The winner also gets their freedom and in Jensen's case his daughter back as well.As far as action films go this is a fairly decent one if you're expectations aren't too high, which frankly after a lot of recent films mine aren't. There are plenty of spectacular visuals and action shots, lots of pyrotechnics and a good smattering of gore for the more bloodthirsty among you. A few of the scenes are pretty original as well, such as a Chinese woman getting minced by chariot-style wheel spikes through a car door and the use of a large metal shield aka "The Tombstone" to slice a pick-up truck nearly in half and crush one unlucky navigator. Really top notch stuff and is sure to keep your cheeks close to the edge of your seat for most of the duration. I doubt few of you will be disappointed with the pulse pounding racing that is focused on for about 50% of the running time, but the other 50% may be a bit lacking...Allow me to try and convey the tone of this film a little better to you, if I may, by telling you that if you haven't seen it Sylvester Stallone was one of the stars of the original. The essence of most of his films seems to have been spiritually passed on to this younger successor, in that the action is always good, but the rest not so much.The acting in some places can be pretty horrible with Statham actually being the best actor in this picture (and although I do love his films, he's never going to win an Oscar bless his little cotton socks) and the rest of the cast is either completely forgettable or downright embarrassing in the cases of Tyrese Gibson (Machine Gun Joe) and the rest of Statham's pit crew of convicts.One thing that annoyed me slightly about this film was the mandatory inclusion of the massively stereotypical and preposterously corny "Coach" figure. Is it really still necessary in prison films and films in a similar vein to still have a character such as this? Surely not seen as how most of what he does during the film is spew fantastically clichéd one liners and try to come across as all old and wise as these coaches always bloody are. In particular the line "Now that's what I call entertainment!" was close to making me physically wretch because of the overwhelming stench of cheesiness emanating from it.The overall plot of the film, although not as enthralling as I usually like them, can't be faulted too much, as to my surprise it did throw a couple of unexpected twists at me and does provide a couple of nice little sub plots that interlink well throughout and culminate in a grand finale. In particular near the end a fairly unforeseen and downright impossible scenario unfolds that actually left me feeling pretty impressed by the fact that I had no idea it was coming. But even so there is nothing really there to draw you in or allow you to feel too much connection to any of the characters, and the same can be said for the scripting. I guess W.S. Anderson felt giving the characters some growth and depth would get in the way of the RPGs and gory glory of people getting insta-gibed by power sliding trucks.In summation this film is overall pretty decent and if you were a fan of the Twisted Metal series you will love every minute of this film for the sheer amount of automotive destruction and fire power on display. If you were looking for some kind of deep and moving story and breathtaking portrayals of whimsical characters I'd assume you needed help tying your shoes on a morning because you just wont get that here and you'd have t be stupid to expect to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average, and has almost absolutely nothing to do with the original film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1975 a film called Death Race 2000 shocked part of the world. A film where racers raced each other and scored points by running down people. The film became a cult-classic over the years, became the base of a series of computer games (that were met with the same amount of shock by the same parts of the world) and eventually became the base of operations for a new film, this one called Death Race 3000. Two of the names of the original main characters came along. The mask of one of the main characters came along. The concept of racing came along. But quite sadly, it stopped there.Death Race 3000 has as much to do with Death Race 2000 as chickens have to do with milk. In Death Race 3000 the races are held on a prison island and the contestants are prisoners that are riding for their lives and freedom. The races are organized by the somewhat sadistic prison warden that wants to make a rather large amount of money from the races by having them shown on TV. And that is where the story ends, nothing fancy added to it.Which means that all the rest leans on the way the characters are played out and how the races are displayed and it can be said that the first is thin at the most and the latter is OK but nothing more than that. Which makes the ending result of the film to be OK and nothing more than that. It's a nice way of spending an evening if you're into bloodshed and CGI but there are far better things to watch out there.6 out of 10 cult-classics mangled</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but dumb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot compare to the original movie since I didn't see it. From what I've read though, the new one is more politically correct (no hitting civilians for extra points), less over-the-top in general and on a closed circuit instead of cross-country. I found the "remake", if we can call it that, moderately entertaining and far less bad than I expected from what I heard and read. The car races scenes were exciting, even with clever power-up pickups like in video games, but I can't help but feel that a more talented director would have made them much better. Actually, to be more accurate, the car battling was more fun than the secondary car racing. Despite the known weapons, there were some clever and unexpected take-downs.Mostly, I always had the lingering feeling that the behavior of the racers was illogical or dumb. For example, smart drivers who would get shot in the back would just need to slow down and let that shooting car pass them. Is there any real benefit to finishing first, second or third as long as you survive until the next instalment of the race ? There were several mistakes or goofs that took me out of the pictures such as the mechanic with his hand badly crushed with no sign of injury the next day or how the guy manages to catch up instantly with the pack in the second race despite having driven the wrong way and not that fast for several minutes. And also, when the "surprise" arrives in the second race and does its task, if it continued, as the director seems to want, there would be no third leg of the race and so no profit (because the races are pay-per-view). How about the helicopters that continue shooting a car with no rear protection anymore and that car miraculously surviving. Perhaps those are not the best examples (see the list of goofs on IMDb), but it was enough to unsuspend my sense of disbelief. The presentation of the caricatural racers was enjoyable as well as the rest of the pay-for-view TV presentation that makes you wish more had been done with it (and that the race track and cars were more colorful). The buff lead actor, Jason Statham, looked the part and did an adequate job with the script he had. Not much torment detected from losing what he did though. So Death Race is not so bad : fun but dumb.Rating : 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've noticed that lots of people seem to trash Paul W.S. Anderson as a filmmaker, but I think they take him way to seriously. I enjoyed the Resident Evil series, and loved Event Horizon. I even forgive him the abomination that was Alien vs Predator. The guy doesn't make movies that are necessarily exploring deep themes or making grandiose statements, it's entertainment....get over it already.Death Race is kinda like The Shawshank Redemption if there were car chases, mounted machine guns and decapitations in a depressing post-modern, corporately-owned future. There are a few great actors here earning a pretty good paycheck I imagine...anyway, don't expect a great deal of depth in Death Race, however, it is definitely a fun ride. Worth checking out as Jason Statham is definitely the man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ultimate race with freedom as the prize.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson in association with Roger Corman, DEATH RACE is a high-octane hold-on-to your ass thrill ride. Futuristic story of a notorious prison, where the sadistic warden(Joan Allen)forces dangerous prisoners take part in a race of destruction and death with freedom being the coveted prize. The economy is so far down in the crapper the prison makes a major fortune by allowing the world the watch the race of tricked-out cars on the internet. Jensen Ames(Jason Statham) is an ex-con placed in the prison for the sole purpose of taking part in the race of reconstructed cars that are supercharged, heavy armored and loaded to the hilt with war-like weaponry. Super F/X with insane, metal-crushing and death dealing racing to the extended finish line.Adrenaline rush guarantee. A more than fair exchange of big bang for the buck. The cast includes: Ian McShane, Tyrese Gibson, Jason Clarke, Max Ryan and Natalie Martinez.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What bugged me about this is that some of the scenes near the beginning are quite emotionally harrowing. Even in a movie that turns out as silly as this, they have to make it quite upsetting when I guess the original was more superfly fun. Because, let's face it, this movie is about having a blast, watching cars mash up and felons roast in their tin cans - nothing wrong with that, but it's the revenge element of it that makes it more like Face/Off in tone than Con Air.Joan Allen is great as Hennessey, the Nurse Ratched style prison governess. But though the races in the grimy prison colony are televised, you never see the viewers' reactions so it's not quite as satirical as The Running Man. Despite the grimy authenticity at the start, some plot points do stretch credulity towards the final lap, even within the limits of the genre. Stratham, however, is always good value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple well made action flick that offers no false promises about itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Death Race" is a great example of a movie done right. From the promotional posters to the trailer and finally the movie it gives you just what you expect. Thus, if you are not into tough guys beating the living crap out of one another, car chases, explosions, cheesy one liners and some unrealistically beautiful women (they're prisoners?!?!), simply stay away and save yourself the trouble.The result is not really a good movie, but a fun movie. A very fun movie. if you like this sort of thing. "Death Race" doesn't even bother trying to be a realistic movie in that the races themselves are basically video game races where the drivers must get certain pick ups to activate their weapons and different ones for defenses. Essentially this is a video game on screen, and if I recall correctly, there was a computer game from a while back called "Death Race" as well as the Roger Corman movie.In not bothering to cover up its ridiculous and out-right cheesy elements, but embracing them, "Death Race" is much less ridiculous than it would be otherwise. It doesn't offer false promises and delivers exactly what the target audience wants. The only thing that could disappoint is that they only race on one track throughout the entire film. It would have been nice to see some sort of variety, but even so the film remains entertaining. And if you don't find this sort of thing fun, you've been warned... more than once. --- 7/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence, profanity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid action, decent characters, all around good movie...just not mind blowing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another decent attempt at a remake. No I have never seen the original Death Race and although I knew that it was a remake of the 70's cult classic I kind of forgot until I saw the credits. Last year was one of the best years for movies I can ever remember...absolutely brilliant films like Live Free or Die Hard, Mr. Brooks, Transformers, We Own The Night and so forth but this year seems to be kind of a hum drum year with decent solid movies but nothing mind blowing and that is really the exact definition of Death Race. I mean a film about a raging car race between cons in a high security futuristic prison with pimped out weapon-mobiles and with Jason Statham better AT LEAST have impressive action and it does. The races are blindingly action packed and the gritty dark, gory setting of the penitentiary make watching a blast. The characters are all decent as are the actors but really there isn't much of a plot to speak of which makes sense given the idea of the movie. Still the actors are good enough that you want to know more about them, some back story perhaps. It's a very shallow movie with plenty of cool scenes but nothing to really sink your teeth into...mindless I suppose which can be a great fun night at the movies.I became a fan of Jason Statham, like everyone else did, right after The Transporter. Still I don't think he's really had his huge break through role and he should because he is a great star and really fills up the screen and has a commanding presence. Like many action stars he never really strays too far from what he's good at. His character from The Transporter is the same dude in most of his action flicks including innocent framed family man and killer driver with nerves of steel Jensen Ames. Ian McShane is the perfect example why Death Race just wasn't quite mind blowing. McShane himself was amazing. His rough around the edges, soft at heart "Coach" was a great character and he was amazing at it and him and Statham had solid chemistry but there was no story there for Coach. We got a little background but totally shafted in details and I wanted to know more. Still he was terrific. And same with the excellent performance by Jason Clarke as mechanic and helper Ulrich. Great character but a bit of a mystery because he was so nice and seemed so innocent and scared and emotional and yet we got no background at all. Why was he there? Who was he? Why did he seem so different? However Clarke's performance was excellent. A really stand out performance is given by the triple Oscar nominated Joan Allen as the steely warden of the Prison. Her character falls victim to being completely underdeveloped as well but she still is a great villain for the story. There are plenty of other solid performances by the likes Tyrese Gibson and Natalie Martinez, but they are even more underdeveloped characters.Director and writer Paul W.S. Anderson has done some of the best worst movies in Hollywood. He has single handedly been involved in Mortal Kombat (the movie) but didn't have anything to do with the deplorable second installment, he directed the first Resident Evil which was a kick butt movie, and did Alien vs Predator the first one which was also a solid action movie. So he is a talented director but his talent seems to be to do decent movies and not incredible movies. He can tell a story but he uses action scenes, and fast pace plots instead of taking the time to develop his characters. Death Race definitely fits in with his style because the movie is fun and easy to watch and will leave you wanting more...a lot more...there isn't any depth and that is it's sole mistake. So for an action flick with no brains and nothing to think about then you should definitely check out Death Race and we'll see where Paul Anderson takes us for movies like Castlevania and Spyhunter...maybe he should team up with Uwe Boll? 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't go expecting a "Running Man" type commentary on prisons, the media or the public's thirst for blood. This movie was a straight up action movie with jaw-dropping REAL car effects. (If there was CGI, it was too damn good to rip me out of the picture). The cast was surprisingly good for what could've been a disaster movie. Every star in the pic seemed to not only get their character and get the movie, but they also were having fun with it. And when they're having fun, I'm having fun. Plot? In the VERY near future, prisons let inmates race to the death for their freedom. Statham is an ex-racer who is framed for a murder in order to be incarcerated and forced to take part in the Death Race.Also, if you want to relive the glorious Roger Corman films of your youth, forget it. No comedy here. (But Carradine makes a cameo!!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Adequate Popcorn Picture for People With An Appetite for Big, Dumb, Action Epics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Resident Evil" director Paul W.S. Anderson's "Death Race," a mean-spirited remake of the campy carmageddon classic "Death Race 2000" (1975) with David Carradine, lacks the imaginative of its predecessor but has its share of exciting scenes. "Death Race 2000" depicted a nationally sanctioned, no-holds-barred, coast-to-coast marathon where motorists racked up points for hitting pedestrians. Whereas director Paul Bartel's "Death Race 2000" amounted to a cheesy political satire, Anderson's straight-forward remake is an exercise in sadism that confines its race to an island prison with no innocent bystanders to kill. This nihilistic, R-rated, nonsense boasts a bigger budget, souped-up special effects, and a stellar cast led by lean, mean Jason Statham whose six-pack ripped physique is covered with tattoos. A bullet-riddled, testosterone-driven, high-octane fueled, B-movie motor rally extravaganza, "Death Race" not only pays tribute to the unforgettable Carradine classic but also pays tribute to "The Condemned," "The Running Man," "Escape from Alcatraz," "Goldfinger," and "Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior." "Death Race" takes place in the year 2012 after the U.S. economy has collapsed. Unemployment and crime rage out of control. The government has sold all prison over to the private sector. At Terminal Island, for example, the prison administration began broadcasting pay-per-view cage fights. Audiences, however, lost interest in them, so evil Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen of "The Bourne Supremacy") created a lethal, closed circuit car race. Each auto bristles with guns, rockets, and explosives like those in "Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior." The undisputed racing champ is an indestructible legend called Frankenstein. We never get a glimpse of Frankenstein's face, but David Carradine provides the voice. Carradine portrayed Frankenstein in "Death Race 2000." The infamous Frankenstein has been injured so often that he wears a mask. As the action unfolds, Frankenstein dies in a spectacular crash, but Warden Hennessey keeps his death a closely-guarded secret. Some 45 million viewers pay between $99 and $250 to watch Hennessey's three day death race, and she isn't about to jeopardize her high ratings with news about Frankenstein's death.Hennessey dispatches her vilest inmate, Pachenko (Max Ryan of "Kiss of the Dragon"), to track down former NASCAR driver Jenson Ames. Pachenko stabs Ames' wife Suzy (Janaya Stephens) to death and frames the unsuspecting Jenson for her murder. Six months later, Ames (Jason Statham) draws a life sentence and Hennessey pulls strings to land him on Terminal Island. Terminal Island resembles Alcatraz, except a bridge links it with the mainland. Hennessey convinces Ames to don Frankenstein's mask. Hennessey promises to release Jensen if he impersonates Frankenstein and wins one more race. Jenson had a baby daughter Piper, and the despicable Hennessey holds Piper's welfare over Jenson's head. Nevertheless, Hennessey plants an explosive charge under Jensen's car in case he tries to double-cross her.Coach (British actor Ian McShane of HBO's "Deadwood" with his sinister raccoon eyebrows) and his multi-cultural crew maintains Frankenstein's Ford V-8, fastback Mustang that shares many features with James Bond's Aston-Martin. Hennessey imports buxom babes from a nearby women's prison to serve as navigators for the drivers on an elaborate race course that she has laid out on the prison's premises. Frankenstein's closest rival, Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson of "2 Fast 2 Furious"), is a pugnacious black homosexual who draws his navigators from the prison's all male population. Machine Gun has triumphed in three races. Joe needs only two more wins before he can obtain his freedom and retire to Miami. The problem is that the treacherous Warden Hennessey hates to keep her word to anybody."Death Race" wallows in violent, anti-social behavior. Armor-plated automobiles careen through the prison grounds with desperate drivers blasting away at each other with rockets and machine guns galore. Life in cheap in Terminal Island and the most perfidious person at the prison is Warden Hennessey who abhors profanity but spouts her fair share. Unfortunately, this predictable story has been retreaded so often that the complications outnumber the surprises. Whereas Paul Bartel's "Death Race" was funny but ferocious, Anderson's spin is simply ferocious with characters scheming to defeat their rivals. The hero, Jenson Ames, wins our sympathy on two counts. He has an infant daughter and we know that Pachenko framed him for his wife's murder. Everybody else on Terminal Island hasn't a shred of dignity. The guards are baton-wielding sadists and Warden Hennessey rivals Linda Fletcher's Oscar winning turn as Nurse Ratched in the Jack Nicholson masterpiece "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." Clocking in at a ballistic 89 minutes, "Death Race" runs only marginally longer than its 82-minute predecessor. Anderson never squanders a second and delivers thrills, chills, and a surprise or two along the way. Unfortunately, he seems to have set his sights lower with this formulaic $45 million epic after helming superior sagas such as "Resident Evil" and "AVP: Alien Vs. Predator." While the "Death Race" women aren't the primary focus of the plot, Anderson has cast talented Joan Allen as a sadistic, domineering prison warden. She rules her realm with an iron hand and a double-barreled, sawed-off shotgun concealed in the knee-hole of her desk. "Death Race" suffers from at least one inconsistency. A warning sign on the wall of the prison dining hall proclaims the warning that no warning shots will be fired. When the guards quell a fight between Jensen and Pachenko, they warn them that they will fire. Nevertheless, despite its flaws, "Death Race" qualifies as an adequate popcorn movie for people who love big, dumb, action epics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of fun... if you don't think about it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summertime is well-known for trotting out the big action films and "Death Race" was certainly no different, in the summer of 2008. The basics of the plot are a pretty well-traveled affair and none of the actors does any real stretching beyond their character's needs. From Joan Allen's "ballbuster" warden, to Jason Statham's "hard-ass" hero, to Ian McShane's "Yoda-like" veteran inmate, nothing new, innovative or different is brought out.Of course, no one really sees films like this for deep and meaningful performances. It's all about the action and this one gives you plenty of it. The car battles are done exceedingly well. You actually feel like you are in the vehicle, as the action unfolds. The stunts on the track are pretty much what you expect. If you like to watch fast cars and big explosions, this film will not fail you.One of the things that's interesting about this film, is exactly how it is connected to Roger Corman's cult classic "Death Race 2000." Originally, this was to be a sequel, with futuristic floating cars, like out of "Back to the Future Part II," but the expense forced that to be changed. The film's writer/director, Paul W.S. Anderson, has said that this is meant as a prequel to Corman's film, but since this takes place AFTER the time period of it, I find that hard to swallow.So, for myself, I see it as an updated remake, which I normally find very putrid, since most remakes are of films that are already good on their own. But "Death Race" is of that rare breed, where the remake can be taken on it's own and enjoyed, without it being disrespectful to the previous version. Something made much easier, by the guest voicing of (the late) David Carradine as "Frankenstein" (the same character he played in Corman's classic original).So, while "Death Race" isn't a film that will leave you pondering deep philosophical questions about life and humanity, it manages to pack in plenty of thrills and action that one comes to expect of the typical summer flick. It's simply big, dumb fun and very re-watchable! What every action blockbuster aspires to be. It is sure to appeal to the 14-year old in every guy.</fullReview>

Bone- crunching, fast-paced, hyper-violence served in whiplash fashion by director Paul W.S. Anderson makes for a B-movie guilty pleasure and doesn't hurt with easy-on-the-eyes newcomer Martinez as the bodacious seat cover of Statham's.

		<fullReview>It is uncommon for a film to come out with so many errors and ending up to be likable. Death Race is one of those films. The acting is cheesy, the stunts and action are over-the top and can possibly violate the basic principles of Physics, and there are so many inconsistencies that cannot be explained.SO WHAT?? When you see an action film starring Jason Statham, no matter what, you get what you paid for. Death Race is cool, heart-thumping, mindless fun. And it's proud of it. Tough guys, fast cars, big guns, hot girls, blood spewing, cars flipping, what's not to like in this film? Jason Statham is Jason Statham, no comments. The rest of the cast is good, with hottie Natalie Martinez providing some eye candy for the prisoners (and the audience, for that matter!). Ian McShane is likable as the gruff Coach. The scene stealer her is Joan Allen, who, after seeing her act in serious-type movies, is seen having a blast acting as a sadistic warden b*tch. Clearly, it look like she enjoyed the change of pace.Need I remind you that the film is directed by schlock-master Paul W. S. Anderson, who gave us the disappointing "AvP: Alien vs. Predator". Before then, his films were just plain mediocre, like "Resident Evil". Not anymore. I want him to make more films like this. It's films like this that appeals to the fanboys and make us drooling and coming for more. This is no doubt Anderson's best film so far.So if you like mindless action and mayhem, this film is for you. This film is like "Commando", you go to see it knowing what it is and ended up walking out satisfied.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall value: 6.5/10Delton</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie is looking into the eye of a metal storm. It's every car chase you've ever seen on steroids--especially ones staged underneath an elevated train, like in 'The French Connection.' Plus Baghdad or Falluja. 'Death Race' isn't just a race, it's a full-on battle. The cars are shooting automatic weapons and throwing napalm and smoke and oil at each other, while being fired upon from outside by employees of the prison where it all takes place.These drivers are the worst of the worst, the baddest of the baddest, prisoners who'll risk death to gain release. It's some time in the not so distant future when America has had economic and moral mega-meltdowns. All penal institutions are run by private companies for profit (not much of a stretch). Joan Allen is Hennessy, a steely, smirking super Warden masterminding a battle to the death of 800-horsepower hot rods covered in steel armor-plating driven by muscular baddies (among them Jason Strathem as"Jensen Ames," a fired steelworker/former race driver falsely convicted of killing his wife, and Tyrese Gibson as "Machine Gun Joe," Jensen's nemesis/ally in the race). With the drivers, except Joe is gay so he gets a guy partner, to further turn on the story's paying online subscription audience, are luscious-babe prisoners as navigators. Jensen is assigned Case, played by the irresistible and authentically luscious Natalie Martinez of TV's "Fashion House" and "Saints and Sinners." Paying customers online, whose dough is the ostensible reason for all this mayhem, surrender $99 a stage or $250 for the whole game to receive 75 selectable online camera feeds, and at its peak subscription there's an audience for the Death Race of 70 million people. Think how lucky we are: we only have to pay twelve dollars. And think of the filmmakers' fantasy--crap like this making literally billions in a single afternoon.It's just good clean noisy down-and-dirty maniac killer fun. It's also, as the opening of the movie points out, a replay of the gladiatorial events of the Roman Empire in its days of decline. Even more, though, it's based on a movie called Death Race 2000 (actually released in 1975)--for no franchise-ready movies are ever original. And more even than it's like that, Death Race is conceived and structured like, and looks like, a 90-minute gonzo video game. "W.S.," the British-born director (Brits the ace schlockmeisters of today's Hollywood), is a specialist in "VG to movie" adaptations and has had something to do with same for Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, Spyhunter, Castlevania--most notably Resident Evil, which is going into its fourth episode.For sure there are what's called in the opening credits "Visual Effects," but the car racing/crashing is authentic, or authentic-looking enough, for there to be a warning at the film's end: These stunts, it says in one way or another, were performed under controlled conditions with professional drivers. Don't try this at home! Gee, you mean some of this is, like, actually real? Probably not a good idea to drive your car over 35 mph for 24 hours after watching this, if you're suggestible at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've noticed that lots of people seem to trash Paul W.S. Anderson as a filmmaker, but I think they take him way to seriously. I enjoyed the Resident Evil series, and loved Event Horizon. I even forgive him the abomination that was Alien vs Predator. The guy doesn't make movies that are necessarily exploring deep themes or making grandiose statements, it's entertainment....get over it already.Death Race is kinda like The Shawshank Redemption if there were car chases, mounted machine guns and decapitations in a depressing post-modern, corporately-owned future. There are a few great actors here earning a pretty good paycheck I imagine...anyway, don't expect a great deal of depth in Death Race, however, it is definitely a fun ride. Worth checking out as Jason Statham is definitely the man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A WiseGuy's Review: Fast-paced, action/violence filled, non-stop high-adrenaline extravaganza</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M/25/Detroit - I knew exactly what to expect when going into this movie: lots of mindless action, and that's what I wanted. But this movie went way beyond those expectations. I'm no paid movie critic and I know this is not Oscar material, but I thought this flick had a terrific story behind it. You figure there's going to be many repetitive car scenes and it will get boring after awhile. Not the case at all. There's a specific energy that precedes each race, something new to root for and see in each battle.If anything I wish there had been a little more gore, but don't get me wrong there's enough to go around, as well as tons of violence. I don't know why everyone keeps exploiting the erotic side of the movie. There's no nudity, the women get a nice music video-type entrance and that's it for the sexual side of it.Death Race is simply a face-paced, action/violence filled, decently storied, non-stop high-adrenaline extravaganza. When you throw in an action star like Jason Statham into a recipe like this, you know you are going to get some exciting fireworks. I don't know if my expectations were too low or not but this movie, at least for a huge movie goer like me who loves action, horror, gore and comedy, this flick delivered in a big way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's wrong with you people?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I swear that if a movie comes out that doesn't have a comic-book, novel, video game background or isn't a sequel or prequel to another movie, the public just hates for some reason. Apparently, it's not Hollywood that has lost its sense of originality, it's the fact that original movies end up getting put down by the audience. "Death Race" is one of those movies. Though it's loosely based on the bloody, gritty "Death Race 2000" released back in the day, it has nearly no connection what-so-ever. D.R.2000 dealt with maniacs in cars killing pedestrians and earning points, Death Race deals with maniacs in cars killing each other, and boy, I haven't seen car chases and combat this intense since the severely-underrated "Speed Racer" movie.The movie begins with a very epic battle between two Death Race rivals: Frankenstein and Machine Gun Joe. Well, Frank doesn't last long. The movie then cuts away to the main character Jensen, a working man who has a troubled car-racing past. He's trying to live his life $300 a month to support his wife and baby daughter, until a masked man kills his wife and leaves Jensen with the knife. The police assume it's Jensen who killed her and drags him away to Terminal Prison. It is here that Jensen is forced to take up the role of Frankenstein to appease the fans of the Death Race, a "$99-per-stage or $250-for-whole-season" show in which racers kill each other with a very well scripted "Swords, shields, and death heads" segments that allows the drivers to use their offensive or defensive weapons or activate traps.Honestly, people seem to hate Jason Statham movies just because he starred in "In the Name of the King" by Uwe Boll, and look over his Transporter movies and Crank, in which the movies were very action-filled and were excellent popcorn movies. Jason Statham now perfects his gritty role-playing and is very believable. The toils between Jason and Tyrese Gibson's character Machine Gun Joe really reveal the rivalry Joe feels towards Frankenstein (not knowing Jensen has taken up the role in the old Frank's place) and help motivate the story forward. You also have Ian McShane's character, Coach, who spurts out clever lines and pulls off one of the movie's most audience-satisfying surprises.But it's all about the car battles, the Death Race. There's 3 stages and whoever comes out on top in 5 races earns their freedom, but the cruel prison warden Joan Allen's character Hennessey sees only one thing in the drivers: Money, and she'll stop at nothing to make sure that's exactly what she gets. Joan does an amazing job. I mean, you forget early in the movie that she's just an actress, just like Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson. The first lap is weapon-less, where drivers have to worry about shortcuts and ramming dents into their enemies' armor.Lap 2 is where hell is let loose, where the sword, shield, and death head buttons are activated and the plot uses these buttons to win the movie some of its best moments. Remember the scene in The Dark Knight where Batman caused a whole pick-up truck to flip over? Well, you'll definitely remember the scene in Death Race where a missile-launching machine-gun-heavy 50-caliber-pumping truck gets slammed into a series of spikes and flips through the air to end in a very satisfying explosion. The audience in my theater were cheering.A well-written script, beautiful acting, heart-pounding races, and no-holds-barred combat really make Death Race stand out. It's one of those movies that the public doesn't like for some stupid reason and is under-appreciated in nearly every aspect. For me, I don't care that I missed the matinée price. This movie was well worth $7.50 and is definitely worth a purchase in the future. For all the naysayers out there, stop putting this movie alongside "Name of the King" and "Transporter" because it is very well Jason Statham's best movie ever.</fullReview>

Sex sells, death sells; sex and death - great combo. Maybe an impalement or two, severed head, gunshot wounds, etc on a couple of the chicks. 2) Although most of the one-liners were spot on, the dialogue prior to the final race installment was too cheesy and unnecessary:case (to frank): "do what you do best...drive"coach: "this is going to be interesting" 3) I would have ended the movie right after the last explosion/comment by "coach". That last bit was a little too corny/unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very interesting failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard not to compare and contrast this film with Paul Bartel's original effort, but the latter actually was a better made film. The premise of both movies--bread and circuses for a bloodthirsty populace via Authority--is a fascinating subject. With the original movie, this became a very brightly colored and violent cross-country chase. With this film, you get a NASCAR version of Gitmo where a big budget offers a very slow and boring film compared to Corman and Bartel's much-cheaper and much more fun effort.This Death Race is boring as hell. The movie ping-pongs between three action sequences and a ton of character development so poorly written that it has to be seen to be believed. With ideas openly stolen from Rollerball, Escape from New York, and even B-fests like The Last Chase, one would think that Paul W.S. Anderson would make a film that took all of those concepts and bundled them into the ultimate action film. A fun film that would keep people involved.Yet this does not happen. Statham tries his best with what he has, along with McShane. But they are not given much to work with. The film fails to even delight the gorehound by having approximately three gore shots throughout the film. The film fails the action fan by being so poorly edited that interest is lost during the action sequences. And sometimes the acting of Joan Allen is so awful that the extreme lack of characterization that she has makes it hard to take her character seriously. It's hard to see exactly how a movie made today's technology could manage to be so utterly boring. It is beaten by the gore and the nudity of the original that is nearly forty years old at this point.And in the end, that's all that can be said. When your $45 million movie is outclassed by a smaller and more graphic movie that had the guts to run down children and old people, then you know you have failed. This could have been something special.Truly tragic on how this movie utterly fails.</fullReview>

This film, unlike so many, delivers exactly what coming attractions drew me to expect--fast pacing, minimalist plot (not a bad thing in this genre), under-spoken hero, villains with big black hats, and enough voluptuousness to sate the testosterone rushes. And of course there are homages to so many precursors, starting with Corman's original "Death Race 2000", on to "Mad Max", and ending with "Death Proof". So back to my first thoughts... Just where can I get videos of Natalie's TV series appearances in "Saints and Sinners" and "Fashion House"?</fullReview>

Oh yes, the prison is privately owned by a TV company. Various obstacles are put in their path. Does this not sound like a certain Arnold Schwarzenegger film called "The Running Man" (1987). Also the prisoners end up dying if they cant escape. From a plot point of view ***YAWN***. I cant speak for everyone, nor would I, but I am getting very bored with films like this. I appreciate they have a new (younger) audience, but can they not wow their audience with a real plot without the need of special effects to blind the viewer from seeing a remake of an old film. As for the filming and Special effects, Yes these are very good. Plot wise, night night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i saw the poster i was expecting something else. I thought that this was an out and out sci-fi thriller ... it really disappointed me. The story goes around the hero (ames) where Jason Statham has given an OK performance .. the weak point of this film is that it is not gripper enough... it reminds me of Micheal Bay movie"the island" which is similar to this movie.... but the former was more racy with wonderful car chases... but this movie lacked lot of story especially and the special effects is also not very impressive.... When it comes to the music i find it very hard to digest... OK the overview is this that i will give this a 5/10 rating for its breathtaking sequences (only few). Lets come to the character artists .. well they did a great job and especially coach (ian) was fit for that character... conclusion: don't waste your time and money either watch the fast and furious from your DVD rack....!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** This review is courtesy of Fundulgence.com - the One to watch. It also featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds and York. ***Dubious director Paul WS Anderson has taken a break from his constant stream of ropey video game adaptations (the Resident Evil series, Dead or Alive, Mortal Kombat and the forthcoming Castlevania) to remake the controversial 1975 sci-fi Death Race 2000. If you've seen the trailer, you'll know the score. In the not too distant future, reality TV has taken its natural course with viewers demanding much more for their licence fee. Last man standing Racing tournaments are set up that throw convicted felons into armoured killing machines for the amusement of bloodthirsty spectators; if you watch this film? you're one of them! Former racing driver Jason Statham is framed for his wife's murder and forced into the driving seat. If he wins he gets his freedom, if he loses ? well, the clue's in the title, and it does exactly what it says on the tin. "Faithful to computer game conventions..." The film takes a no frills approach to the vehicles ? it may be set in the future but these are hardcore stock cars geared up to deal out and stand up to masses of explosive punishment. The film is all the better for this approach, rather than opting for a glossy CGI take on the races (remember Speed Racer?). The sensation of speed and crunching collisions are cranked up and hammered with a savage arsenal of bullets, missiles, napalm, oil slicks and the traditional Bond-esquire wheel spikes. CG is used for the future sport league table format, which suits the tone well, and oddly, the film feels faithful to computer game conventions, even though this is one of the few films that Anderson has directed that isn't based on a game. "More tattoos than your average death metal band?" Nobody's going to be winning any Oscars for their performances in Death Race, but Statham is suited to the meat-headed con seeking vengeance; he's hard as nails, built like a brick out-house and has more tattoos than your average death metal band. He's more than capable of holding his own in a prison full of multiple murderers, though he's far too apathetic when the story attempts to inject any emotion into his role. Ian McShane (TV's Lovejoy!) plays the archetypal wise old crim that's far too institutionalised to ever leave prison, and he's responsible for all of the lethal bells and whistles on the sooped-up Mustang, as well as adding a touch of humanity to the proceedings. "?the only grey matter involved is being wiped off the windscreen" Death Race is a Testosterone fuelled destruction derby of a film. It has a functional plot, a cast of 2D characters, a Hip-hop/Metal hybrid soundtrack, and a range of comically gruesome fatalities. It has no pretensions and the only grey matter involved in watching the film is the stuff that's being wiped off the windscreens of the Mad Max inspired vehicles rampaging round the track. It's Anderson's best film since Event Horizon (which admittedly, doesn't say a lot) and it's brutal, well executed carnage that may just tide you over until it becomes a reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my idea of 'popcorn'-thrill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to dutch reviews, this movie was not amazing, but not horrible either. Just a 'popcorn'-thrill ride like Transformers etc.I like Jason Statham even though he is not such a great actor, I like his attitude and charisma, which was the main reason for seeing this movie (and the expectation of lots of explosions and high speed action).I was not prepared for Gore-ish scenes, like the exploding head of 'Grimm' or the napalm burning of Travis Colt for instance, which were repeated over and over again. That is not my idea of a typical 'popcorn'-thrill ride. When the first half of the movie was over, I seriously thought about going home, but having spend ? 20,- on cinema tickets I decided to endure, hoping that the 2nd half would not include as much gore. The first half also lacked any character development: At that time the 'evil' characters were not developed yet, so whenever any of the drivers gruesomely died in the first race, I kinda felt sad for these needless deaths. Only at the death of Pachenko I thought 'Good riddance' and the death of 14K (and the others during the 2nd race when battling the 'dreadnought'), were acceptable losses to increase the evilness of the race itself and 'Hennessey', but this was already during the 2nd half of the movie.Fortunately during the 2nd half the movie became much more entertain-able: The gore lessened, but the action increased with some interesting plot changes. Characters finally got some attention making it easier to be compassionate with the good guys and relieved when the nasty ones found their justice.My overall opinion: - The gore level is a bit too high for my taste, even though this becomes more acceptable during the 2nd half of the movie. Next time I just watch Die Hard 4.0 if I want to experience some thrilling popcorn action. - Characters lack development in the first half of the movie. During the second half of the movie some characters finally do get developed. -/+ Average acting. + Interesting story/plot + Lots of action, but it does get slightly repetitive: emptying mini-guns on thick armor plating multiple times every race does get repetitive. Perhaps a more variety of weaponry would have been more interesting (Flamethrowers, Hydraulic hammers/battering rams or something) + Jason Statham is just cool :)</fullReview>

But I love her more than anyone else possibly could. In the end, that's all that matters. " Jason Statham leads the cast of an action-thriller set in the post-industrial wasteland of tomorrow, with the world's most brutal sporting event as its backdrop. A penitentiary full of felons has inspired the jailers to create a grisly pastime ripe for lucrative kickbacks. Now, adrenalized inmates, a global audience hungry for televised violence and a spectacular arena come together to form the 'Death Race.' Three-time speedway champion Jensen Ames (Statham) is an expert at survival in the harsh landscape that has become our country. Just as he thinks he has turned his life around, the ex-con is framed for a gruesome murder he didn't commit. Forced to don the mask of the mythical driver Frankenstein--a crowd favorite who seems impossible to kill--Ames is given an easy choice by Terminal Island's warden (Joan Allen): suit up or rot away in a cell.His face hidden by a metallic mask, one convict will be put through an insane three-day challenge. Ames must survive a gauntlet of the most vicious criminals in the country's toughest prison to claim the prize of freedom. Driving a monster car outfitted with machine guns, flamethrowers and grenade launchers, one desperate man will destroy anything in his path to win the most twisted spectator sport on Earth.The ultimate man-film of 2008 and Paul WS's best work ever. I was never really a fan of him when he made AvP and all his other works were so-so so I admit I kind of underestimated the guy on this one but still I was gonna give it a try but I didn't set the bar too high so I won't end up disappointed but in the end, I must say I enjoyed 'Death Race' a lot.Forget the plot, forget character development and continuity just as long as there's exploding cars, exploding people and hot chicks and we're all good to go. 'Death Race' is exactly like that video game Twisted Metal where the cars have guns and these cars blow other cars to bits.Jason Statham is slowly building his reputation as a bonafide action star, Tyrese Gibson is widening his career range from loud mouth to trash talking' loud mouth and Joan Allen saying the F-bomb is priceless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is a NASCAR driver. Convicted of killing his wife (which he didn't do) he's sent to Terminal Island Prison, where the warden Hennessey (Joan Allen) has set up a competition where the convicts can race cars in order to gain freedom. Needing a boost to ratings the warden has brought Ames in to compete.In order to race the drivers need navigators, hotties brought in from the local womens prison. Case (Natalie Martinez) is introduced to Ames as his navigator/love interest. She's also the ex-partner of the last champion Frankenstein. Can Ames win the races, get his freedom and get his daughter back? Paul W. S. Anderson hasn't had the best run in Hollywood. In my opinion the last good film he made was 'Event Horizon' back in 1997. Since then its been dross after dross. Although 'Death Race' isn't brilliant it shows he can make a good film. I was initially sceptical about the film, being a fan of the original 'Death Race 2000'. Although David Carradine has a cameo as Frankenstein (in honour of the role he had in the original) the two films have no connection apart from the similar titles.Statham plays the role of tough survivor well. It's a role he seems to keep getting in Hollywood and plays to his strengths. Although I'd love it if he'd done all the (brilliant) driving work himself most of it seems to be stunt drivers. The inclusion of the hot girls seems a stretch too far. Obviously the film would have been too homoerotic if it was just guys, but sometimes you need to keep things simple. The support cast, including Ian McShane do well with the thin dialogue and obvious plot twists.The action and driving sequences are probably the best part of the movie. Although you'll have seen most of it done before, here Anderson has gone to town and the action scenes save the movie from being an utter disaster.Popcorn action. If you don't take the film too seriously then you should enjoy it. Not a patch on the original, but the best thing Anderson has put out in ten years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was this the video game or the movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Jason Statham is by now one of the biggest action stars in the world. He reminds me of a young Bruce Willis, although he's had his share of hits and misses. Death Race is what I would call a critical disaster, because it has nothing but action and carnage. This thing is thin on everything - plot, story, acting, characters, etc. But what else would you expect from a movie with a title like Death Race? It's fast, loud, vulgar, and violent, and as far as I'm concerned that's all that it promises. Works for me.It seems that in the distant future, the American economy is in shambles, inflation is through the roof, and things have gotten so bad with prison over-crowding that, now that they're run for profit by private corporations, they have resorted to allowing inmates to kill each other off in webcasted death races. And by "distant future," of course, I mean that the movie takes place in far-off 2012. If nothing else, Death Race certainly has little faith in whoever will turn out to be our next president.My problem with the movie is that it leaves you with the feeling that a better movie is taking place outside the prison. The movie is essentially an advertisement for the inevitable video game, so I'm willing to accept the ludicrous premise about giving our most hardcore future- criminals heavily armed, high-powered vehicles, but I'm more interested in seeing what's going on in America where the United States military has decided that the best use for their mounted machine guns, laser-guided, armor-piercing RPGs, rocket launchers, and nothing less than napalm, would be to put them in the hands of prison inmates so they can kill each other off for the purpose of online entertainment.But therein you have your message to America about the American economy and our place in the world. Our economy has crashed, so clearly we're no longer the world's #1 superpower. The races are sold to the public for a whopping $250 per race (which, given our economic situation, must be a mostly foreign audience), and since they regularly pull in tens of millions of viewers, evidently America has been reduced in the world to a source of violent entertainment.Then again, I'm probably reading far too deeply into the material than was intended. They do, after all, bus in teams of stunningly hot female co-pilots for no decipherable reason. I'm not sure which is a more dangerous thing to bring in to a prison, rocket launchers and napalm or hot women.But of course what really matters is the cars and the carnage and there's plenty of both. Many of the modifications make no sense, like the 6-inch steel armor plate on the back of Statham's Mustang, which must weigh double what the car weighs, but for full-throttle violence and mayhem you can hardly do better than this.But if there is one thing that I'll have a hard time forgiving the movie for, it's the way the weapons are activated. Joan Allen made a surprising career decision in taking a major role in this movie, which leaves her little to do except be a cold, heartless wench and call for manhole-sized buttons on the track to be turned on and off. Sort of like the little prizes and things that you have to run over on the track in order to get enhanced weapons.The similarity to old Nintendo games is a little too much for comfort. Also, remember how if you hit one of those little oil patches your car would go spinning wildly into the wall? That happens here, too.Ultimately the movie raises an interesting moral debate, whether or not it's worth it to give violent criminals a chance to win their freedom if they manage to bring some money into the ailing economy and kill off a few of their fellow hardened criminals in the process.The movie is basically The Fast and the Furious without all the shiny prettiness of it. The cars are not high-powered speed-racers, they are assault weapons with wheels and untold horsepower, and aesthetic appeal is unimportant compared to sheer power of destruction. I was a little disappointed to see that the movie didn't have the narrative drive of something like Crank or The Transporter, it's a watered down version of Statham's past movies.He's got a tremendous screen presence, showcased best in Snatch, I think, but all he's given to do here is look angry behind the wheel and periodically kick the crap out of some skinheads. You may rediscover that you enjoy seeing white supremacists get their asses kicked, and if you are interested in deadly car racing you may enjoy this one. But given that most half-baked action flicks of this variety tend to spawn endless sequels (4 Fast 4 Furious is on its way, for example), I just hope that Death Race 2: Full Throttle takes place on the mainland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. Sure the acting was so-so, and the whole premise was WAY over the top, but still...In a lot of ways it was kinda sorta like watching a mashup of Mario Kart, Twisted Metal, and Speed Racer.And yes, you may even leave the theatre wondering how in the world these cars even moved with all of the armour and armament that was attached to them...And you may even wonder to yourself exactly how the ending happened (which was kinda loosely explained, but just thrown in the mix to make it happier).But as my wife likes to say "Suspend all logic and disbelief!". Only hot chicks go to prison, and 3/4 inch steel plating doesn't really weigh all that much, nor does 50 caliber machine gun turrets.This movie was absurd, over the top, and really not all that great to begin with. However because Jason Statham can do no wrong, no matter how unbelievable it is, he always seems to make it look cool and completely normal (anyone remember Transporter 2 with the bomb underneath the Audi?).Bloody, dystopic, and predictable, there really is nothing that could make a person want to see this except for the reasons mentioned...Which is why this was a cool movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best car-chase scenes in history of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of car-chase movies but this one is the best. There were much more car chases than in any other movie and they were much more impressive than in any other movie. The atmosphere in the movie reminded me of Mortal Kombat. Even one of the racers was played by Robin Shou. There were also a few fighting scenes witch were more like street fights. The main good guy was played by Jason Statham and I think this was the best choice for that role because he is the best action movie star of todays action movies. I liked Joan Allen's role too and I thing she was also the best choice for that role. So if you are action movie fan you must see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this movie was not meant to be some deep story of humanity and survival it was meant to be a manly movie with lots of action , hot chicks and tons of blood and gore.The movie is set in the futuristic United States. Jason Statham plays an ex Nascar driver who got arrested because he killed his wife(or did he?). The prison warden played by Joan Allen wants him to race in the so called Death Race which is a race in an arena where the drivers have to destroy each other and thats basically it.The movie is bad but so is Shoot 'em up and just like Shoot 'em up its incredibly entertaining and funny with much senseless dialog and even more badass action which didn't use any CGI. This movie is much better than the original which was very boring and bland.After major flops like AvP and Resident Evil Paul WS. Anderson finally redeem himself. Lets just hope he stays like that.</fullReview>

It has everything an action movie needs, fights, guns, explosions, awesome cars, and girls.I don't know why this movie was so lowly rated, id recommend anyone, thats right anyone who likes action to see and buy the DVD. All i have to say is that Hollywood gave me a new found confidence in remakes.The nice thing is that there was also very little marketing in the film, it's presentation was clean, and the way the races were done were rather clever, with the defense, offense, and death buttons.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie couple of weeks ago in a sneak preview in Dusseldorf. Within a minute of the movie starting someone in our group said that we should disconnect our brain, and how true it was. No plot to speak of (wrongful imprisonment, a chance to get out, a car race, violence, death, escape, live happily ever after), so many improbabilities, so many things that did not make sense, far too much violence, and such a corny ending. Even the computer graphics in some places were pretty poor. As the credits rolled at the end I wondered if all those people (many French Canadians) would be happy to have their name associated with this piece of rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Race - Updated, Not Improved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has always been a trend in Hollywood to go back and remake classics, but the term "classics" is loosely defined between critically acclaimed movies and those which we just have a hell of time watching over and over again, sometimes re-coined as "cult classics". Fans of both good and bad films raise their respective hands in horror and disbelief every time another remake is greenlit, while others furrow their brows in confusion as to what inner voices compelled movie execs to take on that particular film update. So here we are again, witnessing the results of nervous hands reaching back into the annals of film history for something to bring back, something to put new wrapping paper on and re-gift to a whole new audience. Happy Birthday, Movie Fans; It's Death Race! The original film, Death Race 2000, was produced by legendary film icon Roger Corman, who also acted as one of the producers for the update as well. It was yet one more notch in the belt of an already stellar B-movie career, which included gems like The Little Shop of Horrors, Dementia 13 and Big Bad Mama. Another tidbit the former Death Race had on it's side was the performances of Sylvester Stallone and David Carradine as Machine Gun Joe and Frankenstein respectively. Both were big names already, with Stallone only one year away from the stardom of Rocky, and these two actors lend a huge amount of camp value to digging through the DVD rental racks just to discover this timeless story of pre-eminent road rage. You might be thinking to yourself, without those two actors, how can this remake hold up? Well, the answer is simple, find a younger actor who can seemingly play absolutely any character with a car and a bad attitude: Jason Statham.For those who have been living under a rock for the past ten years, Jason Statham is one of the most under-appreciated action stars of our generation. Launching himself to critical appeal in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in 1998 he cemented his career moving forward by getting cast as the kung-fu thrilling, one liner spouting and impossibly precise driving lead in The Transporter. His trail through the movie ranks has been a tad wobbly at times, like his starring role in Uwe Boll's In the Name of the King, but no one can fault him for striking while the iron is hot. Statham continues his streak in this flick with a heap of glaring shots through broken windshields and stare down moments after taking unbelievable punches and kicks to the head. The only piece missing for the true Statham fan is a distinct lack of martial arts, which makes sense on the story side of things, but I still wished for one good spin kick, ridgehand chop to the neck or even better, a homage to the greased pig fight ala Transporter style.Surrounding our steely-eyed hero are a couple of people worth mentioning. Ian McShane, who is most recently known for mercilessly killing and beating people down in the Old West town of Deadwood, plays Coach, the institutionalized leader of Statham's pit crew. Tyrese Gibson brings his own version of the stone cold glare over to play as the new Machine Gun Joe, which for one reason or another the new writers decided to make gay. Joan Allen takes a striking departure from her usual fare and turns in a stereotyped performance as the fiendishly powerful warden of the futuristic prison where the Death Race takes place. To get a literary glimpse into her role, picture her performance as Pam Landy from the last two Bourne films and turn the bitchiness up three more notches. Lastly, rounding out the cast, as well as her wardrobe, is the film debut of the dangerously curvy Natalie Martinez as Case, the navigator in Statham's rolling wagon of destruction. The eye candy in this flick just got a little spicy.The movie gives you exactly what you expect, fast cars, loud guns and explosions one after another. There are a few really impressive stunt sequences and the realism of the shots seemingly prompted the studio to put up a disclaimer at the end of the film to make sure people don't go home that night and try to mount mini-cannons on the hood of their Honda Civic. One of the main things I can attack about this flick is not the movie itself, but the trailer. The first trailer to hit the screens was way too long and showed each and every plot twist. Admittedly, you don't sit down for this with popcorn in hand expecting to be dazzled by well written story elements, but at least give the movie a chance to hit on all cylinders (oh hell yes, car references get me bonus points in this one).Recommendation: It's not bad for the die-hard Jason Statham fans and road rage enthusiasts, but for the genre it lands in, I might lean towards the recent decapitation-fest Doomsday. The theater experience is only going to help this one out, so hit up a matinée if you're feeling the fire for it.</fullReview>

That's all we ask." Which, he does deliver, but, since that's all the audience is looking for I can say to them, just watch Death Race 2000. It's the same idea but better and more violent.Which, I don't understand! How can something in the 1970's be more violent than something now?

		<fullReview>I was expecting this movie to be a decent action movie and thats all I got. It would have been better being named something else though. The original movie that it is based on is far better.The thing that annoyed me with this movie was that there were a couple of decent kills but after that Hollywood once again went the route of the ridiculous by utilizing something not even in the race to take out the other drivers! Im sure you will feel cheated by this as well.The original had humour, kills and was cheesy but action packed in the best way possible. It also focused on running over people rather than destroying your opponents which is exactly what this remake did.If I could describe this film, I would say its like Twisted Metal, I found the weapons that were attached to the cars to be too overdone and no this movie didn't focus on humour or running over people. It lacked the factors that made the original a great watch.I did like it when the cars got ready to race, an obvious homage to Carmageddon which incidentally is based on Death Race 2000 (1975) which is a much better movie than this remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this film i have to say that, one,... they should have had the race in the desert like the previous version had. What i do remember about death race 2000, is that the race was held outdoors in the open, where anybody was fair game and not just the prisoners. Points were awarded for each kill of who ever it was in the way. Also this new version was a little short sighted with the cars, using great special effects with huge guns and missiles was really original. But it would have been better in the open land, the carnage would have been more impactive showing debris flying every where resulting in more points and greater chaos. Using a prison was at best un-original, we have seen too many films about winning freedoms from races or fighting, in the old version Frankenstein was a celebrity not a prisoner, neither was his race mates. It could have done a whole lot better using the original script, unless roger corman wrote the original script using a prison but never achieving it. Which ever the case, i did enjoy this for eye candy effects, but the story lacked somewhat substance in the characters. But all in all not a bad move for the car enthusiast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Jensen (Strathom) and Coach, and several of the other Cons.But after Mad Max and Escape from LA, this attempt to recapture the past has few real flourishes. The movie was almost comic-book glib, the way brutality was casually accepted by all while trying to include the personal tragedy of Jensen's life. Supposedly set in 2012 (a bow to the Peak Oil movement, which contends about 2012 scarcity of world energy will cause a major depression - with most families in American unable to pay routine utility bills), assumes a major and ruinous decline starting now.I thought the $300 'final check' for 120 hours work in two weeks was a nice touch, for a mill worker, when Jensen's plant closes. Much of the lost money is called 'cash fee' for taking cash.This is an OK movie, for shoot-em-up and gratuitous gore, elaborate death scenes, etc. But I thought too much time was spent on face-time for actor showcasing than for developing the scenes. It seemed a shame to keep interrupting a (weakly told) story to accommodate actor contracts. Ian was good as 'Coach'. I hope to see more of this understated screen presence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Death Race fans,I'll admit it right away, before you can say it: I don't get it. I confess. I don't understand or care why there is this decades-old cultural institution of claiming to like dick flicks, even when they totally suck. Why do you take campy pride in embracing action films that the average viewer can only like by lightening up and "accepting them for what they are"? I don't want to earn that particular Boy Scout badge.What I'm driving at here -- and I say this with love -- is that I think perhaps you have been suckered. You've been missing out.You see, there is more fun to be had by action cinema buffs. Much more. And there is more money to be made by film studios. A lot more.Plot, for instance, would be more fun. An actual story has this funny way of being, um, BETTER.Characters that are more interesting are, y'know, more interesting. Yes, even to you. Oh, sure, you may be happy enough with cardboard cutouts, as long as they have muscles or tits. But when a genuine new character comes along, your nipples get all perky just like anyone else's. Character is good stuff.Crazy bad-ass stunts that happen for an actual reason and which are related to things that came before ... f'd up crazy damage done to characters we actually care about ... one-liners that are genuinely funny or memorable ... these things, Death Race fans, make action movies REALLY fun. Action movies that have them are the action movies that deserve your IMDb votes.Death Race did not have them.Death Race Fans, I know that you already love the classic quality action flicks that exist. The good ones are already in your library, so I know that you know good when you see it. But discriminate, people, discriminate! Death Race had almost none of the good stuff at all. Nothing you're going to remember in 20 days, let alone 20 years ... and you know it..Change your minds. Adjust your votes. Save them for a film that's both bad-ass AND interesting. You may also wish to see a doctor about how low your standards are and start taking some kind of supplements or something.Sincerely, The Minister for Plot and Character (even in action flicks)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really shouldn't have been that hard to make a decent remake to Roger Corman's Death Race 2000. While I admit that I love Death Race 2000, it isn't necessarily what I would call a quality film. It had some satirical points, funny dark humor, and a fair amount of bloodshed and nudity like good exploitation film should. All Death Race needed to do to improve upon that was have a better story and characters. Unfortunately, Death Race fails to have much in the way of story or characters and lacks all the charms of the original. The satirical points in the original are repeated here, only they are heavy-handed here. There is far less humor in this version and very little of the humor is actually funny. As for the exploitation elements, there is plenty of bloodshed but no nudity. Unlike the original, there is no fun or humor to go along with the bloodshed. It's just kind of unpleasant and seems a little excessive. Because of the minor satirical content in the original, the violence seemed to serve more of a point than it does here. The only thing that kept this lame remake from becoming unwatchable was the Jason Statham in the lead. By far the most charismatic action star working today, Statham brings excitement to an otherwise boring and pointless mess. However, the rest of the cast is severely wasted. This is easily the worst movie Roger Corman has ever had his name attached to...and that's saying something. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death Race (2008) ** (out of 4) Remake (or reworking if you want) of Roger Corman's cult classic Death Race 2000 has Jason Statham playing a man wrongly convicted of murdering his wife. He's sent to prison where the wicked warden (Joan Allen) offers him his freedom if he can win the "Death Race". As with most modern remakes this one here steals the original's basic storyline but then tries to do something different with it and in this case these changes are rather sad. The original film is certainly far from a good movie but it does have all the elements making it the perfect cult movie. Those elements include the racers getting bonus points for killing innocent pedestrians but that element is taken out of this version. We also can't hate the main guy as this time around they make him the typical "innocent man wrongly thrown in prison" route, which we've seen countless times before in countless other films. This is the type of film that requires you to turn your brain off and on that level this works as a mindless action film but that's about as deep as it gets. The action sequences all look pretty good but I found Anderson's direction to be so bland that not once did I feel any excitement. For the most part I was just watching the film but not really caring about any of the characters. None of them have any chemistry together and worse of all is that I didn't care if Statham got his freedom or not. Statham gives an okay performance as does Tyrese Gibson and Ian McShane. You have to wonder why someone like Allen is in this type of picture and it shows because her performance is rather weak, although the screenplay doesn't offer her anything to do. In the end this film isn't bad but it's not good either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had good potential, and like most of Paul W.S. Anderson's projects; the end result is utter garbage, however, Mortal Kombat is a childhood favorite of mine. Even though they do make money (which I guess at the end of the day is all that matters), I still despise this man for screwing up the Resident Evil series and turning it into a joke. The fact that there is some potential helps us believe this movie could actually end up being good, but it isn't. The mistake this movie made was letting Anderson be a part of it.So is there any good in this movie? Jason Statham is usually money, and even though he's not in his prime for this picture, he still sells what little there is to sell pretty decently. Joan Allen and Ian McShane, really make me wonder what they are doing in this picture, both are established actress and actor, and even though they do turn out good performances, I can't help but say my perception of them has definitely gone down a bit since they have starred in this film. The action also has it's moments, though is it really possible to make cars strapped with machine guns not exciting? The concept may be a good idea, but the delivery is atrocious. The script is clunky, the plot has more holes in it than a piece of swiss cheese, and while on the topic of cheese, this movie is that cheesy. Natalie Martinez, co-stars as Statham's navigator while on the race, yes she is hot and that is the point of her. Where the problem is, no amount of hotness can make up for her god awful acting ability, it's utter crap. I hope to never see her in a movie again, or at least not in a role with actual talking. Tyrese still plays the same crappy roles he always does, but thats OK since he's a rubbish actor.Pros: Has potential, never delivers though. Statham has proved a solid leading man in these kind of movies, no matter how bad the flick. Allen and McShane = good acting no matter what. Nice to see Robin Shou again. It's got cars with guns.Cons: Everything else that wasn't mentioned in the Pros section should be taken as a con. Paul W.S Anderson, don't let him make movies... again.Overall: Boys who like toys will go. This Movie made for immature high school boys who are fascinated by violence, but seeing how the movie is rated 18A they may have a tough time getting into the theatre. For the rest of the world with half a brain, please skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of the three "so bad its..." movies I've watched this summer (Babylon A.D., Punisher: War Zone, and Death Race), this is by far the worst, and possibly the only one with no redeeming quality. This was just a poorly written, poorly directed, redundant waste of celluloid. Sure there are explosions and fast cars, but you keep seeing the same thing over and over again; there is no variety in location or even shots. It seems sometimes like you're watching the same six or so shots over and over again; start with a close up of a scowling driver, move to the outside of the car, zoom in on smug warden through a glass window, finish with a clockwise pan around the warden. Repeat ad nauseum, occasionally inserting explosion, and/or hot chick. At least Babylon, as truly awful as that was, made for an entertaining game of spotting what scenes were aped from other, far better, sci-fi movies. Death Race actually plagiarizes itself. Just wait for the unrated version Punisher to come out on DVD and watch that if you're starved for new stupid violence, at least that is as entertaining as the average Steven Segal or TROMA movie. Actually, I guess this does have one slight redeeming quality; Natalie Martinez is very, very hot in this, but the five or so minutes of the movie where she and the other implausibly attractive female inmates walk around in slow motion is hardly worth watching over an hour and a half of this crap for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Race</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Paul W.S. Anderson (Resident Evil, AVP: Alien vs. Predator), I knew the leading actor and some of what it involved, so when I got the opportunity I tried it. Basically, set in the near future, unemployment is high, and law and order has completely vanished, which leaves the way clear for television to do whatever they want. On the day he loses his job, ex-steelworker and ex-Nascar champion Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) finds his wife dead on the floor, and he is framed for the murder, and he is sent to Terminal Island. The island is the place where the popular internet and television show Death Race is run, the show consists of ten dangerous and skilled criminals competing in a race driving armoured cars, and the aim is to kill each other and be the last both across the line and alive, and then they are free. Jensen, with his good record of driving skills, is chosen by steely and manipulative Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen) to take on the identity of the now dead criminal Frankenstein, wearing the mask, and she wants him to be in the race, or rot in jail. After making a bargain, Jensen does agree to do the last three stages of the Death Race, facing true criminals such as Joe 'Machine Gun' Mason (Tyrese Gibson), Slovo 'Angel Wings' Pachenko (Max Ryan) and Hector 'The Grim Reaper' Grimm (Robert LaSardo). After getting his car and some advice from auto shop crew chief Coach (Ian McShane), the new Frankenstein gets his navigator Case (Natalie Martinez) and they start steadily on the first of three remaining rounds. He picks up some credibility in the second race, and more of the criminals are killed in the process, including Jensen killing Pachenko himself recognising him as the real killer of his wife. As he gains more popularity Hennessey is really angry that he is still alive, especially after planting a bomb under his car, and he gets through to the final race, facing the remaining Machine Gun. Jensen and he make a compromise though and instead of killing each other with the available weaponry on their cars, they blow a hole in the wall and make their escape. In the end, Case sacrifices herself pretending to be Frankenstein under the mask, Coach blows up Hennessey with the bomb she planted earlier, and Jensen and Machine Gun start a job in a mechanics yard together, joined by the released Case. Also starring Jason Clarke as Ulrich, Frederick Koehler as Lists, Jacob Vargas as Gunner and Janaya Stephens as Suzy. Statham is cool and thuggish as usual, McShane is alright, and Allen makes a good icy and nasty female villain, it is the races with all the various guns and bombing stuff attached to the cars and the many explosions, and bloody deaths, that are the most watchable bits, an alright futuristic action thriller. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Car Wars: The Move - Ruined by Distastefull Foul Language</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off. What would otherwise have been at least an interesting Car Wars style movie was for me totally ruined by some really disgusting language scattered throughout. Especially near the end. This dragged what would otherwise have been a 6-8 rating straight to hell. The fact that it has virtually nothing to do with the setting and premise of the original movie further lowers its potential. As one viewer noted. Its also Twisted Metal: The movie.***SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW***Death Race deals with a near future where corporations now run privately huge prisons. From this developed brutal death match arena battles and then when that lost interest. There developed a form of Combat Racing called Death Race. Prisoners drive around a track and try to both win and blast each other to smithereens with heavily armed and armoured cars. The winner of 5 yearly tournaments gets their freedom. Absolutely none of this has anything to do with the original movie where the race was cross country and a form of population control to boot.The movie starts off with a race in progress and a driver that looks suspiciously like the masked racer Frankenstein from the original movie. Though here with a "Jason" style mask. Things go badly and focus shifts to our main character played by Stratham. After some set up he is framed for the murder of his wife and sent to the Death Rave prison. Here it turns out he is a former race car driver and the prison warden proceeds to blackmail him into replacing Frankenstein in return for his freedom. From here the movie plays out on two levels with the three races on one side and the question of what really happened to his family on the other. The races are very dynamic and well played. Though I was quite surprised when it did indeed take a "Twisted Metal" turn as the cars have to race over specific icons on the track to activate guns and defenses.Were it not for the truly horrid language the movie would have been more enjoyable. Aside from a slow start it kept a good pace for the rest of the film. As a remake of Deathrace 2000 though its a absolute failure. As a port of Twisted Metal and Car Wars though its not too bad. But I really cant suggest viewing this thing other than to fast forward to the races, and of these only the first two are worth watching. A lot of potential killed dead by unacceptable profanity.</fullReview>
