		<shortDescription>A fun movie from the 80's that got taken too seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know there was a lot of controversy around this film, due to the fact we have a rich white man buying a black man for his son, but I think that people just took this film way too seriously. Richard Pryor is one of the best comedians of all time, so I definitely became interested in seeing this film after I saw it on VH1's "I love the 80's" show, once again though, it seemed like they were giving the film a hard time. Well, I saw this at a store and figured for 5 dollars, what the heck? It's the rental price, if I liked the movie, I might as well own it. Well, I watched it this morning, I have to say that I thought that this was a very cute film that I'm sure if you have an open mind, you'll definitely enjoy it.Jack is a journalist looking for a job, he's not getting anything though, at first he starts as a cleaning lady, but is fired by a snobby rich man. Then he's security at a toy store where the snobby rich man's son is shopping for anything he wants, he sees Jack and thinks he is funny, he wants him as the toy. When offered enough money to save his house, Jack agrees to it, but he's getting just a bit humiliated when he is constantly mocked, understandably. But when he gives the little boy a chance, they end up becoming great friends.The Toy is just a fun movie that I'm sure you'll get a kick out of if you just give it a shot. It's a definite 80's classic that had great comedy in it, Richard was absolutely hilarious. He and Scott Schwartz were very adorable together and looked like they had so much fun together. I would recommend this film for a fun comedy, you're guaranteed a few laughs.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film can be enjoyed by children due to it's obvious subject matter. But it also has a subtheme about racial and class divisions. Depending on the scene, the film's racial connotations range from depicting the use of blacks in subservient positions, to blatantly expressing that people can still sell themselves or be bought out of desperation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone wants to talk about the racial overtones. ***NEWS FLASH*** White folks do not wake up every morning thinking about how to screw over black folks. The movie was great. I loved it then and I love it now. I'm pretty sure the people who made this movie decided to make a funny movie with a great comedian of that era. I couldn't think of a better comedian to have as a toy, white or black.To all my folks who seem to get upset at Richard Pryor and or the directors for making this movie, don't be. Be upset at Petey Greene for showing everyone how to eat a watermelon. You Tube that if you don't believe me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Southern Billionaire buys a Black Man for his son.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Toy" is a remake of the French movie "Le Jouet," but writer Carol Sobieski and director Dick Donner have infused it with a racist theme that is specifically American.US Bates (Gleason), a wealthy, powerful Louisiana industrialist purchases, Jack Brown, a janitor (Pryor) to perform as an object for his spoiled son's amusement.After an initial period of friction due to young Eric's (Schwartz) obnoxious, selfish behavior, they agree to investigate Bates's personal and professional misbehavior in a home-made newspaper, called "The Toy."Infuriated, Bates demonstrates to the two investigators that he owns the people who work for him by ordering his assistant named Morehouse (Beatty) to drop his pants on command (he later screams at another assistant "I told you to dance!")The iconoclastic rebels who finally take down Bates at a Klan fundraiser are Eric's innocent generation who never knew Jim Crow and the truth-burdened, unemployed black man with nothing to lose because he's already at the bottom.This movie is filled with enough Pryor minstrelsy to keep movie-going Whitey occupied and chuckling, but is at the same time digging deep into the reality and shame of this country's racist past, and, indeed, present. And we haven't even addressed the alcoholic indentured man-servant Barkley (Hyde-White) or the Fraulein-who-cries-Mandingo (Leslie-Lyttle.)From the buying of Brown to the sycophantic staff to the Senator-for-hire Newcomb (consonance: Nuke 'Em,) US Bates proves that slavery isn't over...people just cost a little more these days.In this day when skirting the issue of race and playing it safe at the risk of being offensive has crushed any discussion of racism in this country, it's nice to see that Hollywood once had the balls to make a movie that called a spade a...well, you get it.Oh, and the kid grows up to be a porn star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pryor is the main reason to this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie more times than I'd ever admit to, and the thing that keeps me watching is Pryor. He shines in just about every scene he's seen, especially when he's paired with the Wonder-Wheel. It's just that the rest of the film isn't on the level.That's not to say it's a bad film; it's just not a solid one. This remake of a Francis Veber film (the name escapes me) finds Pryor as Jack Brown, an unemployed writer who seeks a job with a newspaper. He arrives at Bates Industries, run by the powerful industrialist U.S. Bates (Jackie Gleason). He works a variety of odd jobs, incl. a janitor in a department store, where he is spotted by U.S. Bates' spoiled son, Eric, during the afforementioned Wonder-Wheel fiasco. Eric wants Jack as a toy, and this leads to a movie that blends the comedic with the sentimental, and works about half of the time.The movie does take it's time to illustrate the goings-on in the Bates home. Eric spends much time tormenting Jack; during their first night, he shoots firecrackers at him, among other things. The two of them play air-hockey, and when Jack is beating Eric, the boy quits. Jack questions the boy if his father knows that his son is a quitter, to which Eric replies, "He doesn't care what I am, as long as I stay out of his way." That scene illustrates Eric's m.o.; he's frustrated at the neglect and inattentiveness he receives from his father, and expresses it in rebellious behavior.That's all good and well, and that scenario does have a positive resolution, but the movie is burdened with unnecessary elements that don't belong in a movie like this. The movie has a racist subtext: Jack essentially allows himself to be bought, even though he says he can't. There's also a subplot towards the end dealing with the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan that serves no purpose other than to wreck a party. And U.S. Bates' wife, Fancy, is a poorly-drawn character; she comes along with an impressive bust and an annoying voice, and does little that is humorous, aside from her pronounciation of "U.S."Still, the main reason to see the film is Pryor. See it for no other reason than to see a legend doing what he does best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important Evidence For How Great The Original Is !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's nearly a shot-by-shot remake for the French masterpiece (Le Jouet - 1976); so much for saying I think !. (Richard Pryor) filled it with his own buffoonery, and some funny lines, but he couldn't capture the serious sense of the story, he almost dealt with the movie as a toy itself. He was a golden star at the moment, so maybe they left him do whatever he wants. Or maybe that's the taste of his comedy anyway. (Richard Donner) made it fairly but it's still one of his most spiritless movies that lacks the personal touch, he was executing more than creating at this break between the end of the 1970s' (Superman)'s movies, and his works at the mid-1980s : (Ladyhawke), (The Goonies), then (Lethal Weapon).Of course the comparison isn't for the sake of the American movie. Firstly, there are no changes, they kind of translated the French movie to American the way they translated le jouet to the toy ("The Toy" is what "Le Jouet" means in English). They only added a storyline about racism which suited (Pryor)'s character, and harmonized with the motif (as if slavery still exists, making the poor as the rich people's toy). And also, it utilized somehow the stepmother as a sexual toy herself. But overall nothing could reach to the original's special pace, or exceptional personality.(Donner), with the 2 scriptwriter, lacked the French director (Francis Veber)'s smart touches while he was transforming his own short story into feature film; for example, at (Le Jouet), the rich man's villa was dark, the silence worked powerfully more than the talking, and it didn't go to repeat the domino's fall, or show off the stepmother's body !. Let alone, how here the adult joking is ruling, there is a purposed kick out of hearing the boy says "Boob", or else familiar matters. (Patrick Williams)'s music was very cute, but not up to (Vladimir Cosma)'s tender memorable score. And nothing can imitate the original's end, which's one of the most touching and expressing cinematic endings I've ever seen.Have watched the original or not, this one is good, fresh and solid as an afternoon movie. In fact its good condition is a perfect proof of the original's beauty, though it's obvious that (The Toy) couldn't be as "unique" as (Le Jouet).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is simply put, a fun, charming movie about a boy (Scott Schwartz) who decides to make Richard Pryor his toy for a week while he visits his powerful father Jackie Gleason. Simple gags, jokes and life lessons are what this movie is all about. It should be noted that Schwartz, who also played "Flick" in A Christmas Story went on to co-star in non-sexual roles in hardcore XXX films, then did a XXX scene himself, virtually destroying any chance for a comeback as an adult actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is the toy Gleason or Pryor's best movie, don't make me laugh. But it shouldn't have been trashed the way it was and still is because a bunch of politically correct pseudo-intelectuals in the media resented the racial undertones. The weakest link in this movie is the script. it could have been so much better. The editing is pretty spotty too. That much said it will make you laugh, and Gleason's performance is sincere, especially during the emotional conclusion. The complaints if the child actor's performance are justified, but mcalaey caulken was awful...he's a kid. what do you expect? I feel as if this movie got a bum rap for political reasons, and that's just a shame because funny is funny and that's the bottem line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason made The Toy tolerable as entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just rewatched this Richard Donner movie starring Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason after 30 years on Netflix Streaming just now. In this one, Pryor plays Jack Brown, an unemployed reporter whose house may be put up for sale unless he gets a job so he finds employment, initially as a maid, for Gleason's U.S. Bates before being reassigned as his son, Eric's (Scott Schwartz), "toy". I'll stop there and just say that despite the silly premise and some potentially stereotypically offensive situations, I did laugh plenty again at many of Pryor's shenanigans with Schwartz and Gleason still was good for some reaction shots especially when he says "woof". Also funny are Ned Beatty-who previously was in Pryor's Silver Streak but has scenes with him here for the first time since co-star Gene Wilder had the lion's share of lines with him there-as toady Mr. Morehouse and Teresa Ganzel as Fancy, U.S.'s (or in her pronunciation-You Ass) wife. It does get really contrived near the end but still, The Toy was fun and somewhat inspirational to me still. With that out of the way, if you're familiar with my reviews, you know that I always like to cite when productions have something associated with my current hometown of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Well, this movie was shot there and I always like recognizing many of the city's landmarks like a brick structure I noticed at the beginning as Pryor encounters a limousine with his first meeting with Fancy there or a scene inside Goudchaux's Department Store-a building that still exists though the store is no more-with his riding the Wonder Wheel or the Indian Mounds near LSU that Jack and Eric walk on and, most awesome of all, two scenes of the State Capital-one seen through the windows of U.S. Bates's office as he makes Morehouse take his pants off in front of Jack and Eric and the other as the latter two are walking near the building's grounds. Also, a couple of players are familiar to me: Linda McCann, who appears in a party scene and at the end, was a teacher of a classmate of mine during my days before high school. She plays Honey Russell. And Robert Earle, who played a poker player at the beginning, was known to me as Bob Earle, president of WIBR-AM 1300, who did promotions for and introed many old-time radio programs for the Top 40 station during the 1979-80 season before it switched to country as I-13 during the latter part of the year. That station went off the air after Hurricane Gustav went through the area on September 1, 2008. Oh, and one more thing, I also like to cite when someone from my birthtown of Chicago, Ill. is associated with the production who in this case was screenwriter Carol Sobieski who had also adapted Annie starring Albert Finney and Carol Burnett earlier in the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Went totally in the wrong direction...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Pryor stars as a down and out writer who ends up as a human toy for multi-billionaire Jackie Gleason's son. The combination results in comedy that only a man like Richard Pryor could take and make even funnier.Shades of his stand up act stand out when the focus is on Pryor and some of the situations he gets himself into and he uses this time to shine. Jackie Gleason played well, too, as the straight man, but I don't think this was his forte, although, come to think of it, this role isn't that much different from the "straight guy" kind of role he played in the "Smokey and the Bandit" films, but he was a LOT funnier in those films than here.The only problem I have with this film is that it starts to go for the throat of comedy, but ends up being a piece trying to deal with the issues at the time...almost like changing boats in the middle of the stream. The comedy continues throughout, but it changes its content, which distracted me a little.7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Pryor's early 80s running down the street on fire incident must have affected him somehow. In his stand up,he jokes about it getting great laughs. It seemed to have done something involving the projects he chose. The Toy is about the lamest he ever chose,aside from I guess Another You.A movie where a white man buys his son a black man? Nice little bit of underlying political incorrectness before thee was such a thing. It's seeing Richard getting all sentimental that made me finally walk out before the end. I wanted to see Pryor get even with this brat,instead it becomes the misunderstood kid nauseum! At least Gleason had his moments. Ignore this and watch Pryor with Gene Wilder or any of his '70s stuff. This is a waste of any movie watcher's time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I consider this the best Lovecraftian movie in the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that may sound misleading since Lovecraft had nothing to do with this Pryor, Gleason and Donner comedy, but there was so much in it that would be impossible to comprehend.First let's address the elephant in the room. Yes it's a rich white Billionaire buying a black man for his kid to play with. Yes by all accounts it's modern day slavery. Yes this pretty much became severely harsher in hindsight not just from those implications, but due to the recent events surrounding human trafficking. But what I like about the movie isn't just the comedy once you get past it. But the fact that they managed to get this movie made at all in spite of the implications. If a censor today were to look at this idea, they would probably have the human equivalent to Blue Screen of Death before going insane at how they managed to get away with that. And that's why I consider it a Lovecraft movie. Because it's that F***ing crazy.</fullReview>

I did not find the movie racist but I can see how it could have become so, however it I felt it dodged this by explaining that the situation was wrong and the fact that it was feel will. I always find this movie funny I like the fact that it is a bit silly but it is very much an 80's movie, I found a lot tended to be a bit like this if you look at Mr Nanny which was written 10 years later it would appear that kids still wanted that type of movie where the kids got a way with murder and the adults got beat up in a slapstick way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Brown (Richard Pryor) is a struggling writer in Baton Rouge. He's even playing poker for food stamps. His family home is about to be auctioned off unless he can come up with $10k or get a job. In desperation, he applies for a maid's job for wealthy U.S. Bates (Jackie Gleason). Sydney Morehouse (Ned Beatty) reluctantly hires him after getting threatened with a lawsuit. U.S. fires him but U.S.'s spoiled 9 year old son "Master" Eric Bates (Scott Schwartz) finds the black janitor fascinating. Eric demands to buy him since U.S. promised Eric anything in his department store. U.S. is an absentee divorced father with Eric only one week every year. U.S. is married to bubbly new wife Fancy (Teresa Ganzel).I love Richard Pryor. Yes I'm the one guy who likes Superman III. He has an instant likability and that makes all the difference. Quite frankly, I missed all the racial undertones as a kid watching this movie. I just found it fun with a touching story of a family coming back together. I don't even mind the annoying brat because it allows him to grow as a human being. It's all very heart warming. I also loved all the toys as a kid and there is nothing better than Pryor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This toy is kind of beat up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason as the stars most people would say this has to be a funny film. Well there is a kid and he is kind of who the film revolves around so that will in all likelihood make this one more cute than need be. Still, Pryor and Gleason, two guys known for comedy, going to be a laugh riot...right? Well, the film for reasons unknown gets a bit to heavy handed at time adding social issues to a film that should be a comedy in the truest sense. Seriously, this film is one of those movies that just does not know what direction it wants to go in. One would think it was trying to appear to families, what with the kid with everything wanting a friend and such. Then why make the film so racial? The film at times becomes a movie about racial injustice and such, and then completely shifts to the moronic comedy when Richard Pryor's character runs over the top of the water to get away from piranha. Make up your mind, do not have a bit of looney tunes comedy in the middle of a film that up until that point did not have humor such as this. This film just tried to be to much and it ends up making the film a bit to boring at times for kids and to childish at times for adults. This film should of been about the kid wanting the person as a friend, you could have ditched Richard Pryor in favor of Jerry Lewis and scrap all the heavy handed stuff. Or you could of kept Richard Pryor, and still ditched all the heavy handed stuff. Though just seems that this film was somehow made for Jerry Lewis, do not ask me why. What we do get is a toy that is broken and not as shiny as it once was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't bother unwrapping this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The comedic might of Pryor and Gleason couldn't save this dog from the tissue-thin plot, weak script, dismal acting, and laughable continuity in editing this mess together. It has a very few memorable moments, but the well dries up quickly. As a kid I remember this as a Luke-warm vehicle for the two actor-comedians, but there was always something strange about the flow and feeling of what was being conveyed in each scene and how this ties to the plot overall. Watching it again after many years, it screams schlock-a-mania. I'm not so concerned with the racial controversy, as I wouldn't mind seeing a movie take that issue on with a little levity. The most obvious fault to me is that the scenes are laid out like a jumbled, non-related series of 2 minute situation comedy bits (any not very good ones at that), that were stapled together by the editor after an all-nighter at the local watering hole. Characters change feelings and motivations on a dime, without rhyme nor reason, between scenes and within scenes, making this feel as though no one had any idea of what to get out of the screenplay. Not that it was any gem to start with. I feel bad for the two actors whose legacy is marred by this disaster that should never have been made. Maybe my sense of humor has become too refined...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awkward, but too much talent on hand to hate it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this is a wrong-headed and awkward little farce, but the stars are fun to watch. The Toy is the story of Richard Pryor desperately needing a job and being hired first as a cleaning LADY, and then as a playmate for the spoiled son of a tycoon. Director Richard Donner is able to showcase the tough economic times of the early 1980s and even sprinkle a little social awareness in terms of race. However the basic plot of a black man being bought or rented by a rich white man is an easy target for the race-bating crowd. Despite some scenes that might make the viewer feel uneasy, there are still a few good laughs here. Pryor is always watchable, and Gleason was unable to work much after this film. He makes his character believable, though.The film suffers from a few problems, to say the least. Scott Schwarz is certainly whiny and annoying as the boy. Yes, he is supposed to be but his performance on many levels is grating. I like one line Pryor has about him when Gleason tells him he only gets the boy for one week each year. Pryor suggests that Gleason get some better lawyers, because nobody should have to put up with that kid for as long as a week! Ha! There are a couple of uncomfortable scenes regarding the boy's German nanny coming onto to Pryor. In one scene she asks if he is brown all over while feeling him up while he's wearing spider man pajamas! Ughh! There is also an embarrassing scene where the boy asks Pryor some pointed questions about sex, while straddling a huge old cannon at a park area. Ewww. Ned Beatty is forced to drop his pants in one scene, but its nothing as graphic as the scene in Deliverance.I loved the scene where a huge outdoor Klan fund raiser is disrupted by Pryor and the kid. Actually Pryor is funny in just about every scene. The big-chested trophy wife of Gleason has some funny moments, too. I guess if you just don't take it seriously, than that is the only way to watch it. Still not a classic, if nothing else, The Toy is a curiosity best enjoyed by die hard fans of Pryor and Gleason. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Pryor again plays the bumbling idiot in this comedy with a morality twist. The premise revolves around Richard losing his house, an opportunity to make a lot of money fast being a human toy for a rich store owner and the hilarity that ensues. While the film (and Richard) are indeed funny, it's hard to watch at times as the movie ATTEMPTS to balance racial/social class commentary with blaxpotation comedy. In one scene, Richard is giving the kid a lesson in friendship and the next we watch him running around bug eyed. And in the end, Richard plays the stereotypical blaxpotation character while Jackie Gleason is the great white rich dad. Its fun to watch but hard to digest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Toy (1982) was another Americanized remake of a French hit. Richard Pryor also puts another nail in the coffin that once was his career by starring in another sell-out role. During the seventies, Mr. Pryor was once an innovative comic who stretched the boundaries of bad taste. Now, he was starring in anything that would pay him handsomely. The story is about a spoiled rich kid who get anything his rich dad can afford. One day he's shopping late night in a toy store and watches a janitor (Richard Pryor) acting real stupid and breaking a lot of expensive toys. After watching him break an expensive toy called "The Wonder Wheel", the kid laughs and wants to buy him as a personal toy. Will this rich kid get what he wants? Can his father afford his services? How will Richard react to it? Is this one of those message movies? To find out the answers to these questions you'll just have to watch THE TOY.An okay time waster, but it's sad to see Richard Pryor stoop so low just to pick up a pay check.</fullReview>

Finally, it get's so bad, he applies to be a cleaning lady at a department store owned by U.S. Bates, mega milionaire that owns south central Louisiana. One night, while Jack was playing with toys in the toy department, U.S. Bates' 9-year-old son, Eric, (who was on break from military school)witnessed this and literally bought him! Jack was not too crazy about being a toy, so Mr. Bates had to shove a little money his way. Jack has a run-in with a boxing robot, a bunch of stuffed animals and an air hockey game. Then one day, Jack suggests he and Eric start a newspaper. Jack gives Eric the nickname Scoop, which he detests. They then learn that Mr. Bates had fired one of his employees for no reason, so Jack and Eric decide to get the lowdone on Mr. Bates. They interview Barkley, Bates' English butler and ask Mr. Bates to tell how he and his bubble headed third wife Fancy met. They put it all in the newspaper. Mr. Bates is furious when he finds out. Jack and Eric also sabotage a party Mr. Bates was throwing, because one of his guests was the Grand Wizard of the Klu Klux Klan! But in the end, all turns out well. Jack gives Mr. Bates some helpful tips on how to better his relationship with his son, then takes off. I really enjoy this movie. It's one of my favorites.Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason are fabulous together. Unfortunately, Jackie Gleason is no longer with us. He died in 1987. Also dead is Wilfrid Hyde-White who played Barkley. He died in 1995. They shall be missed, but they will always be remembered in great movies they did, like this one; Scott Schwartz played Flick, Ralphie's friend in A Christmas Story the following year. Richard Pryor is currently 61 and not doing too well. So in conclusion, you must see this movie! Thank you, and hang in there, Richard!--</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies ever...here's why:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two great comics turned into saps for a bratty kid. They've both sold themselves out in this one, worse than Pryor's character. Two: Horrible, overly sentimental script that could have been used in a Harold Lloyd movie its so cliched. Three: Choice of a black actor as the toy; the racial subtext of this is unbearable, as its never addressed. There's no message here, Pryor's part could have been played by any comedic actor. Four: That kid...I wish I could go back in time and prevent him from ever acting...that would mean movies like this one and Kid Co. might not have been made...and my childhood would have been free of their mind-warping power. So if you want to watch a couple of great comics defile themselves in a sickly sweet kiddie flick, go ahead. If you want to see them in something good, see Pryor's old standup act and Gleason in something better, like the Honeymooners.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I want that black man, daddy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid I actually loved this movie, but now that I'm a man, I'm kinda horrified by "The Toy." A rich white man buys a black man for his spoiled son? Or at least rents a black man for his son. And they take baths together? Yikes! I love Pryor, but I have to assume he took this gig for the money to feed his notorious crack habit. Moral of this movie? If you're a rich white man you can buy a black man for your son. Can you imagine the firestorm of protest if this movie came out today? And oh yeah, the kid became a real life porn star!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good 80's Comedy!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Pryor, Jackie Gleason, Scott Shwartz, Teresa Ganzel and Ned Beatty star in Richard Donner's 1982 comedy. Jack Brown (Pryor) is a writer who needs a job to make a down payment on his house and wants to be a reporter for millionaire, U.S. Bates (Gleason). He gets a job working as a cleaner for U.S. until his spoiled son, Eric (Schwartz) notices him goofing around and decides to buy him as a toy. U.S. learns what Eric has done and makes a deal with Jack to play with Eric for a week earning $10,000. Jack gets practical jokes thrown at him, but gets close with Eric and helps him and U.S. with their troubled relationship in the process. Ganzel plays Eric's stepmother, Fancy and Beatty plays Morehouse, one of U.S.' right hand men. I've liked this since I was a kid, Richard and Jackie were great in it together and I recommend this good 80's comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me and my sister used to watch this when we were children and we loved it. In fact, the last time I saw it I was only 8 years old, but I remember why I enjoyed the movie. I was too young to understand the adult politics but trust me this is a wonderful film for kids to watch. If I was to watch it now it will not be as powerful, and I may not even enjoy it. The point is this was a film made for children, and as this is the case only a child, or an adult who watched it and remembers it as a child are able to accurately review and justify it. Pryor's performance was superb and it shows how diverse he was being able to star in a children's film and manage to be so convincing and never patronises the film by under-performing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theatres when I was a kid. I knew I was maturing when I wanted to leave the theatre instead of enduring this trash. The movie is not funny, it's pacing is dull, and overall offensive for everyone. Particularly the most galling scene of the movie is at the very end, when Pryor is shot in the head with suction darts, then runs down the street at super-speed (a la Benny Hill).Do yourself a favor and avoid this turkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who cares about these negative remarks!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You dry people need to chill out and quit being so darn sensitive about the racial tone of this movie. Heck Richard Pryor was a big time racist on stage but very accepting and intelligent off stage. He would not have done this movie if he thought it was a setback for black people. Besides we're all equal now remember? So stop bringing up black and white. This movie was funny as heck and so original. Jackie Gleason proved to be prejudice in Smokey and the bandit. Cool thing about those times is that people accepted things the way they were instead changing everything around. Racism is still as bad as it once was. The only difference is that the government pacifies the blacks by giving them all the jobs but everything is still the same, only other difference being that you can't make a movie that offencds black people or they protest, but yet do the whites protest all the 'Black shows' or the Black history month, or all the black celebrations held by public colleges? This doesn't create accpetance. This creates resentment in those who already don't accept blacks. Btw, did I say the Toy was good?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Effort But Could Have Been Better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie features two of the funniest comedians ever, Richard Pryor, and Jackie Gleason. the movie, which starts off as a very funny social satire slowly gets away from the comedy and more or less becomes a decent kids movie, with somewhat of a message. Richard Pryor is an unemployed newspaper writer who is desperate to find a job. Jackie Gleason plays a millionaire who has a spoiled brat for a sun. The three meet in a toy store unexpectedly, the sun likes Richard Pryor and 'wants' him, like he would want a toy. Richard Pryor, desperate for money agrees for some money to be the kid's toy.The movie is formulaic, but still funny. Both of these legendary comedians have two different styles, Richard Pryor a fast sarcastic kind of comedy, or Jackie Gleason's bigger than life boisterous style, but the movie caters only a little to Pryor, and almost none to Gleason's style, he doesn't seem to be a typical character he would play. The movie is kind of socially conscious, it is a typical silly eighties kids comedy in a way, but the two leads make this movie much better than another silly comedy. The two really add something to make what really would have been a mediocre movie a good movie.The only problem I have is that you only get these two in a movie once. This movie is well worth watching, but with Jackie Gleason and Richard Pryor this should have been an awesome movie. You put so much talent in this movie and it should have been something close to a masterpiece. With that said the movie is still very good and it is fun to watch Pryor, Gleason, and Ned Beatty in a nice supporting role intermingle together. The movie goes on to discuss millionaires, their omnipotence, racism, and many other issues in a non-comic style, the movie does have some very interesting points. While not great this is a solid movie well worth the time to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You would think that with comic legends like Gleason and Pryor, you'd have a better film. No to be. Actually, the problem with the film stems from the lack of story and the screen presence of Scott Schwartz as Gleason's whiny son.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gobbled penguin turds. It set back race relations at least 75 years and I hope Jackie Gleason is on his knees up in Heaven, invoking the names of Art Carney and Audrey Meadows while he fights for his wings. "The Toy" is such a dog that it woofs in the VCR and, hopefully, will one day run out of the house to be hit by a car.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its spelled: La Jouet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing, how does anyone of genuine comic talent get suckerd into making a BAD movie? La Jouet (the original version) was pretty much the same story. It was about how each of us can get caught in this situation. Not about race. The second the US Version did this, it fell flat. I bet if it cast another black actor as Priors boss, the tone would have translated perfctly. Not this obvious race issue that just was set out to be so absurd - it was unfunny and uncomfortable.Just to see Prior at work, this is not the reason to watch it. go back and listen to his albums.. or better yet, watch Blazing Saddles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Toy" is a guilty pleasure more than anything else. It is fun to watch Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason work together, but overall the film is way too disjointed and skewered in its messages to be a success. Unemployed news reporter Pryor is bought literally by Gleason to be a friend to Gleason's young son (Scott Schwartz). The boy is a brat, but soon Pryor befriends him and they begin to uncover Gleason's corruptive ways. Really hilarious at times, but still a few too many attempted messages to work by the final act. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfunny comedy starring Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason. Plot revolves around a toy--I would never guess. Considering it is directed by Richard Donner, the man behind "Lethal Weapon," this film is one major disappointment. Rated PG but should be R, for both language, sexuality and nudity (including prolongued shots of a portrait a man has had taken of his wife--fully nude).2 of 5 -John Ulmer</fullReview>

TOO BAD RICHARD PRYOR HASN'T DONE ANYTHING GOOD RECENTLY I LIKED HIM IN MOVING AND SUPERMAN III WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE SUPERMAN II. JACKIE GLEASON WAS FUNNY AS MR. BATES WHO OWNED ALMOST EVERYTHING IN LOUISIANA. THE BRATTY KID PLAYED BY SCOTT SCHWARTZ DID A GOOD JOB. THE BEST SCENE IN THIS MOVIE IS WHERE RICHARD PRYOR ROLLS IN THE WONDER WHEEL. THIS IS CLASSIC!!!</fullReview>
