		<shortDescription>Tops; far better than the US version, "The Toy"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has unfortunately been unavailable in the US. It served as the basis for the later US film, The Toy (star, Richard Pryor) but retained an integrity and beauty that was lost in the US remake. Pierre Richard plays the part of a man who has been purchased as a plaything for a rich man's son -- and manages to turn the role around in such a way that the young boy learns in a subtle but unmistakable fashion that all human beings are deserving of dignity and respect. A top notch performance by Pierre Richard, surpassing any of his later films (Tall Blonde Man, Comperes, etc.). I urge you to try this one out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a petite masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film in Washington DC in the '70s, and was captivated. Then I brought friends and saw it again and again. Unfortunately, it is not available now in the States, though the coarse remake with Pryor and Gleason has overshadowed it. How can this be?? Richard has a delightful blend of tenderness and integrity that urge the viewer toward a more optimistic view -- that one person can make a big difference in someone's life. And the ending of the film suggests that we need to give much more credit to our small ones' ability to recognize truth and honor. If you have the chance, see it. If you know how to lobby to get this film the North American distribution it deserves (in VHS or DVD), please get on board!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the World's Greatest Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film! Richard Pryor thought he could use a remake as his personal vehicle in 'The Toy", but the American Hollywood version lacked theinsight and the comic spirit of the French original. The film captures the arrogance and hateful attitude of the capitalist rich towards their employees to a T. I was laughing throughout the entire film! If you get a chance, check it out. I give it 100 stars on a scale of 0 to 10. Give it to Hollywood to mess this one up, which they did. When will we Americans get fed up with this LA butchering of an art form always transformed into commercialized spoon-fed crap? See the original and weep for Poor Richard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A newspaper reporter is chosen to be the human toy of his employer's child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(IMDB summary corrected for grammar and augmented.) When Francois, a journalist, tours a big store for an article, he is chosen by the son of the newspaper's owner, Rambal-Cochet, as his new toy. Needing money and unwilling to quit his job, Francois agrees to this ridiculous assignment. Gradually befriending the spoiled boy, he induces him to play at making a newspaper, unveiling publicly the tyrannical way of life of the father. The powerful emotional climax we experience with the child astonishes both men.This funny, thoughtful film is much better than its American remake and deserves wider recognition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny movie. Better than the American version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very nice and funny movie with several ideas tied into it. It is the original movie which was followed by an American version, The Toy. I feel the American version lost some of the important ideas that they were expressing in the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what he'll do to save his job...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>pierre richard is one of the great physical comedians of this or any other era. richard's body language, facial expressions, and line deliveries are as much a part of his characters as are the twitches of groucho's moustache or the twirls of chaplin's cane. yep, he's one of the immortals in my book.bewilderment, pain, false certainty, bluffed courage, sadness and secret joy flit across his face as fast as the plot requires. he can telegraph a mood by how he sits down in a chair -- or stands up.in this one he plays a journalist who, working for a rupert-murdoch figure, will do anything to keep his job, including being the non-sexual-but-still-dominated "toy" of his employer's foul son. this film is as far superior to the later American version as the sun is to a lit match...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sacré Perrin!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amusing movie about a unemployed man, François Perrin, who finally gets a job as a reporter for an important newspaper. The business is owned by billionaire Pierre Rambal-Cochet. His young son always get what he wants. And he wants François Perrin as a toy! Perrin doesn't have a choice if he wants to keep his new job. So he becomes a simple toy.Francis Veber scores again with this one. It's no masterpiece, but it's a steady comedy with good laughs all along. And the cast is good. Pierre Richard shines as usual. Jacques François too as Blénac. And Michel Bouquet is great as Rambal-Cochet. So funny when we learn how he buys his properties!Out of 100, I give it 76. That's good for **? out of ****.Seen at home, in Toronto, on December 2nd, 2002. I saw this film back in the eighties and I remember loving it at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An endearing 'Toy Story' made in France ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Style-wise, Francis Veber is probably to French Comedy what Billy Wilder is to Hollywood: a mix of wit, slapstick, a little dose of social commentary and an original story with an obligatory emotional core: this is the Veber's touch and "The Toy" marks the directorial debut of one of the most essential comedic writers of French Cinema, who, like Woody Allen -another comical genius- had the most scripts nominated for the Césars (French equivalent of the Oscars).Mind you, Veber's films might not be the most hilarious, but their popularity mostly relied on the emotional appeal behind the laughs. Indeed, Veber, with a remarkable craftsmanship, always knew how to to get the right emotion at the right time: the movie is not funny all the time but when it is, it is VERY funny, and when it's not, it's still positively affecting. And that's the secret of great comedies; their priority is not to make you laugh, but to tell a good and original story, and that's what makes the gags work while even the greatest gags can't be redeemed by a lousy plot.Now, to "The Toy"'s story. It's about a journalist, Pierre Richard as François Perrin, who's just been hired as a trainee in a newspaper whose CEO is the charismatic Mr. Rambal-Cochet, Michel Bouquet as an equivalent of Arnaud Lagard?re in France, the press tycoon with a hand on all French industry's key-sectors. Reporting in a toy factory, François is chosen, to his great displeasure and to the embarrassment of Michel Aumont (the head of the factory), as a new 'toy' by Eric Rambal-Cochet, the President's son, a rich and spoiled little brat, convincingly played by Fabrice Greco.The purpose of the film might sound silly, but this is the quintessential 'Veberian' touch: the little bit of fantasy handled in a rational way, such as the notion of 'bad luck' in "The Goat" or the father's comical mix-up in "Les Comp?res". I concede It's hard to imagine that a no-nonsense adult, especially François Perrin who doesn't have this time the usual goofiness of Pierre Richard's roles, would accept to be a little boy's toy, abandoning his job, his life, just to please a child. But Veber makes the suspension of disbelief acceptable, a credit to his writing talent that shows right in the opening scene.Pierre Richard with a beard is quite an unsettling sight and thankfully, he is immediately asked by the President's Assistant Blenac (Jacques François) to shave because the President hates beards. For some reason, it doesn't strike as an odd thing especially when we discover him. Very far from the stereotypical tyrannical tycoon; Michel Bouquet plays a rather affable and sympathetic looking man. This first impression is contradicted when he fires an employee (Gérard Jugnot in one of his earliest roles) just because his hands are sweaty, and when he sits for lunch and pulls a very long table in his direction forcing everyone to switch their plates, it's a surrealist moment but still important for the man's characterization.The set-up reveals Rambal-Cochet's degree of authority, he can fire whoever he wants and applies the slightest of his caprices to please himself, imagine what it would be for the only person who can control him. Imagine if the boy insists to have François Perrin, keep in mind that it's the 70's, and Perrin knows what unemployment is like, then, his acceptance is not only plausible but logical. It's even more logical when we get to the Rambal-Cochet's mansion and discover Eric's playing room, a dreamy set, a sight of heaven for any kid, full of games, from the most common to the most expensive, billiard, table football, Eric has any toy he could dream of but he acts as he couldn't care less, for one thing, he's not alienated by the world he lives in.How could he be anyway? There are just too many toys, and one can understand how he'd get easily tired and want something different, and Perrin's acceptance is never taken for granted as Rambal-Cochet tries to reason his son. The trust between François and Eric is a very slow process. François, prisoner of a situation he can't control, reminds of Joe Gillis in "Sunset Blvd." with the same powerlessness toward his 'Master'. But while another director would have ruined an excellent plot premise for cheap jokes- after all, you can do many things with an adult befriending an obnoxious kid- Veber doesn't fall in that trap and guides the film in the right direction, first by showing hints of a fondness on François, renamed Julien. And to realistically tackle François's natural reluctance, Veber goes farther in the very notion of toy that defines the film.François, called to join a strike against abusive mass lay-offs, quickly realizes his strong position. While he couldn't open his mouth when he was working, he could control his boss through his son. In other words: rather to be the toy of a boy than an adult, and as it appears, Rambal-Cochet treats his employees with the same carelessness than his son. The film even reaches a moment of pure brilliance and not quite unrealistic, when the President questions the limits of his authority when he asks Blénac (his Assistant) to undress in front of him. "The Toy" provides a very subtle social commentary about the power of press and its interference with many spheres of freedom and the way to resist the pressure, through courage, respect, understanding and a very unlikely friendship.And the very catchy music by Veber's composer Vladmir Cosma, who'll become a long-time collaborator, adds this touch of playfulness and poignancy incarnated in the film's final shot and incarnating the 'Veberian' touch in his much promising debut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny movie, great message!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyed the movie in the '70s. Saw re-make recently which made me want to search for the original. The re-make focuses (no pun intended) too much on Richard Pryor. The lesson is largely lost. I would still like to track down a copy of an English sub-titled version of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in French when I was 12 yo, and then a year after with Spanish subtitles. I watched I believe, 3 or 4 times over a two week vacation.It is a movie that I wish my children had seen in the same context I watched it. It is a movie that teaches a very strong message in a very funny way. Values were prevalent in the French movies of back then, nowadays sex and scandal have taken over.Pierre Richards is phenomenal in this movie. It became part of only a handful of movies that I watched as a child that I still remember.We need in the US to find a more expedite way to watch foreign films. The offer is simply just an insignificant part of what is out there. Netflix does not carry it. We need a distributor!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outstanding performance of Pierre, and let's say it can not surpass his performance in "Le Course a l'echalot" and not in "Les fugitives", because he plays it the best way, as he does always.Of course,it is only my opinion, and you have to see this one, if you want to have your own</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film in 1982. Our French teacher in High school took all her classes to see this one day during school. We were supposed to be immersed in the language while watching. Mostly, we got caught up in the story (and the subtitles) simple story that was simply told.However, the US version screwed it all up by making making it a farce. Subtlty is lost here in the US. I really would like to see it again, since I only saw it the once 20 years ago</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty neat comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When François Perrin is just back from unemployment, he wants to take no risks as a journalist. Unfortunately, the son of the president of his magazine sees him and says: I want him. So he is hired? as a 'jouet', just another toy for one of the most spoiled brats that ever existed. Which means, karting through the house, playing cowboy, and fussball.A neat comedy, good for some laughs, and highly appreciated by its audience. I think it appeals to the feelings of many people for a couple of reasons. Firstly the feeling of a kids paradise. Racing in a kart through the house, that kind of stuff. It also works the other way around: it is great seeing Perrin getting in contact with his inner child again. And at the same time it appeals because of the tragedy. The kid needs warmth and love from his parents, not just another gift.Pierre Richard is perfect for his part but I think the supporting cast is also quite wonderful. Everyone in the family plays it as straight as possible. Especially the father (Michel Bouquet, who had an awkward childhood himself ? read his wonderful biography here on IMDb), and Fabrice Greco as the kid. This was the only role Greco played in his life! How about peaking early in your career! The only part that was forgettable, was the part of the sister, but in many Veber screenplays the women are underdeveloped.This was Francis Veber's first feature film to direct. Already you can see Veber had a different approach than the people he used to work with as a writer of screenplays: much more steady photography, fewer edits, more symmetry. This way the comedic acting is more powerful, though it lacks the usual natural flow of seventies films. In a way, Veber's clean directing style fitted very well in the 80's. From this film on he directed a film about every three years, and in all his screenplays he stayed faithful to the same premise: coupling two opposite strangers. That's quite something, I never heard any writer doing something alike.</fullReview>
