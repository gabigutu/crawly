		<shortDescription>Out of the box</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a very young child, I grew up on the 1961 101 Dalmatians. I loved the show, and I remember thinking that it was one of Disney's best. So when the 1996 live-action remake came out, I had my doubts that anything could be as good as the original. I was wrong. This movie is absolutely fantastic! It is beautifully written and the dogs are so cute and loveable... but I think the thing that ties it all together is the casting. The characters were brought to life in a totally believeable way--from Jeff Daniels as the Dalmatian-loving, Cruella-hating Roger Dearly, to Ms.DeVil herself, played to perfection by the unbeatable Glenn Close. All of the actors fill the shoes of their characters, the comic timing is just right, and everything about it spells a Disney masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great children entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"101 Dalmatians" is perfectly good clean children entertainment. It's has a fun feeling and atmosphere and some great characters.John Hughes his writing style is notable in this movie. The characters and the humor are similar to his other movies such as the well know movie "Home Alone". The humor is slapstick like at times (especially with the villains Jasper and Horace) which works very effective for a fun children movie like this one.Of course everything is terribly predictable and nothing that happens in this movie comes as a surprise. It's simple fun and entertainment. The humor is simple but it's good and works effective.Glenn Close is perfectly cast as über-villain Cruella De Vil and portrays a highly memorable character. She truly is the highlight of the movie and steals the show. She also seemed to had lots of fun playing the over-the-top villainous but oh so fun character. Also good are the more slapstick like, stereotypical villains Jasper and Horace played by Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams. Another fun villain role is played by John Shrapnel who is perhaps best known for his role in "Gladiator".The fun and perhaps also a bit underrated musical score is done by Michael Kamen. It quite honestly is one of his better works.Children will enjoy watching this movie and I can know, since I actually saw this movie back in the cinema, when I was still a child myself.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney does it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an animation student, I frequently cringe when they make a live action version of an animated film, as they rarely live up to their cartoon counterparts. This is not one of those films. I loved it, the Dogs, pongo and Perdy, were outstanding, and even with computer stand ins, and Hensons creature shop, you'd be hard pushed to see the joins, the exceptions being the Wood pecker at the door and the two Racoons giving each other a high five. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson were great, Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams were brilliant as the bumbling lackeys, but the star of the show had to be Glenn Close as Cruella DeVille. I never knew animated characters could have real life twins, but Glenn Close was Cruella's, delightfully over the top, with more ham than a bacon butty. If you liked the cartoon you'll love this version as well. The only thing I wondered about in the whole film was how many takes it took them to get some of the animal shots, this certainly contradicts the old adage of not working with animals and kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've noticed something about John Hughes' movies: he started out writing about adults with child-like tendencies ("Mr. Mom", "National Lampoon's Vacation"), went on to actual teenagers ("Sixteen Candles", The Breakfast Club"), devolved down to pre-teens ("Home Alone", "Dennis the Menace") and then babies ("Baby's Day Out") and now that he's exhausted all the ages of man (except the elderly - don't give him any ideas) he's moved on to the animal kingdom with "101 Dalmatians".You know the basic storyline if you've seen the 1961 Disney animated original - Roger and Anita (Daniels and Richardson) meet and marry then their respective dalmatians Pongo and Perdita have 15 puppies which are coveted by the despicable Cruella DeVil (played con brio by Close) who will have them at any cost to make a puppy fur coat.What's new this time around? The fact that it's all live action, for one, and the formidable assistance of computers helps create the illusion of dogs and other creatures acting with almost human precision, plus the fact that instead of precocious voices for all the animals they act out voiceless against the human baddies, especially Horace and Jasper (Williams and Laurie), as if the animal kingdom were all channeling Macaulay Culkin.And, of course, since Hughes wrote the script, you know this won't be Shakespeare - slapstick malice is at the forefront with cute but noble good guys, ugly and dumb bad guys and lots of adorable animals. But not just dalmatians, mind you: there are all manner of dogs - sheepdogs, bulldogs, terriers, etc. Not to mention horses, sheep, raccoons, rabbits, chickens, pigs, cows, birds and even a mouse in one instance. All of them banding together to bring the dalmatians, all 101 of them, together safely.Director Herek brings everything together with assurance and all the actors make sure you know that this is a story that is first and foremost for the kiddies. Especially Close - complete with claws on her gloves and a different wardrobe for every scene, she not only chews the scenery but nibbles on it with every tooth in her head and savors the taste like a connoisseur. Bless her.This isn't the kind of movie that can be successfully analyzed. You either like it or not, depending on what kind of tolerance you have for kiddie slapstick. I like that, so I liked "101 Dalmatians".Seven stars, plus half a star for Close's diabolical work...and a half star more for the donations from the animal world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine, fine film. As good as the animated version, but different!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredible as it may seem, this film is every bit the equal of the Disney animated version of the same title. And it is DIFFERENT from the Disney version. This is a rare accomplishment, in a medium where remakes and sequels are so often weak.The film is made by Glen Close, whose appearance as Cruella DeVil is fascinating! She is even more evil than her animated namesake. But the rest of the casting of the film is also incredibly strong. No problems with anyone.The dalmations are most excellently employed. Virtually seamless integration of live action and computer animation. And also, the hosts of animals (live and animated) in the film do NOT talk (a cloying and sentimental habit too often indulged in by Disney Studios et al).The film is an adult's movie that children should also enjoy! The VHS version was good, the DVD version even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that truly is - and I don't mean to use the cliché - entertaining whether you are a kid or an adult. The dalmatians and other animals are a lot of fun to watch.Glenn Close must have had a lot of fun making this film, playing the evil "Cruela De Vil." Just as much fun, maybe more, were the two bumbling dog-nappers - Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams, I believe - idiots who were genuinely funny in their stupidity. Their dialog was hilarious.There are nice colors in here, too, so a widescreen DVD is good to have if you enjoy this movie. I didn't find the surround sound to be much.Speaking of clichés and such, there are some drawbacks here that were a little annoying to me, like overdoing the intelligence of the dogs, making them almost human-like with their abilities to understand English. In fact, it's taken to the absurd level level of some of the animals being smarter than humans. Please....give me a break! Also, you get the quick "film romance" in which two people (Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson) barely meet and already they are in love, getting married in no time. Please....give me a break!Still, recommended if you want a want 103 minutes of a "cute" story and don't take any of it the least bit seriously as if anything in here could really happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>101 Dalmatians, the ultimate Disney animated classic about none other than PUPPIES! It was clever, sharp, witty and just a wonderful movie and created one of Disney's most memorable and classic villains Cruella DeVil. So when I had heard about the live action version I wasn't too interested, this movie came out when I was 11 years old for goodness's sake, but I just didn't want to see what was already a perfect movie being made into a live action one, but my grandparents had bought it and we watched it together. I remember seeing it and really didn't like it, but as I grew up, it was on TV one day so I figured since I'm a little more grown up to give this another chance and still I'm not too thrilled with this new take on the "tail", lol, get it? Eh, my lame jokes, gotta love them.Roger Dearly is an American computer game designer, who shares his home in London with his pet dalmatian, Pongo. One day Roger takes Pongo for a walk, and the dog sets his eyes on a beautiful female Dalmatian named Perdy. After a frantic chase through the streets of London, Roger and Pongo discover Perdy likes Pongo; and Perdy's owner, fashion designer Anita Campbell-Green, is taken with Roger when they meet in St. James Park. Romance blossoms between both human and canine couples and Roger and Anita walk down the aisle. Anita works for Cruella DeVil, a sexy fashion maven with a great love for cigarettes and fur. Anita becomes inspired by her dogs and designs a fur coat made with spotted fur, causing Cruella to leap on the idea of making garments out of actual Dalmatians. When Cruella learns that Perdy has given birth to fifteen Dalmatian puppies she offers the couple a decent price for the newborn puppies, but the couple refuses. Flying into a maniacal rage, she fires Anita and vows to get even. She has her henchmen, Jasper and Horace, steal the puppies and deliver them to her ancient estate, but the puppies escape and now must find their way home.So I absolutely adore Glenn Close, she's one of my favorite actresses of all time and always delivers very on the key performances, now she was a great choice for Cruella, but I think it was just the whole idea of the movie that dragged her down, the whole cast as a matter of a fact is too good for this movie. It's just not as fun as the original animated classic, I think the reason the animated movie is so much better is because it was just more special and personal as it was hand drawn and a classic for so many kids who grew up with it. Maybe I am being stubborn where I'm just more for the original, but honestly this movie is just kind of pointless and not really for the kids nore the adults. I'd say it's not like it's the most horrible movie in the world, but it's just not worth it to go out of your way to watch it.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>101 DALMATIANS, in my opinion, is an excellent remake of a pure Disney classic. It made me feel all warm and tingly when Pongo and Perdita set out on their mission. If you ask me, Cruella (Glenn Close), Horace (Mark Williams), and Jasper (Hugh Laurie) were truly devious. If I were Pongo or Perdita, I'd probably do the same thing they did. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the production design was beautiful, the performances were top-grade, the direction was flawless, and Disney has done it again. In conclusion, I highly recommend this pure Disney classic to everyone who hasn't seen it. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent villain, mate - again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of those times when remakes are a good idea. It was a remake of a classic and it was the remake of an animated movie to a live one so I approve and it was a good attempt.Evil Cruella De vil wants her assistant Anita to give up her spotted puppies so she can turn them into a coat. Anita is fired for refusing and De vil has the puppies stolen along with many more and the adventure begins of trying to get them back.Of course this movie was no where as good as the original. It didn't have the dogs as the stars like the original and it took the heart out of it. It didn't have the hilarious cat from the first one and that was the funniest bit from the first one. With it being live action many of the funny stunts pulled off in the original was missing.It seems to me that working with that many dogs would be a horrible task for a film maker and you can tell that editor Trudy Ship had her work cut out for her here. John Hughes wrote the screenplay and he made a lot of changes, some obviously had to be made and some had to be made in order to modernize it, it was good and still true to the original.Glenn close WOW, what a perfect job she did here as Cruella, great acting and to me this is her best role. I love Hugh Laurie from House, and he was a great villain and stood out to me from this film. Also, I like Joan Plowright and enjoyed her as the lovable Nannie.Not as good as the cartoon, a bit longer and slow at times. Some great acting and some fillers, boring music that has already dated badly in the 14 years since its release. I also hated the C.G.I. and most of it could have been avoided. The movie was very corny at times, which made it hard to accept as an adult, but this is surely one for the kids...3 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly Disney film with a great villain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the live-action version of 101 Dalmations, a story where Fashion designer Anita (Joley Richardson) and computer-game writer Roger (Jeff Daniels) meet and got married along with their dalmatians, Perdita and Pongo. The dogs' puppies are later kidnapped by Anita's boss Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close), who is plotting to use their fur for a coat. As a result, Pongo and Perdita set out on a mission to find and rescue all their ninety-nine children from Cruella and her cohorts, Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams).Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson did an OK job in their acting and the execution and effects of the dogs were nicely done. However, the plot and story were filmed in the way that the animals were portrayed as "so cute that they're annoying." They're just a bunch of animals running around on the set and serving really no purpose or development in the movie, as opposed to the original animated version, where many of the dogs were given his/her own unique personality and charm. As a result, I ended up rooting for the villain. Glenn Close did an amazing job playing Cruella DeVil - crafty, sly and hilariously captivating. She basically stole the stage for me and it is rare that I would be rooting for a villain in a movie, which tells you how corny or annoying the heroes (animals) in this movie were.Overall, it's probably a good one for the little kids, but adults would probably prefer the animated one over this one.Grade C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glenn Close's performance doesn't save the remake's incoherent plot and unfunny humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is one of those films from the 90s I saw as a kid, but when years have passed, I took one more view of this film again. Besides I knew it couldn't be possibly worse than the earlier movies that the late John Hughes made in the classic 90s.Boy was I wrong. Never have I been so disappointed in this mediocre remake, but I don't think it's the worst movie ever made. Let me point out the stronger points.The cast is pretty tolerable. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson did alright as Roger and Anite Dearly. Joan Plowright also did alright as Nanny. Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams did very good as Jasper and Horace, I think, but arguably the best performance throughout the entire film goes to Glenn Close who did such a compelling job as Cruella De Vil.The visuals are very amazing that looked exactly like the Disney cartoon and successful details the look of London, Roger and Anita's house and Cruella De Vil's mansion. Gotta give the director some credit for doing such a great job for visualizing them perfectly. That's it for my praise.The reason why I became so disappointed is because the screenplay was made by the late John Hughes who also wrote screenplays for such great films like the first two Home Alone films, the National Lampoon movies, Pretty in Pink, Breakfast Club and many more, but his career went downhill in the 90s when he wrote screenplays for such great disappointments like Dennis The Menace, Baby's Day Out, Just Visiting, the Miracle on 34th Street remake, and Flubber. In here, his screenplay has pathetically contrived dialogue and inconsistently unfunny humor that seemed too childish.The story is unbelievably predictable. It potentially has some great atmosphere in some of the scenes, but since this a remake of one of the greatest Disney films ever made, we all know what's gonna happen next and the second half becomes repetitive.If young kids want to see this mediocre remake of a Disney classic, be my guest, but only if they enjoy Glenn Close's performance. Otherwise, even that doesn't save this remake from it's incoherent plot and unfunny childish humor.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cute live action movie all about Dalmatians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this so many times on TV and every time its on I have to watch it again and here is why.101 Dalmatians is a live action Disney movie based on the animated version. The movie is about two Dalmatians who meet in a park along with their owners who both fall for each other and they have 15 puppies. Anita(Joey Richardson) is a fashion designer who works for the evil Cruella De Vil(played by the brilliant Glenn Close who is sporting a Sharon Osbourne do)steals Anita's puppies along with other Dalmatian puppies to make a spotted coat. She hires two dim-witted burglars who helps her get the puppies with hilarious cauos along the way with the other animals that save the puppies from the evil Cruella.I liked this film as it was cute and adorable how we see two Dalmatians falling in love even though they have different owners(Jeff Daniels from the hilarious Dumb &amp; Dumber flick and the late Natasha Richardson's sister Joey Richardson who play the owners who decide to marry so that there dogs could be together). Its kinda hard to explain this film as its all about animals been kidnapped by an evil woman who wants to make a Dalmatian coat.Anyway if you like animals then check it out. Its a really nice film as well as a very funny one too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The picture is definitely for children. Stars Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson have so little to do after their park meeting with their his and her dogs, brief courtship and marriage.Glenn Close steals the film with her over the top performance as Cruela de Vil, a tyrant of a woman. The character has basically been created out of a mixture of Norma Desmond, Phyllis Diller and Lucille LaVerne. The latter did the voice of the wicked witch in 1936's "Snow White," and was totally memorable as the revolutionary carrying small guillotines with a hearty laugh in "Tale of 2 Cities," the year before.The film really takes off for children when it comes down to Cruela and her stooges taking it on the chin from the variety of animals sounding the alert when the 15 puppies are kidnapped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Glenn Close stars as an evil bitch named Cruel Devil in 101 Dalmations. I don't think that is right. She stars as Cruella Devile in 101 Dalmations. Let me just say, that this movie is funny and fun and cute. But to me, this movie would be total crap without Glenn Close because even in a movie like this she is excellent. I have seen the show Damages with her and she is such a bitch, it's great. I guess she was born to play a bitch. I am pretty sure we all know the story. Cruella Devile wants to make a coat with Dalmation fur. So she hears that a couple has just had 101 Dalmations, she tries so anxiously to take the puppies fur. The only problem that I had with this movie is that all of the pets fight back. I just think it's kind of silly. But besides that, I liked the film.It's got a good cast. Including Jeff Daniels, Joley Richardson, and Hugh Laurie as a villain who tries to steal the dogs. Or a henchmen whatever. I know it's not a great movie but you know what, I still give it a thumbs up.101 Dalmations:***/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Live action remake of an animated classic can't quite match the charm of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered as a "stand alone" story, "101 Dalmations" is a pretty good "gimmick" film, far better than recent, relatively uninspired fodder in the same vein like "Racing Strips" and comparable to a fun romp like "Cats And Dogs". But given its pedigree (sorry), the remake is something of a disappointment - almost every 'change' they made to the updated version causes the plot to fall short of the original.In its favor: Yes, Glenn Close was born to play a live version of "Cruella De Vil". Critics were all goo-goo eyed about her performance, but they didn't seem to notice that vocally she adds nothing that Betty Lou Gershon didn't have 35 years ago. Still, it's a lot of fun watching her stomp around in those ridiculous outfits and chew the scenery mercilessly. Hugh Laurie gives a spot on performance as one of the bumbling henchman that adds a jolt of energy to the movie whenever he's on camera (and his cohort is quite decent playing a Laurel to his Hardy). In fact, there aren't any "bad" performances in '101D', at least not from the human cast.Also in its favor: the screenplay goes to a lot of trouble to keep many of the most memorable elements of the original: the scene where Roger revives Lucky, the Twilight Bark, the puppies escape from the sinister old house while the henchman are watching TV etc. It couldn't have been easy to pull these things off even with CGI and animal trainers.Missing or problematic: Well, the puppies are darned cute, of course, and the scenes where there are massive numbers of little Dalmation puppies swarming down stair cases, across fields, hiding in hay barns, etc, are exactly as adorable and eye-catching as you would expect. But unlike the original, in which 4 or 5 of the puppies had speaking parts, none of the puppies have any personalities (just "gimmicks"). Similarly, Pongo and Perty don't really come into focus as "people" either - they are mostly blank canvases on which you have to project emotions.More importantly, the most intense part of the original plot - where the fleeing dogs manage to sneak onto a moving van under the noses of their pursuers, followed by a thrilling car chase - is tossed aside. Instead, Cruella meets her "Waterloo" at the "hands" of the animals in the hay-barn in a series of clever pratfalls and the henchmen just sort of stumble around the countryside and do themselves in. Yes, it's fairly funny...but it's just not as satisfying as the original denouement, because the Dalmations just aren't involved in it. And a minor quibble: making Roger a video game designer instead of a songwriter adds absolutely nothing to the movie and is in fact a pretty lame and transparent ploy - a fact the screenplay acknowledges by including the "Cruella De Vil" song (which Roger supposedly composed in the original) at the end of the movie in the credits.Anyway, it's still a pretty fair movie with some good strong performances from the human cast and some pleasant puppy based spectacles here and there. I can guarantee that little kids will love it. And I like it too...it's just not a strong as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>101 ways not to remake this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remade 101 Dalmatians is cute in its own right, but it does not compare to the animation by the same name. In fact, it is bland and not really memorable, except for the focus on evil Corella Deville and her streaky black and white hair. (She really *doesn't* have any fashion sense, does she?) In my opinion, it's a cute film, but it offers nothing more to the Dalmatian universe... maybe just a little less.I'm also not sure if this film is for very young children because there are a few 'violent' or powerful scenes in the film. (I believe there was a scene near the end with someone falling over a cliff. I think this scene led to discuss amongst mothers that this film probably shouldn't be seen by young children, which is a drawback because it was marketed at children and slightly revived the 101 Dalmations universe with a new television cartoon following and merchandising.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a cute movie. The original Disney classic set up the story, and this live action version is just as fun and entertaining. Albeit, some details were modified for the sake of live action, but these story elements don't deter from the decency of the movie. Glenn Close is quite literally the perfect actress for the job of Cruella DeVil, and Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson are a well-composed couple with decent chemistry. It's always neat to see other actors you recognize in movies you didn't remember them from, like Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams. They're more than entertaining as the bumbling lackeys who are given the responsibility of capturing the dogs. And though there is some violence, it's completely slapstick, so there's really nothing to worry about. I liked it as much as one can like a family movie. It's campy, fun, and appropriate for kids, so I'd recommend it.</fullReview>

She truly captured the part, actually I couldn't imagine anyone else filling the role as good as she did. The costume designs she wore were fantastic, the entire production was top notch.The supporting cast were very good too, and I can't faulter the set design either. Some scenes were hilarious (to me anyway) I thought Disney did a great job on this. The director and script writer should be congratulated also on transferring from the animated movie to real life.

From the opening of the film with Jeff Daniels being dragged through Trafalgar Square on his bike, having tried to chase Joely Richardons character and Perdita on her traditional Pashley bike. The opening of the film grabs you and sets the tone and in my opinion never lets up. The whole film is enjoyable and you never get bored. Well i am biased ; i did not get bored anyway. Go watch it yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>101 DALMATIANS has some good points. Glenn Close has received a lot of praise for her acting in this film and deservedly so. She is wonderful and very, very funny as the evil lead. She's been given some great lines and delivers them with comedic genius. The puppies are undeniably adorable. Who couldn't love them? But the difference between this and the original animated version is the difference between most old and most new movies. The new one has many cheap unfunny urine and buttocks material. Children's entertainment today seems to revolve around people and animals going to the bathroom, passing gas or scratching their rear end. There are a hundred and one cheap jokes in here that aren't funny and in poor taste. Yeah, I get it, the dog disapproves so he lifts his leg and urinates on a bad persons' photo. Ho ho ho. Ha ha ha ha. I can't stop laughing. Give me a break. The dogs are smart to the point of overkill. They do everything but play chess, solve international disputes, write novels and give dance lessons. The other villains are annoying and not funny though they are supposed to be. And the whole idea that anyone would want to murder these cute puppies for their fur is not the most pleasant plot theme to live with for two hours. The leading lady who gets her puppies stolen is not ugly but is not attractive either, and I thought romantic leads were supposed to be pretty or handsome. And violence against men is not funny to me either. She whaps the leading man across the face with her heavy handbag just after they meet. Ho ho ho. Ha ha ha. There are now 63,798 movies available for rent where it is supposed to be terribly funny that the woman punches the man in the face or worse. He always is knocked down with the loud ham slap sound effect as the audience howls with delight. There is definitely too much violence against women in this world. I don't think it's a great idea to compensate with unfunny violence against men in the movies. 101 DALMATIANS is a mixed bag of puppies. Long live Glenn Close! WHAT a performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Glen Close in this. She's a sexy, stellar actress, and I know it's immoral, but *damn* she looks fine in those furs. I'm more of a cat person, which must mean that I hate dogs, so I was hoping she'd get those puppies at the movie's end. It's too bad she doesn't?it would've been a nice slice of reality for the boomers and man-child kiddies. True fact: after this movie tons of Dalmatians were adopted and then given back to shelters. Ouch, and shame! Should've let Cruella have her way. It's what happens in real life, and we let it.Despite ugly reality, this movie kills me, mostly because I'm so taken with Glen Close. She's an elegant and beautiful woman starring in a bad "kid's movie," so you know she's bound to get her face dragged through the mud. Literally. But Close returns for a bad sequel in which she winds up getting baked into a giant muffin (I think) so I guess Close was getting something out of it (hundreds of thousands of of dollars? Oh, me too, please!!!) Still. Watching someone get debased on screen is hard to watch. If only she was hideous like the guy playing Horace. Ooh. Then we'd want to see her burn. On a semi-side note, kid's movies were at one point superb, like the truly excellent and elegant 1961 original version of 101 Dalmatians. So? when did they become all about hitting men in the pills?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>101 Dalmatians (1996): Dir: Stephen Herek / Cast: Glenn Close, Jeff Daniels, Joely Richardson, Joan Plowright, Hugh Laurie: Pathetic live action version of the animated Disney classic is a complete failure with lavish production. It regards quantity as these dogs band together to survive. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson own two Dalmatians that give birth to fifteen pups and the evil Cruella DeVil wishes to make fur coats out of them. The dogs are a disappointment since they do not talk as they did in the animation. One would think that after the success of Babe that this wouldn't be a problem. This film contains none of the suspense or detail of the animated classic, which makes the plot here seem very basic. It was as if the makers thought that making a live version was enough but without those important details of the animation it just comes off as bland with only an effective villain to carry it. Director Stephen Herek doesn't heed details from the animation. This ranks with The Mighty Ducks as among Herek's worst efforts. Glenn Close steals the film with her icy performance as DeVil making her the film's best asset. Daniels and Richardson sleepwalk through bland roles with Joan Plowright as their maid. Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams play the idiotic henchmen nabbing the dogs. It is yet another bad adaptation that turns into a big budget dog show. Score: 2 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a great storyline, it's suitable for the whole family and is entertaining. This film came out before I was born so I grew up watching these kind of films, and through watching it recently I have found my love for Disney films once more.There is an element of comedy with the names of the Dalmatians being 'dipstick' and 'whizzer' and the villains are fairly funny too, featuring Hugh Laurie from House and Mark Williams from Harry Potter with their name-calling and arguments with one another. With some scarier parts (when you're a child) such as when they kidnap the puppies and 'Mr Skinner' who has a scar on his face.Although, even though it is a children's film there are some very unrealistic parts of them film, such as how are the couple making money and can afford a nanny when they are both not at work or making money, why they marry after only knowing each other briefly and the typical 'scruffy van and tights over your face' cliché bad guys. Yet, this brings the film to the onset of it being very focused for children, and avoids financial worry and darker features.The dogs and their owners are very friendly people and animals, with an unpredictable storyline for children which keeps them engaged within the film. Overall, a very well-balanced film with many light-hearted sections.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I was hoping that they'd give Cruella better motivation since they had the opportunity. But, no such luck. She still just wants to make a Dalmatian fur coat simply because she's obsessed by the idea and doesn't seem to realize or care that she'll just be arrested for stealing and killing puppies.Glenn Close does make a perfect Cruella, and she overplays it even more than the original. It's one thing to see a cartoon screaming about killing puppies, but with a live action human it's just bizarre.Less than halfway through it seems to become a Home Alone clone, with the two bumbling villains being injured in slapsticky ways by determined animals.The animals do not talk in this movie. They probably decided it might make the movie too corny but I don't really think that's possible. It actually makes the movie more boring. A lot of the shots are of dogs barking or running, bunnies running, etc. In other words, animals not really doing a whole lot. The puppies run everywhere en masse but do little otherwise. There are a few named and recognizable pups, but because they don't have voices you can't tell if they really have different characters.Someone called this a pointless remake. I think they could have done a lot better if they'd made it less cartoony. After all, we already have the cartoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cute, but very silly at times, and not as good as the original.The original 101 Dalmatians, released in 1961, was an animation classic. Adorable characters, nice story, happy ending. Mostly meant for kids but had something in it for adults too. It wasn't perfect though: after a wonderful opening act it did lose some of its charm and substance and degenerated into a caper towards the end. This 1996 remake of 101 Dalmatians takes the same plot, almost to the letter, de-animates it and throws in more silliness. There are a few positive things added, mostly in dialogue in the first few scenes, and I thought the real dogs were quite cute, even compared to the animated ones, but most of the changes are for the worse.One big positive of this remake, however, is Glenn Close's portrayal of Cruella De Vil. Suitably intense and menacing.Overall, very little reason to watch this if you've seen the original. And if you haven't, then watch the original instead...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never likely to replace the original in my affection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dodie Smith's 1956 novel "The Hundred and One Dalmatians" was made into a very successful Disney cartoon in 1961, but 35 years later the same studio clearly thought it was time for a live-action remake. The cartoon was a great favourite of mine during my childhood, so reviewing this remake, which did not appear until I was in my thirties, is something of a difficult task for me.The plot essentially follows that of the earlier film rather than that of the novel, although there are some departures from both. It restores the original surname of the Dalmatians' owners, Dearly, although Roger here becomes an American, although the film is still set in England. He is also a computer-game designer rather than a composer (as in the cartoon) or a financier (as in the novel). His wife Anita becomes a fashion designer and an employee of Cruella's company rather than her old schoolmate. (Possibly because Glenn Close is eighteen years older than Joely Richardson, so the idea of their having been at school together would have been rather implausible). As in the original, the human characters are all rather overshadowed by the dogs and other animals, with one notable exception The original Cruella de Vil was perhaps Disney's most iconic villainess- indeed, possibly their most iconic villain of either sex- so they needed someone equally charismatic here, and found her in the shape of Glenn Close. This was not her first appearance as a villain; possibly her best-known previous role had been that of the vindictive Alex Forrest in "Fatal Attraction", and she had also played the scheming Marquise de Merteuil in "Dangerous Liaisons". Those two performances, however, were very different to the one she gives here. In the two earlier films she was concerned to give a realistic psychological portrait of evil; in the case of Alex, moreover, there is an implication that she is almost as much sinned against as sinning. There is nothing psychologically realistic about Cruella. Close plays her as an over-the-top pantomime villain, hamming it up and gleefully overacting- which is exactly what the role calls for. I was surprised to learn that Glenn Close was not the first choice for the part. (That was, apparently, Sigourney Weaver).The main difference between this film and the cartoon is perhaps one of tone. In contrast to the hectic look and garish colours of some Disney cartoons, the original "101 Dalmatians" has a surprisingly restrained, elegant visual style, typified by a palette dominated by (appropriately enough) black and white, along with cool blues, greys and purples. Elegance and restraint are qualities quite alien to this remake, which is not surprising given that it was produced and written by John Hughes, a man to whom those qualities are equally alien. (He was also responsible for films like "Weird Science", "Flubber" and the "Home Alone" franchise. Enough said). As one might imagine with Hughes, the film makes great use of slapstick humour, complete with fart jokes, poo jokes, a vat of molasses joke and a skunk joke. (Yes, I know skunks are not native to the British Isles, but Hughes evidently doesn't. That is not his only zoological goof- he also introduces a raccoon to the Suffolk countryside, around 3,000 miles away from its natural habitat, and that woodpecker is of a North American, not European, species).Apart from Close, the film's big selling-point is that real Dalmatians, whether adults or puppies, are even cuter than their animated counterparts. This film, however, is never likely to replace the original in my affections. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I feel bad for the actors...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember clear as day when I was eight and my sister and I begged my dad to buy this on VHS for us. We were in a "puppies are so cute" phase, which long ago faded (I now hate dogs and think they're disgusting, dirty animals). Nevertheless, we watched it and were both shocked at how bad it was! Don't get me wrong, the actors were amazing despite the pathetic storyline. Glenn Close provides an outstanding performance as the antagonistic businesswoman who thrives on conspicuous consumption and adores wearing a variety of fur coats. The soundtrack wasn't bad. But the plot was terrible, it was like watching a twisted romance film, and the crude humor was gross and unnecessary (dogs peeing on magazines, etc). The names of the characters are sort of clever but still unoriginal and it's Disney, so of course it's that hokey "puppy love" garbage.As I got older and checked out the movie online, I was surprised to discover that the dogs used in the movie were not treated in compliance with the animal cruelty prevention laws set in place at the time of filming. That's Disney for ya, too cheap to take care of its live animals on-set but rich enough to pay people to shut up.I highly recommend you avoid this one, it's incredibly lame and dorky, not to mention inappropriate for younger children at times. If you're into dog movies, try Beethoven, it's dopey but at least it's funny most of the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Dearly (Jeff Daniels) is a struggling American video game designer living in London with his pet dalmatian Pongo. Anita Campbell-Green (Joely Richardson) works for fur-loving fashion designer Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close). Cruella becomes obsessed with Anita's dalmatian prints and designs a fur cape. Pongo sees Perdy the dalmatian and drags Roger to chase down Anita with Perdy. Roger eventually marries Anita. They get pregnant while Pongo and Perdy have 15 puppies. Roger refuses to sell Cruella the puppies and she fires Anita. Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams) are De Vil's criminal henchmen who overpower Nanny (Joan Plowright) and kidnap the puppies.This movie is missing the voices from the animals. That's really half of the charm of the animated movie. This is a lesser remake for no good reason. Making Cruella a fashion designer is a good improvement. It makes more sense to have her as Anita's boss. However, that's the only improvement from the animated version that I can see here. Glenn Close tries hard to be a cartoon villain but I do miss her cool car. A real version isn't the same thing. And the CG is not advanced enough to make the animated dogs real. The kids are better off watching the cartoon.</fullReview>

I liked that they made Roger a video game designer and that he designed Cruella as the villain for his new video game at the end. There were lots of funny scenes from both the dogs and some other animals that appeared in the film. In all a good film that the whole family can enjoy and John Hughes did a good job writing the screenplay just like he did for some other of his films such as Home Alone. All in all 101 Dalmatians is a great family movie that anyone can love. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

I absolutely like Glenn Close's deliciously camp performance as Cruella De Vil. She has taken a cartoon character, one of the most iconic villainesses in film history, and made it all her own. I think it was real good for her to bring such a wicked character to life. Overall, I enjoy this film, enjoy all the slapstick recycled from "Home Alone" and it's a real good effort to try and remake the animated film. John Hughes, who wrote the screenplay, did an amazing job, as well as Stephen Herek for his direction. And I must say, those two crooks, Jasper and Horace, played by Mark Williams and Hugh Laurie, were very funny and really acted like the Chuckle brothers or Laurel and Hardy, and I like that about them. And Glenn Close really is the perfect actress to be cast as Cruella in this film, and her costumes, designed by Anthony Powell, are astonishing and fantastic.

		<fullReview>Based loosely on the writings of French animal-rights activist Jean Latrille, this movie succeeds in revealing the inhumane aspect of the puppy-farm industry, and depicts the heroic efforts of those who are honor-bound to stop it.Brothers Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams) mount a daring raid of a Dalmatian breeding facility, located incongruously in a tony London neighborhood, in an attempt to rescue a group of Dalmatian puppies that are bound for market, where they'll be sold to vicious and uncaring English families. The brothers are aided by their altruistic and devoted cousin, Crue (also, obviously, a heavy-metal fan) who is played by Glen Close.The movie follows the successful rescue attempt as the brothers lead the puppies through the wilds of Great Britain, where they find refuge at a paradisaical English estate. The film continues as a counter-raid, led by the evil agents of the puppy farm and abetted by hundreds of brainwashed animals -both wild and domesticated, is successful in recapturing the group of puppies, along with eighty-six other puppies previously rescued by the brave brothers. Crue is degraded in an inhumane manner, and the brother's vehicle is firebombed.The film ends as the puppies are forced to fend for themselves in the wilds of the English countryside, living off the frozen remains of dead sheep and discarded fish-and-chip wrappers. Later, reverting to their wild traits, the puppies form packs in order to survive. One such pack, led by the strong, dominant male Lucky, survives on the outskirts of London by, ironically, poaching on cats and small family dogs, and soon mount an attack on the very same puppy-farm that owes to their existence, along the way dispatching brainwashed animals, corrupt bobbies, and ego-maniacal video-game designers.Shot in cinema verite by French cinematographer Pierre Latrille (grandson of the original author) this film very aptly captures the idealistic brothers, the beauty of the English wilds, the random hubbub of big city London, and the horrors encountered by a group of animals born in the wrong place, and in the wrong time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>101 Dalmatians was a bland, inadequate, and completely dissatisfying live-action remake of the charming 1961 animated feature film of the same name - Both from Disney Studios.101 Dalmatians starts its story off as a horribly contrived boy-meets-girl tale where the thing that brings these 2 sappy people together is that each is the proud owner of a dalmatian dog - His is a male - Hers is a female. (Now, isn't that just too corny for words, or what?) 101 Dalmations' biggest and most damaging deficit was actress Glenn Close, as the ruthless fashion-house owner, Cruella De Vil. Close was truly terrible at this sort of Comedy. Her annoying, over-the-top, scenery-chewing antics weren't even in the least bit amusing, only nasty and just plain awful. Her despicable character quickly wore out its welcome within the very first hour of this picture.101 Dalmatians was the sort of story where the animals appear to be more intelligent and resourceful than their human counterparts. It wasn't until this film's last 45 minutes that these mighty clever beasts (dogs, raccoons, horses, and birds, alike) eagerly took their heroic part and ingeniously pulled together in order to help rescue the 99 dalmatian puppies from their deadly confines at Cruella's posh Suffolk estate.Through all of this strife one really had to wonder about the rationality and sanity of the ludicrous Cruella character who wanted more than anything in the whole, wide world - A full-length coat fashioned out of dalmatian puppy pelts. It was really quite unsettling to see what a kick Cruella got out of the thought that once she had her coat of dog hair, she'd actually be wearing her employee's dogs.Now, I ask you - Is that not just too unfunny and demented for words, or what??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last month, I watched the animated 1967 Disney film, "The Jungle Book", for the first time in I don't know how long and maybe for the first time ever from beginning to end. I then watched the live action 1994 Disney flick of the same name, which I also hadn't seen in a long time. This month, I watched the 60's animated Disney version of "One Hundred and One Dalmatians" and then watched this 90's live action version. I first saw the cartoon probably in the early 90's, before the release of this film with the number in the title shown in digits instead of words. I think I first saw this one in 1997, probably not long after it came out on video. I'm not sure exactly what I thought of it, but didn't see it again until this year, and now I think it's pretty dull.Roger is an American video game designer who lives in London, England and owns a male Dalmatian dog named Pongo. Anita is a fashion designer in London who owns a female Dalmatian named Perdy and works for a mean-spirited lunatic named Cruella de Vil who longs for a fur coat made from Dalmatian skin. One day, Pongo and Perdy both happen to be out for a walk with their owners in the park when they see each other and fall in love. They put their owners through mayhem while they chase after each other, but the two humans soon fall in love as well. Roger and Anita get married, so the four of them all live together and Perdy is soon expecting puppies while Anita is expecting a baby. After fifteen Dalmatian puppies are born, Cruella wants them all, but Roger and Anita refuse to sell them to her. She fires Anita and soon sends in two henchmen, Jasper and Horace, to kidnap the puppies for her! The two Dalmatian parents leave the house to try and find their offspring and call upon other animals to help them, while Cruella wants the puppies killed soon before the police find them! During my first viewing, it didn't take me long to realize that this film's version of Cruella de Vil, played by Glenn Close, comes very close (no pun intended) to the animated version of the character, but the Roger in this live action flick, played by Jeff Daniels, is a lot different. However, the problem with this Roger is not that he is different, but he doesn't stand out the way the cartoon Roger does. Daniels can be very funny, but he isn't here, which leads me to the humour, another problem. I never laughed while watching this film recently, and VERY seldom did I even smile, only in scenes such as the "cup of marriage" one, and the part where Horace does exactly what Jasper tells him not to do when he meets Skinner. Fairly lame parts include the "Whizzer" scene, and Nanny, the human housekeeper, barking in her sleep. The scenes with Jasper and Horace are generally not nearly as funny as the ones in the animated film, even if the actors who play them here, Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams, fit their respective roles. Some things are done differently here, including the way the two human/dog pairs meet, with the two dogs suddenly seeing each other in the park and sappy music to go along with this scene, and certain other scenes as well. Apart from some differences, this live action movie follows the same basic plot as the animated one, but seems to drag it out a little. It doesn't help that without any human speech among the animals (unlike the 1961 version), the scenes showing them communicating can be a little tedious.The live action 90's Disney versions of "The Jungle Book" and "101 Dalmatians" are both less popular and not as good as the 60's animated Disney versions, but after recently watching both of them again, I really think the 1994 "Jungle Book" movie is far superior to this 1996 release. That film, though significantly flawed, has some good action, memorable characters, adventure, mild humour, etc. to make it entertaining for the most part, and that's not the case with this one. I know it's more debatable whether the 1994 flick is suitable for kids or not, as this 1996 film doesn't have any gore, unlike that one, but I still stand by my opinion and this is coming from someone who saw the 90's version of "The Jungle Book" on the silver screen as a kid. This version of "101 Dalmatians" has more in common with the 1961 film than the 1994 version of "The Jungle Book" does with the 1967 film, but that's not necessarily a good thing. It might be one of the reasons why this film turned out to be so bland. Other than the occasional mildly amusing moment, a good performance from Glenn Close as the main villain, and just a very tiny bit of suspense, there's not much to give this movie praise for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a lot to enjoy, especially Glenn Close's near-perfect performance as Cruella DeVil. She was absolutely brilliant here, truly evil, and was clearly having a lot of fun. Hugh Laurie made a memorable appearance as Jasper, and some of his lines are very funny. The scenes in the mansion, were inspired, I think by the Home Alone franchise, and for this sort of film it did work. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson are more subdued but deliver very human portrayals of the Dearlys. Joan Plowright was fine also as the nanny. And Michael Kamen's music was lovely. However, I much prefer the animated version to this, and here's why. The dogs were very cute, but nothing they did was particularly interesting. Also the Twilight Bark sequence was lost, and that's what made the animation so poignant. It also isn't as entertaining as the animated version. All in all, an entertaining film, that just lacked the ingredients that made the animated version a masterpiece. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review summary: A good-looking live-action version of the animated classic. Glenn Close steals the show.I remember watching this numerous times as a kid (on a laser disc), and remember liking it so much. I haven't watched it in a while, but I can still remember it's zany fun. I can still remember Glenn Close's excellent performance as Cruella DeVille. I can still remember Michael Kamen's energetic and enjoyable music. I can also remember the funny antics and silly humor. But of course, I wouldn't forget those cute little puppies who wisely avoid all the dangerous obstacles, with the help of a bunch of farm animals. I didn't know it was actually a remake of an animated film until I was a bit older. But then again, didn't care. I'm sure both are as good (I haven't seen the original yet).So for a fondness which I can remember from my childhood, I recommend it to everyone who likes to have fun at the movies, and not take all they see too seriously.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why does Disney do this to great stories? Sometimes they apparently just have to go on and do this. The visual look of the film is really good, most of the points come from that exactly, the rest of it is just disrespectful. Maybe the youngest kids like this, but for a little older set of kids, this is under estimating them and their intelligence. Plus for the visuality, a huge minus for the intelligence and wit or if you will, the lack of it.Disney had all it all and they could have made this so much better. With just a few little changes, this film could have been fantastic, but it just didn't happen here. A word of an advice for Disney, don't under estimate even the youngest viewers, kids aren't dumb like you seem to think they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Animated Disney Classic Comes to Live Disney Life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Our story begins in London in the home of Roger Radcliffe. His dalmatian dog, Pongo, started Roger's coffee, started his computer and brought in the newspaper. Roger finally got out of bed. Roger's profession was in designing video games and he was currently working on one where some dogs outwit a dogcatcher but that game hasn't tested well with the young ones. Roger and Pongo went to the park. Roger was also a bachelor and thought it would be nice to have a Mrs. Radcliffe in his life so Pongo looked around for the perfect match and he found one: a beautiful woman with a female dalmatian! Roger had climbed onto his bike but Pongo lead him to the woman, Anita, which resulted in one crazy bicycle ride and ended in Roger flying into the pond. The bike was destroyed. Roger grabbed Pongo's leash, or he thought it was Pongo. It wasn't because Anita began beating him with her purse full of bricks and called him a thief. Roger then noticed he had her dalmatian, Perdita's leash. Soon they departed, but Perdita lead Anita on her bike back towards Roger, which ended up in another bicycle accident. Roger and Anita began to get close and soon got married! Pongo and Perdita did as well. Anita worked in a fashion design center for an atrocious woman named Cruella De Vil. Cruella looked over Anita's sketches and rather liked the one that featured her wearing a white mink with black spots. Cruella pointed out that it looked as if she were wearing Anita's dog; Roger, Anita and their dogs moved into a larger flat and got a nanny named Nanny. Roger was still trying to improve his video game but with no such luck. Before long, Pongo and Perdita had puppies! 15 total, well, 14. One was still-born, but Roger revived it and there was once again 15 puppies. That one was named Lucky. Right at that moment, Cruella showed up and tried to buy the puppies for...Her own evil purposes. Roger nervously put his foot down and declared the puppies weren't for sale. Cruella was furious. She fired Anita and vowed revenge and stormed out. She then enlisted the help of two bumbling thugs, Jasper and Horace. She also hired a pro dog skinner, Skinner. Skinner had a bad experience with a dog in his youth. One jumped up and chewed on his neck, ripping out his vocal cords so now Skinner is unable to speak and has an enormous scar on his neck. So one night while Pongo, Perdita and their owners went for an evening stroll, Jasper and Horace drove up to the house, entered, locked Nanny in the closet and snatched the puppies. When the owners returned home, the summoned the police but Pongo and Perdita knew the humans could no nothing so they set out to find their puppies. Jasper and Horace hid out at an abandoned house awaited Skinner and their cash. At a nearby farm, a sheepdog, horse, cat and several other animals got word about the kidnapped puppies and knew the kidnappers and where they were so they acted quick. They sabotaged their van and knocked at the door and hid several times. Jasper and Horace had several other puppies there too, bringing the total to 99 puppies. The cat lead them out of the house. Jasper and Horace gave chase. Horace landed in the frozen pond. The puppies raced away. Cruella stopped by and was furious at Horace and Jasper. She then raced off to find the puppies, they tried to follow but their stupid van wouldn't start. When it did, it caught fire and veered off the road. Jasper and Horace then followed dog tracks to an electric fence and got a shocking experience. Cruella chased the dogs into a barn and was taken down by the animals. Pretty soon, the police arrived and took away Cruella, Jasper, Horace and Skinner. The puppies, along with the 84 other puppies. Pongo and Perdita came home as well. Roger and Anita now had 101 Dalmatians! Roger had finally made a successful video game when he made Cruella the villain so they all moved into an even bigger house. Anita soon had a baby and the dogs had many more puppies. A pretty good movie. Glenn Close was good, so was Jeff Daniels. Joely Richardson and Joan Plowright were good too. It basically follows the same storylines as the 1961 original, only the cartoon was told from the dogs' point of view. This one is from the humans' point of view; Was followed by a sequel: 102 Dalmatians in which Cruella is released from prison and tries once again to make a coat from dalmatian puppies. I haven't seen it. So in conclusion, check out the animated version too. I think it's better, but they did a pretty good job with the live action version of 101 Dalmatians!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adds nothing new to Disney's version. A largely unfunny and uninteresting remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a rating scale of 0 to 100; I rated "101 Dalmatians" a 37.This remake was pointless. "101 Dalmatians" is just you sitting through Disney's "One Hundred and One Dalmatians" again, except it isn't good and it isn't original. "101 Dalmatians" is not a new film, it is the same as Disney's except its live action, but is that a good thing? Well, the answer is a very serious no.Fashion designer Anita (Joely Richardson) and computer-game writer Roger (Jeff Daniels) meet, fall in love and marry along with their Dalmatians Perdita and Pongo. But the proud dogs' puppies are kidnapped by Anita's boss Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close), who is stealing young Dalmatians to make the coat she has set her heart on. Enlisting the help of the British animal kingdom, Pongo and Perdita set out to find and rescue all ninety-nine pups from their fearsome captors, Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams).In "One Hundred and One Dalmatians", Disney worked hard and allowed the characters to be expressed properly, and Walt showed the evil nature, as well as the good nature, of the characters before banging into the action. In the remake, we get what the names are, we see where they live and then boom - right into the (boring) action! Hooray, that's what we really want, isn't it? No again! We want a good story line and we want to see the characters developed differently, and "101 Dalmatians" has and does neither. We just sit through a one and half hour of trashy dogs-running-away-from-evil-person-and-then-they-bump-into-them-again-so-th ey-run-away-again and so on and so on. Disney's version had a good script to go with the cute animated dogs and excellently drawn sets. Here we have a stunning Glenn Close, cute dogs and some good set decoration. But, where's is the script? Where's the intelligence?Add to that a boring and unfunny finale and you have a very missable movie on your hands.</fullReview>

The movie is just like One Hundred One Dalmatians with a few parts added and a few parts taken away. I think that Glenn Close makes a wonderful Quella DeVile. If you liked One Hundred One Dalmatians, then watch this movie. If you liked this movie, then watch the upcoming movie coming Thanksgiving of 2000 to theaters, 102 Dalmatians, because I believe that 102 Dalmatians will kick even more butt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney came out with this movie the day after Thanksgiving in 1996. It's called "101 Dalmatians," and it is the live action version of the 1961 animated classic. The movie followed the original story somewhat, but because it's a more modern live action movie, there are some things that are just different from before.Glenn Close played "Cruella De Vil," and she seemed like the perfect woman for the job!!!!! Her dream was to kill all 101 dalmatians and make a fur coat out of them!!!!! (My mom, back when the family seen this on opening day, heard that one little girl in the audience thought that she was gonna "eat" the puppies!!!!! LOLOLOL) Now, the dalmatians must stop her...or else!!!!!At the end, I really enjoyed this film. It was very good, very exciting, and had just about everything I had expected in a Disney film. Watch this movie; it's not a dull moment!!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A soggy doggy-bone...but Close gives it some kick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recycled comedy from Disney (now infamous for recycling their classic goods) featuring a bland London couple who are frantic after a fur-wearing sadist dog-naps their litter of Dalmatian puppies. John Hughes adapted his script from Dodie Smith's book, which was previously animated by the studio in 1961. Reedy-thin family-oriented nonsense has very few honest laughs, with a story that goes around in circles, culminating in a brainless slapstick chase and rescue. Comparisons to the animated film are useless, even though Glenn Close pulls out all the stops as Cruella De Vil. She's well in the spirit of the piece (aided by terrific make-up and costuming) and gives it a much-needed boost. Otherwise, the film targets easy-laughers who don't mind a soggy Milkbone. Followed by 2000 sequel, "102 Dalmatians". *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

The movie is filmed very good. The music is great by Michael Kamen. The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. This is a very good and thrilling film. If you like Glenn Close, Jeff Daniels, Joely Richardson, Joan Plowright, Hugh Laurie, Mark Williams, John Shrapnel, the rest of the cast in the film, Family, Comedy, Adventure, Thrillers, Dramas, and interesting Animal films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So... Disney thought they'd dip into the cash cow and try and rehash the already perfect with no need for modernization movie, 101 Dalmatians. Now with video games, fashion, and modern slapstick humor, this is a wonderfully terrible movie that seems to forget about the stylistic choices and just HOW the original worked. In the original, no one suspects Cruella of doing anything - Anita even states 'She may be eccentric, but she's not a thief.' One of Disney's more downplayed movies, the 1961 original featured wonderful characters, wonderful down to earth animation, wonderful backgrounds, and people you actually cared about. When the dogs go off- on their own - because nobody else saw the sings, it isn't a constant snooze fest of waiting for the off camera crew to have the REAL dogs do what they're supposed to do (in this way, Santa Buddies did it better) but it actually has, (because it was animated) the dogs TALKING. You understand what they want, what needs to happen - because they can speak their minds. Now, we have the police out to get the puppies as well - and Cruella, (whom Glen Close is a good match for) is played up even MORE to the extreme and completely unbelievable as a sane individual that no one would suspect. I enjoyed this movie as a child, but I can't get behind it now. It's too much, too silly, and the original did it right. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can remember seeing 101 Dalmatians on the big screen in 1996, and I can remember enjoying it. I rented it a little while ago to bring back the memories, but, unfortunately, this time the memories were going to be bad.Fashion designer Anita (Joely Richardson) and computer-game writer Roger (Jeff Daniels) meet, fall in love and marry along with their dalmations Perdita and Pongo. But the proud dogs' puppies are kidnapped by Anita's boss Cruella DeVil (Glenn Close), who is stealing young dalmations to make the coat she has set her heart on. Enlisting the help of the British animal kingdom, Pongo and Perdita set out to find and rescue all ninety-nine pups from their fearsome captors, Jaspar (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams).The real problem with 101 Dalmatians is that it doesn't dream up any new ideas. The dogs all do the same thing without talking and you feel like your sitting through Disneys version all over again, making this film nothing special or original. The characters aren't developed, John Hughes, screenwriter, obviously thinks that the way to develop chracters is by their name, eg. DeVil (devil) or Skinner. Glenn Close is, as in the sequel, fantastic as Cruella, but Joely Richardson and Jeff Daniels are basically inexcusable as Anita and Roger.Having said that, the kids will enjoy it and the dogs are watchable, but adults should keep clear.I rate 101 Dalmatians 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney, by now more a synonym for heavy merchandising and formulaic movies than for creativity and innovation, recycled their own animated feature ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS from 1961 about the evil theft of 101 Dalmatians, planed by the deliciously evil Cruella De Vil, who tries to make a fur out of the puppies, and their heroic rescue by a bunch of animals, to a 90ies-Live-Action-Family-Entertainment, helmed by Stephen Herek (not a bad idea, bringing in the man who directed the touching last-year-tearjerker MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS) and written by 80ies-Teenflicks-Maestro and Kiddie-Movie-Creator John Hughes (a very bad idea, taking in the guy who repeated his HOME-ALONE-formula once to often). Thanks to stupid kids falling for the cute dogs a box-office and merchandising-hit this failed attempt to evoke the loveliness and... well, kind of suspense of the original with real human beings and BABE-like special-effects-animated animals stands out from the usual modern children's fare by spectacular costumes, art direction and a over-the-top comedy performance by sexy Glenn Close who is the only thing about the Remake that's better than the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having fully expected not to like "101 Dalmations" at all, I was actually surprised by the first half hour or so. The human leads, Roger and Anita, have fine chemistry, and their dunking in the park, followed by a romantic proposal, was quite touching.Glenn Glose is also excellent as Cruella de Vil, making the performance just as campy and outrageous as it should be. Her office is an art-deco delight.Unfortunately, the film starts to break down when it moves on to the puppy-napping and chase. Instead of using "Babe"-like techniques to give the dogs the vocal ability they had in Disney's original cartoon, the movie sends silent (sometimes barking) canines running through fields, houses and barns. Occasionally they slide down ramps or drop people in vats of molasses. With many of the gags recycled from "Home Alone", this is neither original nor exciting.The original film was interesting because of its dialogue and plot developments, not the animation (if you look carefully, you can see that many shots have been recycled). When will big Hollywood filmmakers get it through their heads that special effects do not a movie make?</fullReview>

That's where the cartoon took place and that's where most of the live-action characters still get their accents.Raccoons do not live in England. They are a species native to North America. A better British critter, as clever as a raccoon and in the same family, would hail straight out of Wind in the Willows -- the European badger.The movie was fine otherwise, but this kind of thing shows Disney really doesn't care about details.

		<shortDescription>101 Dalmatians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked the cartoon version of this story, most kids will like this new live-action version. Golden Globe nominated Glenn Close plays the nasty Cruella De Vil, the woman who will do anything to get her new spotty fur coat. Jeff Daniels plays Roger who has the dog Pongo. Roger is a designer of video games and has been trying to come up with a good villain for his new game (he chooses Cruella in the end because she is suitable). Joely Richardson plays Anita , the woman that Roger falls in love with, and she keeps a dalmatian herself, Perdita who Pongo falls in love with. Later Pongo and Perdita have fifteen puppies. Then it gets more interesting when Jasper and Horace (Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams) show up. They also get the help from Mr Skinner to kidnap the puppies, and Skinner is obviously the man who kills them. A good film with some interesting moments and some humorous ones too. Look out for appearances by Tim McInnerny and Hilda Braid. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair. Cruella De Vil was number 39 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains. Good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistic License?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having now had the opportunity to see this film (or bits of) 3 times over the Christmas period (3 network channels all running it at different times) it's wearing a bit thin.Always good to see Glenn Close, and nice to see some lesser known UK names like the amazingly rubber-faced Mark Williams get a wider airing.It's a good romp but some artistic liberties have been taken: since when have there ever been racoons and skunks in England?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Performances of the three leading characters were quite good, especially Glen Close's character. Out side that and some interesting animal dialogue scenes there's not much in this movie. Scenes where human idiots get clobbered weren't funny and reminded me of those overrated Home Alone scenes. Anyway, **1/2 out of **** for 101 Dalmatians.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dog's breakfast of terrible nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Live action remakes of animated features almost always wind up being risky affairs. Disney's 101 Dalmatians, a live action version of its classic animated feature, goes well beyond risky and straight into idiotic territory. This jumbled mess of a film is only noteworthy for the animal acting and for an over-the-top Glenn Close performance that gets worse by the second. Unfortunately, even those rare elements of slight interest get glossed over by CGI and a ridiculous set of sequences that turns the minimalistic joy of the original into nothing more than chaotic clutter.101 Dalmatians strips all the elements from the animated feature for the sake of laziness, it seems, and what we're left with is a completely unnecessary project that demonstrates Disney's unfortunate unwillingness to fully commit to a film with heart. This Stephen Herek-directed movie "updates" the formula and adds a couple of dumb chase sequences to fill time, giving us characters that we don't care about and putting them in situations that cheerlessly mangle the original plot.Roger Dearly (Jeff Daniels) is a video game designer. He's an obvious update on the song-writing Roger out of the animated version and this proves problematic right away: there's no excuse for the famous and awesome Cruella de Vil song. In any event, Roger has a dog genius named Pongo. Pongo's pretty bright, but we have no idea what's going on in his canine head because there's no internal dog monologue. The key element that made One Hundred and One Dalmatians so fantastic is, alas, missing.Roger meets Anita (Joely Richardson) in the park after a disastrous and apparently hilarious pair of chase sequences because one wasn't enough to set up things. They do what any sensible people do after getting thrown into a park's lake and get married immediately. Also, they both have Dalmatians and now Pongo has a lover. The cuddly dog scenes show us they love each other. Aww. Anita works for Cruella de Vil (Close) a bizarre fur-loving weirdo with designs on the puppies Anita and Roger's doggies eventually have. You know the rest.Stunningly, this live action version of Dodie Smith's story was penned and produced by John Hughes. Yes, that John Hughes. How he managed to mangle such a simple story is beyond me, but he sure did a number on this one. For starters, this version sticks the humans squarely in charge of things and then jettisons them for the last act so that we get a musically driven dog's rescue sequence that eliminates the brilliance of the original because we can't hear what they're saying to each other.The best parts of the animated version are, therefore, gone. The barking of the dogs becomes a bunch of noise and the overwhelmingly invasive Michael Kamen score keeps meddling and telling us what we're supposed to feel. As much as I dislike the premise of talking animal movies, Disney's remake could have used a voice or two from the kingdom of the canines.Because the dogs lack voices and because we're focused on the dumb, boring humans, we don't really ever connect when the dogs go missing. The sequences that the animated version used to so lovingly attach us to Pongo and his family are gone, replaced by a grand "naming of the dogs" sequence that really only identifies the dogs by physical traits. This is another problem that could have been solved by having the dogs speak.Of course, having animals speak in these sorts of movies usually suffers from the fact that talking animals generally look stupid. But Disney doesn't seem to have any concern of that because they use copious CGI anyway, "fleshing out" the actions of the dogs and other animals when the trained canines can't do the trick. The discrepancy here is abundantly and embarrassingly clear, as it's hard to mask the sudden appearance of a CGI puppy heading down a slide into the snow. The large group shots of the puppies also shine with the clumsy computer-assisted stuff.In the end, 101 Dalmatians is a waste of time. While some may find value in the Glenn Close performance and some of the animal stuff, it wasn't enough for me. The movie is amazingly lazy, even by Disney's modern standards. The invasive score, the poor CGI and the bland performances from Daniels and Richardson make this a film to avoid like a creepy canine with rabies. And don't even get me started on the tragic absence of the beloved Sergeant Tibbs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, waste of a good cast. Stick to the cartoon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I settled down on a Sunday evening to what should have been a pleasant Disney film. Boy, was I disappointed.This live action version takes the basic elements of the original, but strips out all the charm. There's no cat. There's no scene where the puppies disguise themselves as labradors.Cruella is a mean business woman, who's annoyed that one of her employees (Anita Dearly) wants to get married and have children. Because obviously, you can't mix a career and having a family. The undertones of 'career bad, motherhood good' are just unnecessary in a modern children's film. Cruella is more pantomime than actually scary.The lack of original charm isn't replaced with anything else. It's just boring and predictable.This film has an amazingly talented cast, which is completely wasted here. The jokes are just not funny. Most of the film is taken up with lame, unoriginal slapstick. Part of the first sequence has Roger Dearly accidentally trying to steal Perdy because he has mistaken her for Pongo. That's right. He loves his dog so much, he can't even recognise him. The screenwriter obviously has either never had pets or just assumes children are stupid.The dogs are cute, but have no personality. The puppies have very little screen time at all. If you liked the sequels to Home Alone, you might like this movie. If you liked the original cartoon or any recent children's films that actually have a good storyline, you'll be disappointed. I'm afraid most of the reviewers here are giving this movie a pass because 'it's a child's film and you can't expect that much'. Well I do expect better from Disney and I wouldn't subject my children to this film. Try the book instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie is quite enjoyable but it definately lacks originality as it's almost an exact copy of Disney's animated movie Glenn Close is without any doubt the star of the movie as the evil Cruela Devil, the dogs were cute but not really funny, the crooks were clumsy and dumb which brought some laughing to an otherwise action-filled but boring movie Anita and Roger were really dull characters Not a movie to watch over and over again ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste Of Glenn Close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glenn Close is a very good actor. She was creepy in Fatal Attraction and awesome in Jagged Edge. She is campy and over the top in this live-action of 101 Dalmations and is virtually the only reason to watch this movie. True Jeff Daniels is good, too, but his part required little more than a phone-in.But this movie "must" be great for the kids because it has all of the formula elements of kids' movies, these days: 1. Bathroom humor: as when, in the scene when the humans are naming their enormous brood of puppies, they christen one "wizzer" because he goes on the floor a lot.2. Sooner or later one or more male characters get thumped in the privates. Normally I love this kind of gag, but this is such a ubiquitous, obligatory scene, that it's charm has gone away.3. The villain or villains get their comeuppance by getting dunked and/or covered in any number of sticky, gooey substances as an apparent homage to Home Alone and Double Dare. This has almost never impressed me. And the fact that it's Glenn Close who has to endure this experience is the biggest waste of her talent. She plays the scene really well, but it is so stupid that it's a waste of a really good actor.</fullReview>
