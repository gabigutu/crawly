		<shortDescription>Best comedy ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film seems to me to be the best comedy ever. Both Richard and Depardieu are wonderful. The film abounds in comic situations, but the dialogue is even better - lively, volatile, "French". It is both a comedy of situations and a comedy of words. This film is like a Mont Blanc among comedies. It's a pity that few people bother to vote for it. In Russia a generation grew up laughing at the characters of Richard, and this generation was far from being the worst. His films are pure joy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is wrong with these ratings??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just cannot understand how such a movie can "only "have a weighted average of 6.9 ??? Seen over and over and over with so many different people, I never could find a single person not laughing the whole way through!!! The usual "Different characters" are this time represented by Depardieu and Pierre Richard, both absolutely wonderful!! A must see... If you loved this watch "Les Comp?res" and "Les fugitifs" with the same Richard/Depardieu tandem even though they are a tone under "La ch?vre"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film has a wonderful concept and hilarious execution.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These two actors are great together, and their three films are all funny (La Chevre, Les Comperes, Les Fugitifs), but this one is the best because of its concept that it will take an unlucky detective to find the missing unlucky girl. But he is more than unlucky; he is also a deluded jerk (though not a mean one)who doesn't even know he is unlucky. His partner, a very competent realist (and perfect straight man) has to rescue him time after time to follow his unlucky course toward the girl. Great French humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Catch A Dork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was only Veber's second film as a double-threat (writer-director) and the first to employ the inspired casting of Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard. Its recent re-release on DVD to celebrate its 20th anniversary should make it accessible to a whole new generation too young to have caught it first time around. One only has to read the comments - almost exclusively raves - to guage the quality and I can only add one more voice, slightly hoarse from so much laughter in support. The concept is simplicity itself; take one accident-prone girl and because her father is an industrialist, ergo wealthy, let her predilection for bad luck result in her playing into the hands of kidnappers THEN, instead of hiring a team of SAS/mercenaries to track her down hire just One private investigator and supply him with a human bloodhound in the form of as big a dork as the missing girl. Pierre Richard breathes life into a dork who doesn't wait for a banana skin to trip on, he brings his own. Team him up with a pragmatic Gerard Depardieu who refuses to give house room to the concept of bad luck and just stand back and let them get on with it. The Mexican setting is largely irrelevant, it could just as well have been set in Marseilles but laffs are laffs wherever they occur. The ending is particularly effective - it's always something of a problem to end a story like this - as the two Dorks fall in love as expected but then Veber rounds it off with one last neat and very apposite visual gag. Not to be missed. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is from 1981 and it shows ... Still, it is one of the (if not THE best one) best comedies I have ever seen. IT IS DEFINITELY A _MUST SEE_ . The acting is terrific and I have not enough praises for the plot.It is better than the other depardieu/richard/veber movies ("Les Fugitifs" and "Les comp?res" - Yet they are very funny as well). The actors are excellent and Veber is the recordman about the movies that have been remade by Hollywood - there must be a reason for that. that with the praise of the people that posted their opinion here should convince you to give it a try.To sum it up : you have to watch it !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is THE masterpiece of funniness. Trust me, the big winner trio (Depardieu, Richard and Veber) shows one more time his talent. On one hand Pignon/Richard is the unluckiest man on earth, all the things you don't even think about happen to him and on the other one there is Depardieu, a cartesian private detective who doesn't believe in fate or luck, he disagrees with these concepts. Actually, by meeting Pignon, his entire life will be turned up side down because they must work together to find Pignon's Headmaster's daughter who was kidnapped in Venezuela. The worse thing will happen to the Laurel-and-Hardy-like team. You almost die of laughing so much. This is the comedy one should have seen once, just as "the Gods must be crazy." The movie is really worth being watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Situation Comedy at it's Best!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie back in 1982 when I was about 12 years old. I couldn't stop laughing. Another 12 years later I finally got the VHS... I thought I wasn't going to find it so funny because I was 24 years old, but I laughed even more!.. And keep laughing to this day. The film must have been so successful that this trio (Veber/Depardieu/Richard) made 2 more movies afterward, all of them equally funny. The way the director generates humor from everyday situations, shows a keen sense of observation and a capacity for caricature of the ridiculous in human nature. If one manages to abstract from the fact that it is not exactly a recent movie and if one concentrates on the humor of the situations, attitudes, face expressions, etc... One will easily realize that it is not needed to behave like a clown, falling dressed on a swimming pool or smashing wedding cakes on someone's face... Or screaming vulgar words, to be funny. A true Golden "Oldie", and a definite must see!..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Idiot's delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remade less successfully as Pure Luck, the first of Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu's teamings, La Chevre, is still the best of the bunch. Richard's the idiot accountant assigned to find a missing girl in South America simply because he's every bit as accident-prone as she is, while Depardieu's the worldly private eye who has to pretend to be working for him while really running the case and trying to keep him out of trouble. You can pretty much fill in the gaps from there, but that doesn't make it any less funny. Richard's pratfalls work not just because they're unsensationally directed rather than heavily telegraphed (one even takes place out of focus in the background) but because, like Clouseau, Richard's character doesn't know he's a clumsy idiot. In fact, he thinks he's the epitome of cool and control. But it's Depardieu who really makes the film, his underplayed exasperation and beautiful reaction shots easily the funniest thing in the film, especially as he realises with increasing fatalism that Richard's bad luck is starting to rub off.Kino's R1 DVD transfer suffers from being a standards conversion from PAL, which is acceptable but has some blurring not present on the Australian DVD (where the film is also available on a triple-disc set with Les Comperes and Les Fugitifs).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cute silly little comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the video box described the pairing in this movie as reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy, I think this is greatly overstating things. However, it is still a very good movie and worth your time.The story concerns the abduction of a VERY unlucky girl and the investigation into her disappearance. Gérard Depardieu is a competent kick-butt detective that is unable to find her after searching 42 days. Then a psychologist suggests to her rich father that they are going about searching in the wrong way--to find such an unlucky girl they should use a man equally as unlucky as they are bound to be drawn to each other! Silly as it may seem, this strategy seems to have something going for it, but Depardieu feels quite miffed that this boob, Pierre Richard, keeps blindly stumbling into important clues.While this is not the funniest movie, it certainly does offer quite a few laughs. When I find myself laughing out loud, I know it must be a pretty good comedy!FYI--I probably SHOULD take off another point from the score, as the movie had two stupid moments: in the jungle in Mexico, our heroes encounter a gorilla AND a cobra--this isn't even the right continent for either!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like Gérard Depardieu, discover this gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see what comedy should be, instead of the gross-out humor passed off as comedy in movies like Austin Powers, see this film. This forgotten gem stars a very young Gérard Depardieu as adetective hired to find the missing daughter of a business. It is shot in the French tradition of visual comedy, and is very, very funny.POSSIBLE SPOILERS:Gérard's character, a no-nonsense detective who does not believe in superstitions or "luck", has been teamed with a hapless man whose life seems to disprove the notion that bad luck does not exist. The missing girl also has had a life of extraordinary mishaps, and her father believes that this poor schmuck will be like a guide dog leading Depardieu straight to her. Depardieu's mission becomes more and more simply trying to keep this poor shmoe alive as he searches for the businessman's daughter, and continues to disbelieve his claims of bad luck; until it starts to rub off on him. By the end of the film, he is a superstitious nervous wreck, and it is fun to see this handsome leading man developing a nervous tic and believing the smallest occurrences are "a sign" that something bad is about to happen. A long stream of unpredictable and inventive incidents occur throughout the movie that would convince anyone that carrying a lucky charm is not such a bad idea after all. The end is a masterpiece of French visual humor. If you like Depardieu, check this out sometime. There are worse ways (and movies) to spend your evening. By the way, Martin Short and Danny Glover remade this movie a few years ago, and it was not a tenth as funny as the original; proving that American screenwriters need to smarten up their writing. Seven stars for me.</fullReview>

Richard and Depardieu are at their best while their characters experience mishap after mishap in trying to find a businessman's daughter. Remade a decade later as "Pure Luck", this film stands as further proof that the original usually outshines the remake. Rent this film if you like to laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see French comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best french comedies. It has a good plot, humor and acting. Pierre Richard and Gérard Depardieu make a great comic duo. This movie was remade in USA and named "pure luck" but i think french version was funnier and the acting was much better than in American version. Althou if you already seen the American version than there is no point watching this because even jokes were the same in both versions. On the other hand i've watch this one only after watching "pure luck" and i still liked this version more. I don't know what more i could say about this film just watch it. And if you liked this one you should watch other Pierre Richard and Gérard Depardieu films like Les Comp?res and Les Fugitifs, they all were directed by Francis Veber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is by far the best comedy (french or otherwise) I have ever seen.If you haven't already seen it, it is a must. The story is totally original, it is delightful, smart, extremely funny and timeless. The casting is brilliant. Everybody knows that Pierre Richard is one of the best french comedian ever and his interpretation of "Pignon" is flawless, he is at the same time endearing, silly and funny. Nevertheless, in this movie, it is Gérard Depardieu's rough private eye character that, by far, steals the show. His interpretation of "Campana" alone his worth seeing. And, if for no other reason, you just have see how funny this "tough guy" can really be. He will make you double over with his strait to the point one liners. He is nothing less then hilarious. Truly a must.</fullReview>

Look for when it will appear and enjoy a wonderful comedy about a missing French Industrialist's daughter, and how she is found.This is the kind of movie that you don't really have to read the sub-titles.

		<shortDescription>I only hope you'll be LUCKY enough to discover this gem of French Comedy ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With so many scripts such as "The Tall Blond with a Black Shoe", "A Pain in the Ass" and the internationally acclaimed "The Birdcage", Francis Veber already confirmed in the 70's his status as one of the most promising and talented comedic screenwriters of French Cinema, the equivalent of Billy Wilder if we also take his directing into consideration. But in the early 80's, he had only directed one movie called "The Toy", starring Pierre Richard and released in 1976. And although the film was a modest commercial success, it was not until the release of "The Goat" in 1981 that Veber made his deserved entrance in French Comedy's Hall of Fame."The Goat" is now regarded as a classic of French comedy and a film that didn't lose its appeal after 30 years. Featuring for the first time the duo made of Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard, who would appear in two other films, the film uses the basic ingredients of the typical buddy movie with the funny guy and the straight one, in other words, the eternal "odd couple", but that's only on the surface, don't let yourself fooled by the poster. Behind the laughter, "The Goat" accomplishes something more impressive, it makes us care for the two characters and not just on a comedic aspect. Indeed, no matter how funny the gags are, what makes the film so impacting is the progressive bond going between Campana (Depardieu) and Perrin (Richard), who'll learn to get along despite their differences. Any other director would have made this material cliché, but Veber always finds the right note, and seems to get the best from the two lead actors, making the supporting cast more forgettable and guilty of providing a false feeling of B-movie. For instance, the movie is set in Mexico, but people there speak good French with no accent whatsoever, these details were perceived as futile precisely because the story was the most important.I don't want to make the film sound serious when it's indeed a great comedy, still funny and fresh by today's standards. My point is that the core of the film is the relationship transcended by Depardieu and Richard's incredible performances. Pierre Richard is like the 'Steve Martin' of French comedy, with a natural clown-face that made him the perfect lovable loser of French Cinema. Richard plays François Perrin, a modest accountant so unlucky and accident prone that no day of his life passes without him being victim of a misfortune. What could have lead to a series of goofy situations is not overdone in the film as the point is not Perrin's bad luck, but how his bad luck would lead to the rich businessman's daughter, Marie. This point is essential because it explains the failure of the dreadful American remake: "Pure Luck" (starring Danny Glover and Martin Short). Marie appears in the first scenes, she's kidnapped in Mexico and apparently suffers from the same bad-luck syndrome than Perrin. After many fruitless investigations, the father's psychologist suggests that the detective Campana goes back to Mexico with Perrin, feeling that this time, Perrin's bad luck would be the compass guiding them to Marie.We laugh at this premise that flirts with fantasy, and of course, Campana, the tough-guy detective played by Gerard Depardieu comfort our feelings and embodies our thoughts. He's a no-nonsense guy, reasonable and don't believe in luck or hazard, but It's a last-chance mission and Perrin, after having given a luminous demonstration of his daily bad luck through a funny test involving chairs, is chosen for "his remarkable intelligence and perspicacity" to look for Marie, with Campana as an assistant. The duo works perfectly, because Perrin is not naturally funny, but funny despite himself, he takes his role, his mission so seriously that he's incapable to realize his total incompetence. And we see him trough the condescending eyes of Campana. I read in the Trivia section that Depardieu wanted to play Perrin's part; this proves that he's one hell of an actor, but not much of a casting agent. Depardieu, as the duo's straight-man, is the one who makes the situations funny. When Perrin accidentally burns Campana's tie, it's funny okay but the look on Depardieu's deadpan face is the laugh-out-loud pay-off. Depardieu's reactions are almost as equally hilarious as Richard's clumsiness, if not more.And as the story progresses, and some of Richard's misadventures start to give clues about Marie's disappearance, we understand that the psychologist's theories are not without validity, but at this precise moment, the focus is more on Depardieu and Richard's odd couple, and its evolution, especially when Campana's confidence about the nonexistence of bad or good luck starts to be seriously shaken, through his companionship with Perrin. At one point, both are in jail with another prisoner, and then they're informed that every day, the guards take one prisoner to beat him badly, Depardieu's pitiful face while looking at Richard, made me laugh so hard, but the twist that went after literally killed me. If only for the 'prison part' which is pure comedy gold, the film deserves to be a classic among the classics. Although, I would have done it without some gags, like the inexcusable gorilla coming from nowhere, while there are no Apes in South America. Apart from this one, the rest works perfectly.And speaking of South America, the film also possesses an undeniable escapist value from the setting, something that would appeal to every audience, and it's beautifully served by whom I believe to be the greatest French composer ever: Vladimir Cosma. Cosma who scored Veber's films and some of the most classic French comedies beautifully conveys this mix of exoticness and melancholy in his theme and it perfectly serves the film's conclusion, which is as poetic and satisfying as any other movie's endings, magnificently closing the first opus of one of the most defining duos of French comedy: Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious French comedy only the way the French can do it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those cool French movies with weird characters and it makes me want to come back to them. Unfortunately, like all movies, there are some good and some bad. This is one of the good ones.The extremely clumsy daughter of a Paris businessman is kidnapped on a trip to Mexico. She is not taken for a ransom, but for a prostitute, but ends up proving too much trouble. The father, desperate to find his daughter again, decides to listen to his weird psychologist who suggests that he look for his daughter by using another clumsy person. As such, this movie becomes an odd couple with a detective and a clumsy oath having to work together to find this woman.This is a good little movie with a lot of slapstick humour. Slapstick, done well, can be very funny. I think it is done quite well in this movie. In fact, the clumsy characters mean that a lot of the comedy relies on slapstick, and the occasional stupid statement. I think that it is done quite well.The one thing that comes out of the movie is the idea of true love. This only comes in right at the end, but it works on the idea of the soul mate - that is one person has somebody who is so much alike that they will find each other and be instantly attracted to each other upon meeting. We don't understand this until the end, where they see each other, and simply walk out onto the pier hand in hand. There is not sweet talk or anything, they simply take each others hands and walk out - as if it was always meant to be. This, to me, is one of the most beautiful scenes that I have ever seen.I, of course, don't believe in the idea of the soul mate, or true love. There are people which we are more attracted to than others, and sometimes things like this will happen, but the idea that everybody has a soul mate is not true. Some people say that God has a person set aside for us, but that is not what the bible says. In fact, the bible says that some people will not get married, preferring to do God's work alone. People, like my mother and father, love each other very much, but are hardly considered to be soul mates. In fact, the saying that opposites attract is more true than not.Still, this is a beautiful little movie and I really did enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With actors like Depardieu and Richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie. But Weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth. This movie is high on story but low on character. You never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick. Unfortunately Weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. His style could be described at hit and miss. Of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor at this lot. It is a shame how bad he uses good talent. Many good french comedians have been wasted away by mediocre directors.</fullReview>
