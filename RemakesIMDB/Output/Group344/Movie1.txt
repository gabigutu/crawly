		<shortDescription>It's "pure luck" this movie is bashed so unfairly!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why does Martin Short always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop? And even more so, why does he get the fuzzy end unrightfully? "Pure Luck" is a funny movie with some very funny moments of genuine comedy. It relies more on subtlety than on loud antics; more on characters than on pure gags. It's pure luck this movie is bashed so unfairly.Short plays Proctor, a bumbling man who doesn't find bad luck - bad luck finds him. He would be the one the automatic sliding door doesn't open for; he would be the one that chooses a chair with a broken leg; he is the one who would be capable of finding an equally unlucky woman lost in Mexico, whose father is Proctor's boss. Proctor's boss figures that singe he's such a bad luck charm, his daughter - who is just like Proctor - would be found much quicker if they used another luck-impaired civilian to find her. Of course, Proctor thinks he has been chosen for being a great mystery solver. During the entire film he walks around thinking that he was chosen for the job because he is good. But alas, that is not the case.Danny Glover is the head honcho looking over Proctor to lead him along - but Proctor thinks he himself is in charge, and that Glover is his co-detective. Some funny scenes come out of this.A movie like "Pure Luck" is fun not because it is wildly outrageous (i.e. not Jim Carrey humor), not because it has great direction, but simply because it has a more subtle humor reminiscent of an older type of film; its actors are terrific (whatever happened to Danny Glover and, even more so, Martin Short?); the script is funny.Is it just me or is Martin Short a funny guy? He's got the comedic timing all down-pat, he has comical facial expressions, comical guestures - what can I say, he's a comical guy. People seem to forget his roles in "The Three Amigos" (alongside Steve Martin and Chevy Chase), "The Father of the Bride" (also with Steve Martin), and so on. But I think he's talented.And Danny Glover ("Lethal Weapon") is a great character actor who hasn't appeared in many films over the past few years. Maybe "Predator 2" put him out of the game for a while. But he was in "The Royal Tennenbaums," so . ..?This is a funny movie more character-driven than anything; it has an element of subtle humor that adds a charm to it. I really don't care if people don't like this movie - it's one of those that everyone I talk to loves, yet the general public seems to have a different opinion. Odd - is it just me, or is this funny stuff?3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It can cheer up your day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is a great funny film that can cheer up any day of your life and keep you thinking on some of the scenes after it's been finished.The combination between Danny Glover and Martin Short even when is a bit strange it really works out in a funny way and how the story been such a simple plot can take you from the desert to end up in the waterfalls in the beautiful Mexico.There is a certain American humor that i can enjoy a lot, this film belongs to that type, because even when is about bad luck and how funny that could be, is never over the top and you are just waiting what would be the next thing to happen.I didn't stop laughing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what all the negative comments are about. This film is absolutely superb fun. It has been my family's favorite comedy for years. We've got more funny lines from this film than any other.This is Martin Short at his best. He plays the part to perfection. His facial expressions, body movements, and vocal intonations are exactly what this character needed. I'd like to see all these negative people do better!Danny Glover is excellent as well. The perfect complement to Short. I can't wait to add Pure Luck to my DVD collection. If anyone knows of an on-line petition for getting this movie to DVD, please let me know!! I'm there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully funny, slapstick adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What has everybody got against this movie? It's damn funny! Martin Short and Danny Glover going over from NYC to Mexico to search for the accident-prone daughter of Short's big company boss Highsmith. Monosoft, played by the brilliant Harry Shearer, has the idea of sending Eugene Proctor (Short) to Mexico with detective Raymond Campanella (Glover). The jokes come thick and fast and, although sometimes predictable, the movie goes along fine with plenty of wonderful slapstick thrown in all over the place. Probably the funniest scene of Eugene inflating to twice his size because of a bee sting in the helicopter! All in all, this is not a movie to be taken too seriously! It's a funny, light-hearted film with plenty of action and comedy thrown in that will always entertain well for people of all ages.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but still only a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect to like this film, but I have to admit that it was a better than average comedy, and I laughed several times even though I knew exactly what was about to happen. So on it's own terms, this is a good enough movie. However, I have a problem. The problem is that this American remake of "La Chevre" pales in comparison. There was just something about the pairing of Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu that easily outshined the American tandem of Martin Short and Danny Glover. Only watch this inferior version if you really hate subtitles, but instead of watching a great movie, you'll only be watching a good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sit-down, family film is definitely something to have among your classics. Ten years after my first viewing of the movie, my family, friends and I occasionally bring up a "What was that movie where..." line. We refer back to pure luck and think how funny it was. The movie is very creative. It is the best portrayal of bad luck I have ever seen. If you have not yet seen this movie, and are looking for something hilarious, fun, imaginative, creative, and that will leave a positive impression on you and your family, than this movie is definitely for you. While reading through the ratings, I encountered some negative ratings. This film is definitely better than those people made it out to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I enjoyed the movie and got a laugh from it. You can watch it with your Kids! Get the pop-corn out. Kids from 8 to 13 will get a kick out of this. (well most will). My family loved Its A Mad Mad Mad world ,and have watched it many times. Pure Luck is not worth as many viewings, but is well worth an evening with the kids. Martin Short is the most unlucky person and Danny Glover is funny as well. There are not many movies theses days that can whole family can watch together. There is not much to find offensive in this movie. If you would like to see the range that Danny Glover can play watch this and Gone Fishing (with the kids). Then put them to bed and watch SwitchBack. I like him better in the comic roles but he can be sinister as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very funny movie that deserves to rated much higher than it is! I have seen it several times and always laugh hard. It was witty and cleverly written, and I think Short and Glover play very well off of each other (contrary to what many reviewers have said.) The scene in the mission is among the funniest things ever put to film. I don't need to write a book about this...you just need to rent it for yourself and you'll understand. It is a true comedy classic despite being a lesser-known film (like some of the other "bests" I might add.)While there is not a lot of "substance" to this movie, for pure comedy, it is amongst the best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of fun but not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was something very special in the chemistry between French actors Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard that was lacking in the Martin Short, Danny Glover comedy team. In fact, the trio of comedy films that Depardieu and Richard did together was quite funny: Les Comperes, Les Fugitifs, and La Chevre. Each of those films was re-made by Hollywood (Father's Day, Three Fugitives, and Pure Luck) but each unfortunately fell short of the hilarious originals. The original Depardieu character in La Chevre was an impatient take-charge man who always had to exercise self-control in the presence of the guy with bad luck, knowing all the while that he was really the professional private eye and the competent one and forced to play along with the Richard character's self-delusions about his own investigative prowess. Depardieu was the rational Cartesian man who didn't believe in good or bad luck and you had the constant feeling he was about to boil over as the Pierre Richard character continually proved him wrong. I felt there was a more dramatic turnaround in this character's eventual dumbstruck realization that good and bad luck existed in the original comedy. His wide-eyed disbelief at the end when they found the missing girl was an emotional high-point in the original, whereas the American version wasn't nearly as moving. I didn't feel the mounting sense of frustration and aggravation from the Danny Glove character, who played it a little too coolly, in my opinion. Also, Pierre Richard's character in the original approached every incident of bad luck with the same comic serene self-confidence as though it were something completely normal. I didn't get this sense of Barney Fife nerdish swagger as the man who thought he was in charge of the mission from the Martin Short character. Above all, I didn't see the same degree of conflict between the two characters that ended in true affection in the re-make as I saw in the original. They were too nice to each other throughout the film. In the original, the Pierre Richard character tries to physically attack the Depardieu character in the end, but only succeeds in badly hurting himself. The American version doesn't involve this conflict at the end. The characters in the American version didn't seem to have as firm a grasp on who they were. Nonetheless, the idea of the film is very original (a man with total bad luck is the last resort for finding a missing girl who has identical uniform bad luck) and Pure Luck is a film that is a lot of fun to watch. Even though Danny Glover and Martin Short didn't seem to "get" what the characters in the original film were all about, which made it a true comedy classic, they still pulled off funny performances which made for good if not outstanding comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this rating (5.0/10) on IMDb, I learnt one thing: IMDb ratings reflect NOTHING on the reality of movies. This movie is indeed one of the all-time funniest movies I've seen. It's so cleverly written, witty, and every single cast member has been selected to perfectly suit the role. The lines all come out naturally, and you cannot help but fall in love with this masterpiece. This movie is one of the very few movies I know line by line, and for a reason: Every line is memorable. I seriously cannot get over the totally unfair rating this movie is receiving here on IMDb. Martin Short and Danny Glover give a phenomenal performance, and make copycats out of all the black guy/white guy movies that followed.</fullReview>

Emailed Universal Studios within the past 6 months and requested same.Danny Glover as Raymond Campanella the skeptical investigator and Martin Short as the ill fated Eugend Proctor have a good chemistry together and their adventures are very entertaining.

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that this movie is so overlooked (under 5/10 rating??? bunch of morons). Pure Luck has perhaps Martin Short's best comedic performance (oscar worthy, I'm not kidding) accompanied by a hilarious and engaging plot that makes me incontinent, I laugh so hard. And still not on DVD. The film's nuances in every scene demonstrate its genius and accentuate Martin Short's brilliant acting skills (e.g., "buenos tardos, amigos"). I find myself smiling for hours after watching it, picturing Martin Short's face as he tries to appear engaged during the cigar smoke-filled police briefing. I've seen this movie many, many times and never grow tired of it, something I can't say for most films these days. Morons, I tell you.</fullReview>

Why it is not available on Netflix? I like the story and I have not seen the movie for very long time. Is it too old or is it under some kind of protection. Everybody should be able to see it.There should be more funny movies like this one and I believe that there are enough good stories to tell, that will make people laugh.Also I think that Martin Short is very funny actor and "Pure Luck" is one of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has an overall mediocre average from the total comments in this site - but I agree with those who liked it, and who wonder about the complaints. I don't have any feeling about its being something of a remake of an earlier French flick (so what; it's not as if the original were any type of classic). Martin Short is one of the funniest individuals, ever, and here Danny Glover is outstanding as his reluctant, straight-man sidekick. Sheila Kelley gives an excellent performance, and is certainly pleasant to view. Harry Shearer and Sam Wannamaker always add positively to films in which they appear, in their own different styles.A lot of personalities who have made their fame in television have enjoyed less success on the big screen. Sometimes it seems the cause may be difficulty breaking from their TV character(s) - but more often, they seem to try to stretch a story appropriate to a 10- or 15-minute skit, or 22 minutes of program during a half-hour slot, into a full-length film. While the story in this movie is predictable, and pretty much consists of several variations on it one-dimensional theme (Martin's and Sheila's vying for the title of the world's greatest "klutz") - it succeeds in holding interest and being enjoyable for the entire hour-and-a-half.I haven't seen Peter Bart's and Peter Guber's "Sunday Morning Shootout" program very often, but I did see the program where Short was their guest. These two men are true heavyweights in Hollywood and films, erudite, interesting, and they conduct a program which is engaging and succeed in drawing the most from their guests. While they are pleasant men, neither is a "ray of sunshine," and any humor they generate is more subtle, with few yucks.But Martin Short's appearance had both of them in the proverbial "stitches," and displayed his natural, tremendous talent as a totally funny individual, whether in a scripted or talk show venue. And this was done while not detracting from their normal meaningful programming.You might not feel compelled to label this picture "outstanding," but I would rate it on the upside of "excellent."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood should shy away from the inane types of remakes it tries to make out of some French films. This one in particular was based on "Le Chevre" by Francis Veber. French humor is not well understood once it's translated. The original film wasn't that great, to begin with. It's a mystery why Nadia Tass undertook to direct this film, at all. The screen play by Herbert Weingrod must have looked a lot funnier than what we see on the screen.Martin Short, as a comedian, is very funny. He has not fared well in the movies. It could be his choices that have limited him, or just that he is completely hysterical in one medium and with the wrong guidance, he will be not as funny in films like this. The jokes in this movie are too tired.Danny Glover, on the other hand, playing the straight man, to Mr. Short's funny one, fares better. The pairing of these two men sometimes work, but much of the time, even an experienced and talented actor of Mr. Glover's stature, falls flat.Watch it at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You gotta love the originality and smarts to this movie. Just watching it again, last night (God knows the last time I saw this film, it was yonks) he had me bringing up the question, "What the hell happened to Martin Short?". He wasn't a bad actor, and deserved more roles. This film, incidentally, if you didn't know, was made from the people who made Malcolm. This is their first film, venturing out of Australia, yet somethings gone afoul here, when judged against their last three films, which I all enjoyed. They were all good films, and I'll let you in on a little secret, I did like this one the best, but as a film, it just fell into average fare, and as a comedy, I would of found it funnier, when I viewed it all those years ago, and I too clearly remember being impressed by the makers of it, if a little envious. The plot is pure genius. This consistently accident prone daughter is kidnapped while holidaying on the French riviera. No ransom, no note. A month has passed where this super detective (Glover) has got nowhere. His only option at the advice of the daughter's dad (Wanamaker) and a psychiatrist, is to use a accident prone sales assistant (Short) of equal misfortune, to lead, or more correctly let em' stumble onto the daughter's whereabouts. Glover and Short do make a wonderful team, and some of the gags are truly memorable, trust me, no more greater than the bee sting that gets out of control and Turns Short into Blubberman, while the ending is classic, and genius, not the only genius moment. I must of really enjoyed the film, cause it passed quick, yet again it's just average, as if running short of something. Some gags won't rub off of people. Summed up, it's a cute little film, like it's actress Kelly. The ending is a match made in Heaven, literally, if they die first. Ha.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure luck is better than no luck?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Martin Short gem is probably my favorite movie of his (aside from the Father of the Bride series) and it seems to be so undervalued. I loved this movie way back then and I love it now. So many bad things happen to him during this hilarious and irreverent movie and even after all my many, many viewings, I still seem to eagerly anticipate all his misfortunes. The way he just takes all his many "accidents" in stride is what I love about it. And Danny Glover's horrified fascination is also priceless and perfectly played. It skips a lot of the clichés, isn't too obvious, and is largely situational - if anything can go wrong, it will. Martin is a naive hothead who delivers physical comedy with style, and Glover is a hard-boiled P.I.-cum-babysitter who just can't believe this is all happening to him. I don't know the circumstances that led Danny Elfman to only compose the main titles and ending selection for this soundtrack, but his compositions are quite fun. Definitely a switch from his dark stuff, it hearkens back to his Oingo Boingo days, with a twist of Caribbean."Pure Luck" is a hilarious comedy, with Martin Short and Danny Glover at their best! There is some language, but mild on the scale these days. You'd think with all of today's technology they'd give us a button to turn that stuff off if we wanted to. Anyway, not too much to worry about with this movie, just laugh!!! My favorite scene is where Martin short attempts to use karate on Danny Glover and winds up landing in a .... well you'll just have to watch to find out where he lands. This is without a doubt, one of the funniest movies of the 80's.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Valerie Highsmith (Sheila Kelley) is the bumbling daughter of a wealthy businessman on vacation in Mexico. Purse snatchers leave her on the streets with amnesia. Small time con man Frank Grimes comes along and takes her hostage. Her father sends investigator Raymond Campanella (Danny Glover) but he has no luck. Because of her bad luck, her father is convinced to send the equally bad luck accountant Eugene Proctor (Martin Short) to follow Valerie and partnered with Campanella.This is adapted from a French movie and I have yet to laugh at a French comedy. Some of that is the language difference but I also think the French aren't that funny. This should work better with Short as the wacky funny man and Glover as the straight man. Short has his moments and Glover's best comedic partner remains Mel Gibson. The comedy is very broad and very limited. It's pretty stupid but not stupidly funny. Worst of all, the investigation isn't that compelling. Seeing Valerie doing similarly stupid things could make the concept work better. It may also work better if Eugene is an idiot but he's not really written as such. He could also be resigned to the bad luck. I'm not sure if Eugene is calibrated correctly.</fullReview>

Lots of laughs, and Short and Glover make quite the humorous pair. Has such a great amount of charm, excitement and reply value, that suspending disbelief is very easy.

		<shortDescription>A decent comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Americanized remake of the French film "Le Chevre" is essentially a mild, one joke comedy. That said, that one joke is reasonably amusing and leads to some effective slapstick, all performed with bravado by the talented Martin Short. He and the other cast members make this pleasant, if not hilarious, to watch. Certainly there's gorgeous Mexican scenery to enjoy as well. Eventually the movie does get a little tiresome but it *does* continue with the gags right up to the end credits.Sheila Kelley co-stars as Valerie Highsmith, the daughter of a business magnate played by Sam Wanamaker. Her character is terminally accident prone, and when she disappears, a psychiatrist in Wanamakers' employ (Harry Shearer) has a brainstorm: use Eugene Proctor (Short), the unluckiest man in the company, to try to track her down. Hopefully these two hapless souls will be just unlucky enough to be drawn to each other somehow. Naturally, dedicated private detective Raymond Campanella (Danny Glover) thinks this is a stupid idea, and he starts to grow weary of Proctors' endless pratfalls, but starts to become a believer as he and Proctor get some leads.If it weren't for Short, this wouldn't work as well as it does. He just throws himself right into the part. And Glover, just as he did in the "Lethal Weapon" franchise, proves to be the consummate straight man. Shearer doesn't really get a chance to be funny, but Wanamaker is good, and the sexy Ms. Kelley is an appealing klutz. Also providing fine support are Scott Wilson as small time crook Frank Grimes - who comes to deeply regret his association with Valerie, Jorge Russek as helpful Mexican police inspector Segura, Jorge Luke as an amiable pilot, and Sergio Calderon as a sleazy bartender.The best gag revolves around a bee sting, with fun makeup effects by the ever reliable KNB effects group.All in all, it's watchable enough, and good for some modest chuckles.Six out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Martin Short is pure magic in this role.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Short is a guy who made a couple of comedies that I thought were pretty good. Though looks like once again I like a comedy that a lot of people do not. Granted I did not think it was super great or anything, but I did find this movie about a detective trying to find a girl who had been kidnapped by using a guy with as bad of luck as the girl kidnapped to somehow stumble upon her rather funny. It was Short's character though that carried this one, as Danny Glover was not bad, but he at times was a bit too serious in this one. That is okay, most of the comedy does around Short and he does a good job in his scenes as he has physical comedy scenes and with most other comedy as well. Danny Glover's character spends most of the film trying to prove that Short's character does not have luck and that luck has nothing to do with anything which seems silly to continue thinking shortly after he and Short's character meet. Some good scenes involve Short finding quicksand in a place that has no quicksand, a very bad bee sting and a very bad decision by Glover to get Short to proposition a lady. Short ended up pretty much disappearing from movies for the most part, but I thought he was a good actor in comedies.</fullReview>

After the disappearance of his amazingly clumsy daughter, 'Mr. Big' decides to enlist the services of an equally clumsy employee, in the hope that he may 'slip on that same banana peel', and find her.While Nadia Tass' direction (in her American feature film debut) appears rather hurried, "Pure Luck" benefits from the very funny Martin Short, the good teaming of Short and Danny Glover, and some hilarious one-off scenes. Hardly outrageous cinema, "Pure Luck" is still enjoyable however.Friday, December 20, 1991</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hat's Off to Unusual Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie succeeds in being funny without ever resorting to toilet or sexual humor. The makers of the movie found a universal subject, people with horrendously bad luck, and made a genuinely funny movie with an "Old World" charm. It is clean, kind and engaging. It would appeal to teenagers as well as adults, and to people from all different national backgrounds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have enjoyed this movie for many years. As a huge Martin Short fan, I realize that you have to have a certain type of humor to really enjoy his movies. So if you're wondering if you'll enjoy PURE LUCK, just think if you've enjoyed his other films. This film, as many of Short's films, relies pretty heavily on physical comedy and situational humor. But the storyline IS neat, I think it's funny to those who don't really know much about Martin Short. My husband saw the film for the first time today and laughed out loud at many scenes...and he doesn't usually do that. So, in my opinion, PURE LUCK is fun, lighthearted, and a pretty good example of Martin Short humor. Danny Glover is a great straight man, and this is an overall great, feel-good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A laugh a minute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. Partially because I've been to the Mexican Riviera and I had a few treacherous adventures there myself. The laughs just keep coming as Martin Short's bad luck lands him in some very sticky (and funny) situations. If you like slapstick comedy this movie is for you. One of the funniest scenes is when Short and Danny Glover are up in a plane looking for the missing heiress. As they scan the mountains for the lost lady (who also happens to have a bad luck curse) Short is stung by a bee. He is allergic to bee stings and what follows is hilarious. (Let's just say he gets a little puffy.) There are many more great scenes in this film and you will be laughing off your chair when you see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Short and Danny Glover star in this slapstick comedy about a woman who's so unlucky that she disappears while on a trip in Mexico. Glover is the man hired to find her, and Short is his "assistant". He was dubbed so because he, same as the woman, has rotten luck, so the obvious would be to get him to find her with his bad luck. (It would. Wouldn't it?) The movie has Short falling, tripping, sticking things in his nose, etc. about every five seconds. While it is funny, it gets to be overkill. The acting here isn't that good. Short is only good for falling and stuff and Glover looks so out of place that it's hard not to feel sorry for the guy, but you need some way of income between two Lethal Weapon movies. There are a couple of scenes that will stay in your mind (at least until you watch another movie of this kind), notably the scene where Short is bitten by a bee and puffs up and the scene where he gets a straw in the nose. (Long story.) Pretty good if you're willing to leave your brain behind and have a laugh. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Short and Danny Glover were so funny in this show. It is one of my favorite shows I have ever seen. There is a couple of laughs in ever seen. It so funny to watch a guy who has so bad of luck, and when you think it can't get any worse it does. I loved when the bad luck rubbed off of Martin Short and went to Danny Glover it just cracked me up. This show was enjoyable to watch. I would recommend this show to any one who wants a laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this movie is still watchable, it doesn't even come near the brilliance of the original. For starters: 1981 was a defining year in french popular-cinema. That was the year when "Le Professionnel" and "La Chévre" was released. "Pure Luck" is an American remake of the second one, made ten years later. I sometimes really hate way American film-making works: when they got so tired of their own clichés, they do a remake of a foreign film, which has foreign clichés. That was the element that made these two french movies great. European clichés. When they made those movies, they were totally aware, that they are only using the old recipes, which already worked well. The french humor in La Chévre is hilarious, and goofy. The scenery gives you a nostalgic feel, and the actors are just plain brilliant. Never over-acting, just plain funny. The strong, and aggressive Depardieu, and the always unlucky Richard made an unforgettable duo. NOW this movie... It doesn't have ANY of the elements listed above. Danny Glover and Martin Short are raging idiots, screaming through cities and jungles, acting so bad, it makes even your average stand up comedy actor look pretty sharp. The story is the same, almost word-by-word, yet the jokes don't work. Okay, I am a bit too hard on this one, but the original La Chévre was a generational masterpiece. And this is not. Just an average American early nineties comedy, with not too many things to remember for. Not that bad, but hey, if you take time to dig up this one, search for the original instead!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For somebody who has seen the French original with Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu, this is the worst remake of a movie for all times. Martin Short might be a good comedian and Danny Glover is a good actor, but as a team they are not even close to be as funny as the original team. I don't know, why American filmmakers always try to make remakes of French movies and fail on the attempt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie. I have never laughed as hard as I did in this movie. I don't like comedy actors like Martin Short, Jim Carrey or Steve Martin. As a matter of fact I avoid them and any other "slapstick" comedy, but this movie made me laugh. The idea of it...using one person with bad luck to find another is ingenious! I hope others out there will give the movie a chance and watch it with a light heart. If you don't think people like this exist...you are wrong! They are living their lives trying to accept with a positive attitude what fate has given them...just plain old bad luck! I had to watch this movie several times to hear the whole dialog, my continuous laughter made me miss a lot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original French version "La Chevre" ('the goat', in France a symbol of bad luck), with Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu, is much funnier, but I too agree that Martin Short is a great comedian and that this movie works not bad. Anyway I'm sure that a couple like Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor would have do a much better job. Wilder also worked in an adaptation of another funny and successful French movie: "The Woman in Red", and it turned into a little masterpiece... For Martin Short "Pure Luck" was the second "French" adaptation after "Three Fugitives" from 1989 with Nick Nolte (in France the original movie starred again the duo Richard-Depardieu).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>9th Greatest Movie of all Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen several movies in my entire life but this ranks as one of the greatest accomplishments of man kind. Critics rave: "...ri...vet...ing...", "this is one of the best movies (sic) i have ever seen", "...the culmination of hu...man...existence", among others. Step aside Kane, there's a new Citizen in town. The making of this movie is among the things our kids are going to be talking about when they're telling their great grand kids about the events that touched their lives and changed the course of the world forever. It's no "Replacements", but then again, nothing is. Ted and Rob each put one of their thumbs into the air when rating this movie. They say sometimes classics often go unnoticed until they resurface 14 years after being made. With that said, what year did Pure Luck humbly grace this world and what year is it now. Now take the latter year stated and subtract the former from it and see how many years it has been since made. Coincidence... I think not.Best Movies of All Time (Some are debatable) 1. Citizen Kane 2. The Replacements with Keanu Reeves 3. A Clockwork Orange 4. The Sandlot 5. Angels in the Outfield 6. Air Bud: Golden Receiver starring Chester 7. The Godfather 8. Hitch (i've never seen this one, but my friend said it was pretty funny and kinda enjoyable to watch... also if you get sour patch kids at the theatre, probably won't buy it when it comes out on DVD though he said, i would definitely recommend it though) 9. Pure Luck (rounding out the Top 9 finally) 10. Ladybugs starring the late Rodney Dangerfield 11. Japanese Fighters 12. Singing in the Rain 13. A Streetcar Named Desire 14.

		<fullReview>Martin Short and Danny Glover star in PURE LUCK, and the title plus Short should be a tipoff as to the quality of this obvious tax writeoff. Investigator Glover is assigned to find a missing heiress in Mexico and Short is sent along as someone who shares the heiress' constant state of bad luck (running into doors, falling down, etc.). Somehow this is supposed to mean Short will be able to find the lady, who has been kidnapped. I can't imagine anyone sitting through this inept, unfunny flick in a theater. I couldn't finish it on TV. Short has fallen a long, long way from his INNERSPACE days, and Glover simply looks embarrassed. He also mumbles most of his dialog. PURE LUCK makes THE MAN, with Eugene Levy and Sam Jackson playing similar roles, look like CITIZEN KANE. It is fair to say Short's auburn-dyed, permed hairdo in PURE LUCK outperforms Short at every turn. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, not the greatest movie ever made. But a 4! A 3! It wasn't that bad ... You should know going in that, seeing as how it's starring Martin Short, there's a good possibility it won't be great. So keep those expectations low and you'll enjoy a half-decent (if you're in to slapstick) comedy. Uhm ... Minimum of ten lines, really? There just isn't that much to say about this movie. Danny Glover plays a cop, so that must have been a real stretch for him. Martin Short plays a hapless idiot. Bit of typecasting going on, I guess. I'd include a plot summary but I'm lazy, and someone else has already done it anyway. Wow, I never would have gotten into this 'comment' thing in the first place if I'd noticed there was a 10 line minimum. Doo dee doo, bloop de bloo. Anyone finding my comments interesting? Helpful? Probably not, eh? Ooh, that did it. Ten lines! Yeah! See ya.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Junk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The elements necessary to pull this comedy off completely just do not come together. Short (an automatically hilarious person who is always "on" and whose humor works on many levels) stars as a hapless accountant who never met an open manhole or a slippery set of stairs he didn't love. He is hired by his boss to find the boss's daughter (Kelly) who is equally as clumsy and who has disappeared without a trace in Mexico. He is accompanied by the original investigator (Glover) who came up empty in his first attempt. Together, they scour Mexico (as if it's the size of Rhode Island or smaller) looking for the girl (who often leaves a trail of disaster in her wake.) There are several amusing moments along the way, but the film doesn't hold up for several reasons. First, there is PRECIOUS LITTLE chemistry at all between Short and Glover. They just don't gel as a pairing. Part of it is due to the lazy, rote performance Glover gives in which he barely growls his lines in a whisper and looks ahead blankly most of the time. Also, the general timing of most of the gags and dialogue is awkward and poorly edited. It's almost as if room was left for the gales of laughter that don't come. This has to have some of the worst costumes in a film as well. Glover wears an ugly shirt buttoned up to his neck that is supposed to have a tie with it, but doesn't and Short has a horrendous jacket that is only part of his whole deadly wardrobe. For unknown reasons, Short's hair has been dyed a distractingly loud color of red and he doesn't look at all natural. (He, at times, looks like a middle aged Clay Aiken before the makeover!) Accordingly, Kelly's hair has been lightened beyond it's usual red tones (apparently to contrast with Short's clown 'do.) She doesn't exactly excel at her mishap scenes, but it seems to be the fault of the timing and staging of them more than her lack of ability. It really boils down to the fact that this is farce and most Americans cannot pull off farce. This is why so many people find the film such a poor remake of the French original. The director and writers could only take it so far before floundering. Non-discriminating viewers may find some of the pratfalls funny (and Short's encounter with a bee is amusing if one hasn't seen Short's TV show "Jiminy Glick".) Mostly, the movie sort of lumbers along with predictability and occasional tedium until it runs out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Bad Luck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miserable remake of the French comedy "La Chevre". Martin Shorty is a funny guy, but he gets no help here with a director (nadia Tass) who has no experience directing comedy (and has finally found her niche directing "Felicity" and "Samantha" pre-teen girl films) and a writer (Herschel Weingrad) who a long, long time ago wrote "trading Places" (a decent comedy at best) but since has done ham handed comedies like "Brewster's Millions", "Kindergarten Cop" and "Lift".As a result, the teaming of Short and Glover is an annoying failure. Glover's always pretty good at playing annoyance, but here he's in good company as he couldn't possibly be more annoyed than the audience watching.The big scene where Short's character Eugene Proctor gets stung by a bee and swell up to enormous size may have contained the genesis of his later (and much funnier) Jiminy Glick show biz reporter character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, and every other remakes of french comedies by American directors are just awful (Father's day, Mixed Nuts, Three fugitives...). What makes "La Ch?vre" an excellent french movie, is the acting of great actors like Pierre Richard and Gégard Depardieu, and the directing of great directors like "Françis Veber" which are by far more subtle than American acting or directing, especially in comedies. And as you talk about the goal of this movie, they bought an idea that was a big success elsewhere and they popularized it to make the movie accessible to a large audience. The result is a big load of tripe. I guess you have to be french to understand that, because it's just a matter of culture...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PURE LUCK (DIDIER BECU)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why they did it was totally a dark artea for me but one of the most popular things in Hollywood were making Americanised versions from French comedies. The basic problem is that the original ones were mediocre comedies you will give two stars and a half, so you can imagine the American result... "Pure luck" is the "adaption" of "Le ch?vre", a French comedy starring Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu. For the "new" version they found Martin Short and Danny Glover who will always be linked with his Lethal Weapon-roles. Everything starts when Valerie (Sheila Kelley), a daughter from a rich industrial, decides to go on holiday herself and as she is the typical dumb blonde who is born for bad luck, she soon get kidnapped. The kidnappers don't know what to do with her as she doesn't even remember her own name (it'd be better they'd dump her immediately so this movie wasn't made). After several searches tons of detectives haven't found a trace till some psychologist comes up with the idea to hire Eugene (Martin Short), a man who is born for bad luck as well as the theory says that through this way they will find Valerie, but as Eugene is dumb as dumb can be he got the help of a real professional Raymond (Danny Glover). Well the biggest problem is that the goal of this film is Martin Short doing slapstickgags and after 5 minutes you know when you see a staircase he will fell or when a door is closed he will bump into it. And it goes on and on, till the moment it really is embarrassing (see the moment when he is stick by a bee and his body swells...). Funny, no it isn't....and there is no magic between Glover and Short, and for some reasons it was a bit too much like Three Amigos which was a least tenthousand times more funnier!</fullReview>
