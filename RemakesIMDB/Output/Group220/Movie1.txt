		<fullReview>This movie doesn't get enough credit. I found it in a DVD bargain bin after never even hearing about it on cinema, which is a great pity. Jean Reno is in a different role for a change, and he excels - his comic timing is perfect, and together with Applegate and the dumb slave, you are left wishing you could see more of them. You also develop a real hate for Applegate's boyfriend. I laughed solidly the entire way through at the way the characters battled to fit in with modern living standards. Everything from the concept to the jokes, even the graphics, is done really well, and I would highly recommend this to fans of sci-fi comedies or even romantics. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may laugh at me if you like but I still think "Les Visiteurs" of 1993 is one of the greatest French movies I've ever seen and yes, I've seen quite a lot of them. The idea of a remake for an American audience seemed pretty pointless and stupid because the original was so bloody excellent and entertaining comedy already. Before I saw "Just visiting" I wondered would it be easier just to teach the people of America how to read the subtitles instead of making a whole new film.Last night I watched this one simply out of curiosity and it turned out being rather great. My brother said that it was even better and claimed that the remake was definitely a sensible thing to do because the idea of "Les Visiteurs" was marvelous but the film was incomplete and filled with flaws. I don't necessarily think this one's better but it's not much worse either.At least it made me laugh just as much and Jean Reno and especially Christian Clavier were fantastic and even Christina Applegate (Kelly from the highly popular tv sitcom "Married with children") didn't disappoint me. So all I can say is "Just visiting" was a splendid effort and worth a watch. Hilarious scenes, absurd characters and downright crazy plot. I wish I would also had a chance to see "Les Couloirs du temps: Les visiteurs 2" because I haven't found it anywhere in Finland. Shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean Reno at his Gallic best, although anything with him in it is worth a look. Some scenes are distinctly Python-esque. Excellent entertainment, suitable and appealing to all ages. This version of the movie was made after the original French language version was a hit in France - it's also worth watching after this version (providing you don't mind English subtitles, or understand French).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny trip to the future by a royal ancestor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to watch this one at least twice or more. Some of the humor will escape you the first time. Some of it is almost slapstick, but it gives a very humorous view of some of the culture clashes and learning experiences that could occur if an ancestor from very far back were to accidentally be transferred to our modern times. It is actually very entertaining, and I would highly recommend it. Even children over the age of 10 or so might enjoy it (it mostly pretty unoffensive, but a little gross in some parts), but some of the humor might go over the heads of younger ones (that might actually be good, however).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "What If" Comedy Is Good For Some Real Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magic, as well as evil, is afoot in 12th Century France, and when the two are combined to effect the sinister scheme of an unscrupulous individual the result is a comedic journey for a Nobleman and his lackey as they are transported into the 21st Century in `Just Visiting,' directed by Jean-Marie Poire, and starring Jean Reno and Christina Applegate. Count Thibault (Reno) is about to marry Princess Rosalind (Applegate), daughter of King Henry (Richard Bremmer) and his Queen (Sarah Badel), but at a prenuptial banquet the Earl of Warwick (Robert Glenister), who covets the fair Rosalind, coerces a witch (Valerie Griffiths) into casting a spell that will enable him to usurp Thibault and make Rosalind his own. The plan goes gravely awry, however, and Thibault subsequently engages the talents of an English Wizard (Malcolm McDowell) to set things aright. But the Wizard proceeds to muck it up even worse, sending Thibault and his slave, Andre le Pate (Christian Clavier), into a `Tunnel of time' from which they ultimately emerge in Chicago, 2001, where they encounter Julia Malfete (also Applegate), the spitting image of Rosalind, who turns out to be a direct descendant of Thibault. And it becomes the task of the Nobleman, Thibault, to find a way back to his own time. In the meantime, he and Andre attempt to negotiate this world of the future with a Medieval mind-set that puts them at odds with the inanimate objects and humans that surround them. And it becomes a trial by fire for the brave Count, and a laugh riot of uproarious proportions for the audience. This stranger-in-a-strange-land, fish-out-of-water scenario has been done before, to be sure, but it's given a fresh face here compliments of Poire, who sets a good pace and keeps the story on track, and the talents and impeccable comedic timing of his cast, especially Clavier and Reno, who play so well off of one another. Much of what transpires is predictable-- the way Thibault and Andre react to a modern city replete with technology, and specifically things like automobiles, light switches and television-- but they always manage to take it one step further, which makes the humor spontaneous and genuinely funny.  Reno is perfect as Thibault, playing it straight and allowing the humor to naturally evolve from the character's reaction to a situation rather than going for the purely physical humor. Reno, in fact, demonstrates a real talent for acting through reacting, which makes his character believable and adds to the humor of the film. He never allows Thibault to lose that 12th Century logic, willing to attest to his own nobility, for example, to anyone who will listen, and backing it up with a verbal inventory of his assets, which includes things like fifty barrels of olives and, of course, Andre. It's not a performance that requires a lot of depth, but for the film to work it had to be done right, and with precision, and Reno succeeds admirably on both counts. Clavier, on the other hand, goes straight for the jugular with an all-out assault of slapstick and physical humor that takes it right to the edge and works perfectly in effecting what was intended: He makes you laugh out loud. Reminiscent of a cross between Peter Sellers' Clouseau-- though not as subtle-- and the best of Monty Python, Clavier creates a memorable character, who as the `property' of Thibault gives a real perspective and context to the humor of the story. Some of his `discoveries' of the modern world will have you rolling on the floor. And again, the fact that he plays the character straight and not just `for' laughs adds significantly to the overall humor of the film. Christina Applegate provides a welcome presence as Rosalind/Julia, and while not a stretch for her as an actor, by any means, she lends a quality to the film that could be easily overlooked, but would be quite apparent as a missing element without her. She has a natural, charismatic manner that makes her endearing and sympathetic, and it's a good, solid performance through which she creates a credible, well rounded character. The supporting cast includes Matt Ross (Hunter), Tara Reid (Angelique), Bridgette Wilson (Amber), John Aylward (Byron), George Plimpton (Dr. Brady), Bill Bailey (Thibault's Father) and Clare Welch (Thibault's Mother). A comedy that successfully blends the fine art of comedic subtlety with physical gags, `Just Visiting' is everything a comedy should be: Funny and entertaining. And it does it without venturing into over-the-top Farrelly Brothers territory or by employing the abstract brand of hilarity often offered by the Coen Brothers. It's a film that succeeds on it's own merits, and does it splendidly. It's a funny one you don't want to miss, and that's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 8/10.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the funniest of the offbeat, little advertised movies I enjoy the most. Underrated and under appreciated by American audiences, slowly making its way to cult status, this tale of a French nobleman and time travel, at the hands of a slightly daffy sorcerer, played by Malcolm McDowell takes place mostly in Chicago. A twist on the "I am my own Grandfather" theme brings the nobleman face to face with distant Granddaughter, who he saves from a decision she would have lived to regret. This is a remake of the French film, "Les Visiteurs". Jean Reno shows his talent for comedy and wit. Thankfully he and Christian Clavier teamed up for the remake. Clavier was allowed to develop a little in the American version. The rest of the cast are enjoyable, and bring together a tight, clean story. Worth the video rental. Good clean fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many of the comments here are the usual gripes about remakes. Well, I've never seen "Les Visiteurs" so I'm just looking at this film on its own, and I must say that I was greatly entertained.Of course, it's a lightweight plot, but Reno and Clavier sink their teeth into the time-travel jokes and manage to be endearing as well as thoroughly crazy. (Especially Clavier, whose scenes among the rich folks reminded me a lot of the Three Stooges' many dinners with the snobs.) Christina Applegate is sincere and appealing, her boyfriend and his bimbo are appalling, and the Chicago scenery is GREAT! (I have to admit my prejudice in that regard, having lived there for many years.) Considering that the remake was done by the men who made the original film, what's the problem? Think of what it would have been like if it starred Adam Sandler and David Spade, for instance. Zut alors!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever a foreign film is good enough for the american film industry to want to copy it they usually botch the job by trying to americanize it. If you have ever seen the original, "Les Visiteurs" then you probably know what I am talking about. This american version would have done well to stick to the original story. It's unfortunate that the the writer (also the original's director) tried to "fix" something that wasn't broke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original, but not as bad as one might fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just Visiting is an American remake (starring the same two main characters) of the excellent French "Les Visiteurs" from 1993. The remake is of course not on par with the original, which is a perfect comedy. The U.S. version is much duller, and marred by several things, such as Jean Reno being too old to successfully reprise his role, and many jokes simply not being very funny.It gains, however, on two important counts. First, Malcolm McDowell's wizard, who has a much larger and more interesting part in this movie than the original wizard did in the first movie. Second, Christina Applegate's character. She is surprisingly good, and a delight to watch. She's never been a terrible actress, but here she's extraordinary. She plays a kind of good-hearted, intelligent and yet naive character that, to my knowledge, is quite different from the other characters she's played. Where she's often been an air-head bimbo, here she's genuinely appealing; even endearing.It still does detract from the movie that, to a great degree, it merely goes through the motions of the original movie, trying to mimic the jokes and japes, and very often failing miserably. Still and all, it's worth watching and is better than it might have been.I rate this one 7 out of 10. You should see the original, though, which is far more inspired and also gives a great impression of spontaneity. I rate the original version 10 out of 10. It's that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film was good, but could have been better. Key script points for future scripts that will be made like this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers I enjoyed this film...I watched Down To Earth and also Just Visiting on the same night. I enjoyed this film more.This had a good story, but it still lacked and some parts did not make any sense.To note...the very beginning.There should NOT have been a voice over...there was no need, simply because the voice over didn't follow through to the rest of the movie, nor did it offer any real detail, except bad humor for the first few minutes. The intro would be much more funny without the voice over.Second note...the dungeon scene...in which jail do the PRISONERS lock themselves in?The time travel sequence was good, but if the two characters drank from the same cup, why didn't they disappear the same way?Why did they time travellers have to wake up in a museum castle setting? Why couldn't they wake up in a mall or a restaurant or even a city park? Why did it have to be the same element? It would have been way more funnier if they would've woken up in a fountain or in the middle of the airport runway or a swimming pool or bowling alley.When people travel through time...why do their clothes come too? If their clothes come, why not the furnishing around them? Why not dirt? I STRONGLY feel that if there will be time travel films made....(and there will be many made) why does the personal property of the traveller arrive with them, but not articles that are lying beside them?Why not have time travellers arrive naked??? And then be really stuck in a situation...(besides being stranded)? Imagine...when you are lost in the woods, wouldn't you be more freaked out if you were naked and unarmed?The arriving at the house scene had too much repetition. It was good, but over done. Even the female lead should have known that somebody who has no idea how to work a lighswitch should be taught the basics of operating other features in a modern home.Why did the servent have to be so clumsy? He could be stupid...but even though he may not be bright....there was no need to be totally idiotic to how things work as played out in the kitchen scene.Why did he have to be knocking stuff over constantly?If you had strange visitors as these 2 characters...why would you go to the classiest restaurant in town...why wouldn't you just order a pizza and deal with their ridiculous adventures at home till things became more stable? Just to get cheap laughs? This could have been done at home with more laughs if more time was put into building it.Tara Reid is a great performer, but doesn't have enough screen time or character definition for a good performance in here aside from being a tart. (I love you Tara). More screen time for Tara!!!!The knight should have ventured onto his own for a longer period and should have explored more of this new world. There could've been more exploits for him to enjoy or fear.Another 30 minutes of film could make this an exceptional great comedy if more time was taken to it. There may have been a different script then what was originally cut and printed...something that would've lasted longer.I gather that this movie was geared at young children and for them, this would be good time to waste in a theatre, but for an audience from mid teens to adults, it fell short.All my reviews are written from a screenwriter and director's point of view. Consideration is given for budgeting and script cuts, but even this final should have been more carefully scrutinized.Imagine the knight and his side-kick trying to drive a bike or a car, taking the subway alone, dealing with gangs or police while trying to make an escape, going into shopping malls and getting hoarded by people with demands for autographs or questionable stares, going to order food and trying to pay with 900 year old gold coins...so much possibility.Since the knight had a sword, there should have been somewhere for him to use it...in escaping the police or defending somebody from harm other than just using it to destroy a car which was not even bearing down on him.Bathing is not new to people, so why would time travellers bath in their clothes...I can understand the fact that they dropped all sorts of bathroom chemicals into the tub, but why wear the clothes while getting washed? Why not try to use a hair dryer and then bring it in the tub and have somebody save their butt just in time before being electrocuted?It had so much potential, but lacked so much product. You journey 900 years or so...you want to experiment, but you're not stupid...you're cautious.Future screenwriters...think of things like this when you create your masterpiece.Out of 10 stars, I give it 7 for effort and because the characters were well casted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had very low expectations of this movie - time travel is an overworked theme and I did wonder about Reno (who I will forever associate with Leon) leading in a comedy film. However, there are a few good moments although a little more imagination (and a bigger budget)would have improved things.The plot also goes nowhere for such along time that the reliance on standard 'situation'comedy dries up quickly.

		<fullReview>I've seen this re-make in cinema, and it was so annoying! I knew all the gags before they happened, since this film was already made years before, with 99% of the same jokes. THAT was a terrific, very good comedy, which made me rolling on the floor laughing. It was genuinely original, with all it's characters. That's what i missed from this version, it's simply a hollywoodised version of the original, lost most of it's beauty (old language for example). I can't understand, why was it necessary, to do the same movie again, with the same 2 main actors (Reno, Clavier), but in a worse form?I can only suggest you, to go and check the original!

		<fullReview>My brother and I went to this movie and we were the only people in the theater. We laughed so hard I had to go outside of the theater. I thought I was going to pee in my pants it was so funny. I can't say enough about it. Leave your high falutin' film-going skills at the door and laugh. Go. Jean Reno is great both as a romantic character and as a comedian, but when you think of Leon or Ronin, you remember that he could definitely play for laughs. Christian Clavier is hilarious and excellent comedic actor who is unknown to the general US public. Finally, Applegate does some good work playing the straight man/woman. Finally, what was an interesting approach was to take a successful foreign comedy and redo it in the USA. But, they used the same director and actors. It translated well which is unusual for comedies- much harder to cross cultures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>they're visiting? They'd better going away and never coming back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a French movie is a huge commercial success, it's often followed by one or a few sequels. Sometimes, it happens that an American version is made. It was the case for "un indien dans la ville" a movie made by Hervé Palud in 1994 and transposed in an American version which was released in 1997. But these American versions are generally a waste of time and (why not?) a loss of money. This is what you could put forward by watching this listless and not very inspired remake of the French movie: "les visiteurs". Here, Jean-Marie Poiré contents with taking back the funniest elements that assured "the visitors"'success; sometimes in similar circumstances. For example, the curator of the museum in which our "visitors" appear replaced the black postman in 1993. So, the comical effects don't work and the movie creates very few surprises. Concerning the cast, well it's quite disparate: if Jean Reno keeps on talking with smart and noble terms, he seems less imposing and authoritarian than he was eight years ago. Christine Applegate is far away from Valérie Lemercier's performance whereas Matt Ross hasn't got Christian Bujeau's furor and exasperation when he's got to face "the visitors"' disasters. Nevertheless, Christian Clavier is always entertaining, especially when he's provoking disasters, in spite of very few new gags. In another hand, when we learn that Matt Ross aims at grabbing his wife's fortune with a little help from his lover, the movie becomes quite conventional. But with Reno's presence and bravery, Applegate will know how to make her husband leave. At the end, the movie lacks of punch and rhythm. It's not a bad movie but simply an useless remake. It's high time Reno and Clavier had a well-deserved rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christina Applegate was perfectly cast for this movie. One reviewer said that she lacked passion, but that was not what this movie called for. This movie called for a young woman that was unsure of herself, who had no self esteem, and was being led by her con artist, cheating boyfriend to sell her heritage and inheritance solely in order to take her for her money. She was a young woman, who through a meeting with her past...her ancestors, finds also herself. She finds what we all need, encouragement, someone who believes in her, and someone who sees the best in her. There was much longed for subtlety and innocence, without the stupidity that plagued her "Married with Children" role. Passion was in her eyes...not in visions of her breasts. The real beauty was in the courage she found (which is her truest inheritance).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when I saw les Visiteur in France in Cinema I couldn't stop laughing,it's just an hilarious film(I would like to say that about les visiteur 2) so I wasn't sure what to expect with this remake considering I had bad memory of French movies geting an american remake(For example the bird cage and Jungle to Jungle),still I was very curious but what really made me go and see it was that John huges co-wrote it and I'm a huge fan of John huges so I was curious what new things he will brings to the Franchise.And I was'nt disapointed at all. To make it easy I give you the good and the Bad of this movie.Good : I LOVE what they did to the caractere of Andre le pat (Jacouille in French),in the original he his just a goofy caractere and you dont really care for him but they gaved the caractere a heart in this remake and you get atached to him.Very smart move and I'm sure it's from John Huges.The relationship between Count Tibo and Julia was much touching in this remake than in the original.Christina Applegate his VERY sweet you just whant to give her a big hug during the all film. I sure would like to see her in the big screen more often because she his a very nice and talented actrice.The special effect were much better this time around.Andie Mac Dowell was fun.The bad: It wasn't as funny as the original because this one his familly oriented while the original his more for Adults.So somme very funny but a bit incorect moment from the original were cut out.It whent too fast.I love Christina but I miss Valerie lemercier (She his the one who originally play Julia).In fact Julia his completely Different in this remake.In The Original she his very stuck up and she have a huge Posh accent but she his VERY , VERY funny,I would even say that the caractere can be as funny as our two heroes.But in the remake Julia his more quite and sweet it works but it would have been good to let Christina get a bit more crasy(and we know she can be funny from Maried with Children).Well all in all I say it's as good as the original (And better then the terible Visiteur 2)but it dos'nt taste the same at all and that's what make it work if you tell me.I'll definitely buy it when I go back to France.(I'm studying in Ireland and it just came out in the Cinema). Good Familly film and certainly the best and most clever remake I ever saw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I want to state that I am not familiar with the original French film that preceded this American remake. That said, I was pleasantly surprised. When my husband brought it home from the video store, I rolled my eyes and groaned, thinking that this was another adolescent boy humor film. And while there is a time and a place for that type of humor, I certainly was not intrigued. Getting through the very beginning of the film was tough. But soon, I was completely engaged, enjoying the humor for the most part and intrigued by the social commentary. The film does make you see the 21st century through different eyes. Reno is wonderful as is his sidekick. An evening's good entertainment with the added bonus of provoking thought as well. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a Breezy little movie! Its actually quite cute and funny once you sit through and watch it. At the very beginning it's actually pretty dumb but stay tuned it gets better! Now after the stupid start you get your classic fish out of water story but delivered quite funny and originally. Towards the end the movie speeds up and leads to a not so great ending that was thrown together but it's worth watching for the funny cute moments inbetween the silly ending and weird start. Check it out for some innocent fun. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a surprise- when you remake a film, especially one from France,most likely it will turn out to be worse than the original. This film isno exception to that rule. Christina Applegate tries gamely to keep iton it's feet, and does an admirable job, as does Jean Reno- but the filmfalls flat. Perhaps because everyone is trying so very hard to BE FUNNY.It's as if the director didn't trust the material, which is a shame,because there's a decent kids story at the heart of this mess. Featuringa shameless floozy performance by Bridget Wilson Sampras, and the chubbypal who falls in love performance by Tara Reid, this movie has it'smoments, but unfortunately not enough of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality - Funny and Heartwarming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great comedy about characters you will care about. You'll want the best for the good guys and the worst for the bad guys - I did. Each character, hero and villain, is well-defined and interesting. It's VERY HEARTWARMING because the goods guys (and gals) are so endearing. This remake is TOP QUALITY work - all aspects of it - and the acting is outstanding. On top of this, this is VERY FUNNY; at times I couldn't stop laughing. I'll definitely buy this video (when it comes out) and put this in my library. I read many negative reviews on this movie - and that's puzzling. The only explanation I have is... maybe they were drinking some of the same bad potions [some of] the characters in the movie were drinking - who knows?</fullReview>

The movie has little bits of humor that the audience must pick up on to make the experience even more enjoyable. For myself, when I left the theater, I was driving home and I recalled one scene and laughed so hard I almost crashed my car.

		<fullReview>Good fish-out-of-water dramas are rare enough; good comedies in this vein are rarer but fortunately "Just Visiting" is one. The plot: A 12th century English royal and his manservant are transported via a botched magical spell to Chicago in the year 2000 and need to get back to prevent the terrible tragedy the spell wasn't supposed to help them prevent.Jean Reno plays Count Thibault straight and larger than life. He is courageous, romantic and highly motivated to get back home. The slapstick that happens around him doesn't faze him: he is royalty, after all and the only one that really knows what he's doing for most of the movie. (I saw Jean Reno last in "Ronin" and I liked his delivery and style in that movie also.) Christian Clavier plays Andre (a.k.a. "Peasant!") his manservant amusingly over-the-top. Both of them having French accents glosses over the fact that 12th century English wasn't very much like English today.The movie has some funny scenes of the two visitors encountering 20th century technology. And I was very pleased at the relatively light touches of toilet humor that seem to be a hallmark of "comedies" these days. (At one point, the two are led to a half-bath and told they can clean up here--where do you think they will first find water? In another movie the toilet would have exploded unattractively.)There are unsympathetic bad guys in both in the 20th and 12th centuries that we want to see brought down. There are some cool effects to look at. Jean Reno knows how to use his sword. There's a cowed blonde who finds her heart and courage for some romantic drama. There is a trashy blonde for some eye candy. There's some fun slapstick. There's a chase scene. There are a few in-jokes about the twentieth century. There are some nice matte shots of a 12th century castle and then real shots of its ruins.This is not a great movie. The Plot Device needs to have Count Thibault coincidentally find his many-great-granddaughter almost immediately and have her in trouble as well that he can rescue her from it. A better movie could have let the cops be real cops and not low-rent extras from the "Blues Brothers". A better movie could have let a few less comedic consequences of our visitors play out--what about a press conference, for instance? A video crew from "Hard Copy"? A visit from a U.S. Customs official?But these are quibbles. I saw it at a half-filled matinee with a bag of popcorn, a Coke and a sense of humor. I laughed. I was entertained. I even recommended it to friends.IMDb rating: 7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another French classic completely ruined</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the warning signs were there. Jean Reno already made a perfectly good version of this film in 1993. Unfortunately, Americans do not like subtitles or films set outside their own country, so Just Visiting was conceived, chiefly with the aim of milking a few more dollars from the original idea.Unfortunately, the humour is not as good, the acting of the US supporting cast is not as good, and the plot makes far less sense than the original. Why would he be transported to Chicago? What are the odds his descendant lives in Chicago? The original was much more plausible - it was set in the same geographical area, so meeting one's descendants is not so ridiculous, and it created plenty of humour based on Sir Godefroy's shock to learn that his castle was now owned by the descendant of his moronic lackey, whereas his descendant lived in a modest 3 bedroom house.For goodness sake, save your ticket money and get the original French version "Les Visiteurs" on video. It is a far better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, granted remakes tend to pale against the original, but this is a good film for the family. Nice little tale of a nobleman and his manservant trying to save his beloved from death by time travel and helping out more than he can ever imagine. It's good to see the original leads, writers, and director saw fit to preserve as much of the original film as possible without losing much of the gig. It would've been nice to see them flesh out some parts, like how Andre's new love Angelique reacts to the time travel bit and whether she loved him for himself or for the trinket with the nice (and very expensive) jewels, and the FX were a tab overboard...but this film is a lot better than most of the stuff out there right now. It'll do for a kosher two hour time killer with the date. I recommend it.</fullReview>

Between him and his sidekick, Andre the servant, I was laughing so hard tears were gushing out of my eyes, i couldn't stop!... they're a great comedy team... And the rest of the movie was a simple but sweet classic faery tale with the honorable knight in shining honor. Christina Applegate was wonderful, a true princess, and Tara Reid was gorgeous and cute at the same time, and Bridgette Wilson made me stop breathing... The movie won't win any Oscar's, but who cares about those silly awards anyway... I had a lot of fun, laughed like crazy, and even got a couple of sweet romantic stories too, as well as some nifty effects... This is great for all ages, kids were loving it (though the special effects in the very beginning of the movie may be a little scary for little kids)... I give this movie a B+...</fullReview>

Hello, Big Nose! ALL the forest is in the small wheel! Thank you, Master!) Sure, the plot is outlandish, but Reno and Clavier do an amazing job of conveying what it would be like to be transported from the 12th to the 21st century. The actors are great, the story is great, there's no sex, no violence, only one curse word, and what I found to be only two very short, slightly lame moments in an endless parade of fun. I can't wait to watch it with my teenage nieces. I described it to them, and they're already laughing.

		<shortDescription>A great trip in time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first post, but I had to because I just watched this for the first time and was delighted by it. Jean Reno adds dignity to a movie that has elements of Python-French low farce-American slapstick and I think his performance gives it just a bit more weight than your usually lightweight time-travel pieces. Thankfully they didn't put someone like Jim Carrey in that role, he could not have carried it off with his frantic mannerisms. I had no problem with the Applegate-Reno love story - remember the time it's set in. I had no problem suspending my disbelief, his accent and Gallic charm worked for me! Frankly, I enjoyed all the performances. It's rare that I laugh out loud but this one did it for me and I'm not a fan of slapstick. This one was better than most. I thought the movie moved along well - held my interest right to the end. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun and honest comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film captures the innocence of severe culture shock of a French Noble and his peasant slave as they travel ahead of their time some 900 years. Their ignorance of today's culture is simply magical; the scene where the two try to rescue the contestants from the television set is hysterical.I looked up this film's box office results and was disheartened when seeing that so few people know about the great heart this film has. The film does appear to be rather dull and silly, but then again, "Men in Black 2" is much worse in it's presentation than "Just Visiting." I suppose it's that "Men in Black" has actors that most people are comfortable with seeing hundreds of times in hundreds of roles.Not known to most people, "Just Visiting" features several familiar faces; Jean Reno, Christina Applegate, Bridgette Wilson, Tara Reid and Malcolm McDowell. Reno [Mission Impossible (Brian de Palma, 1996), Ronin (John Frankenheimer, 1997)], a French native, takes on his royal character with a grace and charm that couldn't have been done better by anyone short of perhaps Gerard Depardieu. Applegate [Jane Austin's Mafia (Jim Abrahams, 1998), The Big Hit (Che-Kirk Wong, 1998)], is always dazzling on the screen, and her roles in this film are no exception. Playing both the 12th Century fiáncé of the Count of Malfete (Reno) and 2001s Julia Malfete, she looks the same, but behaves totally different for her two characters. Wilson [Last Action Hero (John McTiernan, 1993), Billy Madison (Tamra Davis, 1995)] is Julia's fiáncé's secretary/lover, and she is absolutelys stunning. Reid [American Pie 1 &amp; 2 (1999, 2001), Dr T &amp; the Women (Robert Altman, 2001)], playing Julia's next door neighbor Angelique, falls in love with Malfete's slave and teaches him to live freely, to throw away his 12th Century way of thinking and enjoy life. McDowell [A Clockwork Orange (Stanley Kubrick, 1973), (Star Trek Generations (David Carson, 1994), Milk Money (Richard Benjamin, 1994)], Malfete's wizard, delivers a convincing performance in his minor role.This is a relatively clean film and it's a shame it wasn't more successful in today's culturally naive society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick with the french version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: Contains some plot details This film is a good example of why French films often don't make the transition to American films. The 1993 French original, "Les Visiteurs," was for many years the all time box office champion in France. It succeeded on a number of levels. First, it was a clever time travel film about a French knight and his serf who travel from medieval days to modern day France and meet their ancestors -- a Back To The Future in reverse. Second, it was a charming fantasy with almost Disney like qualities, especially in the 20th century, when our French knight and his serf find kind and sympathetic help from Beatrice, the only one among their descendants who really believes who they are. Third, and perhaps most significant, it was a clever satire about French society. Imagine when our medieval knight makes it to modern times only to discover that his castle is now owned by the descendants of his serf. What follows is a delightful story that is a humorous and often poignant commentary on who and what we are. Sadly, most of that was lost in this American remake --not that the producers didn't try to retain the same magic. They brought in the same two principal actors, and much of the same production crew. It appears, however, that they made one big mistake in the hiring of John Hughes as a writer. What you see here looks too much like a Chicago based John Hughes brat pack film and not enough like an ingenious comedy satire. In addition, much of the Disney like awe and fantasy are also gone. (Ironic, since this was a Disney film.) Instead, our American actors are too hip and streetwise to care as much as they should about what they are experiencing. (So why then should we care?) Given all of the rewriting going on in Hollywood these days, it may or may not have been all John Hughes' fault. Nevertheless, a real opportunity was squandered here, as what was so powerfully stated in the original film was lost in this translation. What we learn about film making once again is that writing is the key element. In the case of adapting a foreign film, it takes an intimate understanding of both cultures to pull it off. When it works, it can be wonderful. Other times, not so wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the notion of a 12th century French knight and his valet appearing in the 21st century and being astonished by everything from the "day/night wall switches" to "iron chariots", then you'll probably enjoy "Just Visiting". A well crafted little comedy with just a whiff of romance and a ridiculous premise/plot full of slap-stickey nonsense, this redux of "Les Visiteurs" features Reno as a charming and gallant Knight who is oft upstaged by his bungling but dauntless man-servant (Clavier). A worthwhile diversion for those into slappy, silly no-brainer comedy.</fullReview>

The same pointless jokes are still there, and the few new actors don't really add anything. The only major changes were the addition bunch of over used CG special effects and a handful of Hollywood-inspired, moronic jokes. Overall, it just isn't enough to make it worth the $7.50 to go see it. If you're really curious, just wait till it comes out on video and watch it then.

		<fullReview>Yesterday I went to the videoshop to get something easy to watch and noticed Jean Reno on the jacket of the Just Visiting DVD. I've seen Les Visiteurs (1993) a while ago and liked it. For some reason I thought that Just Visiting is the movie I've seen before, so I rented it to see it one more time. As I watched the movie, I've got the feeling that something is wrong with either my memory or the movie. The movie begins very similar to Les Visiteurs and progresses along quite similar plot at first, only to turn to quite stupid Hollywood flick, completely different in mood and style to the original movie. Still, even the Hollywood fake is rather good, better that most of the american comedies. If you haven't seen the Les Visiteurs, Just Visiting is Ok. But if you can find Les Visiteurs, watch it instead.</fullReview>

This movie is a must see!! We rented it and watched it five times in five days. Highly recommended for a great laugh! Andre is very funny and it is great to see him realize that he can be a free man and finally stand up for himself. It helps us realize how inhumane the treatment of "slaves" were in ancient history. Helps us realize how much we take for granted in the 21st century too. This movie is like a mix between Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail and Napoleon Dynamite, at least that is what type of satirical humor it reminds me of and I think both of those movies are absolutely hilarious as well, the kind that you like to watch again and again and find yourself quoting over and over and laughing.

		<fullReview>I remember seeing the French version of this film on the television when I was a kid, but don't recall much other than two men from the medieval in the streets of the modern world. Somehow I found this, and after some research I chose this version to watch which I thought easy to understand, as well as for the reason some updates were made in this. Well, I know nothing can beat the original, but for those haven't seen the original, this is not a bad one. Quite an enjoyable film with a simple theme and a simple adventure.Seems a very familiar concept, but surely a unique product. Jean Reno was brilliant and so his sidekick and other supporting characters. Top notch jokes, felt like I had some loud laughs after a long time. Of course, there are some flaws, but minors, like relocating from Europe to the US since it is a Hollywood production. It is a time travel theme in fantasy. There's no time machine, instead a wizard behind the adventure through the time.A perfect family film. It's not about prediction, since watching the first scene you would know what follows it and how it all ends. So you're relieved from guessing stuff and can sit back relaxedly and enjoy it as much you can. It is your average film, but if you're seeking a good comedy, then it is surely above that. There are thousands of masterpiece comedies, this is not one of them, though must see from this genre.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the American remake of one our best classic comedy. The originality for us french people is that this remake uses the same original and french duo of medieval heroes ! Thus as this movie deals with time travel, we get a really innovative experiment : if « BTF2 » was a travel into « BTF1 », this remake is like going into a parallel earth : it's the same story more or less, the same scenes and funny moments but in a total, new environment because we jump from a small rural french village to big city Chicago ! When it becomes even more crazy for me, it's because I know a bit Chicago after visiting it so i was as well in a known territory ! I found « Kelly Bundy » to do a good job and in all cases with more talent that the dreadful Robin used in the french sequel ! In a way, the variations really clarify and wakes up the story ; the production has more money to do great sets and effects ! It's true that i don't laugh as much, maybe because i was always in the gang ! But i also watched it in french so i lost all the pleasure to hear my fellows speak in medieval English ! In addition, it's a pity that the heir of Jacquouille has been erased because as Clavier was a electrical maniac funny actor, his character misses. To conclude, the remake is a bit less good than the french original but much better than its sequel !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revisiting a classic French comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1993, "The Visitors", one of the biggest commercial successes in French cinema's history, boosted the then-declining power of popular comedy for the decades to come. Indeed, each recent French comedy owes a little to Jean-Marie Poiré's titular visitors from the Medieval Ages, the knight Godefroy le Hardi (the brave) and his obedient vassal, Jacquouille la Fripouille (the 'Laurel' of this 'Hardi', so to speak) who are accidentally transported to the 90's, discovering there horseless carriages, stinky air, tasteless food and such trivialities as toilet bowls, Chanel perfume and? human rights.The film deserves every Franc it earned as it was funny in every possible meaning of the word, warm, intelligent, and carried by terrific performances from Jean Reno as Godefroy to Christian Clavier as Jacquouille (he would also play his sophisticated descendant, a pedant and precious go-getter named Jacquard) and Valérie Lemercier as both Godefroy's fiancé and his descendant Béatrice. The medieval settings were breathtakingly rendered, the special effects excellent for the time, and the story was a school-case of comedic writing, with the perfect happy (but-not- for-everyone) ending. The least thing needed was a sequel, so it was done, 5 years later. Although a commercial success, the film was panned by the critics (and also the public) for its mediocre attempt to copy a formula without any real good story to tell. The film didn't fool anyone and was seen for what it was: a noisy, over-the-top excuse to use CGI, you know this syndrome that struck movies from the late 90's and early 2000's. In the first opus, the two medieval protagonists fought a postal car (driven by a Black man, immediately labeled as a Saracen, one of the film's best gags), they felt sick in a car, they drop and broke plates after being startled by a phone ring (causing the furor of their host), washed their faces with toilet water and emptied an entire bottle of 'inevitable' Chanel n°5 in the bathtub. As basic as they seemed, these gags worked."The Visitors 2" had no story, no Lemercier, but it had special effects and big budgets, but who can possibly tell that a hysterical Jacquouille, exploding a TV or making a fire hose gushing like a geyser can make people laugh. And by overusing it, they even ruined one of the film's best, running-gags: the jump-transformation sequence, Godefroy turning into ice, and Jacquouille into excrement. That sequel was so awful that when I learned that the first film was remade for an American audience in 2001, my initial reaction was "Can't they live that movie alone?" The original didn't even work in the US, and now, they take the same actors. In fact, not only the film does justice to the original, but the casting of Reno and Clavier is the masterstroke.The plot is basically the same, except that Lemercier's role is played by Christina Applegate as Princess Rosalind, and her modern alter-ego is Julia Melfete,. Reno and Clavier's names are changed to Thibaut de Malfete and André le Paté (not the cleverest choice but anyway). And I was pleasantly surprised by how convincingly engaged they were in their performance, despite the comical material. I even preferred Reno's hairstyle as he looked almost younger than the original Godefroy. And Clavier didn't sin by overplaying Jacquouille, one of his most recurrent post-"Visitors" criticisms. There are other minor changes from the first film, in the original, Godefroy accidentally kills his soon-not-to-be-anymore father-in-law, taking him for a bear after being poisoned by a witch, he then looks at his fiancée who just witnessed her father's death and see with innocent eyes: I saw a big beast", there's a rather hilarious punch line to quite a dark scene. In the remake, Thibaut drinks poisoned wine making him hallucinating, he sees everyone he sees as monsters and then kills the most 'hideous beast', Rosalind. It's a rather creepy set-up, served by disturbing CGI effects, but thankfully, it doesn't last very long and as soon as the Wizard takes them to the future, the film takes off. And speaking of the wizard, it took me almost to the last part of the film to realize it was Malcolm MacDowell."Just Visiting" revisits the previous film and even improves it by creating a bigger and contrast between the Medieval age and a city like Chicago. There's a dizzying moment where the two heroes can't turn their heard to a direction without being frightened by monster-like vehicles and technology. While in the original movie, apart from the cars, the landscape was rather welcoming, and the film didn't even feature an elevator or big buildings, it was more restrained, which was good. "Just Visiting" is spectacular and it's as good, too. And while it doesn't have Lemercier, Applegate is delightfully sensitive and endearing, Matt Ross was a good as the cunning and hypocrite husband that gets his comeuppance at the end and the Tara Reid (who screams early 2000's whatever happened to her) formed a cute pair with André, showing him that some advantage of modern life don't necessarily consist on food, objects and technological stuff;Of course, the film is also 'modern' by its guilty use of Political Correctness, so no 'Saracen' to meet them (a lie like "a Moor!" was a wasted opportunity) but the film redeemed itself by bringing some new gags, my favorite being André frenetically banging the car window to get out, as if he was trapped. "Just Visiting", like "The Birdcage" is one of these rare occurrences of a French comedy remade with proper respect to the original material and wise tactical changes. And from the way it's both funny, touching and a little-over-the-top, it's exactly the kind of film, "The Visitors 2" wanted (but failed to be) And a few months after the release of "The Visitors 3", I guess, if it's half as funny as this one, I'll be satisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just Visiting (2001): Dir: Jean-Marie Gaubert / Cast: Jean Reno, Christian Clavier, Christina Applegate, Malcolm McDowell, Tara Reid: Comedy about the differences in generations as Jean Reno and Christian Clavier are transported through time to the present. Reno plays a Count and Clavier plays his loyal servant. Reno is set to marry the Princess but he is given a drink that causes him to become disoriented and he accidentally kills her. He is sentenced to death until a wizard transports them to present day where they encounter a woman who resembles the Princess. Reno claims that he must find a wizard so that he can be transported to the moment before he was given the drink. Typical plot follows the duo's mishaps with present day. Director Jean-Marie Gaubert is backed by fine comic chemistry between Reno and Clavier. They are given many hilarious moments as they struggle to adapt to present day. Reno must restore his position, and Clavier finds freedom. Malcolm McDowell as the wizard begins with the pitiful time travel introduction but from there he steals scenes with many amusing moments. Only Christina Applegate in duo roles is left with double the cardboard as both the Princess and the lookalike female. Tara Reid is also featured and this counts as yet another decline since her success in American Pie. This is a totally recycled slapstick visit. Score: 5 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great humor even for an 'ancient' theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story has a rather 'ancient' theme of time travel, made famous by the classic movie Back to the Future. As is with the classic, this movie is also a comedy. Yet I praise the amount humor served in this movie. The humor is also very laughable thus enjoyable. And also, despite the potential of being distant culture wise, the movie bridges the culture shock humor by depicting enough scenes and narration at the medieval era to make the later humors clearer and thus more enjoyable. What I like even more is the fact that the main character is played by Jean Reno, who is indeed a great name in action movies. And he did quite a funny appearance in this movie. Christina Applegate did just enough to complete the story balance. Another name worth mentioning is Christian Clavier, who also had a part in writing the original story and screenplay. He too did a great job at being funny here.</fullReview>

I didn't think Christina Applegate would be good with Reno but she was outstanding also along with Reno's Andre played by Christian Clavier who is his servant who falls in love with Tara Reid and some other interesting characters give the movie great substance.Also the location of Chicago and some of the zany scenes of them eating out reminded me of BLUES BROTHERS.....

		<fullReview>I don't understand the negative reviews of this film. It's funny - downright hilarious in parts - and can be watched repeatedly without getting stale. Being a remake notwithstanding (I haven't seen the original), I also found it fairly original, at least for American cinema. The perspective and social commentary on the class system is present without being cloying, and the special effects are good for a movie of this sort. All in all, it reminds me a bit of another French film, "The Fifth Element," that didn't make a bit splash in the theaters, but has been enduring.A note about the review summary - I enjoy a Quentin Tarantino (insert your favorite non-family friendly director here) film as much as the next person - so I'm not trying to make any sort of veiled morality statement by invoking the term "family friendly." However, I find that the term is often used to refer to the formulaic pablum that saturates us - you know, the one where the girl's stern, old-school father is strict with her for her own good, but in the end her individuality and rebelliousness save the day and everyone learns a valuable lesson (all in the midst of a hail of product placements). "Just Visiting" is, refreshingly, not that film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonable fish out of water comedy remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just Visiting starts in 12th Century England where French nobleman Count Thibault (Jean Reno) is about to marry Lady Rosalind (Christina Applegate), a cousin of the English King (Richard Bremmer). However a rival for the beautiful &amp; rich Lady Rosalind has a Witch poison Thibault's wine with a magical potion which sends him insane &amp; makes him kill Lady Rosalind for which Thibault is sentenced to death, a Wizard (Malcolm McDowell) conjures up a potion to send Thilbault back in time to stop Byron but makes a mistake which actually sends Thibault &amp; his peasant servant Andre (co-writer Christian Clavier) forward in time to present day 21st Century Chicago where they meet Julia (Christina Applegate) who turns out to be a distant descendant of Thilbault &amp; Rosalind. Thibault &amp; Andre search for a Wizard in Chicago in order to get back home but find it hard to adjust to the future...This French American co-production was co-written &amp; directed by Jean-Marie Poiré under the pseudonym Jean-Marie Gaubert &amp; is a remake of the French film Les Visiteurs (1993) which also stared Jean Reno, Christina Clavier &amp; was directed by Poiré under his real name &amp; the fact he chose to change his name on the credits of this remake says something, while not the worst silly time travel comedy out there Just Visiting isn't going to win any awards or top any best film lists. The story is pretty weak with next to no explanation behind anything like how Thibault &amp; Andre started in England but ended up in Chicago or the coincidence of meeting a distant future descendant or how Julia know's her boyfriend Hunter is having an affair simply because Andre gives her a handbag. At less than 80 minutes the pace is good &amp; while silly it tries to be funny although I found it to be very hit &amp; miss in that regard, some of the sometimes vulgar humour was amusing like the eating of the toilet disinfectant or Thilbault &amp; Andre washing themselves in the toilet bowl but some of the other humour is very poor with the comic relief Wizard being particularly annoying &amp; scenes like when they attack a television because people are trapped inside. The whole culture clash fish out of water extremities of time travel makes for a few amusing scenes but overall Just Visiting that funny &amp; the script seems to concentrate on sentimental family values &amp; friendship a bit too much. Sentimental is rammed down our throats at every opportunity with no subtly at all, from Thilbault wanting to save Rosalind to Andre finding love &amp; freedom &amp; Hunter the evil boyfriend getting his comeuppance at the end.Cut over here in the UK on DVD to get a lower rating I can confirm the version shown on telly recently was uncut &amp; contained the toilet disinfectant eating bit so it's UK fans might want to check any future showing out. The film looks nice enough, there's a chase through Chicago &amp; there's a fair bit of CGi here too. People's faces morph into vegetable's &amp; trees, people turn to glass &amp; shatter, people tun into human beach balls &amp; bounce around a room (it's as bad as it sounds) &amp; there's even a huge fire breathing Dragon. The computer effects work varies between alright &amp; poor. I must admit that I have never seen the French original so I cannot compare the two but apparently it's better.With a supposed budget of about $40,000,000 the production values are good &amp; it looks alright &amp; fairly polished. Largely shot in England. The acting isn't great, Jean Reno looks bored &amp; show's little interest, Christina Applegate looks nice enough while Tara Reid is attractive enough although she needs to start making better films...Just Visiting is a light hearted time travel fantasy comedy that passes the time pleasantly enough but the lack of any real laughs is a problem &amp; with such a shallow story there's not much to it, the family sentiment that is laid on with a bulldozer is very one dimensional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I vastly enjoyed this film. I love movies about accidental time travel, and this one was more fun than most in the situations the two medieval men -- a knight and his squire -- found themselves in. Jean Reno, who seems usually to play heavier roles, shows great comedic flair, as does his squire, Christian Clavier. Christina Applegate was warm and sympathetic as the confused, distant descendant of the knight, and Matt Ross was a boo/hiss-worthy bad guy. Oh, and one mustn't forget Malcolm MacDowell, who really steals the show as the low-budget, eccentric wizard who messes up one spell after another.The movie had some great laughs and even a couple of heartwarming, tender moments. I was sorry when it ended. I can't fathom why it has such low scores here, but trust me as a longtime moviegoer, with a collection of movies from the silents to the recent, this one is worth the time to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is among the many movies that I came across watching on CW. Since I've never seen the original, I can't comment on that nor can I say which of the two versions I think is superior, or which one I'd prefer over the other. But what I will state is this: This is on my top-movies- from-this-past-decade list! A 12th century French count known as Thibault of Malfete and noble servant named Andre turn to a wizard for help after Thibault's bride-to-be has a malevolent spell casted over her. But the wizardry goes wrong, and instead, the two are sent to 21st century Chicago. While there, they meet Thibault's descendant, Julia and as they explore the windy city and learn, and adjust to the latest technology, they try to find a way to return to their own home (and original time). But that's only if they can overcome some obstacles that may get in their way. This movie was/is so great that I just had to order and buy a copy of the DVD eventually. That's just how great it really is. There are never any signs of the feature's momentum of non-stop hilarity slowing down. Just watch for yourselves. Loved every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this appear on television, I thought 'Oh-no; it's Catweazle in Hollywood'.However, it proved to be a lot funnier than expected. Generally; culture-clash movies seem to work or they don't. There's no happy medium. 'Crocodile Dundee' certainly worked. Though the sequels were abysmal. But those involving time-travel bring some extra zest. The 'Bill and Ted' franchise worked OK. 'A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court' just about survived. Whereas 'Back To The Future' is one of my favourite movies. And I've always got a soft spot for 'Catweazle'.Here, Jean Reno leads a so-so cast in a French medieval romp around modern USA. Humour hangs on the utter mayhem and destruction they cause and a host of unexpected sight-gags that carry a hint of 'Pink Panther'. The sub-plots are rather banal and the romance is too schmaltzy to take with more than a pinch of salt.Little things like the gormandising in an expensive restaurant, confusion about lights and toilets, and a belief that people are actually trapped in a television set are all pretty inevitable, but handled with a slap-stick ingenuity. The metallic wizard reconstituting his broken anatomy was a worthy poke at the T1000 Terminator.It's hardly a piece of genius. For one thing, the cast are just not good enough. For another, neither is the script. But taken as a comic farce it works well enough. I'd compare it with 'Coneheads'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Important events of our times have been kept in time capsules only to be opened in other centuries. Imagine opening the contents of one of these devices in another eight centuries. Our world, as we know it, might look ridiculous, even with the amount of sophistication and advances. Such idea is behind the premise of "Just Visiting", an American remake of "Les visiteurs", a success in France, but such a failure in this country.Directed by Jean Marie Poire, the same director for the original French original. Working on the screenplay with Christian Clavier, who also plays an important part in all the versions, and John Hughes, they have transferred the action from present day France to Chicago. Ueli Steiger, the cinematographer, captured the city in all its splendor.The story juxtaposes the way life was led in the 12th century and today's environment in a large American metropolis. Thibault, a noble man who is about to marry Lady Rosalind, is given a potion that puts him to sleep for centuries. His vassal, Andre, is also a victim of the sorcery.Alas, when they awake, they are in an alien world. Since they rouse in a fine arts museum, they feel right at home, that is, until they have to deal with the unknown world outside, full of dangers they must overcome. The only familiar face is that of Julia, a curator, who resembles Rosalind; in fact, they are related! Jean Reno, who usually is seen in heavier roles, strikes the perfect pose for his Thibault, the romantic nobleman out of place from his regal surroundings. Christian Clavier is perfect as the clownish Andre, the lord's slave who takes to the new world with passion. Christina Applegate is the object of Thibault's love and admiration.There are a lot of laughs in this film that merits a viewing thanks to its creators.</fullReview>

He is getting married to English Princess Rosalind (Christina Applegate). His enemy tries to stop the wedding by giving the princess a hallucinogen. He accidentally takes it instead and kills the princess in a delusional state. He gets help from a wizard (Malcolm McDowell) to transport him back in time to fix his mistake. Instead, it goes wrong and he's sent to a modern day Chicago museum run by Dr. Brady (George Plimpton) and curated by Julia (Christina Applegate). Julia assumes he's her lost presumed-dead cousin. Her boyfriend Hunter (Matt Ross) is selling his estate and having an affair with Amber (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras). Andre falls for kind-hearted Angelique (Tara Reid).Jean Reno is really off-putting in this movie. He is really annoying for a lead. One of the problems is his attitude. He treats Andre like crap. He is arrogant. He is an idiot but not a lovable idiot. The whole movie is aggressively annoying. Jean Reno may not be the right person to do this role.

The production values are high and show it. The entire cast was a joy. My favorite was the great french actor Jean Reno, who was quite believable as the knight. Keep in mind some of the concepts may be a wee bit complex for younger kids ( five and under perhaps). If you need a family film that will not bore you to death! this is the one to rent.

		<fullReview>Most time travel movies make one major mistake: the travelers become too quickly acclimated to life in whatever time they find themselves in. Not so in "Just Visiting," where Jean Reno deadpans his way across 30 generations to present-day Chicago. Being astonished by electric lights and indoor plumbing and having a surprising take on what they perceive a television set to be, there isn't a point in the movie where the characters lose the naivete of time travelers, yet Reno never sinks to buffoonery (he leaves that for his servant) but maintains a regal dignity that keeps things moving. Laugh-out-loud funny in spots and a hoot throughout, "Just Visiting" is definitely worth a viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical viability</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found 'Just visiting' an great movie! I get the feeling that why there are so many bad critiques it is because they simply can't relate to some of what happens. Ever since I was 8 my family has acted as French in events re-enacting the French and Indian war in the 17th century. I was impressed with the high level of historical accuracy in the clothing, and situations, but not everyone gets the jokes about historical accuracy. EXPECIALLY if they are not French in the first place.For example when the police are overviewing item's found on the two visitor, they note some sausages found on Andre, mentioning that it was the only thing not found in pockets. This would puzzle most people not familiar with french history, and it even puzzled me until my father explained it to me. The sausages were hanging inside of Andre's pants, apparently with nothing around them either.No small wonder the director set the movie in Chicago for the remake. To try and have French jokes for an american audience would confuse most of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why it's a terrific film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! What fun ! It was terrific to have a movie that I wasn't afraid to take my kids to. It wasn't dumbed down for adults and was slapstick without taking away from the verbal wit. There were a couple of obligatory fart jokes but other than that the comedy supplied some new twists on old tricks.No obscene language, which was a major change. Moral characters - The characters despite what they may seem are for the most part moral folks ( excepting of course the bad guys) and that was really cool.I enjoyed this flick and it's really too sad that it was marketed so poorly. All in all it's gross reciepts compared to the small number of screens were not shabby at all. Just waiting on the DVD.T'khula</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice little movie with some good laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just Visiting is the kind of movie that Hollywood has been churning out for as long as it has been in business: the simple, yet entertaining romantic comedy.The plot is not at all complicated and has been done before. It's the basic 'duck out of water' story line. The strength of this script is that it takes all of the characters seriously and never stoops to making Count Thibault and Andre dumb just because they are from the 12th century. Instead, Thibault is portrayed for what a knight of that period would be: someone full of confidence and used to having his commands followed. The humor here flows from the juxtaposition of different cultural habits, not from dumb characters. There are some absolutely hilarious scenes, like the battle with the SUV and dinner at one of Chicago's finest restaurants that are simply not to be missed, even if the overall product is not the best movie of the season.This is a good family film because there is something for everyone here. The film delivers some humor for adults and for kids. If your children are at the stage where they think bodily functions are the height of humor, they will laugh themselves sick at some scenes. So will the adults, and there is just enough of a serious plot line to keep everyone's attention even if no one will be glued to their seat.Is this film predictable fluff? Yes. It is also entertaining, delivers some good laughs, and fills the audience with a good feeling at its ending. That's more than some films I have seen have accomplished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the rare movies where everything seems to fit. The actors harmonize beautifully, the story is extremely funny. Jean Reno is perfect for the role and Christian Clavier just funny, really, really funny. Christina Applegate is totally non Kelly Bundy and acts just great. What really stands out in this movie is that it does not depend and does not use swearing and foul language to be funny. The gags, the faces, the cut, clean fun - everything just matches. I am going to watch this movie again - this time with the kids.......I wish they make more movies like that. A well deserved 10 from me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning of this movie,seeing the medieval warriors, knights etc, I was trepidated to come across another remake of the Brave heart or Gladiator.It turned out to be one of the funniest movies I' ve ever seen.If you liked American Pie or Something about Mary, You will love this one too. A 12th century French duke and his servant get beamed to the present day Chicago by an awkward witch whose real intention was to send them to a time before a killing so that they can undo the murder.After then , everything is screwed up. The restaurant scene made everyone in the theater roll on the floor laughing.A definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody English wizards, they cannot do anything right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for Christina Applegate, but was not prepared for what a good, unconventional romantic comedy it is. Given the premise, 12th century nobleman comes to 20th century Chicago, there is ample room to screw it up and just make a farce. Instead it is a very well written story and, once disbelief is suspended, it examines the real problems one might face in today's world if you were magically transported forward a few hundred years.Christina Applegate is a fine actress (a bit under-appreciated) and, when she smiles, has the most charming look of about anyone in movies. Here she plays a dual role, as Julia Malfete in present day Chicago, and Princess Rosalind from 12th century England. Superb actor Jean Reno is Count Thibault of Malfete who, when the movie begins is traveling to England to marry Princess Rosalind. Things go awry and soon he is in Chicago, along with his peasant servant André. There is a wizard involved, played with great charm by Malcolm McDowell.SPOILERS FOLLOW. An evil rival of Count Thibault enlists the help of a witch to make the bride go crazy but instead they switch cups and Thibault drinks. In a fit, and seeing a vision of a monster, he pulls his sword and kills his bride. In prison, the wizard comes to him to transport him just before the death of his bride so that he can prevent it, but inadvertently leaving out an ingredient sends him and his servant to present day Chicago instead. He meets Julia, who looks exactly like his bride, and realizes later that she is a direct descendant of his. Which, of course, means that his bride could not have died, and we know the wizard will eventually get him home to make things right. The servant gains his freedom, stays in Chicago, and is destined to be with Angelique (Tara Reid). There is also a side story about her fiancée Hunter having an affair with Pete Sampras's wife while trying to have Julia sign her inherited fortune over to him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just A Waste Of Time Travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps as good a definition as any of the expression the triumph of hope over experience is people - and I am one myself - who persist in watching Hollywood remakes of decent French films in spite of tinseltown's abysmal track record in that department. In my case I persist on the theory that sooner or later the Law of Averages HAS to kick in and someone will get it right. Maybe it will... someday. This is definitely not it. The original stars Jean Reno and Christian Claviar (who also co-wrote the original) are as good as we expect them to be but the original premise has been negated by having them wind up in Chicago instead of France. The idea after all is that they are catapulted forward in time to meet their own descendants still in situ on the same land that has been in the family for 800 years, an impossibility with Chicago, New York or anywhere in the New World for that matter. Okay, it is still funny to see Reno throwing food to Claviar in a high-toned restaurant in Chi but one swallow doesn't make a banquet. Nice try, fellas but no cigar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was that really necessary???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why, please, why do they always have to do this? Remakes, I mean. Are they really necessary? Of all the remakes I've seen so far maybe one was better than the original film. And there are so many remakes around. Why do film people always do remakes? Do they have too much money? Or is it really so utterly terrible for an American to read subtitles? For most (or all?) remakes are for the American market. Could somebody please enlighten me?Because here they did it again: a nice French film and bingo! a few years later we get to see the superfluous remake. Or a nice Danish film. Dutch film. Swedish film. Whatever. Maybe the only way to avoid this to do it the German way: don't do any films at all!So, in the case of "Just visiting" I don't want to repeat what others have already said. I just would like to add what I liked about the film, for this is not much, and I'm an avid admirer of both Jean Reno and Christian Clavier. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*I liked the distorted faces after Thibault had drunk the magic potion. Faces like this, inspired clearly by Arcimboldo, I haven't seen before, that was a nice little idea. Well done.I liked the family tree Thibault finds in his descendants home which indicates their relationship. It looks like family trees from the book of Hartmann Schedel, The Chronicle of 1493. Nice inspiration here, too.And I liked the way Jean Reno tries to portray his knight as a decent character in a silly film - although he somehow fails, because it is hopeless to put something decent into this silly script.Why did these two actors have to do it? Not a good decision. Let them do good films, not a disaster like this again.Watch "Les Visiteurs" instead. This is silly, too, but at least it's funny and not annoying.</fullReview>

To take a fantastic original movie like "Les visiteurs" (which was close to perfection) and put it back in New York with new actors (not better, C. Applegate is nowhere near V. Lemercier), add a car chase, some ridiculous lines (You are in America! You can be free! Say: "I am a free man!"), and some ridiculous emotional sequences is just not the way to do it...The original gags still make you laugh but they are drowned on the whole in this just average movie... Sad...What's more, even if Christian Clavier and Jean Réno try to do their best in Shakespeare's tongue, they are no way near their original performance... 4/10 while the original deserved a 9...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly delightful comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Just Visiting" may seem like a familiar fish-out-of-water comedy. It sure didn't look like much in the previews. That's why I found it surprisingly delightful. I laughed a good deal, and often kept a smile on my face. There are certain moments where they push the fish-out-of-water gags too far (drinking out the toilet? that was too much!) and brief moments of crude humor that we could've done without. But we are stuck in the eye of this tornado of gross-out comedies, and believe me this is nothing! I think you'll find it surprisingly tame, and you can even watch it with the whole family. Watching the great Jean Reno is worth the admission alone. He turns in another fine performance. Of course, I wasn't too thrilled (like always) about the little subplot involving Christina Applegate's nice, naive character engaged to this stuck-up, unlikable airhead (Matt Ross). But I'm going to let that slide, since it was damn funny watching his stuck-up character get humiliated in some of the gags. Then again, this is a magical fantasy where it's important to suspend disbelief. I also have to note Tara Reid, who annoyed the hell out of me as the stereotypical blonde airhead in "Josie and the Pussycats." She's very likable in this movie, and she surely made up for that poor career move. Tara's a beautiful, charming actress with a one-in-a-million smile. I would hope to see her in more likable roles like this. And Carson, you're a lucky man!"Just Visiting" is just a good ol' time at the movies. Fun, lightweight entertainment that will keep you smiling. I can't see why it bombed. But you can now catch it on video and DVD, and I highly suggest you check it out. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

As in what concerns the acting...i could have played better.No offense but i just can't agree with the casting.While Reno and Clavier are at their best, the other actors seemed nothing but artificial to me. If you'd like to see a movie that will catch your attention and make you want to see it again, then choose the first two parts of Les Visiteurs.I wouldn't recommend this sequel to anyone...at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean Reno and the French Comedian, Christian Clavier are in this one for the paycheck. The chick, Cristina Applegate, is cute but can't act. The villain, Matt Ross,is slimy but that's his job. And who would remember Malcolm McDowell under the beard and make-up as the contraculture kid in Kubrick's classic, Clockwork Orange? Add George Plimpton, the old Paper Lion and professional amateur and you've pretty well shaken the box. Then, for the frosting on the cake, take a water-down version of a hilarious French comedy, Les Visiteurs, and there you have it: A summer comedy. Well, sort of. This film is generally harmless and has a few charming moments but the script as full of holes as a tea strainer. Reno still has great intensity even in this parody of the old Mark Twain tale in drag, but it's still a bit ho-hum. Rent it only if you can't find something in the way of a good chick-flick to bring home to show the Mrs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly, I don't understand the many crabby IMDB reviewers who put this movie down as "unfunny" or "a waste of time." I'm rather a snob, myself, when it comes to movies, and I had a really great time laughing at the hilarious situations which the two medieval time-travelers get into in 2001 Chicago. Sure, it's not one of the most subtle and elegant of comedies, but I thought it was fun throughout, and some of the scenes were absolutely priceless. I'll definitely have to find a copy of the French original on which "Just Visiting" is based since, apparently, it's even better.</fullReview>

Often when successful French films attempt to cross the the Atlantic they tend to lose their soul - but not in this case.

		<fullReview>this is one of the funniest movie`s i have seen the humour start`s from the very begining and does not stop till the credit`s roll. which is good because sometimes you see comedy`s were the joke`s start to get unfunny after the first half hour but not hear it will be in my dvd collection as soon as i can get a copy of it :).a prince/king and his fool sidekick are transported to the future because of a mix up in transporting them through time to try and stop a murder. so they find themself`s trying to come to terms with all these modern things and they must figure out how to get back to their own time to stop the prince/king`s wife to be from getting murdered.the wise cracks come flying thick and fast at you all the time like once the prince/king was lost and he wondered in to a pub and asked if any one knew of a wizard that is what they needed to help them get back to their own time. any way he asked and then he told them who he was he said some thing about being `the duke of clemonte` or something like that and this guy said to him `yeah is that so and i`m the duke of hazard` i almost choked on the pepsi i had i thought that was so funny as was all the humour in the movie. this movie is way funnier than a jim carrey movie the humour is better.this is a movie you should all own if you like your comedy`s really funny this is definatly one of my all time favourite comedy`s.there was another part that was funny when the prince/king was taking a bath his man servant/fool side kick wasstanding behind him and was looking at a bottle of chanel n.o5 a huge bottle of it and he grabbed it and drank some and said something like `it has a bitter taste to it`` and the prince took it and tried it and emediatly spat it out and said something like ``fool that`s not for drinking`` as i said before the movie is full of part`s like this if you have not seen it then go and get it you should like it :).rating for this movie 9/10.</fullReview>
