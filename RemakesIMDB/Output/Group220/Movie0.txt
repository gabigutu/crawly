		<shortDescription>Immensely Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at some of the other comments, not everyone is in agreement here, but I have really liked "Les Visiteurs". The original is so good, its a pity they had to spoil with the Americanized version - 'Just Visiting' - which is at best an insult on the intelligence of the American viewing public.For us that do not understand French, they have done a tremendous job with the English subtitles (translating a kind of 'medieval' French into a comparable type of old English ? modern swearwords included). In fact, the job is so well done, that we had a lot of laughs just by comparing the film's verbal antics to the translation. Even though I do not speak French myself, it is quite clear that a lot of effort had gone into this. Sometimes the conversations are fast and furious, so it's worthwhile to see the movie a second time. Even on the second pass, there was a lot to laugh at.This is meant to be slapstick and the story is a total farce, so it's hard to see why some viewers apparently expected more. I thought it was well done, and very well executed. Even though this whole thing is intended as a joke, the reactions of the medieval guys are quite believable.The movie is a blast!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the low rating on this movie, I knew I had to submit a vote because, in my opinion, it make discourage many others from watching one of the funniest movies ever. The plot is very original, a knight and his servant, who were supposed to return in the past only several hours to correct a fatal error in judgment, mistakenly get zapped to modern times. Imagine medieval eyes seeing asphalt and a horse less steel chariot (a car of course) rolling towards them. The men, used to witches and sorcerers, believe it is some sort of devil machine. When the car stops, they promptly attack it. A black man exits and the medievals yell: "A Saracen, a Saracen!". I saw this movie in its original language: French. If you can understand French, I very strongly recommend it. This is slapstick at its best. You will want to buy the movie and watch it over and over because you will always discover something else you missed. It is a jewel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, funny movie, if you speak/understand french well, a medium slapstick comedy if you read subtitles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching the movie, and it was hilarious. I was laughing outloud at many many points. However, as my title indicated, it was the original french track that made me laugh. As is always the case for biliguals, one cant help but listen to the track and read the subtitles at the same time. Unfortunately, the subtitles do not do justice to the movie.There are just too many semantic jokes that play off names and locations that could not be translated and make sense. That is why in so many reviews there seems to be a sharp contrast in views of whether or not this was a joke-a-minute movie. The hollywood remake is awful, in fact,it never really made any sense and and the jokes were far and few in between. This one makes much more sense, and the meeting of people and their descendants makes for many more laughs.The other factor is the acting and casting. This is just the nature of subtitled movies - one very rarely gets the fantastic acting and language ability of actors when reading the watcher is reading a yellow line, especially in comedy. Those who listen to the movie in its original french thikn the acting was fantastic, the voice casting (something i think is terribly important in acting [say, could Ashton Kutcher play Maximus from Gladiator, no, a high pitched voice could not do it]) is brilliant, but reading a crummy translation (and it was crummy) wont do the film justice.8/10 for francophiles 6/10 for subtitle readers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest 'Foreign' Movie I've Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I haven't seen more than probably 40 or 50 "foreign" films, but of those, this is still the funniest one I have watched. The major problem I had with it was that the dialog (and the humorous lines) came so fast I barely had time to read the subtitles. It gets a little tiring after awhile trying to keep up with the reading and viewing at the same time, at that pace.As with all comedies, you get smart and stupid scenes. You get more stupid when you have more slapstick, but you also have more laugh-out-loud moments. Such is the case here, as Jean Reno and Christian Clavier portray clownish 11th-century men who suddenly find themselves in modern-day France. Time-travel films almost always are fascinating, whether it's sci-fi or comedy.Most of the jokes center around the guys trying to figure out today's modern conveniences, such as toilets, and the problems they have trying to figure them out. Also, there are big problems with the men's relatives, who are trying to figure out who these strange-acting guys are all about!As for family viewing: not suitable. There is no sex and no nudity, but there is rough language which is why it's rated "R."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unashamedly silly fun, okaaay?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film late at night on Channel 4 while not being able to sleep, not knowing what on earth to expect. In fact it turned out to be a delightful film, which really made me laugh and was unashamedly silly while not being specifically aimed at kids. I ended up getting it on DVD and making my friend watch it: she also thought it was great. Neither of us can speak French and while we knew the subtitles probably weren't getting all of the humour across we still found it very enjoyable. Shame it had to be remade, although I never saw the English version I'm sure it wasn't as good. Recommended!(P.S. We were also shown some of it in French class - the teacher and I giggled throughout and no one else in the class did! So maybe an acquired taste, but I loved it!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dialogue is fast at times and sometimes in olden French at that, the subtitles are in white and can't be read on a white background but I still found this excellent, (I don't speak French). Jean Reno always a favorite, plays well, though there is not the same scope as in some of his thriller roles. Christian Clavier is superb in his two roles, but for me the star was the Countess. Altogether very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The French sure know how to make it fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The French have a wonderful sense of detail. I've spent 10 months there, and this sixth sense seeps through most things - including films. Their comedies are almost always very good, and if they could just get rid of the need for banana-skin-humor (in this case a bowl of soup on someone's head), they would be hilarious.This film is the funniest of the lot. The characters are extremely funny, and the clash between the medieval knight and his sidekick and the modern world is just as grotesque as I imagine it would be in real life.The part where they have dinner together is the best: "Jour...nuit...jour...nuit..." You can't quit laughing.</fullReview>

Although the jokes are coarse, they are used correctly, WITHOUT fake laugh tracks in the background. The actors portray the characters so well I could almost believe it! Well, almost believe it.

		<shortDescription>Subtitles and All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometime soon we'll agree not to be mad at the French. When that happens, look for "Les Visiteurs" on cable or at the video place. The frantic humor of this time-shifting comedy works well both on the French dialogue track and through the somewhat loose paraphrases of the subtitles. Yes, folks, subtitles and all, this is a good one.Christian Clavier emerged from the Splendide, a French take on Second City, to seize the film comedy market by the throat. Like Jerry Lewis, he is in need of a straight man. Lewis's moved on to the Ding-a-Ling Sisters. Clavier has granite-faced Jean Reno of "French Kiss" and "Mission Impossible", the man with the permanent dix-sept heures shadow across his jowls. Their interaction is spot-on hilarious.Oddly, the memorable quote from this film is in (sort of) English. "OK" is acceptable Franglais, the Academie notwithstanding. Clavier's character becomes fascinated with the word, shouting "O-Kayyy"! at the least provocation. Listen to my wife and I converse: we echo old Jacqouille all the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only film where stupidity actually makes sense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm Chinese who reside in Sydney, Australia, and was fortunate to have a government operated television studio to show foreign programs in its original language with English subtitles.More fortunate isn't because of the showing of the Hong Kong Kung-Fu films but the funniest film in anyone's language ?Les Visiteurs'. As the English subtitles has already provided so much enjoyment to the film, I would assume most of the French would have laugh until they start coughing, to the extended of suffering from a sore throat.OOOKAY!! ? Which was frequently used in the film deliverers the impact to some the comic relief, but from my point of view, it is not a simple comedy to make. Some research was properly done to imagine someone who had lived in the middle ages, not forgetting their customs and habits from that era, then place them to the present day, you will end up witnessing similar chaos and disasters that is far worse than Mr. Bean. My favorite is when they call the car a ?chariot', also the subtitles is presented with Medieval English, I would imagine the same in French.This is not doubt the funniest movie I have seen in my lifetime, the way they mess up the bathroom made me though it was stupid at first, but then I realize it actually make sense, as this is how they clean themselves back in the middle ages. This film beats my funniest English film, which is ?Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' directed by Yoda (i.e. Frank Oz)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very funny comedy, with some really good characters. A knight and his servant from late 11th century France get sent forward in time, after a wizard gets his magic spell wrong. As the two men try to adjust to life in the 1990s, they get into various problems, and meet their descendants. The knight is furious that his castle is now owned by the descendant of his peasant servant, while his descendant is relatively poor. Great acting throughout and with some great scenes, such as when the peasant tries to cook a leg of lamb using an umbrella in the open fire. The ending was quite good, although a bit silly how the peasants ended up. Enjoyable overall, apart from a few swear words which kind of spoil it a bit. I could not keep up with the French speaking most of the time, fortunately I watched it with English subtitles, although as they spoke so fast I had to read them fast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is French Comedy at its best ...Ok-kay?"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Jean-Marie Poiré in 1993, "The Visitors" is without a doubt one of the funniest, most quotable and most emblematic of all French comedies, marking the refreshing come-back of old-school popular cinema, in the same vein than its ancestor "La Grande Vadrouille" and descendant "Asterix: Mission Cléopatre". No social commentary, no political correctness, only pure entertainment for both kids and adults, notably carried by the unforgettable buffoonery of Christian Clavier as Jacquouille la Fripouille and his immortal "OK-kay"? Proof that the film doesn't take its comical premise for granted; it takes almost half an hour to build the set-up before the adventure can finally take off. "The Visitors" begins in an extremely convincing historical set-up, in 1123, during a thrilling fight opposing the King Louis VI "the Fat" to his English cousin. The English are defeated thanks to the intervention of Godefroy who saves his king in extremis by decapitating an English fighter; then as a reward for his bravery, Godefroy is made Count of Montmirail and is promised to marry a duke's daughter, Frenegonde de Pouille, played by Valérie Lemercier. Victim of a hallucination, he accidentally kills his to-be father in law, as a result, the marriage is canceled. "Only God can resurrect the dead", objects Jacquouille. Yes, but Eusebius, the Wizard, proposes another solution. Time is like a mountain made of underground galleries, and one of his most secret recipes can get Godefroy back to the past, one brief instant before the incident.Naturally, it all goes wrong and both Godefroy and Jacquouille (who had to drink first, 'just in case') are ejected in 1992. After that, the comedic core of "The Visitors" depends on a simple yet realistic promise: any person who'd be accidentally put in another era would not really be like fish in water. Think of Marty McFly in "Back to the Future" who was only thirty years too early: he was naturally seen as a weird guy. Applying the same logic, it's quite understandable that the Count Godefroy the Brave and his servant Jacquouille, who were almost nine centuries too late, would be believed to be insane. And while this is already funny, it's even funnier when they are not, like Jacquouille who lives a tender romance with an exuberant trash trailer, played by his real-life wife, Marie-Anne Chazel.The comparison with "Back to the Future" doesn't end here, like Robert Zemeckis, Jean-Marie Poiré doesn't take the comical premise of the plot for granted, to let the film go for cheap jokes begging us to laugh. The script is rich in many subplots that enrich the main story, and the performances of all the cast have the perfect dosage of over-the-top mannerisms and realistic behavior. Reno acts very naturally like a real Knight confident about his majesty, while Clavier delivers a magnificent comical performance as Jacquouille, proving that he's the worthy successor of Louis de Funes. Jacquouille la Fripouille has quickly become one of the most memorable characters of French Cinema, something that most comedies tried to achieve in an artificial way, but the public immediately loved Jacquouille, and he's now part of French Pop-Culture.And the performance of Clavier is more impressive because he also plays another prominent character of the film, as the descendant of Jacquouille, the alliteratively named Jacques-Henri Jacquard a snobbish nouveau riche who bought the Montmirail castle. Valérie Lemercier also plays another character as the Countess Beatrice, descendant of Godefroy. Only an actress with the talent of Lemercier could have turned such a dull and bland character into an unforgettable caricature of the typical aristocrat woman, but touching in her naivety when she believes Godefroy is her cousin Hubert who mysteriously disappeared after an accidental raid. The film earned her a César for Best Supporting Actress, while it was nominated for most of the major categories. But nonetheless, it was the most popular French film at that time.And speaking of popularity, that the film made half the success of the more uninspired "Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis" says a lot about the impact of Media buzz and Internet in a movie's success. Had the movie been directed 15 years later, it would have probably dethroned "La Grande Vadrouille" in the French box-office but then again, can you imagine "The Vistors" set in the 2000's, with all the movie conventions it implies: racial political correctness, special-effects overdose and all that stuff or maybe worse: excessive sentimentalism like in "Bievenue Ches les Ch'tis". I have nothing personal against Dany Boon's "Ch'tis" films but the film received so much publicity that at the end, it wasn't successful because it was popular, but quite the opposite. If only it was good enough to be forgivable, but I can't forgive a comedy that ends in an emotional note, when a punch line is required.I remember when the movie came out, it was the phenomenon of the end of the year, everyone was talking about it with so many superlatives that I couldn't believe a movie would be that funny, especially a French one. Well, I saw it on TV the first time and I laughed, my parents laughed, the whole family laughed and never did a slower moment ever change that feeling, there was not even a slow moment, the film was funny from beginning to end, with an exquisite twist at the end, the so-called punch line that cruelly lacked at the end of Dany Boon's film. At the end, the hysterical incomprehension of you-know-who when he finds himself you-know-where was the icing on an already delicious cake served with a magnificent Gothic music. We all laughed to tears, and the fun that never deserted the film is the proof that sometimes the simplest plot premises can make the most hilarious films. I was not in love with the film but with the story and the way everything worked as a set-up for a hilarious conclusion. OK-kay?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hilarious French slapstick - Jean Reno does comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've only seen this in the French with English subtitles so I'm sure it loses something in translation but it's still very funny. Jean Reno is a world renowned actor but many of the other actors in this ensemble cast were not known to me before. Valerie Lemercier was particularly good, as was the vassal Christian Clavier.This is humour along the lines of Blackadder &amp; Baldrick, but with a time travel medieval vs modern day France twist. It does highlight the difficultly someone would have coming from the past into the modern day and like similar films the time travellers don't adjust within five minutes so it's far more convincing. It's just funny and I don't find the subtitles a distraction, and everyone's increasing hysteria makes me smile. First time I saw it, it was definitely laugh out loud humour and each time you see it there's definitely something more to see. Recommend you see the French original before the American version. Jean Reno is an awesome actor and he shines in this with comedic timing and genius; it's not many big star actors with such gravitas that will dress up in medieval undergarments and wooing "best" for a role and carry it off with so much aplomb! Funny, very very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it is mainly slapstick humor to non French speakers I guess it is in the nuance of the dialog that the French find it so funny. What I liked about it was Jean Reno when playing it straight - there was real menace and one could imagine a medieval knight in today's society coming across as being psychopathic as life was cheap in mediaeval times and to kill a social inferior was as nothing. I also liked the scene not long after the start when the French King, although short and portly had a convincing regal air about him, darting keen shrewd glances about him as he walked through the camp. And the knights looked like real men at arms, a very tough bunch of warriors. If you stay through the titles at the end you will get a wave from a knight in armor who happens to be wearing sun glasses. The version I saw had sub-titles that were in keeping with the ambiance of the screenplay - slightly quaint and old fashioned. They were perfect in their intent of conveying the meaning of the clever and understated French dialog. These sub-titles were for the showing of the movie on Australian SBS channel. No advertisements either, it ran straight through non-stop. Reno plays it as a buffoon for much of the time but underpins his role with occasional deadly serious approaches to his plight and never hesitates to resort to violence to get his way. He presents an unshakeable determination to resolve the matter of being transported in time, resulting in a portrayal of a French knight of old which is very convincing. You would not want to cross this guy. I have watched this movie a number of times and can assure potential viewers that it is truly a very funny movie. Disregard the criticisms of those who didn't like it, they must be pathetically and pathologically humourless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot fault the first reviewer's summary of this movie. However, I would not agree that it is best enjoyed in French. I have a very basic understanding of the language but I knew where the subtle gags were... Okay, I admit not all of them but there again I miss the ones in English films too. You only have to watch the faces and the eyes to grasp what it is the characters are talking (well mostly fighting) about anyway. That is where this film stands up because the acting is absolutely brilliant. It is a true gem of a film and the relationships between the characters are immense. Firstly the relationship between Reno and Lemercier is truly a thing of beauty, especially in the future as Reno courts Lemercier and she slowly falls for his charm. Secondly the dynamic of Reno and Clavier (who is a very under-rated actor and a shame that he has not been in more films to reach English speaking audiences) Their master and servant relationship is hilariously done, Reno as the aloof nobleman and Clavier as the clumsy fool and is in all honesty a work of genius. When the two first arrive in the future and stumble upon a road they attack a postal van, thinking it to be a work of evil - I cried with laughter. All I can really say is please watch this movie and never the remake (I mean NEVER) Clavier steals the show to be honest, in both his roles. Reno is excellent and Lemercier is both beautiful and hugely talented (again, it is a shame she hasn't been in more films for English speakers).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional comedy for a foreign film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie back in Spring 1993 while vacationing in Toulouse. It had just come out and was playing at the same time as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. I had already seen Unforgiven weeks earlier in the US so I opted to see The Visitors instead.I have not regretted that decision. Although my French was poor, and the subtitles were as subtitles go, it didn't matter. I laughed throughout the movie, and I was still talking about it when I returned to the US. I remember trying to get a copy on VHS but it wasn't available (at least not in NTSC format). It wasn't until years later that I came across it again, this time on DVD.I am not a film expert but since I've lived in Spanish and French speaking countries for many years I know that comedy/humor, especially the nuances and the "play-on-words", is almost impossible to duplicate across languages. That "The Visitors" is a global comedy success even though its subtitles cannot possibly convey subtleness show the appeal of the film.If you like comedies, or can appreciate a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, then you'll enjoy The Visitors.</fullReview>

This is without contest the most hilarious movie I have ever seen.Christian Clavier is one of the most famous comedians in France, he started out with the "splendid" in the seventies. Another hilarious movie with him in the cast I can recommend is "le p?re noël est une ordure" from 1982. As for Jean Reno, he is just a great actor who can play dramatic parts (eg: Le Grand Bleu) as well as humorous roles. This movie has become a cult in my country and I am quite chuffed with the positive comments I read from all over the world.</fullReview>

Jean Reno, who we all know from the newest version of The Pink Panther, is Godefroy, and Christian Clavier portrays the very funny Jaquasse the Krasse (I think I spelled that right.) Although the French was a bit hard to understand, the film itself was still intensely amusing. I especially loved the toilet part. My mom liked it more than I did! It's an all around family movie, even though it's rated R. I think that it's very good for kids my age to see, and I'd recommend it to all my friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"O-Kayyy!" - one of the many phrases that stick in one's subconscious from this film; more on that shortly As every one else has pointed out, this a time travel film but it is done with such a deftness of touch that it makes some Hollywood offerings look clumsy by comparison. The film is subtitled but the translation have been done with terrific skill. My French is just about up to the dialogue and who-ever did the work has managed to keep the humour throughout. I like the film so much that I even bought a DVD copy of both Les Visiteurs 1 and 2. Returning to "O-Kayyy!" - I was on a very busy Aires de Service in France. I was asked if I wanted the water tap turning off and without thinking shouted the reply of "O-Kayyy!" Two French, One Dutch and one German couple all collapsed with laughter. Later that evening we ran Les Visiteurs 1 on the laptop for them. The result is four friendships that have endured for more than 6 years Yes, Les Visiteurs 1 and 2are truly cinematic greats</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dipping into sheer goof-ball humor, the French film industry made "Les Visiteurs" about medieval French nobleman Godefroy de Papincourt (Jean Reno) and his loopy squire Jacquouille la Frapouille (Christian Clavier) getting transferred to the 20th century. From there, the movie is basically a series of gags reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and/or Laurel and Hardy, as Godefroy and Jacquouille try to live in the present, apparently without knowing which century they're in. I don't even know whether I can describe any scene, lest I spoil the fun for you.Anyway, you just gotta see this movie. It is a REAL hoot. It goes to show that the French can do more than snooty art. And you probably can blame this movie if you spend the next few days saying "OK".There was an American remake, but it looked idiotic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! As a french student, I was able to understand most of it (it was pretty simple french), and as a movie watcher who speaks english the translations were hillarious. Usually the subtitles aren't as rich and vivid as the original language. Here, the movie could have no sound and just subtitles and it would still be amazing. Starts off a little strange for the first 5 minutes but then it picks up rapidly. There is rarely a dull moment throughout the entire film. SEE IT!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A medieval nobleman (Jean Reno) and his squire are accidentally transported to contemporary times by a senile sorcerer. He enlists the aid of his descendant to try to find a way to return home, all the while trying to cope with the cultural and technological changes distinguishing his time from ours.I had never heard of this film, but apparently Reno and Clavier reprised their roles in a sequel in 1998, the American remake "Just Visiting" in 2001 and a second sequel in 2016. So now I have more to see...This film is very much a cross between "Bill and Ted" and Monty Python, but still different enough to be very much its own film. I love the concept of going hundreds of years in the future to meet your offspring. That's clever. The humor is great, and I'm told it is even funnier if you speak French and don't have to rely on subtitles. (French is unfortunately not one of my better languages.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The two movies came in 1993 and if each one was a huge success, the two split totally in vision and production. This one is about what France does best, comedy and its long history! Usually, time travel is about going into the past and causing paradox while here it's about going into the future which is our present! A bit like "BTF", our heroes feel stuck and alien to their new environment and want to get back to their time-line. But the essential factors here are not the special effects that are rather crude but the cast and the idea to stick to country life that remains even today the real roots of France! Lemercier who isn't among the glamorous one is indeed exceptional as a catholic housewife of this rural elite! And for sure, for all who like French history, the meeting of old language and new speech is totally funny whereas we rather expected the same gap with the objects? So this comedy really embodies what's my country and is thus a must-see for all France lovers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good French comedy if you stick it out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me it took until about half the way through this movie to really get rolling, but it is a lot of fun once you just relax and enjoy the ride. It's not a deep farce, just an enjoyable one. It has a lot of slapstick, but it's not too heavy mostly, although there is a bit of blood and barbarity in the beginning part set in medieval times. (Possibly some of the harsher parts in the beginning aren't suitable for young children--I'm not sure what goes nowadays. By this I mean a graphic beheading and a couple of deaths by crossbow, both played for humor.) The best thing about this movie is that it doesn't sink to the level of a lowest common denominator comedy and retains some intelligence throughout. Overall, just give it time to build momentum and it's a fun time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just one of the funniest ones I've ever seen in my entire life. I still continue to laugh out loud each time I'm seeing this hilarious farce about time traveling.Just imagine that: 2 men from the middle ages, a French Knight hero and his raw squire, are mistakenly sent into modern France after a wizard messed up his potion. Struggling to understand what's happening to them, they met their respective descendants and transform their life into hell. You understand now that what's making this movie so hilarious are the many misunderstandings between Godefroy and Jacquouille on one hand and their descendants, Beatrice, Jean-Pierre and Jacquard on the other hand. It's also hilarious to see Godefroy and Jacquouille discovering the subtleties of modern life like cars, toilets and phones and that Jacquard, Jacquouille's descendant, is the actual owner of Godefroy's family castle, making Godefroy very angered and Jacquouille very proud of this unexpected shift.We can feel that the cast took a real blast during the shooting and I'm sure they burst of laughter during each scene. The good mood is contagious and it's definitely a movie to watch if you have a low day.</fullReview>

The French knight and his peasant servant get mixed up with a sorcerer who gives them a potion that puts them into the modern world to see his modern descendants. *Special Stars- Christian Clavier, Jena Reno, Valerie Lemercier, Maire-Anne Chazel, Christian Bjeau, *Theme- Never make an enemy of a sorcerer.*Based on- French Medieval history and popular time travel film plots.*Trivia/location/goofs- French made (English subtitles) Great costumes, and locations around the French countryside.*Emotion- Rather clever time travel comedy movie dealing with great performances from the actors. The cast plays the emotional and dramatic scenes 'dead' serious which only sets up the comedic outcome with a great finish to this film.

		<fullReview>I am not keen to French comedies, maybe a prejudice, whenever in a slapstick comedy, the usual gentle and romantic French sounds a bit vulgar and harsh to me (I don't speak French though), also due to a cultural barrier, my understanding usually is biased or in sheer ignorance of the dialogues or local allusions. There is a common topic why good comedies are always much more difficult to find than decent and touching dramas, suddenly the answer jumped into my mind, which is in most of people's lives, comedic element only occurs sporadically, major quantity of our time is spent in a drama way which we could feel the appeal from the motion pictures, thus, if we encounter a film totally composed of farces and gags, a sense of out of touch from the reality will slowly kill our patience, hence a usual ending is we completely lost all the interest towards the characters in the film provided its jokes and actions fall into cliché and self- regarded humor. Which is my exact feeling towards the film.I cannot call it a bad film, it entertained me in the first half, then I wished the farce could be ended ASAP (accurately speaking, after the two visitors made a mess in the house of the youngling), Jean Reno's poker face performance is far more enjoyable than Christian Clavier's Joe Pesci-sque monkey business (I cannot squeeze any smile towards him), the last straw is Valerie Lemercier's natural and authentic charm, I cannot believe she was only 29 at that time as I can recall in LITTLE NICHOLAS (2009), she seems to hasn't aged in almost 16 years (a more plausible explanation may be premature senility), I think she is a very qualified comedian.</fullReview>

Pretty simple starting idea, making a middle-age knight and his servant time-travel to nowadays, but the result is extremely funny. What i want to say is also that, and many people mentioned it, a huge part of the humor in the movie comes from the mix of the modern french and this old time french language which is extremely funny to hear, cause we (french) aren't used to hear it often.As for the acting, well its amazing : the duo Reno/Clavier just made this movie great, but the supporting characters are also very good (Lemercier, etc ..)A lot of lines in this movie have become famous in my country ("Merci la gueuse ! T'es un laideron mais t'es bien bonne !"), and just by reminding of this movie, i'm laughing out loud, alone in front of my screen :DOne of the best french comedy ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very funny indeed. People will think you're sophisticated for watching a French film, when in fact the humour is mostly slapstick, puns and the Blackadder-style relationship between a prince and his moronic baldrick, Jacquasse. The humour is not exactly Oscar Wilde, but neither is it overly lowbrow. At times you can hardly bear to watch as the pair wreck well-meaning havoc wherever they go.The first is better than the second, but only marginally. If you like the first, the second is well worth a rent - the fire fighting scene is fantastic.Another good thing about this movie is that its time travel over a somewhat grander scale than we're used to. None of this Back to the Future 50 year jump rubbish. We're talking 1000 years. Interesting to think how a medieval knight would react when confronted with a mail truck. Pummelling it into submission is the option our boys choose.</fullReview>

Enter, "Les Visiteurs," easily the best European comedy I have seen since "La Cage Aux Folles" (both I and II). Again, we have an endearing and zany pair at work in a somewhat different, but no less hilarious, premise. Some of the lines with historical references are really quite funny (such as Jacquart's admiration for Robespierre and his lackey's dismay that the castle windows would leave them vulnerable to the Visigoths, etc.) Fine and striking visual effects (when required) and a charming cast.

		<shortDescription>A French nobleman knight from the 11th century and his vassal are accidentally sent forward in time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As was mentioned in a previous review, I, too, am sure that some of the great dialogue in French was missing when they wrote out the subtitles, but even so, the gist of this movie is easy to follow. The dialogue, even for the 11th century scenes, is crisp and at times very clever, but it's not until the main characters end up in the modern world and are dealing with a populace too self-involved with themselves to really notice that something is amiss, that the real fun begins. The movie starts out in the 11th century and warring clans between France and England and a specific knight who only wants to get back to his love so he can marry her. On the way they encounter a witch who somehow manages to lace his water with something that makes him see a ferocious beast chasing his beloved, when in fact it's her father. He shoots to kill, and does, thus ruining his chances of marriage and having descendants. He can, though fix this error, and heads to the local wizard, who is senile, and the knight, with his slave, end up in modern-day France. They then have to figure out how to get back, since he if does not he realizes that the descendant that ends up helping him will no longer exist. The movie somewhat reminded me of some Monty Python gags, but without the overt silliness. This was an intelligent comedy, at times with some silly elements, but they did not come off as such. Our hero, even when saying something absolutely funny, does so with the style and grace as only nobility can. This is where Reno shines. Who knew? All I have ever seen him in is crime thrillers or dramas, but the man can do comedy and does it well. But what makes this movie so very funny is everyone else around them, all talking fast, so you need to read those subtitles very fast, and all the little actions going on at the same time that somehow have nothing to do with the knight and his side-kick, yet we realize that they actually do, as everything is linked to something along the way. Overall, an excellent movie for some general fun using witty dialogue.</fullReview>

But this rib-tickling take on the head-on collision of "civilizations" and "cultures" a millennium apart, was worth the mistaken identity. Jean Reno is always authentic, and his costar and supporting cast are each delightfully droll and fleshed, as Gallic sensibilities usually appear to be. I particularly savored the Anglicized puns and witticisms, and thought the entire mise-en=scene more than "authentic" both then and now, and that the generic "rating" above is more than unkind and unfair to all those involved in this farcical fable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: Contains some plot details Until the release of Amelie recently, Les Visiteurs was the all time box office champion in France. It succeeds on a number of levels. First, it is a clever time travel film about a French knight and his serf who are suddenly whisked from medieval days to modern day France and meet their ancestors -- a Back To The Future in reverse. Second, it is a charming fantasy with almost Disney like qualities, especially in the 20th century, when our French knight and his serf find kind and sympathetic help from Beatrice, the only one among their descendants who really believes who they are. Third, and perhaps most significant, it is a clever satire about French society. Imagine when our medieval knight makes it to modern times only to discover that his castle is now owned by the descendants of his serf. What follows is a delightful story that is a humorous and often poignant commentary on who and what we are. Jean Reno and Christian Clavier are excellent leads, and Valérie Lemercie shines brightly as Beatrice. There are universal themes here, and even if you don't know a lot about French culture, you will surely enjoy them.</fullReview>

It is like an extremely noisy and hyperactive child that will not stop creating a mess. People shout, break things, engage in endless conversations in which neither side knows what the other is talking about... Things explode, lightnings strike... And yet I am utterly bored and I want to personally grab the protagonists by the neck and choke them to death.I have to say that I'm pretty sure I missed some of the points due to the fact that I was reading subtitles in English. I am also aware that the humour is built around the French culture, which again means that some of the jokes went over my head. Nevertheless, there is no excuse for this film being so incredibly dull and outright irritating. There is not a single scene where people aren't shouting. Shouting does not equate comedy, be it France or Mongolia.Unless, of course, the French have the weirdest sense of humour on the planet.In any event, I advise all people to stay away from this film. It is absolutely atrocious. Watching this is pure torture.</fullReview>

But the sorcerer didn't mix the potion right and so Godefroy and his servant Jacquouille are being sent in the future. This leads to lots of problems, misunderstandings, some funny scenes and endless dialogues (which are supposed to be funny too).Considering that this is the highest grossing movie ever in France I was quite disappointed. I saw both the French (original language) and the German version of this film and wasn't convinced by either one of them. The film certainly has scenes that are simply hilarious but most of the film is rather lame. At least the music score is very good but the music always ends abruptly because of the editing. There are also a few scenes that are not logical and film also contains a very obvious (and therefore disturbing) continuity error. Jean Reno gives a decent performance and Christian Clavier turned out to be a very talented comedy actor. The film is good for a few laughs but fails to be amusing as a whole.My rating: 4/10</fullReview>

The way people keep asking about his "Brother", Jacquoille (who is really his 1000 year old ancestor) , is just so funny.Valerie Lemercier is so much better as Beatrice, than Christina Applegate is as Julia. Beatrice is stronger, less wimpy, and much, much, funnier.I give this film 11 out of 10!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A medieval french knight and his 'baldrick', are transported from the 12th century to present day France (1992). Extremely effective comedy of misunderstandings and manners in a bourgeious setting. Throughout most of the film the medieval duo are mistaken for a couple of harmless cranks, and until the knight discovers that the castle has been converted into a hotel and has a new owner, the film seems to be going no-where. Some hilarious set-pieces (the baldrick eating the cling-film along with a sandwich, and later on, cleaning his teeth at the table of a posh restaurant, gargling and finally spitting all over the table) are so funny because the medieval duo don't think they're doing anything wrong at all. Tres bien.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some Hollywood softballs producer has purchased rights, hired Poiré (film maker and screenwriter), Reno (actor) and Clavier (actor and screenwriter) and are currently (1999) re-shooting in Chicago. Just like "The vanishing", this pic will be shot twice by same team.It was funny and has a sequel. A riot in France where references to modern aristocracy and social class clashes rings a bell. Somewhat mildly received in French Canada where French humour don't stick as much. Didn't make it to my list of all-time favorite flicks. A worthed video rental. More so than any run of the mill american comedy. See it before remake comes-out.Middle-age team time travels to modern French small-town. Same actors play modern-day characters and folks from the past. Aristocrat's descendant live in cottage while servant's descendant purchased the castle, turned it into an hotel and works hard to hide his origin and homosexuality. Funny. Not overwhelmly so, but somewhat funny. Rate it 7 on a scale of up to 10. Extremely funny acting by Clavier and Valérie Lemercier, modern day aristocrat.Filmmaker Poiré previous flick was also remade in Hollywood with Steve Martin as Nuts. Critics didn't like it much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this film. I was curious about it because the film featured Jean Reno in a tin can suit(?).Well folks, "Les Visiteurs" was a very funny movie. I never laughed so much in a long time...at least not at a French film.Je suis desoleé, Messieur Dépardieu, mais...Jean Reno is succeeding as being the most popular French actor in America. He was in "Ronin" and "Godzilla" this year. He was pretty good in both, and video fans are viewing his French films. Reno was very funny as the nobleman blasted into the future.I loved Christian Clavier's role. He may have been a lowly, down-trodden peasant/whipping boy in the 14th century. But, now that's he's in the 20th century...well, see for yourself.The nobleman and his squire have a few slapsticky moments becoming accustomed to simple 20th century innovations like soap. Sure, it's purile humor...lighten up...it was funny.I'm waiting for an American film company to make a remake of "Les Visiteurs" and screw it up.The only thing about the film I didn't care for was the sub-titles. Somehow, a few of the English translations were off a little, but what the heck.Rent this and have a ball!</fullReview>

This is an utterly delightful madcap comedy, yet very touching in places, quite believable, and carried off with a finesse of timing that is awe-inspiring. The performances are wonderful.

		<fullReview>After "le p?re-noël est une ordure" and "Papy fait de la résistance", French audience made a triumph to this movie when it was released in 1993. Indeed, it attracted about 14 millions of people in the theaters! And this success was so huge that the movie was followed (unavoidably) by a (rather poor) sequel in 1998 and even an American version (2001). But in the three movies, the first one remains the best even if according to me it isn't a masterpiece of French comedy. Following a curse provoked by a witch, Godefroy de Montmirail (Jean Reno) is induced to kill the father of his beloved. By trying to come back into the past, he and his horseman are landing in the twentieth century. They discover this new world, its curiosities ans especially their descendants... You can guess it, our visitors feel anxiety, astonishment and curiosity on this world of the twentieth century. In this way, the movie's screenplay appears like thin, a bit predictable and sometimes clumsy: it's obvious that Reno and Clavier are going to launch disasters, not only on the objects but also on several people: the police, Jacquart etc... But in parallel, some elements of the plot make the screenplay agile: Valérie Lemercier doesn't know until the end that her "cousin Hubert" is actually a time traveler. The tandem Reno-Clavier works rather well, besides Clavier is the essential comical character. Above all, he's the one who makes the spectator laugh and without him, the movie wouldn't have been so funny. Another excellent actor: Christian Bujeau, irresistible in his role of exasperated and angry man. By contrast, Valérie Lemercier is more quiet and discreet. It's even a double contrast because she's Reno's descendant and she's all the contrary of her ancestor... The sequences by Lemercier's house are the funniest of the movie but this one loses a little of its appeal in the second part which takes place in Jacquart's castle. At this moment, the movie especially focuses on Reno and Lemercier's efforts to find a way to come back into the past and neglects the comical side in spite of good comical sequences. Nevertheless, as we said: "you mustn't deny yourself a good thing". So "the visitors" remains a good funny movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... or, What's A Nice Time Traveller Like You Doing In A Century Like This? I caught this on its release and fell about laughing. I just bought the video for bupkes in a fire-sale and fell about again. I should really be ashamed to admit this because as a rule it takes the sophisticated verbal wit of a Frasier or better to get me to open and here we're talking belly laff sight gag. Jean Reno does the best deadpan since Buster Keaton - he's still at it in his current release 'Tait-Toi' in which Gerard Depardieu gets the benefit of the Great Stone Face - and that only adds to the fun here as his 12th Century knight cuts a swathe through modern day France. Even if an early scene - having just arrived in the present the knight and his vassal 'attack' a car - owes its origins to John Cleese and Fawlty Towers, they take car beating to a logical conclusion by actually reducing it to rubble substituting a broadsword for Cleese's twig. When one character is billed in the credits as 'Ginette the Clochard (Tramp) it's fairly clear what to expect. With a couple of Burke and Van Heusen numbers this could be up there (or is it DOWN there, that's the thing with time, you never quite know where you are) with Crosby's 'A Yankee At King Arthur's Court' although compared to THIS, 'Yankee' was subtlety personified. Of course non-French speakers immediately lose half the jokes but 50% of these jokes is better than 100% of all the Eddie Murphy faux comedies put together. A laff riot. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The King's warrior Godefroy de Papincourt is set to wed Frenegonde de Pouille. However when he falls under a witches curse he mistakes her father for a bear and kills him with a single crossbow bolt. In order to put things right Godefroy and his vassal Jacquouille go to the local wizard who offers them a potion to travel back in time before the bolt hit. However the wizard messes up and the potion fires them into the 20th century where the castle has become a hotel run by Jacquard and the Montmirail's no longer own it. Godefroy is taken in by his beloved's descendant under the understanding that he is her cousin Hubert. Despite the total lack of understanding of the culture, Godefroy sets about to return to his own time while trying to get the castle back for his descendants. However Jacquouille is not so upset that his peasant family has risen up over the years to run the castle.A hugely successful film at it's time - so successful that the director has tried to milk it as much as possible, with a sequel and an American remake. The story is actually quite good, even if most of the comedy is the usual 'fish-out-of-water' stuff like drinking from toilets, attacking cars etc. The sense of period is very good and Godefroy is well played as an honourable man who finds his culture totally gone. The comedy is not that great - it simply isn't very funny. It's amusing and has it's moments but I just didn't find as funny as other 'fish-out-of-water' films that tackle the same subject. The story itself is OK but I just wanted it to be a bit funnier.Reno is really good here, I'm biased because I like him anyway but he does manage to convey a lot through his character. Clavier was good as modern day Jacquard but unlikable as vassal Jacquouille. This made the ending silly as well, I won't spoil it but I thought neither Jacquouille or Jacquard deserved their fate. The rest of the cast are not very good and seem to clown it up -Marie-Anne Chazel in particular was terrible (a shame as she did the two lead female roles), she hams everything up and can't seem to say "bonjour" without throwing in about 5 exaggerated facial expressions.Overall I wasn't disappointed and enjoyed it while it was on. However most of the acting is iffy and the comedy is basic. Enjoyable, but certainly didn't deserve a sequel or a remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess the main thing to be said about "les Visiteurs" is that it hardly makes sense for a non-French-speaking audience to watch it. I shudder to think what it sounds like dubbed, for instance. Plus the elements of French satire are probably not transposable elsewhere.I laughed to tears when I viewed "les Visiteurs" when it was released in France 15 years ago, where it was an immediate box-office hit. Now I must admit it mostly brings a smile there and there. Of course it's me being 15 years older but the movie just hasn't aged well. The directing is mediocre at best, the cheap CGI is horrendous, and Marie-Anne Chazel's character as a tramp grates on one's nerves. There still remains the altogether funny plot, the hilarious performances by Reno, Clavier and Lemercier, as well as the (then) cult dialogs.Watcheable if you like French comedies, but don't get your hopes too high. In the same vein "Les Bronzés" (part I &amp; II) is far superior. And incidentally Les Visiteurs part II was embarrassingly bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I once commented rather unflatteringly on a film featuring French comedian Louis de Funes a few years ago, and I believe it is one of the least 'useful' comments I have written. Something like 0 out of 19, I think. When it comes to French humour I clearly don't 'get' it, because this successful comedy also left me cold.It begins promisingly, and the scenes featuring Jean Reno's Godefrey de Papincourt and Christian Clavier's Jacquard in their own time are by far the funniest and strongest. Unfortunately, things descend into a typically Gallic farce when they unexpectedly find themselves transported to modern-day France. It's surprising, really, because you'd think the potential for laughs from this 'fish out of water' scenario would be virtually inexhaustible. In this case, however, they're practically invisible. The hapless knight and his serf drink water from the toilet and leave the basin taps running, they pull light fittings from the wall believing them to be torches (one of the funnier moments) and get travel sickness in cars.Jean Reno has a face made for comedy ? although this is the first one I can remember seeing him in and he provides most of the laughs. Clavier's brand of humour is too broad (he also co-wrote) and he is too prone to pulling faces to get laughs. Many of the other characters are simply annoying; they either do stupid things or stand around screeching at what Reno and Clavier are doing. Clavier plays two roles, and it's a toss up as to which is the least funny.Other reviewers have suggested that much of the humour will be lost if you need to rely on subtitles to understand what is being said. While this may be true, it can't account for the number of visual gags that fall flat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comparison to "Just Visiting"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many have expressed the opinion here than "Just Visiting" is a poor remake that does not do justice to the original "Les Visiteurs". After recently seeking out Les Visiteurs on this general consensus, I was somewhat disappointed, and write this commentary in support of the American version released in 2001.To begin, the two films have substantially different themes. Les Visiters theme is "I don't like it here and want to go home". "Just Visiting" puts the most noble theme of true love front and center. And both themes are effectively executed, in the case of Just Visiting with an impeccable "10" hottie, and in the case of Les Visiteurs, with the presence of a countess who is clearly an everyday person enjoying the escapade, but not about to abandon her quaint life with two children and a dentist to chase "nobility".The two films also look very different. Just Visiting is a much crisper, brighter looking film. Chicago's bright lights and big city imagery does more than just take the film across the Atlantic. It shift the characters' perspective to one of ants in a land of giants. By contrast, Les Visiterus retains a provincial French countryside setting which, with cobblestone courtyards and lots of green space, relies on some very brief visual juxtapositions of the galloping night riding under a 747 and next to the TGV (a very French symbol of progress) to introduce the sense of modernity. In Just Visiting, the modern bustle is omnipresent.But the biggest reason to give Just Visiting a chance is the improvement of the funny "out of place" encounters. The dinner scene with throwing the food to the peasant on the floor is much more funny in the fancy Chicago restaurant... with the old rich lady trying to do it too (not to mention the type of disgusting half-eaten food in play), and the scene with the toilette is also more enjoyable with the addition of some very natural mid-evil verbal observations. The new "little people in the TV" scene is great, as is the "run behind the car" scene. I did like the original "attack the devil's chariot" scene more than the "slay the red dragon" scene in Just Visiting, but the references to "a Moor" would be a little too politically incorrect for 21st century sensibilities. As would be the dumping so many catastrophes on the peasant's rather effeminate descendant, whose loss from the script is without notice.To be fair, I found Les Visiteurs more humorous when I listened to the actual french dialog without the subtitles. The effectiveness of this type of comedy really hinges on delivery, something which a non-French speaker will not enjoy with eyes stuck to the subtitles. If you are not French, and not a "French Film" snob with preconceived bias, then you would enjoy Just Visiting as much, if not more, than this film.</fullReview>

Also, the character of the wizard is just a waste. He's just there and then he's gone again. I actually liked the remake better despite it's rushed editing and poor timing.

		<fullReview>This was a VERY silly and often juvenile movie that is NOT, nor would it ever purport to be "high art". The acting and writing are rather slap-stick. In addition, copious amounts of profanities are sprinkled throughout the film, so the kids out there that laugh at this sort of broad humor might not be allowed to see the film due to its R-rating. However, despite it being so dopey throughout, you may find yourself laughing at the many dumb moments. And I guess whether or not you find yourself laughing is more important that if you find the film well-made. That is why I am giving it a '6'--not because of production values or great acting, but because it can be an enjoyable time-passer.I have heard that in France, this movie was a MEGA-blockbuster.

Other then obvious problems, like operating bathroom fixtures, their main problem is dealing with the new class structure, or lack of one. They run into their descendants, and the knight is repulsed, while the squire is overjoyed. So the knight plots to go back to his own time, while the squire attempts to stay, happy as he is with his family's new status as owner of a fancy castle/hotel. I did not laugh, even once.
