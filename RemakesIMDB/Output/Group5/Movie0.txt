		<shortDescription>Another Wonderful Classic Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A HUNDRED YARDS TO THE STATION - A HUNDRED SECONDS TO GET THEREAND A HUNDRED BULLETS SAYING.... THEY'LL NEVER MAKE IT"!So goes the explosive text on the poster for Columbia Picture's 3.TEN TO YUMA (1957). An iconic western 3.TEN TO YUMA has quite deservedly taken its place in the pantheon of classic fifties westerns alongside "Shane", "The Searchers", "High Noon" et al. From a story by the tireless Elmore Leonard it was beautifully written for the screen by Halsted Welles and produced for the studio by David Heilwell. With stark monochrome cinematography by the great Charles Lawton Jr. the picture was arguably the best directorial effort to come from master craftsman Delmer Daves.Glenn Ford heads a superb cast as notorious outlaw Ben Wade who, with his gang, holds up the Butterfield stagecoach, kills the guard and relieves it of its strongbox contents. Van Heflin is Dan Evens the struggling small rancher who - with his wife (Leora Dana) and two small sons try their best to eke out a living on their dried out small holding. But without rain or the money to buy water rights for a nearby stream to water the cattle Dan finds it difficult to carry on. But then luck comes his way. Wade is captured by the posse and the Sheriff offers $200 to anyone who will take Wade to Contention City and transport him by train on the 3. ten to Yuma prison. Dan immediately accepts the job and so begins a tension filled few hours as Dan holds his captive in a Contention hotel room to wait for the train. And all the while staving off the efforts of Wade's men to free their boss as well as contend with Wade trying to psych him out with tempting bribes to let him go. Excitement reaches fever pitch when its time to leave the hotel and go for the train. But then just as Wade's men are closing in for the kill, and in a surprise move, Wade capitulates and actually helps Dan to get him aboard the moving train.Performances are excellent! Ford has rarely been better! As Ben Wade he is roguish, cool and throughly likable. Heflin is great too! His Dan Evens looking almost like an extension of his Joe Starrett from "Shane" four years earlier. And Looking gorgeous is the beautiful Felicia Farr in a splendid cameo as the girl in the saloon. There is a lovely moment at the bar in the empty saloon when Wade is trying to seduce her ("Ye know ye look kinda skinny - but I don't mind a skinny girl if she's got blue eyes"). Poignantly scored and beautifully directed - the scene in close-up, as he kisses her, is both amorous and heartfelt and played out by two superb actors.Providing a wonderful atmosphere to the movie is the music of composer George Duning. Duning was composer in residence at Columbia Pictures and scored most of their prestigious productions like "Bell,Book &amp; Candle", "The Devil At Four O'Clock" and his best known work "Picnic" (1956) in which he pulled a master stroke by combining the tune Moonglow with his own love theme to great effect for the evocative scene where William Holden dances with Kim Novak. His music for 3.TEN TO YUMA boasts a lingering central theme. It is given lovely renditions throughout especially for solo guitar and distant solo female voice. Then with added lyrics by Ned Washington it was turned into a brilliant ballad and sung over the titles by the inimitable Frankie Laine.Fifty years after 3.TEN TO YUMA an unfortunate revisionist remake was produced. It improved on the original NOT one iota and only served to emphasize how good the Delmer Daves classic really is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally don't comment on movies others have already commented on, but this one's been really bother me because no one really noted just how outstanding the cinematic compositions are. They're eye-poppingly gorgeous and remind me of a western Citizen Kane. In some scenes the Deep Focus technique (lots of hot light so that the background is in sharp focus) is outstanding. The artistry is almost out of place in this exciting but preposterously noirish western. There doesn't seem to be anything else in Lawton's repertoire (maybe parts of Two Rode Together?) as good, but director Daves' respect for good pictorials is evident in most of his efforts. It's a great collaboration, and a pretty good picture that's not as great as the sum of its parts. *** Most of the other comments rightly comment on Glenn Ford's cool acting. Isn't it time for him to get a Lifetime from AFI?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delmer Daves has certainly proved himself as one of Hollywood's most talented directors?at least in the Western genre... His "3:10 To Yuma" echoes "High Noon" in some respects, but to make frequent on the similarity misses the point of a very fascinating picture? "3:l0 to Yuma" is a classic among suspense Westerns, a serious examination of the nature of heroism of an ordinary man in control of a dangerous outlaw... It is fundamentally a distinguished psychological drama played out in the claustrophobic setting of a hotel under mental and physical siege? The film deals with two entirely opposing characters locked together in an isolated room where Daves' camera moves ceaselessly on their course of action...After a holdup and the killing of a coachman with a gold shipmen, Ford is captured in a saloon, where he is wasting his time in amorous advances with a lovely barmaid (Felicia Farr).But how to hold him? For his gang, who have made their getaway, will most likely be back to claim him... Ford is sure of this, as his care-free indifference makes it easy to see? The cowed citizenry (echoes of the Zinneman picture) become equally certain? Someone has got to get him out of local circulation and then on to a train to Yuma where he can stand trial?Who will undertake such task?The best offer comes from an austere farmer motivated by a severe desperation... Struggling Heflin sees in the 200 dollars his last chance of salvation as his means of subsistence are too little, and the prolonged drought is killing his cattle... For him, there is no other option...So Ford expects his gang to follow him, and eventually they do... Richard Jaeckel?'the man who slept on the sofa' was how everyone remembered him in this picture?is sinister evidence of discovery?In a hotel room, therefore, they sweat it out? But Van Heflin does most of the sweating, trying to cope, until the train is due, with a situation beyond his experience? For Van Heflin is not even a true professional, as Will Kane was in "High Noon" (who had somewhat similar train-waiting problems), but an amateur, having to deal with Ford's every physical and psychological ruse; having, in the last resort?finding some sort of moral obligation in the job?to resist temptation...The outlaw, an intelligent man, continually seeks for a way that will give him his freedom, but becomes deeply fascinated by his 'keeper'. What kind of creature is this who toils on some miserably piece of land, cares so deeply for it, gets no fun at all out of life and seems so greatly incorruptible? Whatever he is, he's the complete antithesis of Ford? You get the impression that the outlaw is confronted by a being from another planet? Who wouldn't be intrigued?Van Heflin could so easily have repeated his leading homesteader role in Shane, but, in fact, he adds another layer to him? Ford, in one of his best performances, and he has given many, gets the utmost from his greatest gift... The women in the picture, Felicia Farr and Leorna Dana, make a solid contribution to its depth?With a nice musical score, this great psychological Western draws its drama and power from the interaction of two excellent characters rather than gun blazing action...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense little thriller that stands out for it's simplicity and it's strong characterisation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Farmer Evans looks to avoid conflict and work his farm in peace, when he witnesses a stage coach being held up he doesn't get involved. However due to drought and debt threatening his farm, he takes the job of escorting the leader of the gang to Yuma and prison when he is caught. The sheriffs fool the gang into thinking that Wade has been taken by coach and Evans and Wade stay in a hotel room until the train to Yuma. However with Wade's gang getting closer, the clock ticking and Evans' posse deserting him man by man the stakes rise.It's a western but it could easily have been in any setting if it was done this well. The story is clever but really picks up once Wade is captured ? in both Evans' home and in the hotel room, the dialogue becomes clever and meaningful. The story is kept tense (with Evans getting increasingly sweaty) despite being very talky. Wade works Evans in a Machiavellian flow of dialogue that visually gets to him throughout. However once it is clear that honour is important over money the countdown to the tense walk to the train station is on.Heflin is great as the farmer who takes a stand only to see pride swell up in his family, in a way he respects the criminal for taking risk and being brave in contrast to his middle road lifestyle. Ford is effortlessly brilliant as the criminal blessed with charisma and charm with a dangerous streak underneath ? in one key scene he sets out Heflin's character when he easily casts a spell charming Heflin's wife and sons. However beneath the dialogue he is slightly jealous of the farmer's settled life and this adds spice to the relationship between the two.Overall this is a fantastic western, but if it was set in the modern day it would be a brilliant cop thriller, or in space, a brilliant sci-fi. The key is the central relationship between the two men ? here it is perfect and the tension that builds towards the fateful walk to the station is gripping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Van Heflin's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best westerns ever made, a good blend of subtle psychology and action with some taut editing. There isn't one moment of film wasted in this one.I also believe that this is Van Heflin's best screen performance. His Dan Evans is an everyman in the west. A rancher struggling to get by and support his family, he happens to be a dead shot and together with that and his need for money, he agrees to take outlaw Ben Wade to Yuma Territorial Prison.Glenn Ford's Ben Wade is a complex man. He's an outlaw and a killer, the first few minutes of the film establish that. But he's tired. He can easily get away. But the sight of Felicia Farr at that saloon, makes him pause and linger when he should be skedaddling with the rest of his gang. They shouldn't have been stopping at the saloon in the first place. But Ford needed some quiet time and his acting does convince you of his need for a breather.Anyway Ford's nabbed and stage line owner Butterfield, played by Robert Emhardt offers a reward and Heflin needs the money. The only other one aiding Heflin is Henry Jones playing Alex Potter the town drunk. He's a comic character, when they stop at Heflin's ranch, Jones inquires of his two sons where Heflin might keep a jug handy. You laugh but Delmar Daves is very subtly setting you up for later heroics.Ford and Heflin are together most of the film and they have good chemistry. Ford works on Heflin, he'd just as soon offer a bribe to get out of his fix and Heflin comes close to taking it.The best scene in the film is when Heflin's wife Leora Dana comes after Heflin. She finds him hold up in a hotel with Ford handcuffed to the bed just after a shootout in which Henry Jones was killed. They talk, Heflin's not sure he's coming out of this and Dana tries to tell him to give it up. Earlier Robert Emhardt has also told him to give it up. But Heflin's sticking to his duty now. The comical town drunk has just been killed in a very brutal fashion for standing up for law and order and he couldn't look himself in the face if he shirked his responsibility. Remember Heflin is no John Wayne type hero. He's your everyman citizen taking on responsibility for his community's safety. He and Dana play this beautifully and if you don't get an emotional response you are made of stone.Van Heflin had already gotten an Oscar for Johnny Eager. But I think his performance here is even better. Why he was overlooked in the Academy sweepstakes in 1957 is beyond belief. It's Heflin's film and it's a great tribute to a very underrated actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic suspense film that works both within and beyond its 'western genre'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A well crafted film. Superbly paced, composed and edited with hardly a frame out of place. From the very moment the film hits the screen with the 'Columbia' statue and haunting soundtrack you are held throughout. The lead actors, Glenn Ford and Van Heflin are perfectley cast with strong support from Leora Dana, Henry Jones, Robert Emhart, Felicia Farr, Guy Wilkinson et al. This is a film when all the elements that make a good movie - script,music,photography,acting,editing,direction - come together as one and excel. Delmer Daves,Director, has clearley been influenced by other film-makers; there appear to be brief references to Battleship Potemkin and Bicycle Thieves among others. 3.10 to Yuma is a classic suspense film, that works within and beyond its 'western genre'. It remains to be seen what James Mangold, Director(Walk The Line etc.) and his team make of a proposed re-make scheduled for 2007. They will have to work very hard indeed to come close to the quality of the original production. A good start would be to retain the Frankie Laine soundtrack performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Striking Imagery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Old West, a meek family man (Van Heflin), already under pressure to save his cattle and homestead from a devastating drought, must now confront a ruthless, but smooth-talking, killer (Glenn Ford). Textured characterization of these two men, with seemingly opposite motivations, more than offsets a somewhat thin story, a credit both to the film's dialogue and to the acting.The pace is slow and plodding. The tension builds gradually, as the clock counts down the hours and minutes to the arrival of the 3:10 p.m. train to Yuma (Arizona), that will end the standoff. The film's simple theme of good vs. evil evokes similar stories from the old Gunsmoke TV series of the 1950s.The film gets off to a powerful start, with a stark B&amp;W image of a distant stage coach moving across a barren desert landscape, as Frankie Laine wails, with affectation, the mournful theme song. It's one of the most striking opening scenes in cinema history.While the dialogue and acting are more than competent, it's the visuals that really distinguish this film. The overall B&amp;W imagery provided by cinematographer Charles Lawton, Jr. is almost in the same league as the B&amp;W imagery from cinematographers Gregg Toland and Stanley Cortez.Apart from the thin story, my only significant quibble with the film is its finale, which I found to be unrealistic, and unsatisfying. These issues aside, "3:10 To Yuma" is a technically well made western that thankfully eschews displays of gratuitous violence, and focuses instead on the psychology of human conflict.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great western from Elmore Leonard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was enjoyable to me before I knew anything about Elmore Leonard's writings. The underlying story is made into a very watchable movie by the director and involves a ruthless but insightful gunman being held for subsequent transport by train which will take him to prison. The job of guarding him is taken on by reluctant guard. This temporary guard is a civilian who takes on the job only because he desperately needs the money to save his farm and family.Typical of Leonard stories, the main characters have strengths and weaknesses not at first evident but when these traits become evident they are significant factors in the outcome of the story.It is an intelligent movie which is great to watch. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original Still The Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before it was re-made, I treasured this modest gem of a western.From the first notes of its mournful, affecting theme to to the poignant finale it draws you in and keeps you riveted as the tension mounts. It accomplishes this by keeping to the Aristotelian unities: a single theme about a single protagonist on a single day. Yes, there is an obvious parallel to **High Noon**.Though cast as a villain for the only time in his career, Glen Ford's natural likability shines through in the role of gang boss Ben Wade. Van Heflin's Dan Evans is Everyman--no hero but spurred to heroism by desperate circumstances and devotion to family. In contrast to Heflin's homeliness is the godlike physical perfection of the young Richard Jaeckel as the outlaw gang's second-in-command, smart, dangerous, utterly amoral yet loyal unto death to his boss.There is not a bad performance anywhere. But I must single out Felicia Farr as the lonely barmaid who gives Ford a last, quick good time, and craggy-faced Ford Rainey as a town Marshal with a plan.With its mix of deep focus shots and closeups of the actors' faces, the cinematography was the obvious inspiration to Sergio Leone in his spaghetti western series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 3:10 to Yuma must surely be in any fan of the 5o's Western genre top 10. Glenn Ford is at his best as outlaw and gang leader Ben wade, it does not take him long to shoot someone, ride into town and then proceed to chat the local barmaid up. When captured he goes one better and makes a play for his armed escorts wife! Van Heflin is superb and worthy of an Oscar in his role as the hard up rancher making a pay day out of being Fords captor.The tension that mounts as Heflin &amp; Ford wait for the train to arrive at the station whilst surrounded by Fords gang is unbearable, and the twist at the end is both unexpected and brilliant in its delivery.</fullReview>

It is a thoughtful game of chess between a ruthless outlaw (Glenn Ford) and a farmer (Van Heflin). To see Ford, who we lost last year, try to buy Helflin (Johnny Eager, Shane), and see Heflin grow in courage was magnificent.Every one else fades as these two play their game.

		<shortDescription>Psychotic killer or gentleman thief?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've liked this movie for a long time. Watching it last night, though, it finally occurred to me to wonder about the character played by Glenn Ford. I don't really understand what motivates him, or his gang.Some people have commented that the closing scene is unbelievable, but I think that's only true because we never get a fix on Glenn Ford's character. Is he a psychotic killer, or is he a gentleman thief?The psychotic killer label is supported by his actions in the opening scene of the stage coach robbery. He didn't even try to talk himself out of that situation, even though the driver was one against twelve and couldn't carry out his threat without being gunned down instantly. It's also supported by the fear that his name strikes into the hearts of all the townspeople. A man doesn't generate that kind of fear by simply robbing stage coaches. Obviously, he and his gang have done a lot of killing.The gentleman thief label is supported by his complete lack of bullying characteristics. In every other situation of the movie except that opening scene, he uses his charm to try to get around people. He doesn't attempt to run roughshod over them. That completely contradicts the image of a guy who shoots first and asks questions later.As for his gang, they show an extraordinary amount of loyalty to him and each other, which makes the shooting during the stage coach robbery that much more unconvincing. Why would they be loyal to a leader who didn't even try to save one of his own? Maybe that was just an anomaly. Ford tells us later in the movie that his gang will always go to extraordinary lengths to save one of their own, and they do just that to try to free him. Yet, at the end, he chooses to save the life of Van Heflin rather than go with his gang. Okay, so he decided that Van Heflin was a good guy worth saving, even if it did get his second in command killed. I don't mind that. What bothers me is, why is he so confident that, having turned his back on his gang, they are going to try to rescue him again in Yuma??? If I'm in that gang, he's made his choice and he can swing for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful if a little flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly Ford's a charming fellow but to score with the barmaid within seconds of meeting her... mind you, her town didn't seem to have much else in the way of real men. Earlier comments have more or less given away the ending, and I, like many of their authors, found this hard to swallow. Heflin does a fine job of the "little man", especially when he's tempted by Ford's offers of good money to let him go. The scenes in the hotel room are some of the finest in a Western. Heflin was a bit rash leaving his wife and children on their own; after Ford's gang had discovered their leader wasn't in the decoy coach they might have gone to his ranch to find out what had happened. I guess one can find flaws in other great Westerns: the much-discussed failure of the Indians to shoot the stage's horses in "Stagecoach", preferring instead to chase and be killed by Wayne et al; and if Cooper had taken a shotgun or second revolver with him in "High Noon" he wouldn't have had so much trouble dealing with the four baddies - but then neither film would have been very exciting. I liked the facts that Heflin's wife actually looked careworn, rather than being the glamour-puss we see out in the desert in other Westerns. And the $200 Heflin needed seemed a realistic sum; all too often Westerns in the 1950s and 1960s refer to sums of money that have been increased to modern values - cowpokes gambling $500, for example.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Room 207 and the 3:10 To Yuma.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Van Heflin plays rancher Dan Evans whose family and livelihood is at breaking point due to a devastating drought. Needing money fast, Evans gets thrown a financial lifeline when a reward is offered to escort a recently captured outlaw, Ben Wade {Glenn Ford}, on to the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. But as Wade's gang closes in to free the shackled outlaw, and the clock starts to tick down, Evans finds himself torn between a sense of social duty and an easy option courtesy of Wade's mind game offer.Based on a story by Elmore Leonard, this is a tight and tense Western that harks to the wonderful High Noon five years earlier. Directed by Delmer Daves, 3:10 To Yuma sees two of the Western genre's most undervalued performers come together in perfect contrast. Heflin's Evans is honest, almost saintly; but ultimately filling out his life with dullness and too much of a safe approach. Ford's Wade is the other side of the coin, ruthless {the opening sequence sets it up}, handsome and very self-confident. This coupling makes for an interesting story-one that thankfully delivers royally on its set-up. As Wade's gang closes in, led by a sleek and mean Richard Jaeckel, Wade toys with Evans, offering him financial gain and gnawing away at him about his abilities as a husband, the tension is palpable in the extreme. Nothing is ever certain until the credits role, and that is something that is never to be sniffed at in the Western genre.The comparison with High Noon is a fair one because 3:10 To Yuma also deals with the man alone scenario. A man left alone to deal with his adversaries and his own conscience; money or pride indeed. Daves' direction is gritty and suitably claustrophobic, with close ups either being erotically charged {watch out for Felicia Farr's scenes with Ford in the saloon} or tightly wound in room 207 of the hotel; where Heflin &amp; Ford positively excel. His outdoor work, aided by Charles Lawton Jr's photography, also hits the spot, particularly the barren land desperate for water to invigorate it. While the piece also has a tremendous George Duning theme song warbled (and whistled by Ford in the film) by Frankie Laine. Great acting, great direction and a great involving story; essential for fans of character driven Westerns. 8.5/10Footnote: The film was very well remade in 2007 with two of the modern era's finest leading men, Russell Crowe &amp; Christian Bale, in the dual roles of Ben &amp; Dan respectively. One hopes, and likes to think, that they remade it purely because it was such a great premise to work from. Because Daves' film didn't need improving, it was, and still is, a great film showcasing how great this often maligned genre can sometimes be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about honour as well as a psychological drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This really is an excellent film. The standard of the acting, the psychological interplay between the van Heflin and Ford characters, the tension (similar to that in High Noon) and the photography have all been commented on. All those aspects are first rate.It is, however, also a film about honour - and interesting from this point of view also. Van Heflin's struggling farmer begins the film by justifying his having to surrender his cattle to the Ben Wade gang if he is not to be shot. Throughout the film his stature develops. His wife later talks of the pride his sons feel in him as the 'man who captured Ben Wade'. Towards the end of the film money is not the reason for his wanting to bring Wade in. When the town drunk has been killed, van Heflin's farmer realises that morality, justice and honour demand that the job be finished (despite others' protestations) and Wade be made to face trial.I do not agree that the ending is really a weak point. When I first watched the film I misheard Ford's Ben Wade character to say 'I've broken out human before' instead of 'I've broken out of Yuma before'. I genuinely think that some sort of strange bond has developed between the captive Ben Wade and that, in a split second decision of human compassion, Wade recognises the worth of his struggling farmer guard whose life has been that of loving struggle to support his wife and family. He therefore acts to save him. It could then be argued that the theme of honour and redemption has extended to include Ben Wade's outlaw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the charming outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) is captured after the heist of a stagecoach, the stage line owner Mr. Butterfield (Robert Emhardt) offers US$ 200,00 to the man that escorts the bandit to the city of Contention to take the 3:10 PM train to Yuma to be sent to trial. The rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) is broken and needs the money to save his cattle and support his family and accepts the assignment. During their journey, Dan saves the life of Ben when a vigilante tries to execute the criminal. Meanwhile Ben's gang split to find where Ben is and then rescues their boss. When they find that Ben is trapped in a hotel room, they put the place under siege and Dan can not find any man to help him."3:10 to Yuma" is a classic western from a wonderful time when honor was an important value in a film and even outlaws could have a code of honor. In the present days, it would be hard to believe why Dan Evans is incorruptible and does not accept Ben's bribe. Glenn Ford performs a charismatic outlaw and the moral duel with Van Heflin's character is fantastic. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Galante e Sanguinário" ("Gallant and Bloodthirsty")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good western indeed! Van Heflin plays a small rancher who undertakes for money he needs desperately the task of putting reckless gang leader Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) in the train that will put him behind bars in Yuma's prison after a stagecoach robbery. The point is that Wade's gang will chase him to free their boss before he reaches the train. The film is intense and thrilling and the black and white photography (rare for 1957) helps to create the dark atmosphere that Delmer Daves probably wanted to surround the action. As the bad guy, Glenn Ford brings a fine performance and though he always looks calm you can tell that he is a really dangerous man. Van Heflin is very good too in a character not far from that he had played four years before in "Shane". The rest of the cast is also in a high level, mainly Felicia Farr as the girl in the saloon that causes Ford to be captured. Richard Jaeckel, as the second in command in Ford's gang, plays a role with no secrets for him since he was often cast as a villain in the fifty's westerns, and gets his as usual. A nice song too in the voice of Frankie Lane. Critics on 3:10 to Yuma are mainly referred to the final part when with no need to do so Ford jumps into the train and actually into prison in some kind of redemption. I think the man is somehow tired of his killing and robbing life and perhaps is planning to change it; or perhaps he has learned to respect Heflin's character and he really means it when he says he did it to pay back Heflin for saving his life back at he hotel in Junction. In my opinion no top 10 western list would be complete without 3:10 to Yuma in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bisbee/Contention/Benson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bisbee/Contention connection was used in 3:10 to Yuma, Hombre, and at least one Randolph Scott western. I saw this when it first came out and recently on the western channel. Frankie Laine's haunting singing has stayed with me since I first saw it.I really like the way the obvious sexual encounter with Wade and Emmy was handled. You knew they had sex but didn't have to see it.As for the ending, maybe Ford (Ben Wade) was overcome by the Stockholm Syndrome where the captive becomes sympathetic to the captor. See many films, more recently the Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada.A great western and if they are doing a re-make, forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"For Fate Travels Everywhere"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The desolate backdrop of the old west , coupled with the wonderfully wistful title song (sung by Frankie Laine), gives this 1957 Columbia film an intriguing opening, one which the viewer cannot help but be absorbed. Van Heflin is Dan Evans, a rancher whose family is threatened by drought, and who is asked to bring notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) to Yuma to stand trial, for a sum that will undoubtedly help his financial problems. Wade's gang is jailed after committing a stagecoach robbery and killing, but they escape, planning to rescue their leader, so Dan must keep one step ahead of them as he escorts the handcuffed Wade to the train station. Felicia Farr has a nice supporting role as the bar girl, Emmy, who falls for Wade - Ford's villain knows how to charm the ladies, so much so that almost every woman falls under his spell. His engaging manner with the girls - "What's a woman for, if you can't treat her right?" - his romantic way of telling stories, almost literally makes the female population swoon. Even Dan's wife Alice (Lenore Dana) is temporarily taken with Wade as he sits, handcuffed, at the dinner table, telling a tale of a girl that he knew with sea-green eyes. Heflin can't understand why women fall for this - after all, this guy is a outlaw and a killer. As the two men arrive at the station town, Wade's gang is ready to pounce and so Evans and Wade hide out in a hotel room, the bridal suite, no less, to wait. Ben then plays mind games with Dan, trying to escape, to beat him down. Although Alice wants him to save himself by allowing Wade to escape, Dan realizes that he has to do it - not only for the money, but because it's the right thing to do. The two guys form a strange bond, as Ben's gang closes in. Had things been different, they may have even liked each other. Wade allows Dan to get him onto the train, explaining that he doesn't like to owe anyone any favors. There is a tentative understanding between them as Dan waves to his wife from the moving train, while the final chords of the title tune and Frankie Laine's voice close this psychological, fascinating Western.Ford's performance is just flawless; he embodies his redeemable bad guy effortlessly, whistling the title song throughout relatively quiet sequences. And he is cunning and manipulative, knowing what buttons to push, as he subtly degrades Dan for not being a good husband and father. Maybe it's my female perspective, but somehow I don't' think I'd be immune to his penetrating gaze. After he and Farr engage in a passionate kiss, we see them a few moments later emerging from the back room of the saloon, fully clothed of course, but there can be no doubt of what had transpired between them. As he is taken away by Evans and the marshal, he promises to send her some pearls. Heflin gives just the right amount of selflessness, courage and compassion as the one who has to perform an unpleasant, risky task to support his family. These two underrated actors fill the screen, and it's hard to imagine any other leading men of the time bringing the protagonist and bad guy to life. An up and coming Richard Jaekel plays Wade's right hand, a fair-haired, cold-hearted sidekick who will stop at nothing to free his leader. He would later go on to have a succession of similar roles in several genres. Director Delmer Daves collaborated with Ford on many Westerns, all of which are gems.The DVD: Transfer looks great, with a few extra trailers included: "Bite The Bullet", "Silverado" and "MacKenna's Gold". It's a dual sided disc so that the viewer can choose between full screen and widescreen."Though you've got no reason to go there, and there ain't a soul that you know there, when the 3:10 to Yuma whistles its sad refrain, take that train . . . . . ."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other contributors have noted the fine cinematography, music, etc, and with all this I wholeheartedly agree but I feel moved to comment on the widespread allegation of an implausible ending. For me the ending is far from implausible but fits perfectly with the ambivalence of the Glenn Ford character. From early on he is casual with regard to his liberty, seeing fit to dally in a bar and even reporting his crime to the authorities. The key to the ending lies in that bar. He recognises the bar girl from another place and another time with a wistfulness that is amplified as he sees what might have been in the farmer and his wife. He is a ruthlessly competent criminal, a devious charmer, but he is also very tired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get me to the train on time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a great fan of Western B-movies, which this obviously is, but intrigued by its recent big-budget remake (which I haven't seen) I was more than pleased in the end to make the acquaintance of the 1957 black and white original.Borrowing a little here and there from two more-celebrated genre predecessors earlier in the decade, "Shane" and "High Noon", nevertheless this movie shakes itself free of these connotations and delivers a very watchable and creditable suspenser.Well directed by old-hand Delmer Daves, it boasts an interesting mixture of perspective shots - I especially liked the close-as-this shot of bad-guy Glenn Ford playing up to the lonely barmaid and a goodly number of high-point viewpoints, convincing dialogue and a winning combination of slow and fast pacing as the fateful 3.10 deadline approaches. The cowboys here all look like honest to goodness plainsmen, dust kicking up off their heels and horses' hooves and the realism is continued in the I would imagine carefully chosen faces of the fearing marshal and his cobbled-together posse, well contrasted with the calm-as-you-like, confident features of the law-breakers, namely Ford and his gang.The acting is very good all the way down the cast, not only high profilers Ford &amp; Heflin, but certainly taking in Heflin's worrisome but ultimately stand-by-her-man wife, the marshal who puts duty above dread, the hapless town-drunk who none the less shows bravery above and beyond the call of duty and even the lovesick barmaid, her part over by the first quarter as the action moves away from her bar.Perhaps her part and burgeoning relationship with the renegade Ford could have been made more of (her sole raison d'etre it seems, is to be the somewhat unconvincing reason as to why Ford recklessly stays on in town) and the ending is a little too pat, with an unlikely bonding between Heflin &amp; Ford saving the former's bacon at the end, a little hard to swallow considering Ford's Faustian goading throughout, but this psychological western gets you to its station in quick time and in good order, like any good train journey should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This taut, classic Western demonstrates what craftsmanship in making movies is all about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lonely train called the 3.10 to Yuma / The pounding of the wheels is more like a mournful sighThere's a legend and there's a rumor / When you take the 3.10 to Yuma You can see the ghosts of outlaws go ridin' by... / In the sky... / Way up high... Now that we've got out of the way one of the most awful opening theme songs any Western has been cursed with (sung by Frankie Laine), let's talk about one of the best-crafted Westerns Hollywood ever made...a fine example of getting the job done superbly and without phony flash, burdensome moral lessons, extra hormones or intense "acting." 3:10 to Yuma is the real goods. It's the short, unadorned story of Dan Evans (Van Heflin), a poor, stubborn rancher in the third year of a drought. He needs water. He needs money. His wife loves him and works as hard as he does. He worries how she's able to put up with all the misfortune. His two young sons look up to him but he'd like to leave them with a memory of him of more than just a hard-working failure. When they're out rounding up cattle the three witness a stagecoach holdup. The youngest boy wants his father to stop the holdup and capture the robbers. He knows with young certitude his father could do it all. Dan tells the boys to be quiet. As played by Van Heflin, we accept Dan's integrity and his earnest desire to do something for his family. It's also the story of Ben Wade (Glenn Ford). He and his gang rob anything they can get money from. Wade makes it a point of pride that he kills a person only if there were no other way to protect his own safety. Ben Wade is intelligent. He's charming, tough, and knows how to get around a woman or get inside a man's head. As played by Glenn Ford, we're nearly captured by star charisma and likability. We know Ben Wade is a smart, sly villain, but we admire his confidence and smiling way of undermining another man's confidence. Dan Evans, desperate for money, agrees for $200 to take the captured Ben Wade to Contention, where he'll put him on the 3:10 train to Yuma and the Yuma Territorial Prison. Ben Wade knows that his gang will sooner or later figure out that he's being taken to Contention to await the train. He even tells Evans how they'll find out. When they show up and rescue him, they'll kill Evans and anyone helping him. This taut, simple story is told with economy and tension. There's no angst or "acting," no allusions to the director's favorite causes, no close-ups of the make-up artists' skill at creating blood clots. In fact, there's not much bloodshed or violence until Dan finally has to find a way to get Ben from the hotel in Contention to the train station, where the train is waiting, and where so is Ben Wade's gang. Although there are some fine subsidiary performances, the movie is all about Evans and Wade. And that means that Heflin and Ford had to be at the top of their game to sustain this 92-minute movie. Dan Evans is a man much like Heflin's Dan Starrett in Shane. He's more resourceful than we might think, but mainly he's an honorable, earnest man who might be tempted by Ben Wade's coaxing tongue, but not for long. He wants the $200 for his family and because he knows he's doing the right thing. Unlike the 2007 remake, there's little question but that his wife loves him and that his two sons look up to him. Glenn Ford rarely played bad guys (watch him in Lust for Gold), but he makes an outstanding one here. His shooting of two men at the start of the movie, one of them a member of his gang, is fast and startling. But it's Ford's winning personality that makes Wade so attractive and so dangerous. Maybe sometimes, when he dallies with a tired, pretty barmaid, he even believes some of what he says. A good deal of the movie is spent in a hotel room in Contention with Wade in handcuffs lying on the bed and Evans holding a shotgun, peering uneasily out the window looking for signs of Wade's gang. The interplay between Ford and Heflin - easy and underplayed - is a pleasure to watch. Ford shows how he can worm his way into Evans' mind, undermining his will and raising doubts. Heflin shows how tempting and frustrating just thinking about what Wade is saying must be. The final shootout is well-staged and violent; the conclusion is satisfying. There are no attempts by rich Hollywood directors and producers to bring Tinsel- town tragedy to a good story. There are echoes of High Noon, which the craftsmanship of this movie and the performances of Ford and Heflin quickly dispel. There are a few clichés that are handled so respectfully, so matter-of-factly and so quickly that they are easy to forgive. The budget for 3:10 to Yuma (1957) was probably, even in 2007 dollars, less than Russell Crowe's salary alone in 3:10 to Yuma (2007). If you like movies and appreciate well-crafted stories, 3:10 to Yuma (1957) might find a place in your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films of 1957</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3:10 to Yuma is definitely one of the best films of 1957. Even though it was completely shunned by the Oscars (not a single nomination) it remains as one of the best Westerns of the 50's. Glenn Ford is perfectly cast as Ben Wade, the criminal who always keeps his cool. The scenes in the hotel room were done perfectly. As Wade starts to creep out Dan Evans (a strong performance by Van Heflin) and tempt the poor farmer with offers of money, Evans, even though he sweats buckets, keeps his head. Ford's confident smile and carefree whistling of the title song make the effect complete. The first half of the movie is good, if a tad bit uneven. However, the last half more than makes up for the beginning; it barely lets you breath. Ben Wade's true colors come through at the end when he saves Dan Evan's life. When the rain comes down in the final scene, it seems to shower the audience with relief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very well written movie. However at age 47 my memory is driving me crazy. I seem to recall that Ben Wade and Alice had a previous history and the older Evans son is really Ben Wades son. Perhaps I'm thinking of a similar movie? Can someone older than me clarify this? I do find the movie very action packed. I enjoyed when they destroyed the town of Bisbee and how well staged it was ti burn the stagecoach when it was discovered Ben Wade wasn't inside. Also the back scenes crew did a fine job with the herds of cattle and many horses. I'm sure someone had to be patient enough to deal with animals. It was in general very well put together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is OK though not brilliant it is worth watching. It is much better than the 2007 remake which towards the end became a total caricature of a film and also focused needlessly long on the transportation of Wade, which in this original version was done in a few minutes of film time.SPOILERS FOLLOW: The end here is though quite unconvincing, unnatural and sudden. How Evans took Wade successfully through the gauntlet of his gang that was there eager to free him, it was some luck getting out of it alive, but the worst let down was the way Wade went up on the train willingly when he could have easily escaped at that point as the train was already leaving. Just refuse to board it.The excuse he gave "I am doing it so as not to owe you anything" is laughable since he basically chose going to the gallows or at least to a long sentence in prison instead of freedom and in real life things like that simply don't happen.But otherwise the acting was good and the psychology of captive and captor very interesting though it made Evans too much of a hero, Butterfield even releasing him from the duty of delivering Wade yet he chooses to stay on ignoring wife and children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: 3:10 to Yuma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, this isn't the updated version starring Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. While it's making its rounds in general and festival circuit release, over here we've got to wait until next year (yes! Almost 3 to 4 months!) before it arrives on our shores. So what can one do in the meantime? Do some homework and pick up the original of course.You would already know by now the basic premise of the story. Ben Wade (Glenn Ford, who was Jonathan Kent in Superman which starred Christopher Reeves, and in the 3:10 update the character is played by Crowe) is one of the most notorious and wanted criminals in the Wild Wild West, and together with his gang, rob a stagecoach in the beginning of the movie, and in the process, kills the driver. While getting his rocks off with a local barmaid Emmy (Felicia Farr), he gets arrested by the town sheriff with the help of poor rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin), and Evans gets offered 200 dollars as a volunteer to transport Wade to Contention City, in time for the 3:10 train to Yuma (hence the title).It's really a simple story about the dynamics and uneasy relations between the two men. One captive, the other the guard. One a criminal, the other just being the mercenary in need of money to get through hard times and feed his family. One full of cunning, the other a good boy scout who has high morals and is serving out his moral obligation. There are enough engaging material here to keep you mesmerized, but the movie turned out to be a quick 92 minutes (the update runs for at least 30 more minutes). The best parts are nonetheless the temptation that Ben brings to the table - let him walk free, and he'll reward Dan with 10,000 dollars, more than 50 times the amount provided to him. Will Dan buckle? It's a quick get rich scheme, nobody will blame him (given nobody else wants this job anyway), and it's almost a banker's guarantee that there will be no blood loss on either side.The tension built in the hotel room where temptation gets seductively dripped and the time gets ticking, is excellence par none, even despite the movie's age. And as the clock approaches 3pm, you find that the odds get stacked against Dan, slowly but surely. However, there are some jarring moments to the plot during those tension filled moments, like Dan's wife Alice (Leora Dana) comes a visiting. And for all the build up, the climax is a little disappointing, at least to me, as there's no big OK Corral styled shoot em ups. It does have a satisfying ending, but one that is rather muted for a Western.In fact, if you look at it on hindsight, it's quite unsophisticated, with few sets, and little battles. What made it being touted as arguably one of the best of its genre, is the delivery by both Glenn Ford and Van Heflin. Ford's mannerisms in his portrayal as Ben Wade will offer no surprises why Russell Crowe was chosen for the role. Van Heflin's Dan is a curious choice to offer to Christian Bale however, as the Dan here's a little stocky, and confident but yet unsure. But Bale being an excellent actor, should be able to pull this off, and it'll be interesting to see how his Dan will react to Ben Wade's propositions.All in all, after watching this one, I can't wait for the remake to come any sooner. No doubt having known how the story played out might mar the enjoyment, you'll never know when, as usual, the Hollywood remake will throw a curveball in the story, especially in beefing up the action with a couple more gunfights. Watching Crowe and Bale go head up aga inst each other, is reason enough to watch the updated version, some half a century after the original was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film noir actors in first rate drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two giants, one movie! I truly admire Glenn Ford and Van Heflin for their excellent work in a type of movies most people don't relate these actors with: film noir. Van Heflin is terrific in "The Strange Love Of Martha Ivers" (1946), "Possessed" (1947) and Joseph Losey's "The Prowler" (1951). After watching those movies I became a fan of him. And for me it is similar with Glenn Ford. "Gilda" (1946), "The Big Heat" (1952) and "Human Desire" (1953) are my favorites of him. Many Americans associate both actors with western ? a genre that doesn't mean much to me.But "3:10 To Yuma" is an outstanding western. The movie is not even as close to film noir as "Pursued" (1947, an interesting and very watchable misfire by Raoul Walsh) or even "Yellow Sky" (1948, an underrated western by William Wellman). Its Director is Delmer Daves, who once directed two remarkable film noir himself ? "Dark Passage" (1947) with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall and "The Red House" (1947) with Edward G. Robinson. But "3:10 To Yuma" is not your typical western. With its overwhelming black-and-white-cinematography by Charles Lawton Jr. and an incredible bunch of character actors it works more like an Akira-Kurosawa-movie for me. Did you ever heard of Ford Rainey, Robert Emhardt or Leonara Dana before? I did not! But all of these actors made me recognize one more time, what a strong cast really means. Everybody was believable and convincing to the last detail. Hats off to such a professional way of working it out! Of course Glenn Ford took his chance and stole the movie. His terrific performance is worth watching until the very end. Ford's portrait of Ben Wade ? though full of holes and contradiction ? is highly interesting and dynamic. This is not an action filled average western story like you've seen so many before. Yes, there is an echo of "High Noon" (1950), which I personally don't rate very high. But "3:10 to Yuma" is more a character study. And also Van Heflin ? a bit too heroic and cliché driven in the end ? has a meaty part while struggling with his own misery and his desire towards a better future and against the option of having none.No, I didn't forget about Felicia Farr as Emmy, and her exciting and liberal relation to Ben Wade. It all adds up to a movie that is definitely not like anything else from the mid fifties. Watch it! You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's perhaps too tempting to compare the old and new versions of Elmore Leonard's 3:10 to Yuma, one by Delmer Daves (old Hollywood pro) and James Mangold (Hollywood journeyman who's hit or miss). While the new version has stronger star talent, and even boasts a beefed up running time and some extra additions in terms of Ben Wade's crew (i.e. Ben Foster), the 50's version boasts a longer section devoted to just Wade and his farmer-turned-gunman Dan Evans together in that hotel room with the moral tug-of-war about logic of the situation and money. Luckily, the essential strength of the source of the conflict stays potent in each version: the devil in western incarnate, a gang leader with lots of guts and even a winning, even charming personality to the right fella or gal, tempts the choice of an ordinary farmer down on his luck with a drought. The line between right and wrong is tested, until it threatens to blur completely in face of the problem at hand, as Wade's gang comes closer and closer.But where Mangold takes things to more nihilistic extremes, Daves takes the material in "old-fashioned" territory, where good men are good and bad men are bad, and there's only so much room for ambiguity. Luckily, just this little bit with hinting at temptation (at one point Evans asks "You sure you could get the money," or something like that) makes this a rich experience, one where the mere suggestion in the face of old moral codes doubles up on the tension of the situation. It goes without saying that Daves still makes things a little too, possibly, 'old fashioned' with certain moments, and even unnecessary, like when Evans's wife shows up right before the clock comes to call at 3; it sets up another beat to Dan's dilemma that's not needed, except to have the added problem of the worried wife on the sidelines of the gunfire. Some of the acting early on in the picture (i.e. Evans's kids) are a little atypical for the genre.But when the going gets good, 3:10 to Yuma is taut and terrific entertainment, led on by Ford and Heflin delivering subtle and convincing performances. What works so well with Ford, especially, is that he could, potentially, play the other part just as well, as he has the quality for a tough leading man (as one might have seen, for example, in The Big Heat). Instead, his better qualities make Wade an insidious bad-ass, the kind of figure that almost draws one into his magnetic qualities, but then the reminder of his true nature comes out in a flash. And Heflin scores well as the conflicted other, a role that requires that there's more complexity than just a usual John Wayne do-gooder. Altogether, it's a fine package that rocks the boat with the genre expectations just a bit, while still making it almost a wholesome, heroic picture, about the terrifying prospect of being heroic in the face of death and going down the path of the "easy route."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tough and plain B-western still outshines it's A-movie remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to jump on the bandwagon and watch the original before the new one showed up, so sue me. But in this case, the viewing was instructive as it really shows (as if there need to be any more examples) how less really was more in the Hollywood of old.Taught and efficient with hardly a wasted second in its hour-and-a-half, this almost feels like it was shot in real-time, one gets caught up in the excitement so. Small-time rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin at his best) gets caught up almost accidentally in helping to transport dangerous outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford, also at his best, absolutely magnetic) to a station to catch the train that arrives at the title hour. Though he's doing it for money to save his farm, he evinces more of a sense of duty or honor than those whose job it is, and slowly he loses all the help he's been promised, as the charming (if cold-blooded and murderous) outlaw tries to get under his skin and get him to abandon his appointed task.But some things are more important that money, something that Wade starts to learn perhaps before hero Evans does, and by the end of the movie the psychological tables are turning. Nothing is overstated, much is alluded to or tossed off in just a word or two, but the performances and direction are so finely calibrated that the somewhat ridiculous conclusion doesn't really seem so outlandish after all.One of the best of the "minor" 50s B&amp;W westerns.

		<fullReview>I would have given this older version of "3:10 To Yuma" a bit of a higher rating if I had not recently seen the Russell Crowe feature, released 50 years later. Oh, it's all there ... if you are in the neighborhood theater in 1957. All that's needed is the popcorn. However, Glen Ford just doesn't quite measure up to the same character as portrayed by Russell Crowe, in the 2007 epic. This reference to Mr. Ford may be a little unfair. He was one of our better actors, but was, to a point, restricted by the company that had him under contract during the 50s: Columbia Pictures. In 1957, Columbia was just beginning to get into the game of making motion pictures with bigger and better budgets, although it didn't see fit to present this film in color, which may have been a good loot-saving decision for Harry Cohn and his tight fist (Mr. Cohn was the head of the studio, at the time). The black-and-white format presents a perfect atmosphere, thanks to the good direction of the talented Delmer Daves. Van Heflin, still under-rated today for the great performances he gave us during his relatively short film career, is top notch in this western. The beautiful Felica Farr (Mrs. Jack Lemmon,in real life)is also in grand form during the short amount of time she is on-screen.All-in-all, this motion picture is a winner --- if you haven't seen the more recent release under the same title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wherever possible, I like to see the original version of a film before I see its remake. Set to attend a screening for James Mangold's '3:10 to Yuma (2007)' the following night, I quickly decided to rent Delmer Daves' 1957 original, which was adapted from a short story by Elmore Leonard. Unsurprisingly, given its source, the film's plot is extremely simple, unconcerned with the need for a large cast of characters and complicated story lines. After a fatal gold robbery, infamous outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) is captured in a small town, and a group of honest volunteers agree to transport him to Contention to board the 3:10 train to Yuma Prison. One of these volunteers is Dan Evans (Van Heflin), a poverty-stricken small-time rancher with a thirst to proves his worth to both his wife and two sons. Meanwhile, Wade's loyal gang ride in hot pursuit of their leader, intent on rescuing him and avenging his capture. As the tension mounts, and loading Wade onto the 3:10 train begins to seem impossible, the other volunteers rationally retreat from their task, with only Evans staying true to his word.It's only recently that I've begun to concern myself with the Western genre, but '3:10 to Yuma' seems an ideal example. The story's brilliance lies in its own inherent simplicity; the interactions between the two main characters form the picture's emotional core, and it's the incredible depth of these interactions that allow the film to rise above its B-movie foundations. In one case, at least, the minimalism of the film's production allows for the perfect atmosphere in the story's climax, as Wade's bandits begin to surround the hotel room in which their leader is being held. Even before the gang rides into town, the streets have become almost completely vacant; Contention has become a ghost town. It seems likely that this was partly a result of the film's low production budget ? money spent on extras was probably considered money wasted ? but the escalating sense of foreboding created by the chillingly empty streets is perfect, as though, indeed, everybody in town figures that "a storm is blowin' up."Both Glenn Ford and Van Heflin do a very good job considering the film's straightforward plot, and it is their believable characterisations that prove the picture's greatest asset. At first glance, Ben Wade appears obnoxious, sarcastic and detestable, but reveals more likable trait ? and even a streak of nobility ? as the film progresses. Likewise, Dan Evans is portrayed as a conservative man {whose logical unwillingness to take risks might easily be misattributed to cowardice}, one who only agrees to escort Wade in order to claim the much-needed $200 reward. However, as the situation continually progresses towards guaranteed disaster, and all the other volunteers back down regretfully, Evans refuses to surrender. In his captor's inflexible perseverance, and unflinching integrity, Wade discovers a man that he himself respects and admires, and the mutual understanding ? however tentative ? that the two men develop proves crucial in the picture's final moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of Westerns, old and new, but this B&amp;W movie was well worth watching, a classic because every time you watch it, you see something more. This 1957 version is without the modern special FX- like mood color, slow-motion or fast-forwarding action sequences, explosions, blood spatter, sound etc.However, the essence of the film- bad man vs good man, being strong in your values, knowing your priorities, and the willingness to fight to the finish for it- is aptly conveyed.The actors did a commendable job as their screen chemistry worked to make them appear effortless in their role. Ford as Wade is debonair, shrewd, daring; Heflin as Evans is gritty, conscientious, vulnerable, the family "man". They kept the storyline progressing along productively because you try to figure how this will all end. The backdrop delivered, old Arizona scenes helps to create the film atmosphere and in particular a reminder that life is both splendid and fierce- a dichotomy of the story good (splendid) vs bad (fierce).In general I believe man has to accept both those sides of himself too. Adapting to the side he chooses, is his challenge and in it, his success. This movie communicates that battle skillfully and effectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Classic, Off-Beat Westerns of the 1950s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Destination Tokyo" director Delmar Daves' "3:10 to Yuma" (1957) qualifies as one of the classic suspense westerns of the 1950s. Furthermore, in the larger context of westerns, this frontier drama follows in the boot falls of "High Noon" since it concerns a showdown between hero and villain based on a time deadline. Everything about this oater is solid and realistic with strong acting by a competent cast. Composer George Duning's haunting score heightens the tension in scenarist Halsted Welles' spartan screenplay. Welles' also penned another big western "The Hanging Tree" (1959) with Gary Cooper. Welles does an exceptional job of capturing the ironic essence of Leonard's short story, the first of the bestselling author's work to reach the big-screen."3:10 to Yuma" opens with a close-up of parched earth somewhere in the Arizona territory. The camera tilts up to show a stagecoach crossing the landscape in long shot and then the stage swings around toward the camera and its galloping six-horse team hauls the vehicle past the camera trailing a plume of dust. Daves concisely establishes in this one take the inhospitable nature of the surroundings. One of the themes is then man versus nature. Later, we learn that a drought has devastated the area. Seasoned lyricist Ned Washington's words--as sung by vocalist Frankie Lane at his most doleful--enhances this western. An entire sub-genre of sagebrushers emerged in the 1950s that opened with images of horsemen riding through the opening credits with singers such as Frankie Lane or Tex Ritter warbling an atmospheric theme song.Glenn Ford makes a memorable entrance as ruthless but sardonic outlaw Ben Wade. The notorious Wade gang hold up a stagecoach. During the robbery, the stage driver gets the drop on the Wade gang member atop the coach and shoves a gun into his back. The brave driver threatens to kill the Wade gang member if the outlaws don't cease and desist. No sooner has he delivered his ultimatum than Wade himself rides up and guns down his own man and the stage driver.The hero of "3:10 to Yuma" is a small potatoes rancher, Dan Evans (Van Heflin of "Shane") who is waging a losing battle against nature for lack of rain. Dan's cattle are dying, and all our hero requires is $200 dollars so he can obtain six months water rights from a nearby rancher. Unfortunately, Dan is dirt poor. Furthermore, he is stubborn and self-reliant and balks at the idea of seeking a loan from the bank. There is nothing flashy about Heflin's performance or wardrobe. Truly, he is a hero behind the 8-ball.After the Wade gang rob the Butterfield Stage Company of a gold shipment, they gallop brazenly into Bisbee, Arizona Territory, to alert the local constabulary about the hold-up. In the saloon, where they are drinking, they explain that they couldn't thwart the thieves. The marshal (Ford Rainy of "Flaming Star") gathers a posse, but one of them, the town drunk Alex Potter (Henry Jones of "Vertigo"), is late and rides out after the posse has left. Meanwhile, Wade disperses his gang across the border and tells them to rendezvous with him in Nogales. Wade hangs around the saloon to sweet talk young beautiful Emmy (Felicia Farr of "Charlie Varrick") and they get romantic. During this interval, the posse run into Dan and the Butterfield Stage owner. They describe the gang and the marshal realizes then that the cattle drovers back at the saloon were the Wade gang. Alex rides up and tells them that the drovers left town but one of them stayed. The posse heads back to town. Dan distracts Wade in the saloon while the marshal sneaks up behind him and arrests him. The Butterfield Stage owner (Robert Emhardt of "The Stone Killer") offers $200 to anybody that will help escort Wade to the train station for the titular three-ten to Yuma. Initially, Dan refuses but decides that the $200 dollars is worth the risk. Nobody else wants to get in on the money except Henry Potter. For the remainder of the movie, Dan and Wade share the upstairs bridal suite in the hotel while they await the train. Wade's second-in-command Charlie Prince (Richard Jaeckel of "The Dirty Dozen") rides off to prepare a reception for our hero and Wade. Eventually, the gang capture Henry Potter and string him up in the hotel. During the suspenseful wait in the hotel, Ben Wade begins to have a grudging admiration for Dan Evans. When they make dash for the train, Ben actually helps Dan out and they get aboard the train unscathed. Although this ending has been called implausible, I don't think it is anything of the sort. Ben Wade is a dangerous, egotistical killer who has the attitude of a cat playing with a mouse. He is so confident of himself that he plays along with Dan, helps him against his own gang, but ultimately you know that Ben Wade is never going to serve a day in jail. He proved at the beginning that he was willing to kill one of his own men."3:10 to Yuma" isn't the first time that Glenn Ford played a villainous killer. He portrayed a corrupt, maniacal judge in "The Man from Colorado," and before that he specialized in bad guys that turned good in westerns, like "Texas" and "The Desperados." Charles Lawton's stark black and white photography combined with striking camera angles that thrust us into the vortex of the action go a long way toward making the action palatable. Eventually, this drama boils down to two men shut up in an upstairs hotel room as they wait for the arrival of the "3:10 to Yuma" train. Daves and Lawton generate a lot of suspense throughout this western but none more tangible than at the end when our hero and villain approach the puffing train and are obscured by clouds of the steam while the outlaw gang stalk them</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Elmore Excellent Entry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw 3:10 last nite for the first time. Coincidently I'm reading Elmore Leonard's later Bisbee/Contention tale- Hombre. Ford is the atypical Western badguy. He's extremely cleancut and small. Contrast him with Richard Boone, Lee Marvin, etc. He's a careful, thinking man's badguy. Although he can let a pretty girl distort his judgment. Heflin, post Shane, has transformed from a lifelong farmer to an ex-lawman now failing farmer who has gone soft. He's apparently unarmed and with his two sons when they happen upon a stage robbery (facilitated by his own herd) that turns into murder. He stands by (what else could he do?) rationalizing his lack of action to himself and his boys. When his wife hears of it, his manhood/self image is really low. The film is about his attempt to restore his manhood/reputation in the face of ridiculous odds. Some parallels to High Noon.Alone in the bridal suite with his gun on Ford (shotgun wedding?) it is the captive who will try to manipulate/intimidate the hero into giving up.I'm not going to say much more. I liked the film, particularly Ford &amp; Heflin although the ending is not entirely believable. Saw the film again near seven months later and I enjoyed it more than I had remembered. A tip of the cowboy hat to Richard Jaeckel and one helluva friendly barmaid. The remake due in September 2007 doesn't interest me cause you can't improve on Ford and Van Heflin!Recently reread the Elmore Leonard short story and I'm surprised to find the film is better than the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the many absurdities of 3:10 to Yuma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is well acted with a reasonably good look and feel. It's even well written in terms of interesting dialog and character complexity. The problem is (and it is a serious problem) that the plot, character motivations, and action are ill conceived and never credible. Ben Wade (Glen Ford) is a charismatic and ruthless thief and murderer who charms the woman and disarms the men. Dan Evans (Van Heflin) is a simple farmer with a sense of justice who is hired to transport Wade to Yuma in secret and under threat from Fords gang of thieves. The two engage in a psychological battle as they wait in a hotel room for the 3:10 to arrive.All that sounds great, but credibility is the issue. The script is too clever for it's own good. To start, Wade and company actually report their own crime after having committed the robbery without hiding their identities. No explanation is even offered for this odd behavior. Once caught (and he is too easily caught), Wade is far too smug in his presumption that his gang will save him. Evans becomes inexplicable dedicated to his task, willing to risk his own life against impossible odds even after he is released from his commitment.Even so, Evans is inexplicably deferential to his own prisoner. He rolls and lights cigarettes for Wade, repeatedly, without Wade having asked for the favor. Evans evens tell Wade that he has nothing against Wade and is only doing his job. But Evans, seemingly so concerned with justice, actually saw Wade kill two men. Evans contradicts himself in both word and deed. At one point, Wade rushes Evans and is knocked back. His explanation: "I wanted to see if you would shoot." Please. The film is an odd and failed combination of incompatible dynamics. While it assumes the audience is intelligent enough to be fascinated by the psychological battle, it also assumes we're not smart enough to question the many absurdities. In the end it's a real eye roller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sober Western suspense grounded by fine Heflin, Ford performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He may not carry himself or show the authority Gary Cooper does in High Noon but Van Heflin as a desperate farmer in need of rain displays the same steel in 3:10 to Yuma, a suspenseful western with a similar dynamic including a theme song.Ben Wade and his gang of outlaws botch a stage job that results in the death of the shotgun and his capture. The problem is there is no law around to bring Wade to the authorities in Yuma. Ranch farmer Dan Evans facing the loss of his crop and property assumes the responsibility of doing it with the promise of a pay day. The problem is Wade's boys are still around trying to spring him. After sneaking him to another town with a train station he holds up with Wade in a hotel saloon hoping to enlist some support from town folk. Solidly edited director Delmer Daves and cameraman Charles Lawton Jr. achieve a very claustrophobic atmosphere for a western by keeping it off the streets and opting to shrink the drama down to the hotel bar and a room with a view in which Lawton capitalizes on with disconcerting angles and fractured imagery and establish a disorienting tension. Catching the train in the film's climax offers up some other outstanding craftsmanship on those mentioned above.As in Shane, Heflin's unassuming looks and demeanor work superbly to his advantage as a Joe nondescript filled with incertitude but with a determination to dig down and see it through. Wade is a charming snake coolly underplayed by Ford who has an excellent chemistry with Heflin sharing a convincing rapport. Beyond its obvious theme 3:10 to Yuma is an interesting looking original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most thrilling westerns I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"3:10 to Yuma" shows that sometimes a movie doesn't need much to be a great movie. The plot is so simple but so brilliantly presented that it's quite difficult to not be touched by it. In it, the honest farmer Dan Evans (Van Heflin) fearing that he might lose his farm due to the amount of debts decides to take the enormous risk of escorting a dangerous bandit, the charming and manipulating Ben Wade (Glenn Ford, at the top of his game). Evans task is to keep an eye on the bad guy and later take him to the nearest town to catch a train to Yuma that leaves at 3:10 and from there he'll be judged for his crimes.It's all good but Evans situation isn't so promising. Yes, he'll get paid for the service no one wants and here comes the dangers: Wade's partners now led by Charlie Prince (Richard Jaeckal) will try to rescue him. Worst than this is Wade's tactics to convince Dan to let him go, promising to give him a better payment, not to mention Wade's attempts to escape. What's at stake here is the lives of two men with so much to gain and at the same time everything to lose. Tense, thrilling and impeccable from minute one, "3:10 to Yuma" is more than just the western, it's a great character study that reveals important things about people, their character, their force and their persistence in a goal. Breaks the old concept of giving us a scary and ugly villain by trading it for a very likable bad guy that when you look deep into his eyes you can see that all he ever wanted to be is to be someone like Dan, with a wife and kids and good things to look at it instead of just robbing people. He can't have that because he's not the kind of person who settles at anything. When the movie is not on so worried with this aspect there's something exciting waiting for us, just as good as "High Noon" (quite similar films actually, both involving men dealing with a mortal deadline that can change their lives). The whole sequence at the hotel is amazing, a perfect way to test our heart and nerves. And those effects can be achieved even now, it's that good. And to sustain such remark, I suggest you to watch the remake directed by James Mangold in 2007 with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe in the main roles and compare both versions. While the new movie has nice improvements (such as Dan's teenage son being part of the group that holds Ben; or the presentation of Charlie Prince as a gay character - you only notice that if you get the innuendos), they go for more spectacular sequences and violent scenes than just manipulating us in what can happen. It's a good film as well, works better with a younger audience but it's just in the entertainment level. Delmer Daves film goes deeper! Couldn't finish this without saying that the acting was first rate and one of the many pleasures of seeing this classic, with Heflin giving us courage and fear as being two things of a whole, you never know where does one begin and the other end. And the simplicity he gets in presenting those sensations, marvelous. Ford is the opposite. He's bad, mean yet appealing to make you like him, cheer for him sometimes. The Porutguese title for the movie reflects with accuracy what his character is: "Gallant and Bloodthirsty". Inside of that facade capable of winning the ladies trust (even Dan's wife) there's a merciless killer that doesn't care to shoot a man of his group if he's on his way of shooting another target.Don't need to say more about it, it's a must-see film, western fans or not. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Famed and classic Western by Delmer Daves with a magnificent Glenn Ford and a restrained Van Heflin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Formidable Western full of action , violence , fascinating drama, gun-blazing shootouts ,and fabulous performances . This first-rate adult Western draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as the noisy action . It concerns about a needy farmer ( Van Heflin ) with wife (Leonora Dana) and family . He's witness as a dangerous gang (Richard Jaeckel, among others) led by notorious gunfighter named Ben Wade ( Glenn Ford) attacks a stagecoach and killing the passengers . Later on , Ben separates from his band and he goes to a Saloon where meets with gorgeous Emma (Felicia Farr). But the sheriff immediately surrounds the parlour and captures Ben . Railroad official (Robert Emhardt) asks for paid volunteers to join a posse to transport Ben Wade towards Yuma and Dan accepts . Meanwhile, other volunteers unite posse (as the drunk Henry Jones) . After that, and numerous dangers Dan Evans must hole up in a Motel while waiting for the train to take them to Yuma prison and overcome the murderer's several ploys to gain his breakout . The brave farmer agrees to hold trapped gunfighter until the train to Yuma prison arrives overcoming several risks and avoiding his freedom .Good adult Western with exciting battle of wits between an obstinate farmer and an astute killer who begins to psych him out . Stylish, fast paced , solid, meticulous and violent look with several shot'em up. This well acted movie is gripping every step of the way . This classic western is plenty of suspense as the dreaded arrival hour approaches and the protagonist realizes he must stand alone but his fellow town people for help , nobody is willing to help him such as ¨High Noon¨. The narration is almost adjusted in real time , from the beginning, until the final showdown and is approximately developed in ninety and some minutes . Screen-written by Halsted Welles and based on a short story by Elmore Leonard . Elmore is a veteran novelist and screenwriter , specialist on noir plot and Western and working from ¨Tall T¨, ¨Hombre¨, continuing with ¨Rosemary murders¨, ¨Get shorty¨, ¨Jackie Brown¨ until nowadays . Splendid and evocative cinematography in white and black by Charles Lawton Jr . Memorable musical score fitting rightly to action Western by George Duning with sensible song at the main titles and the end by Frankie Laine. The motion picture is stunningly directed by Delmer Daves and results to be one of the best western of the 50s and 60s . It's recently remade by James Mangold with the well-drawn characters played by Russell Crowe , Christian Bale and Gretchen Mol as wife , though contains various changes, as excessive violence and a little bit overlong because the first version runtime is only 92 minutes and recalls much the classic directed by Delmer Daves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was accidentally given this movie instead of the 2007 re-make! And I am grateful. For modern students of cinematography the 1950s Western genre may initially seem somewhat arcane, but movies like this demonstrate how movies of that era reach for a higher plane, not just in terms of the craft, but philosophy as well. This effort is almost perfectly constructed, and worthy of a student's close analysis. It could have been 10 minutes longer, to develop the characters of Ford and Heflin, emphasise some of the sexual tension, and to develop the relationship between protagonist and antagonist. Perhaps some back story should have been implied, too, between the gang and its leader (civil war loyalty ?) And incidentally, I was amazed and pleased how briefly, intensely and satisfying was the connection between Ford and the barmaid.An amazing scene, of just a few minutes - which surely must have shocked adult audiences of 1957 (and passed over the head of children).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Struggling rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his two sons witness a stage robbery in which notorious outlaw gang leader Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) shoots the stage driver and one of his own men. Evans feels helpless to do anything about it, but soon finds himself in the middle of the action when his last-ditch effort to secure a loan for water rights fails.The men in a small town manage to apprehend Wade, but the rest of the gang gets away. In his desperation for money, Evans accepts the job (which pays $200) of escorting Wade to nearby Contention where the "3:10 to Yuma" will take Wade to be imprisoned -- if his gang doesn't catch up to them first! This film benefits from a first-notch cast, and both principle characters deliver a fine performance. Particularly disturbing is Glenn Ford as the cool and confident Wade, who manages to be slimy and despicable while also charming and magnetic. Don't expect a lot of action from this film -- there's not much -- it relies on character interaction and a foreboding tension.On that level, it works well. However, I downgraded the rating on this film a bit because of some inconsistencies in the character's actions -- mostly due to the script. The personalities and ethics of Evans and Wade as setup in the first part of the movie makes some of their ultimate actions seem puzzling. More on that past the spoiler warning.All in all, this is a film well worth watching with good performances -- especially by Ford, even if you do walk away with a few questions about the characters' actions and (in my case) a mixed feeling about the ending.---- WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! ---- With regards to the character's inconsistencies -- It seemed inconsistent for Heflin's character, who was so concerned for his ranch and family, to ultimately turn down the opportunity to simply step aside (with the $200 in tow...) and avoid almost certain death simply because he heard the dying scream of the town drunk. For his character to have this kind of major transformation needed substantially more setup beforehand.Also, why in the end -- which, I'll admit surprised me greatly -- did Wade decide to spare the life of Heflin, while effectively murdering his right-hand man -- simply because he didn't want to "owe anybody". He certainly had no qualms in the beginning of the film about shooting down one of his own riders in cold blood simply because he was in the way of the man he wanted to kill. With a little prior indication of remorse or indebtedness this might have worked -- as it is (even though it made for a cool ending) I just couldn't quite buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of Justice - or even Poetic Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously in many ways this is a classic Western, just as its high reputation suggests. It is very well shot, and it is one of those films where every scene is well done. It is also gripping and full of interest, and well acted.However, in some ways it leaves a sour tastes in the mouth for me. The director, Delmer Davies, had strongly liberal political views, which he incorporated into his films. One of those views was a dislike of too much retribution or justice. So, for example, in his film 'The Last Wagon' (1956), the Indians/Native Americans massacre a whole wagon train full of whites early in the film, but only two of those Indians subsequently die in the whole of the rest of the film. The rest escape scot free.The same principle is true here in '3:10 to Yuma'. The whole of Glenn Ford's gang of nearly a dozen (in the first scene) is responsible for the events leading to the gunning down of the stagecoach driver, yet only three die during the film, and one more ends up in prison. The rest get away with it.Even worse, the brave town drunk, played by Henry Jones, is strung up and murdered by two of the gang, albeit on Richard Jaeckel's orders - but only Jaeckel dies at the end. The other two get away with it entirely. Is this justice? It's not even poetic justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a landmark Western recognizable for its psychological thrilling style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1957 version of "3:10 to Yuma" is a highly popular and recognizable Western film with Van Heflin and Glenn Ford that is considered a classic and notable film for its thrilling style of using psychological suspense instead of the regularly used shootouts and fist fights that most Westerns utilize for their primary action sequences. And while "3:10 to Yuma" does most certainly have gunfights and killings on screen, it does utilize its characters for its suspense and overall, dramatic power. It's not a major action movie, but it stands out for its strong characterization and original plot.The film is about a struggling farmer named Dan Evans (Heflin) who is under pressure by the drought. He needs two hundred dollars (an enormous amount of money back then) to buy water rights or else his cattle and his family will die of thirst. He witnesses a stage robbery done the gang of a notorious outlaw named Ben Wade (Ford) who end up killing a stage driver who gets a little too brave in the face of danger. Later on, Evans helps capture Wade in a nearby town and they plan to send him off to Yuma prison on a train that leaves at three-ten the next day. However, Wade's gang is not so willing to just let them do this....The characterization of the two main characters is remarkably amazing. Wade, though being a killer, is revealed not to be such a bad person at all. He's not a villain, but more like an anti-hero. He killed the stage driver in self defense and although he knows a violent shootout will certainly set him free (as he mentions numerous times in attempts to frighten his captors), he wants to avoid any trouble by convincing Evans to simply drop his shotgun and let him go free. Evans, however, is too proud and believes that since he started this job, he should finish it. They spend most of the screen time in a small, claustrophobic hotel room as they await the train's arrival, and they communicate. At first, calmly, and later on, intensely. Wade uses his smart mouth and quick mind to psych out Evans and tries to bribe him. Eventually, his wits begin to scare Evans' comrades into running out on him, but Evans will not back down, even though outnumbered seven to one. And when the train finally comes, it's just a long walk for the two of them through a town swarming with outlaws both on the ground and on the roofs, to the train station. Even if they get that far, there's sure to be more trouble waiting.One of the interesting creative aspects about "3:10 to Yuma" is its bright and fluorescent cinematography. It's in black-and-white, but if it had been shot in color, then it would have had a very bright and unique aspect to itself. The cinematography gives the film an eerie aspect. And sometimes, it also gets darker and then lighter again. When it's darker, the suspense drops. But as Wade continues to psych out Evans, it seems to increase slightly, giving an eerie appearance and atmosphere."3:10 to Yuma" is one of the classic landmark films of the 50s. It has recently been remade, a half-century after it was first released, and the remake is considered to be even more powerful than this film. I myself have not yet seen it, but whether or not I agree with what the critics say in their praise about it, I still defend that the the original is one of the best Westerns of all time. And one of the best thrillers of all time for its different style of using psychological techniques for thrills instead of noise and action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I don't go around just shootin' people down, I mean, it isn't nice you know..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two earlier 1950's Westerns came to mind while watching "3:10 To Yuma"; the similarities to "High Noon" and "Shane" are inescapable for fans of the genre. It begins immediately, with the Frankie Laine rendition of the title ballad, bookending both ends of the story similar to "High Noon"'s 'Do Not Forsake Me'. Comparing the songs though is unfair, there's nothing remotely intriguing about the Yuma song to make it linger in your memory once it's over. Probably the better comparison is the time element, as the countdown to the 3:10 deadline is reinforced by events that portend a showdown between rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and bad man Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) and his gang.I'd have to say that for a villain and his cronies, this is the most understated and casual Western confrontation I've ever seen. Ford's character in particular is entirely affable in the face of incarceration and punishment for his misdeeds. In what other Western would you ever find the bad guys reporting the robbery?The "Shane" connection wouldn't have been as apparent without Van Heflin as one of the leads; his character Joe Starrett in that film was of similar situation and disposition. Here he has two sons who look up to their father as the be all and end all of their tenuous description of a hero. Though they accept his initial reluctance to get involved as a wise man's decision, they're driven to intercede on their father's behalf when Wade takes dinner with the Evans family. Mother Alice's (Leora Dana) temerity is also called into question by the siblings - "Aren't you supposed to say grace with bad people?"The story evolves into a psychological drama once it becomes a one on one battle of wills between Wade and Evans. One begins to wonder when the self assured Wade will lose the calm exterior and challenge Evans violently for his freedom. It happens fleetingly in the hotel room, with Dan winning that battle, but the war is far from over.Keep an eye on the bad guy posse as it rides into Contention City (appropriately named for the scenario represented). In a couple of scenes, if you keep count of the riders heading in to town, you'll note seven men on horseback. However when Ben Wade looks out the window to talk to his gang, there are eight men present. At the same time, one of the men in the hotel states to Butterfield (Robert Emhardt) that he counted seven men, while Wade remarks to Evans after one of his men is shot, 'it's now one against seven'.Though others in this forum find fault with the ending, I'm willing to cut it some slack. I immediately had the same impression that Wade's action was out of character until he himself explained it. Wade was grateful that Evans saved his life back at the hotel when the stage driver's brother attacked him; owing him one was one of those odd paybacks honored by the bad man's personal code of honor. Besides, he'd broken out of the Yuma jail before.Comparisons to those earlier classic Westerns notwithstanding, "3:10 to Yuma" doesn't quite measure up in terms of impact or tension, but I'd still consider it one of the better films I'd never heard of. And if you were really paying attention throughout, you just had to know that in the end, it was going to rain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Western - comparable to HIGH NOON</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The situation in 3:10 TO YUMA is simple. Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), the head of a gang of desperadoes in the southwest territories (near the real town of Bisbee) is shown leading his gang in the robbery of a stage owned by Mr. Butterfield (Robert Emhardt), who is a passenger. To set up the robbery his gang has grabbed cattle belonging to homesteader Dan Evans (Van Heflin) to slow down the stage and steal it's gold shipment. Evans and his two sons show up to see the robbery in progress, which turns more bloody when Ford's assistant is held at gunpoint by the stage driver - who is tries to force Ford and his gang to disarm. Instead, reluctantly, Ford shoots his follower, and then kills the stage driver. He then removes the horses from the stagecoach, and causes the cattle to scatter so that Heflin and his sons will be forced to round them up. Then he and his gang head for the town of Bisbee to get information about the location of the Mexican - American border.They have a first rate head start - even sending the town Marshall from Bisbee with a posse including town drunk Alex Potter (Henry Jones) to go rescue the stagecoach passengers. But while Ford's gang, led by his second in command Charlie Prince (Richard Jaeckel) rides away, Ford dallies with the local saloon girl Emmy (Felicia Farr), who is an old acquaintance. As a result, the posse returns with Heflin and the passengers, and catch Ford.A plan is set up where Heflin and Jones ride out ahead of the posse to Heflin's ranch. The posse with Ford and Emhardt ride out in the stagecoach towards a particular town - but the stagecoach "breaks down" in front of Heflin's ranch so that (while Ford's gang watches from a distance) they end up following the stagecoach while Ford is now in the care of Heflin and Jones.Their goal is to reach another town where they can put Ford on a train, the "3:10 to Yuma" to get Ford to a large city where he can be tried for murder and robbery. They do get Ford to the town, and even into the hotel that he is supposed to be hidden in until the train arrives. But Jaeckel is there too. And the hours move slowly as Ford tries to convince Heflin to take a large bribe and let Ford go. Why risk his neck for the $200.00 Emhardt has promised to pay him.3:10 TO YUMA was one of the best westerns in the 1950s, with HIGH NOON, SHANE, THE GUNFIGHTER, GUNFIGHT AT O K CORRAL, and a handful of others. It is most like HIGH NOON, with Heflin in the position of Gary Cooper worrying about keeping alive and keeping his appointment with that train. But Cooper's problem was due to his social position as sheriff in a town too cowardly or corrupt to support him. That will cross Heflin's position too, but he desperately needs to be successful because he has a dying ranch (there is a drought going on) and he needs the $200.00 to survive.In the end though the screenplay shows two surprises. Although a drunk, Jones turns out to be braver and more of a good citizen than one would think, and his example ends up stimulating Heflin's conscience. But the other surprise is Ford.SPOILER COMING UP:Ford spends half the film trying either to overcome his disadvantage from Heflin, or trying to convince Heflin to take a large bribe. But when the final moment of truth comes, with Jaeckel urging him to fall down so he can shoot Heflin, it causes Ford to decide he has to join sides with Heflin. Probable reason: earlier that incident where Ford shot his own man to kill the troublesome stagecoach driver. Jaeckel could have done the same thing without any hesitation (after all, Jaekel would have taken over the gang!). When he and Heflin ride off in the cattle car, he shrugs off his act by saying he was repaying a favor to Heflin and he can always escape from Yuma prison.The performances of at least six actors (Heflin and Ford, Jones (a wonderful performance that surprises us), Jaeckel, Farr, Emhardt (a believer in justice, but also an honorable man in the face of danger), and Leora Dana as Heflin's worried wife) help make this an excellent film. Treat yourself by catching this, the original 3:10 TO YUMA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filmgasm.com's 3:10 to Yuma Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By: Tim Depin With all the buzz going to the remake of the same name, what about the original 3:10 to Yuma? Lost in the day when a western movie was helmed by John Ford, or starred John Wayne (or on those great occasion's, both) and in the wake of The Searchers, one of the biggest westerns ever, comes a gem of a film. Based on the Elmore Leonard short story it is a film rich in great direction and performances abound, the movie inevitably comes ahead and spends 1/3 of its running time in a single room, where two men epitomizing good and evil stand just a few feet from each other, in a psychological showdown.3:10 to Yuma boils down to a story of justice. Ben Wade(Glen Ford) and his gang are robbing a stagecoach while Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his two sons watch helplessly. They are eventually approached by the gang and have to watch as a man is killed and a train robbed. Eventually Wade and Evans end up in the same city, when Wade spends a little too much time with a bar maid, he is caught with Evans assisting. The Sheriff and a group of men from the City realize they need to get Wade out before his gang shoots up the town. Evans decides to help if just for the $200 offered. Eventually Wade, Evans, the Stage coach owner, and the town drunk end up in Contention City to catch the 3:10 to Yuma. Evans and Wade are in a single room in a hotel in a showdown of wits. When Wade's gang does show up, Evans is given an out to let Wade go and keep the money however he stays true to his word and tries to reach that train.What stands out most in 3:10 to Yuma is the acting, and the actor that stands out the most is Glen Ford. He plays a man the audience knows is evil. Yet he portrays a good natured man. He is polite and articulate he readily gives Evans money for holding up his cattle ranching earlier in the day. He is smug and doesn't hide the fact he never he thinks he is caught up until the very end. That is not to say however that Van Heflin's performance as a man with strong ties to his morals is not good, it just can't stand out next to Glen Ford's.The direction by Delmar Daves is great as well. He is not directing a western in most senses of the word. There is one rather one-sided shoot out, and the tensest moments are inside a hotel room. Which really makes it more impressive, that the movie is more akin to 12 Angry Men then the aforementioned The Searchers.There is little fault to find in 3:10 but when picking at straws one has to mention the score. Over the opening credits the viewer hears a song called 3:10 to Yuma get used to it now as this is the score of the movie. And little variation is offered upon this. Also while the last 5 minutes or so is very fitting to the characters the very end of the movie reeks of a Hollywood overly sappy ending.Nevertheless not much fault can be found in what is sometimes referd to as the thinking man's western, a distinction that it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The clock is here again, the time of the showdown has been delayed, from noon to 3:10. The black and white photography is excellent. There is a good theme song, on the level with "High Noon" and Frankie Laine is just as good as Tex Ritter. Even the people that are scared and don't help are here. Glenn Ford is the outlaw who has to be moved to Yuma and Van Heflin the man who because of financial problems decides to take this ordeal. Very influenced by "High Noon" this western is very good up to the end which I cannot accept. But I do not think that just because of the last minutes you should dismiss the film. The film lasts 92 minutes, so you have more than 80 enjoyable ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a classic, but almost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The AFI keeps giving premature Life Achievement Awards to stars who either are getting it too soon (Tom Hanks, Jack Nicholson) or who don't really deserve it (Barbra Streisand). I know it's mostly a fundraising event: the award is usually given to anyone who is still alive and will show up with lots of celebrities to testify on their behalf. However, I can't think of anyone currently living who deserves it more than Glenn Ford. Although consistently taken for granted, here is an actor who has made scores of films in virtually every genre and played a wide variety of parts in all of them. In `3:10 to Yuma,' he's on the wrong side of the law for a change as a smooth talking outlaw leader who is captured by deceptively mild-mannered farmer Van Heflin. Heflin has to get Ford out of town on the 3:10 train before his gang can rescue him. The situation strains credulity on several points. 1. I would think a jail cell would be a safer place to keep Ford than a hotel room, where he can look out the window and wave to a cohort. 2. Heflin is always telling the manipulative Ford to shut up. Why doesn't he just put a gag on his mouth? Oh that's right, then there wouldn't have been a movie. 3. The ending is unsatisfying. [POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT] What I would like to have seen happen: Ford is accidentally shot by his own gang, while Heflin escapes on the train. (This is not what actually does happen.) Despite all these weaknesses, Delmer Daves' adroit direction (he was a master of the crane shot), and the excellent performances of Heflin and Ford manage to build up a lot of tension. `Yuma' just misses being a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps I should not have watched this again after a 50-year hiatus, because I remembered it as a western masterpiece, a 10 rather than a 6. It could have been a masterpiece, but it isn't. There's too much style, too much movie tradition that overshadows realism.For one thing, it's hard to imagine a fat herd of shorthorns in the Arizona desert, where there's no grass in evidence. For another thing, the actors are far too clean, too neat, close shaved from start to finish. One can almost smell the after shave lotion. The fictional town, Contention, Arizona, is too posh, especially the hotel which is the site of much of the plot.But this is a character study, a tale of morality, not a realistic story of the old west. There are overtones of Rambo and High Noon, especially the latter. All this is fine, but it might have worked better, played against reality instead of the western background we've seen a hundred times.I haven't seen the new version of this yet and may never see it. It's too bad Leone couldn't have had a go at this morality play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daves' classic has some interesting overtones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of several Westerns the director made which mark him out as a serious contributor to the genre. (My own favourite is his last, The Hanging Tree (1959)). Yuma benefits greatly from a fine performance by the underrated Glenn Ford, whose mixture of amiability and guile makes his villainous Ben Wade particularly effective and dangerous as a character. Wade's narrative presence is also given an unusual dimension by his burgeoning relationship with Emmy, a relationship portrayed in surprisingly sympathetic fashion. Final consummation is left open as a possibility once he leaves prison ?an unusual state of affairs considering the conservative 50's Western's usual attitude to the happiness of killers. As other writers here have pointed out, only the ending to the film is less than satisfactory, Wade's belated loyalty to his escort being psychologically unconvincing.One aspect of the film which has not yet been mentioned here are the faint religious overtones, also found incidentally in the aforementioned Hanging Tree, as we watch the messianic Cooper progresses inexorably to the central execution event. Whether the maker introduced them consciously or not, they give the film a further interest. In Yuma it is Van Heflin at the moral centre, and his journey with his captive turns out to be as much of a spiritual one as it is financial. One can draw parallels between Evans, his rain starved homestead close to a wilderness, tempted by the soft, devilish talk of Wade, and another more familiar tale. And although Evans initially undertakes the task for the desperately needed $300, by the end of the film he is explicitly released from his obligation by stage line owner Butterfield, worried at the turn of events. But bringing his task to a satisfactory conclusion remains something he ?has to do', while his claustrophobic confrontation with the the villain and overcoming temptation has assumed a momentum of its own. All this of course is underscored by the ubiquitous title song (twice even whistled by characters on screen) the repeated cadences of which assume a reverential, hymn-like quality. One might go further and argue that one reason why the ending is so unsatisfactory is precisely because of breakdown of this ?framework', that it is ultimately unbelievable that the tempter would prove saviour..Interestingly I see that James Mangold (director of Cop Land) is set to do a remake of this classic film. It will be a hard act to follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tense, suspenseful Western is spoiler by its forced ending, where bandit leader Glenn Ford suddenly gives up his gang's rescue and jumps on the train with Van Heflin. His explanation is that Van saved his life in the hotel room when a guy tried to seek revenge against him. It's too bad that the writer doesn't know how to end the movie and give the viewer such an unconvincing excuse, because we know that Van didn't do it to save Glenn's life, he is hired to take Glenn to Yuma for trial. Besides, Van shot two of Glenn's men, and one of them is his closest bandit member Richard Jaeckel. So why would he help Van and get himself a death sentence at Yuma? This brings out another question: why take him to Yuma for trial? he didn't kill a man there.Nevertheless, Glenn as the the villain for the first time is at his usual best, and the two actresses give surprisingly subtle performances. But the composer keeps playing the same tune over and over again is a bit annoying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not so much a suspenseful western as it is a character-study between two men at odds: Glenn Ford is the cunning, quiet bank robber, Van Heflin the rancher who takes on the task of trying to bring Ford in. They don't exactly grow to be friends while holed up in a hotel room, but they do come to understand the complications of their situation. There's much dialogue which takes some time cutting to the heart of the matter, but director Delmer Daves gives the downbeat proceedings a romantic grandeur, and the look of the film is probably more striking than the story. Both Ford and Heflin are terrific, but this isn't a western with deep-seated emotional issues (there are psychological undertones which never quite surface). However, it is more involved and absorbing than one might expect, featuring evocative black-and-white cinematography by Charles Lawton Jr. and a stirring music score by George Duning. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"3:10 to Yuma" would rank right up there with "Red River," "The Searchers," "High Noon," "Rio Bravo" and other great American westerns were it not for a plausible, but improbable ending. Nonetheless, great performances by Glenn Ford (his best work), Van Heflin and Henry Jones as well as outstanding music and cinematography highlight this very suspenseful (particularly the last hour), highly entertaining western.Glenn Ford plays the head of an outlaw gang who robs the stage to Bisbee, Arizona. Van Heflin plays a rancher, scraping out a living against a terrible drought, whose cattle are used as an element in the robbery. Heflin desperately needs $200 for water rights to ride out the drought; and he volunteers to escourt the captured Ford to Contention, Arizona to catch the train to Yuma Territorial Prison before Ford's outlaw gang can rescue Ford. As 3:10 PM approaches, Heflin finds himself virtually alone, facing seven gunfighters, constantly being mentally tormented by Ford, who attempts first to corrupt Heflin, then to frighten him into quitting. Ford is simply amazing as the charming outlaw. Even though he killed the driver during the robbery, you can't help but hope Ford will somehow escape his fate.WARNING SPOILER: While Ford redeems himself in a most satisfying manner, his sacrifice is not portrayed in an entirely convincing manner. Had Ford been shown expressing more regret at the deaths of stagecoach driver and Henry Jone's brutal hanging, his sacrifice would have been more convincing.END OF SPOILER While this a a quibble, it's serious enough to reduce my rating from a "10" to an "8". It may also explain why "3:10 to Yuma" is not better remembered as one of the great American westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A+ Cinematography, D- Screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie begins the way all great Westerns should - with the tiny, lonesome stagecoach dwarfed by the breathtaking landscape. It continues in the time honored way by having the stagecoach held up by a band of outlaws, led by Glenn Ford as the wily Ben Wade. Then it introduces the protagonist, Dan Evans (played Van Heflin), and the whole timing and purpose of the story begins to lose momentum.All the establishing shots are simply brilliant, but the actors are by turns wooden, clueless, or clichéd, and only the town drunk seems to have any motivation or personality. My impression upon first viewing was that it was meant to be just another churned out formula piece, but that the cinematographer (Charles Lawton Jr.) chose to be extraordinary and visionary in spite of his humble circumstances. The shot where one of the Gang guys is scoping out the tiny town of Contention and the camera rises about five stories above the action and follows him as he circles around into the main street is beyond anything the poor, miserable screenwriter could possibly ever have envisioned, and therefore made his pathetic lack of decent dialog seem even more disjointed and disorienting. I felt that Glenn Ford just didn't have the chops to handle the hidden menace of his character, and that his sloppy grin and sideways glance never once conveyed a sense of real danger. The tense scene in the hotel room was interesting at times, but mostly for how cleverly it was shot, and the actress playing the bar girl, Felicia Farr, did a very good job of playing a sort of enigmatic victim of circumstance, a quality sorely lacking in any of the characters around her. Otherwise, a B-movie sort of drama, with an indulgent 50's television quality to the direction, so not much else to recommend it. But if awesome camera genius is your cup of tea, you will be greatly rewarded, and might even want to watch it again and again, just to study all the great visual choices that were made without repetition or clichés. I didn't hate this movie, simply found that its style far surpassed its substance, to the point where it took away from my ability to simply enjoy it as a mediocre Western. It might have worked better in my mind with John Ford as director and John Wayne as the bad guy, but that was not meant to be. Only recommended for the beautiful sets and cinematography. Otherwise go watch Shane for true depth, drama and realistic poignancy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie but I still don' know why. It does not have the stunning photography of John Ford's Red River, the style of the Leone Spaghetti Western's, none of Peckinpah's violence and certainly not much of a cast. If you see it and it moves you, you still won't come away thinking its a unique or an A-List movie but you will like it.I think the magic formula lies in the low expectations since this is not one of the most famous Westerns and its not directed by a Ford or Hawks. Glenn Ford - an admittedly Grade-B actor - is in probably the best role of his career and one that fitted his limited acting ability. The theme song has little to do with the plot of the movie but its quite a catchy tune.I hear this is being remade with Tom Cruise of all people. Thats sad and there's no positive way to look at it. It will be another "high-concept" movie with none of the simplicity or grace of the original. It may revive interest and make younger audiences come to see it but I wonder if its simplicity would be appreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>3:10 TO YUMA was a difficult film for me to watch because it's one of those rare times that I've seen the remake, starring Christian Bale and Russell Crowe, before the original. The two films have plots that follow one another closely, so they're virtually indistinguishable, although the remake adds in extra action sequences that weren't in this '50s western.This original turns out to be a surprisingly decent little fable with strong black and white cinematography and good performances from the two leads. Glenn Ford is a likable ne'er-do-well and Van Heflin puts in a commendable turn as a man of principle. The plot is quite straightforward, but it lends itself well to an undercurrent of tension that runs throughout and you're never quite sure what the outcome will be.I suppose you could argue that this version of the story is a little slow in paces (that scene in the hotel room seems to go on forever) but it's still above average and well made by genre standards and a film that's difficult to criticise too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rises Above its B-Western genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1950s, westerns were churned out by the studios to fill those Saturday matinée seats and sell that popcorn. Most followed one of the set patterns of American mythology: Bad Man Turns Good, Returning Civil War Soldier Re-Establishes Himself With Town and Wife, etc."3:10 To Yuma" uses the familiar "Lone Man Not Especially Courageous Against Overwhelming Odds" story to great effect. Glenn Ford is the "bad guy," but not an especially evil one, and Van Heflin is the over-worked, hardscrabble farmer whom life has just passed by. He sees the possibility of financial redemption when a volunteer is needed to take the stagecoach robber Glenn Ford to the train (guess what time the train arrives).Although low-budget, there are several factors which raise this film above B-movie level: the acting is of course very good, the direction weaves a simple narrative, the photography is unobtrusive yet manages to heighten the tension with angles and close-ups, and the script converts a good story into a edge-of-the-chair thriller.One need not be a fan of "westerns" to enjoy this thoroughly engrossing encounter with the genre. In my mind, it lies with "Searchers," "Rio Bravo," "Stagecoach," "High Noon," and the under- appreciated "Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" in the troposphere of cowboy-and-horse films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-Key Performances, High-Key Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to repeat the plot.Director Delmer Daves made a series of westerns in the mid-50's before moving on to glossy fluff like A Summer Place (!959). The westerns include such standouts as Drumbeat (1954), Jubal (1956), and Cowboy (1958). His westerns unfortunately have never gotten their critical due. All show real ability with staging, suspense, and character. Arguably, 3:10 is the best of the lot, certainly the most successful, though my preference is the scenic and sprawling Jubal. I suspect Daves has been overlooked because his westerns, unlike Buddy Boetticher's Ranown series (e.g. The Tall T, {1957}), lack thematic continuity.However that may be, 3:10 builds more than it's share of suspense, as hardscrabble rancher Evans (Heflin) struggles to get smooth-talking outlaw Wade (Ford) onto the train to Yuma and the trial that awaits him. Heflin delivers an ace performance, a study in sheer resolve under an ordinary appearance, while Ford is charmingly devious, an enigma under a smirking veneer. Together they're a study in low-key character rivalry. But I'm especially glad to see two of Hitchcock's favorite TV unlovelies, Jones and Emhardt, getting positive roles for a change. No need to recap the film's obvious dramatic strengths. Instead there are a couple negatives that have generally gone unremarked. Felicia Farr's bartending role turns out to be totally unnecessary to the story. In an otherwise savvy script, the only reason for its presence that I can see is to build up movie star Ford's role. That's not to blame Ford, but it is to point out how established stars got favored treatment from studios, both to nurture the star and protect studio investment. Plus why an unprotected and delectable young woman would be tending bar frequented by drunken cowboys makes no sense. The other point is very minor, yet since when does a cloudless sky produce rain. The long-shot shows no clouds, yet the next shot shows Evans' wife (Dana) hand-waving in the rain, lo, a meteorological miracle. Surely special effects could have matted in a few set-up clouds in an otherwise detailed production.Anyway, the movie remains an effective combination of melodrama and character interest. I'm just sorry Daves has not gotten the recognition his oaters deserve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3:10 to Start.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3:10 to Yuma (1957): Dir: Delmer Daves / Cast: Glenn Ford, Van Heflin, Henry Jones, Falicia Farr, Robert Emhardt: Suspense western regarding endurance within the confines of danger. An outlaw is apprehended and set for the train arriving at 3:10 heading to Yuma. Structure is mainly a room overlooking the streets where criminal Ben Wade attempts to convince Dan Evans to let him go. Director Delmer Daves does a fine job at creating tension but perhaps his villain is too likable. Glenn Ford plays the sly Wade who is arrested and readied for transportation but his gang is closing in once a diversion fails. Wade is experiencing some hospitality from Evans, which doesn't go unnoticed. Van Heflin portrays Evans who suffers the drought and accepts the job of transporting Wade. He has integrity even at the safety of Wade but he will remain at his duty. Henry Jones plays town drunk Alex Potter who provides comic relief despite very standard writing. He fails to fully comprehend the potential consequences of undertaking this task. Falicia Farr plays a saloon waitress whom Wade dazzles. She is very good but the role becomes more distant as the story moves on. Robert Emhardt is the one who makes the charge and the cash offer for this task to be performed. High Noon dealt with similar themes but with greater conviction while this film is somewhat hooky but entertaining. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful black and white imagery .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked up the Criterion Bluray of 3:10 to Yuma. Man, this film has some of the best black and white imagery ever put on film. Some of the shots are just so beautiful to look at. It is a film that is worth watching for the imagery alone. Those picturesque wide open American landscapes untouched by human beings and taverns with unused beer mugs and whiskey glasses are beautifully evoked.Glen Ford is in top form as the smooth talking villain. I have never rooted for the villain more than in this film. I guess it helped that his good adversary is the impotent looking Van Helfin. The so called good guys are all depicted as a bunch of bumbling traitorous fools.Two blots on this otherwise fine western - the hotel at the end where they are cooped up together waiting for the train was an eyesore. It had some gaudy set pieces. And the finale was a real let down. It was too hard to believe.(8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, filmed on the Old Tucson movie site, is definitely like High Noon. The outlaw in this piece, played well by Glenn Ford, is as mean as mean can be. Van Heflin, who must get him on the train, is a big, dauntless man who is determined to do his job. Felicia Farr here, as always, is able to catch a man's eye, the beautiful lady she is. Yes, is so much like the classic "High Noon", and the viewer is wondering if Heflin will be successful in his job. It would have looked better in color, as was the 2007 version of the movie, but I still enjoyed watching it. You can't get jaded by this western, despite the slow pace of it, and I have always liked it. Very exciting in its own way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A decent western. Not great - far too many implausibilities in the plot, especially the ending - but reasonably entertaining nevertheless.It is the constant battle, moral and mental, between outlaw Ben Wade (played by Glenn Ford) and his captor Dan Evans (played by Van Heflin) that make this movie interesting. So many opportunities for Evans to do something different, something unethical, but will he take them?It is the performances of Ford, especially, and Heflin that make this movie watchable.I enjoyed the 2007 remake more. Wasn't brilliant, but flowed better and while it had some plot holes and implausibilities, they weren't as bad as in the 1957 movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trouble in Contention Town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a movie that seems to be a simple tale, but is really about character development and growth. Yet still it's full of tension and suspense.The film starts out with a sudden and unnecessary murder. On the surface, killer Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) doesn't betray a bit of conscience. But his trigger finger has prevented him from consummating an encounter with a lovely saloon maid (Felicia Farr). Wade comes to realize that his choices in life are adding up to a big, fat zero. The way he's heading, he'll never have a wife and kids like Dan Evans (Van Hefflin), the poor shlub who's risking his life to haul him in to the law. Neither man sees it coming, but each influences the other powerfully.Evans has turned bounty hunter because he needs the money. Wade seems to deeply appreciate women, and man, does he miss taking a woman to bed! The chemistry between Emmy and Wade is palpable and intense."What's a woman for if you don't treat her right?" Ford purrs to his would-be lady love.At points along the way, Wade is taunting, shaming, and threatening to the seemingly not-so-swift Evans, who politely answers all his questions until Wade mutters, "I'll bet (your wife) was a real beautiful woman before she met you." At a certain point, it's as if Evans keeps on keeping on not for the money anymore but for his own need to grow up and just stop taking crap. It's his own growing a backbone that captures Wade's attention and spurs his own self-sacrificing turnaround -- even though it leads straight to the gallows. Like a better-known western, "Shane," that has a lot more going on than initially meets the eye, "3:10 to Yuma" captures the struggle between bullies of the world and plain old folks who just want to live their lives -- folks who'd rather not fight, but will do battle if there's no other way.I heartily recommend this film to anyone with an interest in psychological development and spiritual redemption.Don't overlook the brief funeral scene, with its solitary dog atop a plain wooden coffin. There's poetry here, amid the dust, craggy rocks, cacti, and big open sky.Based on a story by Elmore Leonard, this film far transcends its ordinary surroundings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Gem of the Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3:10 to Yuma (1957) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Tense and extremely well-acted Western about a farmer (Van Heflin) who finds himself in desperate need of cash so he volunteers to transport a notorious criminal (Glenn Ford) to a train station. 3:10 TO YUMA is one of the best known Westerns from this era and it's easy to see why. Sure, there are those old-school moments about the good guy versus the bad one but it has an added touch of psychological drama and this here is where the film really stands on its own. There's no doubt that there are many great scenes in the picture but things really start to pick up when Heflin and Ford are inside a hotel room where they do nothing but talk about what's going to happen when the farmer goes to transport him to the station. This is when the super editing kicks into high gear as the farmer slowly starts to become panicked over what he's gotten himself into. There are some really striking scenes in this picture including a very dramatic one dealing with the fate of one of the helpers, which I won't ruin here. Another great scene happens early on during a stagecoach robbery where we get to see how menacing the Ford character can be. This here is followed up with a scene where Ford comes onto a local woman. You'd think a scene like this would be out of place but it actually works just to show that this villain also has a charming side. The performances by the two leads are certainly wonderful. Heflin has never been better as the good-hearted farmer who needs to prove to himself that he can support his family no matter what it takes. The scenes where the farmer's tension starts to crack has the actor really shining. Ford, usually a good guy, does wonders being able to switch things up and that wonderful voice of his really adds to the psychological drama as he starts to torture the farmer. The film certainly borrows from HIGH NOON but that doesn't hurt things too much. The film is certainly a gem from the genre.</fullReview>

After the watching the 1957 original, I can appreciate more of what the filmmakers are trying to do.I especially like the kid nagging at the father. Almost taunting him as being a coward. The farmer is a good man who finds himself in a tough time. His motivation is varied and complicated. In a sense, he's very human. The criminal played by Glenn Ford is brilliant. His motivation is also complicated. He seems like a mannered honorable man one minute and a cold-hearted killer the next.The ending is a little bit too happy ending which seemed ill fitting. Other than that, there is a lot to recommend in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The western meets noir in this intelligent minor classic. A psychological drama that is much more about the battle of souls and the slippery nature of good and evil than about gunplay and chase scenes. Led by a great performance by Glenn Ford, going way against type as a low key, but highly charismatic, even sexy bad guy, who its hard to hate. And he's almost matched by a jittery Van Heflin as a down-on-his-luck rancher who agrees to bring the very dangerous Ford to the titular train to be taken to prison, Heflin doesn't take the job out of any great moral belief, but just because he desperately needs the $200 to have some shot of keeping his cattle alive and his family fed. Beautifully shot, keeping the open feel of the south-west for the first act, the real climax of the film is a 30 minute set piece in a hotel room as Ford tries to gently, almost comically, bribe and woo Heflin into letting him go, promising far more money than the $200 Heflin is being paid. And we see just how tempting that offer is to Heflin, and how confusing doing the "right" thing can be. A truly tense film. Whatever its flaws or dated touches fade beneath its great images, sly dialogue, forceful direction, complex characters, and 1st rate acting.</fullReview>

My favorite part might be the interlude with Ben Wade (Glenn Ford at his best)and Emmy (Felicia Farr) in the saloon. Their chemistry is perfect. Then there is beautiful long shot of Emmy standing looking forlorn in the middle of the empty dusty street watching the stage coach taking Wade away. In the distance behind her and off to the left, Mr. Butterfield watches. Later there is a nice contrasting scene involving Dan Evens (Van Heflin) wife.

		<fullReview>After outlaw leader Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) is captured in a small town, his gang threatens to rescue him. Small-time rancher Dan Evans is persuaded to take Wade in secret to the nearest town with a railway station to await the train to the court at Yuma.Howard Hawks apparently did not like the hidden messages he saw in this film and "High Noon". Honestly, I did not think any message was all that hidden in here -- a man stands up for what is right in order to protect his family and his neighbors. Is that a bad thing? But really, this is just a good story of good guys, bad guys, and the blurry line in between. Can money make a good guy bad? Can cowardice in the face of evil allow injustice to stand? It is suspenseful -- I really did not know until the end who would live or die and who would be on which side.I would compare this to the remake, but I do not remember the remake. I will say it probably did not have such annoying kids in it, though.</fullReview>

"Based" might even be too loose of a word. The recent version is the spitting image of this version, even down to several identical quotes. In fact, the best quotes of the newer version are stolen directly from this one. The only major plot difference is the ending, which I like better in the old version. Starring Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, this fantastic film is nearly flawless, and didn't need to be remade. I like to think of the newer version as paying homage to this one. The atmosphere is tense, and once you start watching it, it is impossible not to get into it. In this one, Ford plays the likable villain and Heflin plays the ordinary guy with the chance to do something extraordinary. The one thing missing is the action. Most will prefer the newer version because of its far superior action scenes. But let's remember where it all started. 2.5 out of 5 action rating</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic revisionist western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peaceful farmer Dan (Van Heflin) stumbles across a wagon robbery in which infamous thief and murderer Ben Wade (played by the great Glenn Ford) shoot and murders an innocent man, so Dan flees with his two sons. When Wade and his gang arrive in his town, he is forced to decide whether to do what's right or to think about the safety of his family. Wade's gang temporarily leave town leaving Wade to romance a lonely barmaid, until he is captured by the authorities. When Dan is offered a substantial amount of money to transport Wade to the train station where he can catch the 3:10 to Yuma to face trial, he must come up with a plan to avoid being killed by the soon to be returning gang.Joining a long list a classic revisionist westerns alongside John Ford's My Darling Clementine and Fred Zinnemann's High Noon, the west isn't used as a primary focus for the story, but instead western elements are used to assist a different type of story. 3:10 To Yuma doesn't usually feature in those ridiculous 'Best Movies of blah blah...' lists but deserves it's place amongst the very best westerns. Similar to another genre classic Johnny Guitar, the good and bad guys are not so easy to disassociate. Here, the big 'baddie' Wade is somewhat likable, and has an admiration for the dedication of the nervous and initially almost cowardly 'hero' Dan. It's also damn exciting and every bit as tense as High Noon. It was recently remade starring Christian Bale and Russell Crowe, which I have yet to see, but I doubt it will capture the old- school spirit of this.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elmore Leonard's short story was first brought to film here. Westerns converted from short stories became big in the 1950's starting with the classic High Noon. Frankie Lanes soundtrack here was definitely inspired by that film too.Van Heflin does one of his best performances here on film. The veteran actor working with Glenn Ford who is also a veteran actor by this time help carry the film. This is the case of a near classic but not quite as top notch as other westerns done in the 1950's as it dulls in comparison with Gary Coopers classic, much less John Wayne's The Searchers.Heflin is one of those good actors who never quite achieved big star status. He does have a decent set of film roles in his career, he just never got to the status of other stars because he never quite got a strong enough film to star in.

		<shortDescription>Glenn Ford, a good bad guy!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was exactly fifty years ago when this film was first shown in cinemas and it still holds up well today. Someone once said Glenn Ford never made a bad movie. This may not be accurate but this film is not one of his bad ones. The action starts straight away as a dozen men on horseback hold a stagecoach at gunpoint, Ben Wade (Ford) being their leader. During the commotion two men get shot and killed by Wade. Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his sons are in the area rounding up their cattle and witness the killing. After the holdup Wade and his men ride into the nearest town for a drink. After his men leave Wade gets held up and is captured by the local sheriff. Knowing it won't be long before Wade's men return the sheriff enlists Evans and the town drunk to escort Wade to the next town and wait for the next train, the 3.10 to Yuma. So Wade can be tried for murder by the authorities there. On arrival at the next town Evans rents a hotel room and this is where they sit and wait for the train to finally arrive. Here they play the waiting game, Wade plays mind games with Evans who never knows when he will receive help or when Wade's men will turn up. This is not your conventional western. It's not always fast moving, in fact it moves at a rather slow pace at times. It's not boring though and that's what counts at the end. Van Heflin is an actor that's mostly forgotten these days, some people may remember him as the rancher in the famous western Shane. He always put in a solid performance, and even though he appears weak in this film he does it well. It's a change of pace for Glenn Ford who is cast as the bad guy. He made a lot of great movies but and the only other film where he was the bad guy was The Man from Colorado. I can't think of any others. Anyway I just want to say I love the 3.10 to Yuma.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ford and Heflin Face Off in a Good Ol' Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In terms of westerns, "3:10 to Yuma" is pretty good. It's not a masterpiece, nor is it as good as the remake, but it still holds up as an enjoyable old black-and-white western. Van Heflin and Glenn Ford face off in the film's somewhat simplistic plot. Heflin's Dan Evans aids the people of his small town in return for $200 when he helps escort Glenn Ford's Ben Wade out of town so that he can be put aboard the 3:10 to Yuma. Obviously, chaos ensues as Wade's henchmen try to get him back before he boards the train.This original version of the famous short story is black-and-white, both literally and story-wise. Though Wade is a killer, we don't personally feel any natural detest for him because we never get to know the people he kills. He's a charming cowboy who also happens to be an outlaw. There's no real complexity to him. Some of his more questionable actions can simply be explained by the fact that every time he robs a coach or escapes from a prison, he ends up a bit more respected, a bit richer, and a bit more infamous. Van Heflin's Dan Evans is even less of an enigma. He's just a touch but good-hearted rancher who needs a bit of cash."3:10 to Yuma" contains no real shocking bits, and is mainstream almost to a fault. However, it doesn't try to be anything more, so it is really a success. It's a quick and entertaining film with two stars facing off and teaming up in typical western fashion. The cinematography is pretty good and the action scenes are classic. It's worth a watch, though probably not a masterpiece on any front.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atypical Western But A Good One In My Opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This makes for a good viewing for those weekend afternoon shows or video/DVD nights at home with pizza and Coke. I say it is atypical for a Western in that the outlaw Ben Wade comes across as so different from what you expect from a Western movie bad guy - he's soft-spoken, charming, polite in fact gentlemanly and strangely enough, opposed to killing people if he could avoid it. As he told rancher Evans - "he (the stagecoach driver) drew his gun first", and that he shot only in self-defense. Despite his being a leader of an outlaw gang that specializes in robbery, he is actually a likable character, and one can't help but admire his cool collected attitude in that he seems confident that his loyal gang members would come and save him from the clutches of the law when captured.. The more detestable characters in the film would be Charlie Prince, his second-in-command and Butterfield the stagecoach line owner.Other characters like Alice Evans, Emmy and Alex Potter the drunkard are also noteworthy, and their presence makes the film reminiscent of scenes from the classics High Noon and Destry Rides Again, of which a few scenes from the movie can be compared to. Frankie Laine's rendition of the song is unforgettable, as are the other versions heard in the movie, especially the (uncredited) woman's voice.I understand that a remake has been made starring Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, both of whom are noteworthy actors though of course they are not in the caliber of the likes of Spencer Tracy or John Wayne. It would be interesting to see how this one turns out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the "High Noon" Spin-Offs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The enormous box office and critical success of High Noon spawned many imitations. Perhaps the best of these was 1957's "3.10 to Yuma". Based on a short story by the legendary Elmore Leonard, "3.10 to Yuma" was originally a Robert Aldrich project, but somewhere along the line Associates and Aldrich sold the script to Columbia where it was picked up by Delmer Daves who commenced filming on November 15, 1956. Although some reviewers have commented upon the film's small budget, it looked like a mighty expensive undertaking to me. There's a memorable cast of fascinating support players and a swiftly paced editorial style that holds shots for just as long as they take to register. However, be the budget large or small, we all agree on commending the superb cinematography of Charles Lawton, Jr., the skilfully intense direction of Mr Daves and the finely shaded performances by Glenn Ford (playing the heavy for only the third or fourth time in his career) and Van Heflin (playing the disturbed everyman hero). Ford displays a great deal more skill and charisma this time around than he did back in 1948 as the psychotic colonel in "The Man from Colorado" or the ruthless gun-runner in "Appointment in Honduras" (1953). The sets and desert locations are stunning. And, true to its "High Noon" parentage, there's a catchy title theme song, rendered here by the great Frankie Laine (whose percussive singing of the title tunes for "Blowing Wild" and "Strange Lady in Town" are the only reasons anyone would want to watch those particular movies).</fullReview>

Other films based on his books include GET SHORTY, JACKIE BROWN, OUT OF SIGHT, HOMBRE, MR. MAJESTYK, THE TALL T &amp; JOE KIDD. "Walter Winchell called this film "Three hours and 10 minutes past 'High Noon.' Leonard said in a recent interview -- "I sold that story to Dime Western Pulp for $90 in 1953. They were one of the better payers?- they paid 2? a word, and it was 4,500 words. And then Columbia offered $4,000 for the film rights, which sounded OK to me. Originally, I heard that Glenn Ford had turned down the role. He thought he was going to be the good guy, which Van Heflin played, the guy who is taking him to prison. But when he found out he was the bad guy, he wanted to do it. I thought, "God, he's gonna be great." In the '40s and '50s, he was kind of a role model, someone you could enjoy or perhaps even imitate to some extent. I remember when we were in high school, we used to button our sport coats and single-breasted suits with the top two buttons because Glenn Ford buttoned his that way in "Gilda." The way I imagined it, he would be very confident in that situation." Directed by Delmar Daves. While studying civil engineering and law at Stanford University, Delmer Daves secured work as a prop boy for director James Cruze's The Covered Wagon (1923). So fascinated was Daves by the Native Americans working on this film that he forsook a law career to live in Arizona among the Hopi and Navajo. He studied acting at the Pasadena Playhouse, appearing in a few early talkies before turning to screen writing. In 1943 he directed his first film, the low-key combat drama DESTINATION TOKYO (with Grant &amp; Garfield). In this and his other war-related films PRIDE OF THE MARINES (1945) and TASK FORCE (1949); writer/director Daves emphasized the anxieties and tribulations of the individual soldier, rather than resorting to gaudy Hollywood heroics. Most of his best 1950s films were westerns, which like his war pictures favored slowly escalating personal tensions over wanton gunplay. 3:10 to Yuma ultimately stands as a superior example of that subgenre of small-scale Westerns that tell their tale simply with an emphasis on character over action, and which can often be every bit as satisfying and entertaining as the widescreen, big-themed Western epics that grab the headlines and critical acclaim. Glenn Ford going particularly against type and displaying that he was one of the more underrated actors of his generation. He was born in Canada and started acting at the tender age of four on stage in TOM THUMB'S WEDDING. Between 1937-1946 he made 15 films in Hollywood before GILDA made him a star. While he insisted that he "never played anyone but himself on screen," Ford's range was quite extensive. He was equally effective as a tormented film noir hero THE BIG HEAT, as he was in light comedy TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON, POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES, inner city drama THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE, fantasy film's like SUPERMAN. Nearly half of his films were Westerns, many of which ? LUST FOR GOLD, JUBAL, THE DESPERADOES, THE FASTEST GUN ALIVE , Texas, THE VIOLENT MEN, COWBOY and his last film TOMBSTONE (1993) - were among the best and most successful examples of that highly specialized genre. Van Heflin was the son of a dentist and preferred being a sailor to anything. He bounced between school the stage and the sea until making a film with Katherine Hepburn in 1936 called A WOMAN REBELS. He was so good Hepburn took him with her to Broadway to co-star in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY in the role that was later played by Jimmy Stewart. Heflin won an Oscar in 1943 playing Robert Taylor's friend in JOHNNY EAGER. On radio he was Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlow. In 1953 he would make SHANE one of the finest westerns ever filmed playing a character much like plays in tonight's film. Felica Farr who plays Emmy the bar maid is 74 years old and is Jack Lemmon's widow. Bad guy Richard Jaeckel plays Charlie Prince. You may recognize him from GUADALCANAL DIARY or SANDS OF IWO JIMA. He was nominated for an Oscar for his performance in SOMETIMES A GREAT NOTION. But ended his career as Captain Ben Edwards on TV show BAYWATCH. Character actor Henry Jones plays the town drunk Alex Potter. You will recognize him from VERTIGO, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF and THE BAD SEED. Check out the poetic cinematography by cameraman Charles Lawton. I love the composition of his work, how he frames the actors and how the camera glides on those long cranes. It's now wonder he photographed THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI for Orson Welles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good, different type of Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about an everyday man who is put in the position of facing off against huge odds. He must bring an outlaw to justice, while a vicious gang tries to stop him. Van Heflin was one of the greatest Western actors of all time. And this role was an extremely well written role. He plays the rancher who brings in the charming but deadly outlaw, Glen Ford. Ford's character is not as well done as others of the same ilk (Ryan in "Naked Spur", Sullivan in "7 Ways to Sundown", Crowe in the remake), partly because it isn't quite as believable a character, and partly because Ford, who can act, wasn't quite as good in this role. It was one of the first films in which such a character was portrayed, and still in the experimental stage. That said, the story itself is very well written, and has all the ingredients of a good Western. Heflin carries this through, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am thankful they remade this movie. I for one, would not have taken the time to watch the original. The films are very similar and in my case, watching them in reverse really helped. This 1957 version is well done and the actors are very charismatic. Of course, this version is not quite as ruthless as the 07 effort but for it's day, it equally makes it point. Basic plot - A ruthless stage coach robber gets caught after a successful heist but he's not worried. His gang is loyal and won't see their boss behind bars. An unlikely hero (in the form of a common rancher) is called upon to help bring him to justice. Justice will come in the form of the 3:10 train that will take him to Yuma for trial. The rancher is in over his head but feels he has no choice but to see this task through.If you don't need special effects and are not frightened by B&amp;W films, you will probably enjoy this effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers.I just watched this Christmas day 2007. I love good westerns and hate bad ones. This is now one of my favorites.Like all my favorite movies it examines the human condition. If you don't believe the universe is arbitrary then Glenn Ford is evil and oh so human. His chatter is compelling and as slick a rap as any. He tells our everyman hero that the men around him, that his colleagues are weak pathetic mortals who will when pushed skulk away.Our hero does not want to stand, he wants to run to his family. He wants to take the money that will make life for his family livable and easy. We would all want to but his explanation to his wife while waiting for the 3:10 makes us realize that while we have watched humans at their worst for an hour, that we can be so proud to accept the insult human because truly every now and then we can see the image we were cast from in even the most broken down among us and would gladly thumb our noses at the reaper for a mere chance to stand with our hero Dan.Great stories can transcend and this movie is art as a story, art as a moving picture, and art as an exploration of human nature.I LOVED IT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tautly written and suspenseful Western...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 12/9/2006 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Delmer Daves): Tautly written and suspenseful Western that carries you thru till the very end due to the story and the performances. Glenn Ford plays a sly, conniving leader of a gang of robbers in the old west (presumably Arizona), who gets caught by a small town sheriff as he waits behind to womanize while the rest of his gang head for Mexico. The Sheriff employs a handful of locals to escort him onto a train to Yuma where he will be put in jail. One of the handful is a hard-working rancher played by Van Heflin, who's having a hard time making ends meet for his family and accepts the job primarily for the money initially. He gets the task of guarding the prisoner while they wait for the train to arrive. He realizes the gang will return for their leader and therefore is reluctant to help at first, but deep down he wants to prove to himself and to his kids that he has the courage to stand up for what is right. As the time gets closer, Ford &amp; Heflin engage in verbal and non-verbal interplay that give the movie it's suspense. Ford's character tries to lure Heflin into a better deal with more money for his family if he lets him go, and he works hard to strike a chord deep within Heflin by trying to get to him from the inside. This mental war makes the movie interesting and their interaction is excellently done. This is a top-notch movie that shouldn't be missed even if you are not a fan of westerns because this is more a suspenseful battle of the wills and of what is "good" and what is "evil" instead of an old west shootout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3:10 TO YUMA (Delmer Daves, 1957) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic Western, one of the best of its kind but which doesn't seem to have been given its due: terse script (adapted from a story by Elmore Leonard), excellent handling by an expert in the genre (this is undoubtedly his finest offering), wonderful atmosphere and outstanding performances by leads Glenn Ford (atypically cast as the bad guy) and Van Heflin (basically amounting to an extension of his role in SHANE [1953]).In many ways, it's reminiscent of HIGH NOON (1952): the time factor (heralding the impending arrival of a train), the hotel setting (which occupies about the entire second half), the hero being left alone - at the crucial moment - to face the heavies, not forgetting the evocative title track (sung here by Frankie Laine). While the film's tone is generally low-key and may appear too talky to some (in fact, there's little action per se), it's wholly absorbing with the tension amongst the various characters as palpable as that in HIGH NOON itself. Also, as in that film, the two women involved with the protagonists are allowed to offer their own perspective on things (though their contribution is not as pronounced, especially when considering that Felicia Farr appears in just one scene early on - despite being third-billed!).The surprising climax, then, is quite splendid - accentuated by the steam of the arriving train (which effectively hides the opponents from one another), followed by a miraculous downpour (the drought which had hit the area having been the catalyst for Heflin undertaking the dangerous mission of transporting criminal Ford to prison) and whose redemptive allusions are also reflected in the latter's character! Notable among the supporting cast are Richard Jaeckel as one of Ford's right-hand man and Robert Emhardt as a stagecoach boss.Apparently, a remake of this is in the works - directed by James Mangold and starring Russell Crowe in Ford's role and Christian Bale replacing Heflin. Will they never learn...?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good buildup, flawed finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those psychological Westerns that were popular in the 1950s. Heflin, playing a character similar to his role in "Shane," is a rancher who captures outlaw Ford and must wait for a train to deliver him to the authorities in Yuma and collect a reward. The film gets off to an excellent start as the tension builds slowly, with the ruthless but smooth-talking Ford trying to talk Heflin into letting him go free. There are echoes of "High Noon" although the tension is not maintained as well as in that classic. This one should have been better but loses points for its ending, which seems contrived and unsatisfying, undermining the nice buildup to that point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BBC just aired this movie, one of my favourite B&amp;W westerns, which I've seen several times over the years, but now for the first time in digital. I largely agree with the other comments about the somewhat unlikely ending. A more acceptable ending might have been if the Heflin character had simply said to the Ford character "jump on the train when I say or get a bullet in the back". After all the rancher would have had nothing to lose.The Ford character after all, as has been remarked, a cold-blooded killer and is very unlikely to have bonded with Heflin enough to put his own life at risk, especially as he probably faced execution after trial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never even heard of this movie before the remade version that came out last year, which was also excellent. It's a shame, because the original is even better. Glenn Ford as the villain was brilliant casting and a daring choice which paid off in a big way. Ford's inherent likability, balanced with the character's sinister nature, provided the perfect tone in the psychological drama, keeping the viewer constantly guessing what's really going through his mind.I can only guess that the reason that this film hasn't been mentioned among the greatest of the classic westerns is due to it's relative lack of "shoot-em-up" action. But this film seems decades ahead of it's time, giving us characters with greater dimension, more human complexity in the balance between good and evil, selfish and unselfish, in each of them. The good guys aren't all good, and the bad guys aren't all bad, a theme which was carried into the 2007 remake, and really the undercurrent that made both films so interesting.Though Van Heflin's role as the protagonist seems typecast, similar to his role in "Shane", his performance contains far more depth and range than the usual stereotypical role of the poor dirt-farmer standing up for the little guy.I hope that the recent attention given to this buried treasure resulting from the success of the newer film helps propel the original "3:10" to it's proper place as one of the best western films of all time. In my opinion, this is both Ford's and Heflin's best performances, along with some surprisingly strong performances by it's familiar supporting character actors who played a great part in making this film a real gem that should transcend the ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1957 western almost inevitably invites comparison to "High Noon." Actually, I think it's better. The screenplay, based on Elmore Leonard's book, is taut and well written. The acting is excellent, especially Van Heflin, playing pretty much the same role he did in "Shane." This is not to fault Glenn Ford, veteran character actor Henry Jones, and, in a small part, Felicity Farr. Heflin is one of the screen's most underrated actors.My only quarrel with the film is the ending. I won't reveal it here, but it defies believability. I haven't read the book, but I know Elmore Leonard, who is a master of 'noir.' So I was expecting a tragic, existential ending. Instead, we get something totally contrived. Otherwise, it's excellent up until then. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This fantastic western comes along as if a return to the quality western like HIGH NOON(1952). Delmer Daves directs this intense story of Dan Evans(Van Heflin)a hard working farmer in the need of money and or a good long hard rain. Evens goes into town to try and borrow money and ends up escorting an outlaw(Glenn Ford)to the town of Contention in order to catch the 3:10 to Yuma and justice. Ford almost has you influenced enough to feel sorry for the outlaw. Kind of methodical until the flurry of gun shots right before you hear that screaming whistle blow. The 3:10 is right on time! With Frankie Laine singing through the opening credits...it is almost certain a damn good western is awaiting you.Also in the cast are: Felicia Farr, Richard Jaeckel, Leora Dana and Robert Emhardt. Perfect scenery for a western; and very good camera angles gets you into the drama. Kudos to veteran director Daves.NOTE:It is said that Glenn Ford was offered the role of the farmer, but chose to be the outlaw to shake up his image for a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's another classic I found riveting when I first saw it and was enamored with most old films. Now, years later and a bit more critical, I found the boring very boring. It's just too slow-moving.However I do appreciate two big things in here: the acting and the cinematography. It was just the story was so--so at best. It's no surprise the acting was good with the recently-departed Glenn Ford in the lead, a man who almost always gave a great performance, plus Van Heflin and Felicia Farr. The latter was never a big "name" but a classic beauty, I thought.Ford and Heflin play very realistic people. Their conversations were interesting. Bad guy-Ford sounded just like the Devil trying to sweet-talk Heflin into letting him go. The finale is a bit hokey is that one of the bad men should have shot Ford. However, the very end of this movie - without spoiling things - is unexpected and very good.Despite all these complements, the second time I watched this it just dragged too much. Part of that might be I am more used to watching faster-moving modern films in the last five years.NOTE: Speaking of that, I see where they are re-making this film with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe playing the two leads! Wow, those are two very intense actors so I check that film out in 2007, or whenever it's released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>3:10 TO YUMA is a well crafted psychological western with the emphasis on the tense relationship between bad guy GLENN FORD, a killer and a thief, and upstanding good man VAN HEFLIN, struggling to keep his ranch going during a drought and putting food on the table for his wife and two kids.The focus is really on whether or not Ford can smoothtalk his way out of his predicament, handcuffed and ready to be taken off to jail on the 3:10 to Yuma if Heflin gets his way. Heflin takes on the assignment reluctantly but he's determined not to let Ford get away with murder.How the situation is resolved is enough to keep the viewer glued to the action, however slow paced some of it is. Director Delmer Daves gets the most suspense out of the film's last ten minutes, when you don't know what to expect in the way of a satisfying conclusion.However, there are some script problems with the ending that didn't satisfy me as to the motivations of Glenn Ford's character, as well as Van Heflin's solid citizen. It seemed a bit rushed and unbelievable in how the score was settled, with a convenient thunderstorm assuring us that Van's ranch would survive the drought and he'd go home to his wife and kids with new respect.Glenn Ford and Van Heflin are at the top of their powers as the main focal point of the story. They give mesmerizing performances.Summing up: Not perfect by any means, but good, solid performances from the entire cast is a big help. Very watchable. Frankie Laine does a nice job on the title song in true 50's style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take that train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, people have compared two near-classic 50's westerns, "3:10 to Yuma", (1957) and "The Last Train from Gun Hill" (1959). Now we've got a third film to compare them to, the fifty years hence remake of "3:10 to Yuma".Both stories involve trains, fugitives and lawmen who are going to take their man out of town on that train, despite the presence of a small army of gunmen. Both echo "High Noon", in that the lawmen have such odds against them that people keep urging them to quit. Both feature lengthy sequences where the lawmen and fugitives are holed up in hotel rooms, surrounded by the gunmen, with the whistle of the train in the distance.In Yuma, the lawman is a rancher, (the always excellent Van Heflin), who became part of a posse to deliver Glenn Ford to state prison only to see the rest of the posse die or quit, one by one, leaving him to do the job alone. He succeeds in doing it with the unexpected help of Ford, who has been needling him throughout the film but apparently became so impressed by Heflin's gritty integrity he decided to save his life and go with him, asserting that he's escaped from Yuma before and will again. The film eschews violence, with some gunplay at the beginning and end. It's all about the words and who is saying them. The cast is strong throughout, including Robert Emhart as the railroad boss and Henry Jones as the town drunk who sees this as a chance to redeem himself. The one drawback is that Ford, having played so many good guys, is never quite convincing as a bad guy. Somehow that causes the ending to make more sense than it otherwise would.In Yuma II, a large dose of violence, "action" and bloodshed has been added. When you see the 1957 film, you realize it wasn't really necessary, expect that that's what the modern audiences expect. If the Wade Gang really wants to save their man, would they turn the place into a shooting gallery? And would Wade run through it, seemingly voluntarily? And why would Wade blow away his own people, even if he had developed an admiration for Evans, the farmer? And why is Wade's second in command so loyal, citing "all the things he's done for us", if Wade is the sort who would kill them all so remorselessly? It would make more sense if Wade had hidden the money from the robbery before they had a chance to split it and the gang wanted to "rescue" him to find out where he'd hid it. Then we know that Wade is not only going to escape form the train with the horse he summons, (while allowing the farmer's boy to regard his father as a hero), but he'd be getting away with the money, entirely in character.Again, the cast is great from the major roles to the smallest bits and it's their performances that really carry the film. I'll take Russell Crowe over Ford. Instead of just a cocky confidence, Crowe shows real charm and humor and dominates every scene he's in. Christian Bale is good as the dogged farmer, Evans, but Van Heflin is in a class by himself. I'll take the fetching Gretchen Moll over Leora Dana as the wife. You can see why Evans might be tempted by the idea of her in a nice dress. But Emhart and Jones are more interesting than the crew in Yuma II. Ben Foster's strange Charley Prince is much more memorable than Richard Jaeckel's 1957 version. Ultimately, the biggest difference between the films is the pace. Yuma II gallops along, afraid to stop too long for fear of boring the modern viewer. Yuma takes its time to tell its story, letting the tension build up. I ultimately decided I preferred is slightly over the newer version.But I still think that "The Last Train from Gun Hill" has both of them beat. It also has two top shelf lead actors squaring off. In this case it's Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn, (just a couple years after they appeared as Van Gogh and Gaughuin in a totally different film- and they are very good in both). I can't help wondering if this might have been intended to be another Douglas-Lancaster film since that pair had just done "Gunfight at the OK Corral" for John Sturges. This would have been an ideal follow-up but perhaps Burt couldn't see losing the final gun battle to Douglas, (even though he was willing to do the same thing in "Verz Cruz" to Gary Cooper).Just as Yuma has Frankie Laine singing the title tune, Gun Hill has a Dimitri Tiomkin score, (any self respecting 50's western had one or the other- or both). Yuma has a lot of shots of the New Mexico desert but Gun Hill has some beautiful "big sky" shots with men silhouetted against the sky- emphasizing the fact that their actions spring from their nature. In High Noon and the Yumas, there is a strong theme of the desire for self preservation vs. moral and community responsibility. Here there is some discussion of that in Douglas' conversation with the local lawman and with Quinn himself. But it's clear that the drama here springs from the nature of the men.Again, the casting of every role is perfect, especially the delicious Carolyn Jones, (why wasn't she a much bigger star?) And the ending is far more dramatic and action filled than Yuma without resorting to all the bloodshed of Yuma II. The image of Douglas with that shotgun under Holliman's chin, riding that wagon down the street, surrounded by Quinn's gunsels while the horn of the train sounds in the distance is indelible.</fullReview>

I can't think of any other actor (besides Russell) who could summon and project the layers of nuance in voice and facial expression required of Wade as he's working his devious mind games on his victims. I hope talks continue and that they can raise the money to make this film. Another problem in the funding is that American westerns historically have not played well across the pond and the studios are afraid they won't recover their investment. (I never thought of Glenn Ford as a "B" actor --- I always liked his work.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3:10 to Yuma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I obviously recognised this title from the Russell Crowe/Christian Bale remake, and when I saw that this original was rated five out of five stars, I didn't see any reason not to try it. Basically, in the Arizona Territory, small-time ranching farmer Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his two young sons witness a stagecoach holdup, but eventually the leader of this outlaw robbery, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), is captured in a bar. With the townspeople fearing the worst about Wade and his henchman Charlie Prince (Richard Jaeckel) getting away to get the rest of the gang, the Marshal (Ford Rainey) decides that he is to be sneaked to Convention City to catch the 3:10 train to Yuma. To pull this off, Stage Line owner Mr. Butterfield (Robert Emhardt) gets Dan, and the only other volunteer, town drunk Alex Potter (Henry Jones), and is paying them $200 to do this dangerous job. Once they are in the Convention City hotel room, that is when the danger sets in as Wade's gang shoots their way to try and get their leader out and free. After many shots fired, and a very close call, Dan and an eventually co-operating Wade get on the 3:10 train just as it starts to roll away. Also starring Felicia Farr as Emmy, Leora Dana as Alice Evans, Sheridan Comerate as Bob Moons - Stagedriver's Brother, George Mitchell as Bartender, Robert Ellenstein as Ernie Collins, Barry Curtis as Mathew Evans and Jerry Hartleben as Mark Evans. I may not remember the "well crafted" moments between Ford and Farr, but I certainly remember the scenes with Ford and Heflin cooped together, and with good horizon shots, and a really good title song by Frankie Laine, there's plenty to like in this western. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from Any Source. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These Are The Brown Ones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm particularly fond of movies that I can see through other facets: remakes, derivatives, spoofs and so on.This one is particularly rich. The remake is quite modern, a story about making a story. The Crowe character (the bad guy) imparts a story on the good guy, that only he can give as a storyweaver and that is more valuable than life. The notion of the western as a story- in-life allows this to work. I thought it a bit blunt to actually engage. It was more a story about storytelling than one that affected me. But it was well within what we expect from the cowboy/gangster genre.That mattered in its way. I had seen the earlier edition years ago and had assumed it was a weighty in intent.Wow, was my memory clouded. I think when this was new, it was considered part of a genre-twisting trend that subverted the western by introducing what was considered "psychological" elements. Those seem completely faded today, but they were enough to get John Wayne in a snit.This is far, far closer to Wayne's notion than to the modern remake. The only element I liked better was the rendezvous with the prostitute. In the remake, the guy was simply bad and a risktaker, sort of an urban youth ignorance of consequence. In this original, the guy knew what he was doing and was just so hungry for sex he took that risk. The dialog in this section must have been written by someone else. Its good.He talks about a particular whorehouse he remembers fondly as if all his stealing was simply for those good times. He mentions how he would do anything for a woman with blue eyes. She tells him (we can't see, but he plainly should have) that hers are brown. He changes his tune to accommodate. They go in the back and return later sated. As he is arrested, she holds the door for him.That there is a complex situation, rather deftly delivered. Its an island of intelligence in an otherwise damaged project.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glenn Ford as the VILLAIN? *** SPOILER ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glenn Ford makes an odd (but not completely unconvincing) villain, and Van Heflin is a cattle rancher who's been hired to get him on the 3:10 train to Yuma, where he will be imprisoned for killing a stagecoach driver at the beginning of the film. Ford plays it as a lark, joking and happy-go-lucky, but not sadistic -- he's a "gentleman" bandit who only uses violence when it's a last resort. Of course, along this line, he tries to bribe and frighten Heflin into letting him go -- he's never worried that his gang of eleven can't kill Heflin easily, but he's gotten a bit attatched to the guy and seems to really want him to let him go so he won't be killed. *** SPOILER *** Even when Heflin finally does get him on the train, he seems unconcerned: "I've broken out of Yuma before". This is all well and tastefully done (what other kind of villain could Ford convincingly play?), but physically Ford doesn't fit the part of a tough guy bandit. Confident, straightforward direction; nice B &amp; W photography.... a "High Noon" clone that is (like many others) better than the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yuma is the Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern-day Yuma is awesome too! My husband and I moved here when the military based him at MCAS in 2002. We bought our dream home, enjoyed Yuma life, and basked in the sun (did you know that Yuma has sunny days 91% of the time?!!!). The Main Street here in town is charming, and they still maintain the territorial prison which is great for an afternoon visit. Did you also know that Yuma's population is projected to at least double within the next four years? Wow!!!!! Well, it's time for us to move on to the next post (although too soon for us, of course!!!!!), so a dream home in Yuma is up for sale.... Please check out my site about a certain place in Yuma that YOU could own....http://www.geocities.com/sullivan.project</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made as well as frequently illogical.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years and years ago, I saw "3:10 to Yuma" and loved it. However, seeing it about 30 years later, I am struck how many illogical plot elements there are in the film--too many to make this a truly memorable western.When the film begins, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) and his gang are holding up the stage. In order to make this easier, they've stampeded some of a local rancher's cattle into the path of the wagon. Dan Evans (Van Heflin) can't do anything to stop the men from doing this with his cattle, as it's just him and his two small sons against a dozen vicious killers. Additionally, Evans is a pragmatic guy and doesn't want to be a hero.Later, after Wade is captured, the local Marshall wants to take the gang leader into Yuma to be tried for murder and robbery. However, there's a problem--the town is minuscule and he needs help. One of the guys he enlists is Evans. While Evans is hesitant to risk his life, he's about to lose his ranch--and the reward money could sure help him. So far, this is a very good western. The dilemma is interesting and Evans is an interesting sort of anti-hero. However, as the film progresses many problems are very noticeable. First and foremost, Wade tries several times to escape and even nearly kills several people in the process. So why not just shoot him?! After all, if a prisoner tries to escape, you shoot him. And, with his gang of thugs wandering about, you really cannot see why they didn't kill the murderer. It isn't like there's any doubt that he is a killer-- he admits it and was witnessed doing the killing. So why allow him to repeatedly try to escape and threaten to have the various posse members killed?! Kill the jerk!! Later, when his gang does arrive and they start killing off the posse members, STILL Evans doesn't shoot Wade...and you wonder why!! To make matters worse, the final scene shows Evans hopelessly outnumbered and surrounded--and then Wade does something that makes sense only to a script writer!! No criminal in the history of mankind would ever have done what Wade then did...NONE! Highly illogical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good movie, but it never quite makes the big leap into greatness.The acting by both leads is grade-A and the gradual buildup of tension is very nice, but it all comes down to an unsatisfying (read: implausible) ending. Overall, fairly good classical filmmaking. (***)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 3:10 to Yuma wouldn't stop for this dud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this western was too low key, with too much smoke blowing and not enough gunsmoke. After the initial shoot-out, we see Ford and Heflin blather back and forth in a hotel room about morals, right vs. wrong, and the good old American ethic of hard work for a living wage. Good topics, but they didn't play for me in a western format. The ending was totally phony, as no psycho would do what Ben Wade did. 2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3:10 to Yuma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank God they decided to remake this because this movie sucked. I saw the new version twice in theaters because how good it was but I saw the older version on DVD recently and barely finished it. The story is pretty much the exact same and some of the lines are the same but there is no character development for any of the main characters. I think this is because the new version is 20 minutess longer so they could spend more time with the character before they got to all the action. I think the new version was so good because Russell Crowe, Christain Bale, and Ben Foster did such a good job acting and playing their characters. I also like the score a lot and though it had a good look to it. I felt like I was back in the old western time when I watched this movie. I would highly recommend the new version and would say you can probably skip the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most boring movie I've ever seen! If you would like to waist 92 precious minutes of your life, watch it! If you prefer toothless dialogs, empty story and non-interesting characters - this movie is for you. And if you like western or at least feel indifferent about them, I can guaranty you that after this movie, you'll hate them. Good luck!</fullReview>
