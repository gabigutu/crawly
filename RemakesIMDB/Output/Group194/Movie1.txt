		<shortDescription>An unnecessary and lesser remake of High Sierra with color as its bait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Mad Dog' Earle is back, along with his sad-sack moll Marie, and that fickle clubfoot Velma. So are Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even the scenery-chewing mutt Pard. The only thing missing is a good reason for remaking Raoul Walsh's High Sierra 14 years later without rethinking a line or a frame, and doing so with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from that in the original. (Instead of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart we get Jack Palance, for Ida Lupino Shelley Winters, and so on down through the credits.) The only change is that, this time, instead of black-and-white, it's in Warnercolor; sadly, there are those who would count this an improvement.I Died A Thousand Times may be unnecessary ? and inferior ? but at least it's not a travesty; the story still works on its own stagy terms. Earle (Palance), fresh out of the pen near Chicago, drives west to spearhead a big job masterminded by ailing kingpin Lon Chaney, Jr. ? knocking over a post mountain resort. En route, he almost collides with a family of Oakies, when he's smitten with their granddaughter; the smiting holds even when he discovers she's lame. Arriving at the cabins where the rest of gang holes up, he finds amateurish hotheads at one another's throats as well as Winters, who throws herself at him (as does the pooch). Biding time until they get a call from their inside man at the hotel, Palance (to Winter's chagrin) offers to pay for an operation to cure the girl's deformity, a gesture that backfires. Then, the surgical strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath. On the lam, Palance moves higher into the cold Sierras....It's an absorbing enough story, competently executed, that lacks the distinctiveness Walsh and his cast brought to it in 1941, the year Bogie, with this role and that of Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon, became a star. And one last, heretical note: Those mountains do look gorgeous in color.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aww, come on. It's better than that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People love to trash movies that are re-makes of classics. They seem to think that there is some disrespect intended if the remake is anything less than a masterpiece. I'm sure that the makers of this film only intended to revive an excellent story, and had no idea that a lot of armchair cinephiles, 50 years later, would consider them audacious for doing so. After watching I Died A Thousand Times, I read all the negative reviews and decided to watch High Sierra again so I could compare them. I decided that each film has it's strengths.B&amp;W vs Color: I love black and white. 8 out of 10 films I watch are in B&amp;W. So, if I have a prejudice, it is against color. But when a color film is beautiful, it's very beautiful. This film definitely has its moments. Its palette ranges from subtle, (lighting in a hotel hallway) to glaring, (pumps at a gas station). All gorgeous. The shots of mountains are stunning.One thing about color film which applies to this comparison, is that it is harder to make a good drama in color than in black and white. There is less in B&amp;W to detract from the actors' performances. Orson Welles said that there were no truly great performances in color, and that's why he shot in black and white well into the 1960's. Comparing a B&amp;W drama to a color is a little like apples and oranges. Color films just have a lot more to deal with, and this film does a good job of it.Performances: In the 14 years that separate these films, there was a shift in popular acting styles. In crime dramas of the 30's and 40's characters were drawn in broader strokes. The characters were almost more "types" than individuals. When Bogie played Philip Marlowe he was playing an archetype of the hard boiled detective, and personality took a back seat. The fact that characters tended to be more 2 dimensional, made any glimpse into their personalities more effective when it came. It also gave the films an almost mythic or operatic feel. But color films of the 50's and 60's had to have more depth to the characters. Winters and Palance succeed in this. A good example is the scene in the car when Roy Earle is telling Marie about Velma. When Palance tells Winters that Velma is a pretty girl and that she is "decent", you plainly see the underlying shame and heartbreak in Winter's face. The same statement seems to just roll off of Lupino. I'm not trashing Ida Lupino, or Bogart. I love them both, and Lupino does a great job and looks fantastic, in that screen goddess way. But I was more engrossed by the performances of both Palance and Winters than by their earlier counterparts. Where Bogie was aloof and cool, Palance was a snarling madman with a tender underside.I think that goes to the core of why I liked the later version. It just had more impact for me. I was pulled in from the first scene by the beautiful photography, and was more engrossed throughout than I was with High Sierra. That's not to say I preferred it to High Sierra. I feel that, even though they were exactly the same story, they were very different kinds of films and each had their differing strong points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Famed Bandit, Former No 1 On FBI List, Pardoned After Eight Years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Died a Thousand Times is directed by Stuart Heisler and adapted to screenplay by W.R. Burnett from his own novel High Sierrra. It stars Jack Palance, Shelley Winters, Lori Nelson, Lee Marvin, Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez, Lon Chaney Junior and Earl Holliman. A CinemaScope/Warnercolor production, cinematography is by Ted McCord and music by David Buttolph. It will always be debatable if remaking the excellent High Sierra (Raoul Walsh 1941) was needed or wanted by a 1950s audience? Especially since Walsh had himself already remade it as a Western with 1949 film Colorado Territory, but taken on its own terms, with great production value and Burnett's personal adaptation taken into consideration, it's a very enjoyable film. Set up is simple, it's one last heist for Roy "Mad Dog" Earle (Palance) before going straight, but as his attempts to break free from his emotional loner status fall apart, so does the heist and his future is written in blood up in the mountains. Heisler and Burnett put Earle up front for character inspection, easing in sympathetic tones whilst ensuring he remains a big physical threat. The air of fatalism is pungent enough and the finale is excitingly staged by Heisler. Cast performances are more than adequate if not comparing to the likes of Bogart and Lupino, while the Warnercolor is gorgeous and the photography around the Alabama Hills in Lone Pine is superb. While not in the same league as High Sierra, that doesn't mean this is a wash out, more so if you haven't seen Walsh's movie. If you have, like me (it's one of my favourite Bogart performances), then comparisons and a feeling of deja vu will obviously infiltrate your viewing experience. But there is more than enough here to make it worth your time regardless. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic hidden away from all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pure mystery, you never know what's next in this film. In fact I'm going to keep silent about everything I know, because if you know anything about this film before you see it, it's just not as good.Once you start the climax filled beginning of this film you just can't move away. It was co-written by the man who co-wrote Tod Browning's Freaks. I swear if you take the 70 + minutes to watch this film, your life will never be the same.On a scale of one to ten, this film gets an EIGHT! A classic, a MUST see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Jack Palance Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie you will enjoy very much if your a fan of Jack Palance, Lee Marvin, Shelly Winters or the cast. Turner Classic movies ran this movie immediately after Humphrey Bogarts classic High Sierra recently. When you watch this one after the classic 1941 Raoul Walsh production, you immediately realize they are the same film.While it is nice to have color, in reality Walsh in many instances uses better camera angles. As far as comparing the casts, comparing Bogart in one of his best roles to Palance is a win-win as they both are great performances.I think one of the reasons Walsh is better is that Walsh had already directed a movie where the hero's were not exactly heroes before High Sierra. I highly recommend checking out Walsh's Dark Command which broke the mold for western movies much the way High Sierra &amp; this remake break the mold for gangster movies.Mad Dog gets a parole from jail so that Big Mac can use him to pull of one last big heist. The characters are revealed to the viewer much like peeling skins from from an Onion. When you reach the core of each character, your really glad you stuck around for the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie for a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay: So it wasn't as good as High Sierra and Palance and Winters are not Bogart and Lupino. But the idiot henchmen in this remake were Earl Holliman and Lee Marvin. Big Mac was played by Lon Chaney Jr. and Palance did a great job and was scarier than Bogie was. I grew up with Holliman and Marvin and the movie was also in color. I guess the best way to put it is this. If you demand the greatest actors and a different script for a remake this is not a movie for you. I (a huge Bogart fan) thought Palance played this role better than Bogie. Better because he was made for it.Put it like this. Who would you rather run into in a dark allay? Palance or Bogie? And since when is Shelly Winters a slouch? I really enjoyed this movie even though it didn't have a great director. I recommend it for Jack Palance fans and hope you enjoy it. Remember. Holliman and Marvin were extremely unintentionally funny in this movie. Gibbs</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody could match Jack Palance as a fearsome heavy and here, playing a freshly sprung ex-con lead bank robber, his authority over a couple of "punks" - junior gang members - including later-to-be star heavy in his own right, Lee Marvin, is powerful and utterly convincing. Nice details early on such as when presumptuous Marvin attempts to grab at the plan for the caper and 6'4" Palance without a word or look just brushes him aside with a sweep of the arm promises much - but little ultimately is delivered. Enter "Pard" the mongrel mutt to the accompaniment then and later of cutesy music. The furry friendly creature, loyal to the last, refuses to budge from the screen to the very end - unfortunately. This seemed symptomatic of the movie's uncertain tone - veering from tough as nails crime caper to family fare. Who was to blame? Was it Palance who possessed a face and physique that uniquely qualified him to be the ultimate brute always wanting to demonstrate a reassuring sensitive thoughtful side?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with this movie with such a beautiful title is that it is a remake ,nay a re-remake, if we remember that Raoul Walsh remade his "High Sierra " as a western ," Colorado Territory", which almost surpassed the original Film Noir.The most interesting side of the screenplay (in the three versions)is the Roy/Vilma relationship ,which reminds you of one of king Lear's daughter.Vilma is one of those rare characters whose behavior is thoroughly unpredictable :who could believe that the sweet tender romantic girl watching the stars in the sky at night would turn into the vulgar gal dancing the night away with her snob new pals?In "Colorado territory" ,Vilma (Julie Ann)even tries to give her benefactor away to the marshal to get the reward !Vilma ,as far the hero is concerned,means a conventional life ,with a housewife ,all that Mary (Shelley Winters) can't give to him;the actress is as good as usual but Ida Lupino was more moving in "High Sierra".Jack Palance,cast against type ,does a good job too,but it is not easy to take ona Humphrey Bogart's part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stands on it's own to a degree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, I haven't seen HIGH SIERRA in years, though I do remember most of it. Therefore, I was able to watch it with an objective eye, not constantly comparing the two films.It does offer panoramic vistas of the mountains and the desolate surroundings. I think the leads, particularly the love triangle of sorts (Marie is involved in two) are to me what sets it's apart from HIGH SIERRA.SPOILER AlERT We know that Marie (a very good Shelley Winters) is a fallen angel. She's a dance hall girl who's run off to the mountain cabin resort with Babe (Lee Marvin) as the gang Red (Earl Holliman) awaits the right time to pull off it's caper once Roy (Jack Palance) arrives and assumes leadership. But Marie isn't going to be anybodies girl, she's the prize of the Alpha Male of the bunch. Even though he repeatedly tells her he doesn't want her around, lust finally wins out.In the second triangle, Marie finally meets her rival, the presumed virginal Velma, a young woman whom Roy's opened up a new life for but springing for surgery to correct a club foot. Though Velma's previously rejected him and he's on the lam, he drops in one more time. Interesting that Velma is dancing up a storm with her young friends and Marie begins to wiggle around suggesting this is the proper way to dance (and maybe do other things)? Velma is Roy's embodied fantasy, a life he's longed for while languishing for years in prison. Though, her second rejection is callous, the second time a woman tells you to get lost usually is. He fools himself into believing he can have her and provide that kind of life. He rejects, then warms to Marie because she's a reflection of him...cheap, unrefined, desperate and living for the moment.Palance reveals both Roy's foolish sentimentality and his vicious streak. When he confronts Babe for slapping Marie, he takes great pleasure in beating the daylights out of him. This act, just like in the animal world, where the strongest males will fight over who gets the female(s) confirms not only Roy's place, but Marie's too. Palance is more brutal than Bogie (who's Roy was only violent when necessary). Palance will back hand a man, rather than speak to him.These factors I feel were better expressed here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Died a Thousand Times (1955)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this, I didn't know it was a remake, but within 10 minutes it was clear. Almost exactly a beat-for-beat remake of HIGH SIERRA. It's in color and widescreen, not that that adds much... the original film didn't have great cinematography, but the more claustrophobic frame gave it a little extra tension. Also, they swapped out a black stereotype for a Mexican stereotype. I guess that's supposed to be progress. Other than that, it really is practically identical to the original. The major difference, of course, is casting. I like Jack Palance, but he doesn't have the world-weariness or charm of Bogart. Likewise, I'm very fond of Shelley Winters, but what she does best is playing pathetic, and this character can't be pathetic. You just end up wanting Palance to ditch her. I don't want to be too harsh on this film, though. It's just that I felt like I'd already seen it (twice, even) and the update doesn't do any real updating. A competent but pointless endeavor, stick with Bogart and Lupino.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of High Sierra with Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lapino. Not quite as good as the original, although it has obviously talented, and great actors. It makes you wonder why they would remake a classic like High Sierra with minimal changes just 14 years later. One interesting difference between the original and this movie... In High Sierra Willie Best plays a stereotypical comical black man (Algernon) in a servile role at the camp. The remake had a comical Hispanic (Chico) played by Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez. Both are incredibly insulting by current standards. It makes you wonder about the changes in the culture from 1941 to 1955.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a literal remake of Bogart's High Sierra. The same roads, towns and even on the same rocks where High Sierra was made. It is scene-for-scene the same movie. It is almost uncanny in that respect. I felt deja vu all the way through.On the plus side the wide screen production and beautiful color are worthwhile, as is the good acting here which I think is equal to the original but that is a matter of each viewer's taste.Lon Chaney Jr. is terrific in his role and more than holds his own opposite the usually scene-stealing Palance. Also a plus is a classic brute thug Lee Marvin performance. You also get very young Nick Adams, Dennis Hopper and Perry Lopez doing good work.Lone Pine, Whitney Portal Road and the Sierras never looked better and they are the main reason you might want to watch this if you are vulnerable to being put off by the striking literal remake nature of this film project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're All Wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beginning in the Early Fifties Movie Studios discovered that they needed something, anything to pry Audiences from their Living Rooms and that Hypnotic Box called Television. It was not going to be an easy task. Well, they decided, we at least can give them Color and widen the Screen to seemingly endless Vistas.So they thought adding WarnerColor and Cinemascope was enough to cheat a little and remake a virtual Scene by Scene, Line by Line Movie called High Sierra (1941), a famously popular Bogart Movie Directed by Raoul Walsh. Despite a strong Cast it was not to be. Most of the Players are unremarkable and some like Lee Marvin are totally wasted barely registering. The whole thing seems uninspired and has very little Life and if you have seen the original this one will make you feel a little cheated. Its not Bad it just has no reason to exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I've Watched it a Thousand Times"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently re-watched this classic on it's own. Because the 1st time I watched it was back-to-back with the original, "High Sierra". Big mistake. The original one with Bogart &amp; Lupino is one of my all-time favorites and watching this remake right afterwards did not help me appreciate it the way it deserves to be.This remake actually is good on it's own merit. The original will always be the "better" version for me but this remake is not bad at all. Let me break it down...Palance's take on 'Mad' Dog Earle was very good. Palance is no Bogie, but he gave the role his own unique touch. And besides, who better than Palance, at the time, to take the role that Bogart made his own. With his sinister visage, Palance brought a different take on Mad Dog than Bogart's. I really got to see this second time around as I revisited this film.Winters take on 'Marie' was not bad either. Lupino I believe did it better but Winters held her own. I especially liked her Samba dance moves. And her 'I wanna die' scene. She had okay chemistry with Palance. But I feel Bogart &amp; Lupino had more.Lori Nelson's take on 'Velma' was right on par with Joan Leslie's. And you can actually believe Palance falling for her rather than Winters 'Marie'Lee Marvin's take on 'Babe' was not bad but Alan Curtis was better. Curtis had the handsome bad boy look and Marvin just looks bad and mean. Curtis you could believe got Lupino out of a club but Marvin taking Winters, nah. Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez plays 'Chico'. A very Mexican stereotype role. In the original, his was named 'Algernon' and it was played by Willie Best in a very black stereotypical role. I really dislike the scene where Lee Marvin's 'Babe' kicks 'Chico' and makes him fall and thinks it's funny. Gonzalez really has nothing to do but be a servant to Palance and his gang and not much else.Lon Chaney Jr. as 'Big Mac'. Great casting. He did a great take on the role made famous by Donald McBride. It was so great to see Chaney and Palance together. Earl Holliman as 'Red'. Not bad but Arthur Kennedy's was way better. Holliman played 'Red' like a good ole dumb country boy while Kennedy's was like a grown-up Dead End Kid, like a Billy Halop. But still it was nice to see Holliman and Marvin want-to-be gangsters.Perry Lopez as 'Mendoza'. It was okay but Cornel Wilde's was way much better. The scene where Palance tells a "bedtime story" of what happens to guys who talk to much was handle way much better with Bogart and Wilde.Howard St. John as 'Doc Banton' was very good. Actually just as good as Henry Hull's take on it. I especially like the way Howard looks at Palance when he talks about 'Velma'. Howard's look is priceless.Ralph Moody as 'Pa'was really good also. Almost just as good as Henry Traver's take. I really liked his scenes with Palance talking about 'Velma'James Millican as 'Jack Kranmer'. It was really good. Almost as slimy as Barton MacLane's 'Jake Kranmer'. But I prefer MacLane's. Richard Davalos as 'Lon Preisser' was not that bad. You can see Nelson's 'Velma' falling for Davalos pretty boy. In the original, played by John Eldredge, the spelling was 'Lon Preiser'In the part of 'Pard', the dog in this one was cute but Zero in the original was way, way much better.Now as for the unbilled bit parts, these are the ones that stood out for me: Nick Adams as the 'Bellboy' who is so nervous he can't stop shaking the tray with cups on it was memorable. Paul Brinegar as the bus driver who says the funny line "Just like a woman, doesn't know whether she's coming or going." Mae Clarke as Mabel Baughman, really concerned about her daughter and who and what is Palance is all about. Hugh Sanders as her husband was somewhat wasted in a very small bit role. A very young Dennis Hopper has a funny scene as Winter's dance partner. Hopper is drunk and horny and is pushed down by an angry Palance as he gets to frisky and comfortable with Winters. Hopper would have a better and bigger role that same year along with Nick Adams , in the now famous cult film, "Rebel Without a Cause." Dub Taylor as 'ED' the gas station attendant talking briefly with Palance was a nice one. and a couple of Three Stooges foils were also on board. Big Mickey Simpson and Robert Williams. Williams had a more showy and longer role than Simpson's. All in all, a great film just for the cast alone. Don't miss it. Just don't see it back-to-back with the original.</fullReview>

There's so many reasons NOT to pull the heist, it's ludicrous to believe they would. In the middle of the heist planning, Roy falls for a "good girl", a cripple who does not return his affections. Then Roy, a well-known, recently freed criminal pulls a heist in full daylight without any disguise or efforts to conceal his identity. Then everyone runs off and Roy runs around in full daylight most of the time planning his escape. Remember, he didn't disguise himself at the robbery! Let's not forget the pooch that is inevitably going to interfere with the plans for either a successful heist or escape? Seriously?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unless you count the western version of this story that Warner Brothers did with Joel McCrea in 1948 entitled Colorado Territory, I Died A Thousand Times is the second version and updated remake of Humphrey Bogart's classic High Sierra. Whole scenes are lifted word for word and other than a bow to the updated technology of the Fifties, like the use of helicopter by law enforcement in the final shootout.If you are a fan of Bogey than you know exactly how this is all going to end. Jack Palance is a stellar substitute for Bogart and in the Ida Lupino part steps Shelley Winters as the hard luck girl brought along by Palance's two confederates Lee Marvin and Earl Holliman who attachs herself to Palance. Unfortunately Palance realizes too late that Winters is who he is meant for.Ironically Palance as the star here would in 16 years in Monte Walsh wind up in support of Lee Marvin as their box office positions had changed considerably. Warner Brothers didn't water down this remake an iota right down to the casting of bit players. And a good bonus is the color cinematography. Fans of the original will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

Stealing, lying and cheating anyone can do but becoming a criminal that is good at it is not found here. Still, as you watch, the movie makes you wonder what you would have done as it presents a series of choices that can give different endings. The one presented here brought closure to the movie but back then, it could turn out any which way. He could have gotten the loot, the girl and lived happily ever after and then some. Perhaps he did? Hollywood had the final say. Bogart did this flick too and he is a joy to behold in the part. Recommend a snack of your choosing, a tasty drink and enjoy the scenery where this was filmed and the time-out from your own little world and get into this one</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destined To Fail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Died A Thousand Times" is a very faithful remake of Raoul Walsh's "High Sierra" (1941) which famously starred Humphrey Bogart as the professional bank robber Roy Earle. This time around, Jack Palance plays the role in a style that's far more menacing than Bogart's portrayal and the most striking differences between this film and its predecessor is that it contains less sentimentality and is presented in colour and CinemaScope. The presence of bright colours and numerous open spaces is interesting because they give the movie a visual style that's radically different to most 1950s film noirs and pre-empt some of the characteristics which would later become prevalent in neo-noirs.After crime boss Big Mac (Lon Chaney Jr.) pulls a few strings to secure the release of Roy Earle from prison, the experienced bank robber travels across country to take charge of planning and carrying out the robbery of some jewellery from a Californian resort hotel. On his way, he meets the Goodhue family who are travelling to L.A. and the attractive 19-year-old Velma (Lori Nelson) catches his eye.When he arrives at the group of cabins where he's supposed to stay until the hotel heist is carried out, he meets Babe (Lee Marvin) and Red (Earl Holliman) who have been hired as his accomplices and Marie Garson (Shelley Winters), an ex-dance-hall girl who Babe had recently brought to the camp. Earle is unimpressed with his accomplices who he immediately recognises as being inexperienced and unreliable and also disapproves of Marie staying with the group. He is pleased, however, by the presence of a mongrel dog called Pard despite being warned that the dog had brought bad luck to his three previous owners.Earle meets the Goodhue family again by chance when he's in the process of preparing for the heist and on discovering that Velma has a deformed foot arranges for her to have an expensive operation to enable her to walk normally again. Despite being warned that she already has a wealthy young boyfriend, Earle hopes that his kindness will make her fall in love with him. Her operation is a great success but Earle's plan fails as Velma firmly rejects his proposal of marriage. The gang go ahead with the hotel robbery which goes disastrously wrong and things don't improve later as Earle gets shot and double-crossed before the story eventually reaches its spectacular conclusion.A combination of factors contribute to the sense that Roy Earle's endeavours after he left prison were always destined to fail. The misjudgements he made relating to Velma and Pard were down to his own poor judgement but the selection of his accomplices and the circumstances that led to him being double-crossed were clearly outside of his control. Jack Palance is impressive as the tough criminal and the supporting cast is also consistently good."I Died A Thousand Times" won't eclipse "High Sierra" in the minds of anyone who's seen the original movie but it's still an interesting remake and judged purely on its own merits, worthy of positive recognition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roy Earle is a professional criminal--one of the toughest and best at his job. When he is unexpectedly released from prison, it is because someone big wanted a big heist and they pulled strings to get him. On his way to the location of his new partners up in the Sierras, he meets a very poor family and befriends them. He also later befriends a cute little dog. Both these acts of kindness are very atypical for such a hardened man and, sadly, BOTH end up causing him nothing but grief in the end. I am a film purist when it comes to remakes. My opinion has always been that if the original film is great, it shouldn't be remade--remakes are only for films with SERIOUS flaws that can corrected in the remake. So, I am a VERY difficult sell for a film like "I Died a Thousand Times", as it's a remake both of the classic Bogart picture "High Sierra" as well as Joel McCrea's "Colorado Territory"==and both films have a higher IMDb rating as well."I Died a Thousand Times" turns out to be an extremely well made film--mostly because it is practically an exact copy of "High Sierra" and because Jack Palance was quite nice in the lead. The only major differences is the wonderful color film stock--it looks great because of the wonderful mountain locations. As for the acting, it's about on par with the original. So, if it offers no real major advantage, why not just see the original--especially since it stars Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino and is a classic. This 1955 version could have become a classic--if the story had been original. Good but see the original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrong Title for A Great Film ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, a remake of the Bogie classic "High Sierra" was excellent because it deals with a deep character study.As usual, Shelley Winters was wonderful. She is especially at the top of her game when she plays nervous, frustrated individuals calling out for attention while totally lost in her environment.Winters was equally matched by a tremendous Jack Palance performance. As vicious as he is depicting, the man shows some heart by taking an interest in a crippled girl only to be spurned for his efforts. Seething after this, he has no regrets whatsoever about the life of crime he has chosen.It is interesting how Palance describes the up and coming criminal as not having what it takes. He comes from the old school. Ironically, Roy Earl (Palance) knew what it would take to make a successful heist; but at the same time he knew what pitfalls would ultimately lead to disaster. He is himself a victim when his robbery attempt goes awry through no fault of his own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dangerous to remake a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>if you've never seen high sierra this could be a six; if you have it drops- thus the 3; it's in color, which doesn't fit the film noir take; palance is no Bogart, more an early sly stallion overdoing everything; and for stunning, vulnerable Ida lupine they picked somewhat chunky almost boy haircut mostly whiny Shelly winters; the tension of high sierra is unstrung in almost every way- with palance going from happy smiley- and boy is that not Roy Earle- to glowering; winters delivers the final crash out line as though she's asking for a newspaper; and the intense, thematic score in the original is adolph deutch with other masterful score credits like mask of Demetrius, Maltese falcon, the apartment, some like it hot; the remake score is a dud written by a guy who did the TV theme for maverick; you have to wonder what the backers were thinking; but it's hard to find a great remake, even a good one: kenneth branagh redoes olivier? please; clooney and crowd outdo the rat pack? not even close; i'd vote for scarface with it's griity update; hitchock redid some of his early antiques with success; but taking on a classic like high sierra- moody, gripping, silky b+w, powerful Bogart, evocative lupino- you have to hit every step to even come close, and this one trips up almost fro the start;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nihilistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With W. R. Burnett as writer and Jack Palance and Shelley Winters as the leads, this caper film has a lot going for it. The darkly handsome, deeply chiseled Palance does well as a hardened ex-con who hasn't quite abandoned his membership in the Family of Man.He'll help an old geezer who can't seem to steer his jalopy straight, he gives an abused dog a haven, and he befriends a dime-a-dance slattern who confides, "In my whole life I never hooked up with any guys who weren't wrong -- until you." Yet he has no compunction robbing a desert resort, shooting a security guard who tries to stop him, and clobbering a man who recognizes him from the newspaper. There are interesting supporting performances as well, including a cowardly, bullying Lee Marvin as a holdup guy; uncredited, pretty boy Nick Adams as a waiter with a bad case of the jitters, and Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez as a highly stereotypical Mexican ("Ay, caramba!"). The film falters by spending too much time on a silly subplot involving a girl with a club foot. I'm glad I caught this, but I'm not sure I'll remember it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classic, ten out of ten!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A real classic, ten out of ten! Every actor is perfect, the screenplay is a haunting succession of suspenseful scenes. Scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. Wonder if this film is already out in DVD, because it must be seen in Widescreen version. Saw this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and never since then forgot it.I remember it was one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features, process called Warnerscope which gave a very neat cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved an Oscar for their performances.The only thing I could criticize is not having been directed by someone like, say Nicholas Ray, to increase its rhythm and tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Died a Thousand Times watching it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to see it because of two reasons. One, it was the remake of High Sierra with Bogart, two, the Bogart part was played by Jack Palance, whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility, as in The Big Knife.But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra; only here, the actors don't care, the director is lost in his thoughts, and who knows what the producer was thinking. Jack Palance is getting bored looking at Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters is asking herself what she's doing in this film. I don't even want to compare her to Ida Lupino in the same role. And of course, they had to use the dog story again! They surely could have come up with some different ideas. Perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot High Sierra, but that definitely doesn't add any quality to the film.It's a waste of time if you've seen High Sierra before. Otherwise, why not see a pseudo-film noir. As for me, I'd rather die than see it one more time...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was a great movie - 14 years earlier...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But this one was dreadful. You just know how this must have gone down. They dust off a good but forgotten script for cheap, find some usually pretty good actors willing to work for cheap and load up the cameras with just enough color film. If any directors actually show up for work, they tell the actors to just get the lines out as written when the cameras roll and then rush on to the next scene. No time for any of that fancy Hollywood acting today. Just get 'er done.Casting? Some unused talent here, but there is no chemistry between any of the characters and the love interest is, well, uninteresting. It looks like nobody in or around this movie cared about it. Why should I?Yes, I did see this one after seeing the Bogart version. Now, I have nothing against remakes when they are done well, as some are. "Cape Fear" comes to mind. But this one was senseless, and so is watching it. If you want to see this movie, see "High Sierra". Now that's a good flick.</fullReview>
