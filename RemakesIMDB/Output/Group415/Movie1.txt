		<shortDescription>Ordinary yet extraordinary. Simply beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line, the excellent character development, and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as a whole.Without giving away too much of the plot, it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons. Along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves. The story has a prologue about what dancing in Japan symbolizes sociologically, so it isn't exactly as simple to learn to dance in Japan as it is here in the U.S. The film is lighthearted; you'll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags. Yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe. All of the film's characters are taken seriously, as they are, and none are diminished because of their "imperfections."I've been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends. It just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance. Is this synchronous or what? I think so because now I'm really geeked to give it a try. Watch this wonderful family film (small children might not get it, but teens certainly would) and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again.Why they would make a remake of Shall We Dance is a mystery, as it is perfect as-is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie that proves Americans hate subtitles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I simply love this movie. It is a perfect example of the well-rounded surprising stories that come out of Asian cinema. There was a recent Hollywood remake of this movie, with Richard Gere and the simply awful Jennifer Lopez. Please do not confuse the two movies. The original Japanese film is touching, subtle and wonderfully acted. The Hollywood version is the exact opposite. I was aghast when I first saw the trailer for the remade US Version and who was starring in it. It's typical Hollywood unoriginal crass commercialism at it's worst. The remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved upon. The ONLY reason the original film did not become more widely viewed is the US audience's aversion to subtitles.One of the main reasons this movie would never work in an American telling is that the reserved, ultra socially conservative character of the public Japanese persona is at issue in this movie. Certainly the main character awakens to a more full understanding of living a vivacious life through dance, but half of the movie's tension comes from the stereotypes and ridicule ballroom dancers face in Japan.Please try to see this movie in it's original form, not the terrible full screen. And please DO skip the US remake....it's a shallow travesty in comparison to the original Japanese movie.Yes, I know the "original" movie is much older, and this is simply a Japanese take on the story, but the only two people are likely to see any time soon are this one and the new US remake.Speaking of foreign films, I'll make a few quick recommendations: 1.Monsoon Wedding-I list this first for a reason, outstanding film! 2.Johnny Stechino-Very funny Italian mistaken identity flic! 3.Shiri-A Korean action pic that mixes both Asian flare &amp; US style plot 4.Run Lola Run-A German film that integrates it's techno score ingeniously.Well, just a quick list anyway :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasing experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so surprised when I saw this film so much underrated... I understand why some of you dislike this movie. Its pace is slow, a characteristic of Japanese films. Nevertheless, if you are absorbed in the film like me, you will find this not a problem at all.I must say this is the best comedy I have ever seen. "Shall We Dansu?" is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It is very different from Hollywood ones, e.g. Austin Powers or Scary Movies, in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes. Rather, it is light-hearted, a movie that makes you feel good.I love the movie because it makes me feel "real". The plot is straightforward yet pleasing. I was so delighted seeing that Sugiyama (the main role) has found the meaning of life in dancing. Before I watched the film I was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork. I felt lost. However, this film made me think of the bright side of life. I believed I was in the same boat of Sugiyama; if he could find himself in his hobby, why couldn't I? It reminded me of "exploring my own future" and discovering the happiness in my daily life.It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect, I kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really "alive", learning to dance as the film goes on.Over all, this film is encouraging and heart-warming. As a comedy, it does its job perfectly. It definitely deserves 10 stars.And yes Aoki is funny :-D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant film. Not to be missed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us, I suspect. Shall we dance? is not a movie about dancing. It is about learning about ourselves, recognising what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it. Mr Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour. One day Mr Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing acadamy. he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons. He is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule. He hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family.There is a hilarious scene in the mensroom at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a workmate who also dances, are interrupted practising some dance steps. There are many other funny and warm-hearted scenes.The ending is not a fairytale, but it leaves the viewer feeling good.This movie helped me to understand the Japanese people a little better. It is a warm and very worthwhile film to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a man who has been too caught up with the accepted convention of success, trying to be ever upwardly mobile, working hard so that he could be proud of owning his own home. He assumes this is all there is to life until he accidentally takes up dancing, all because he wanted to get a closer look of a beautiful girl that he sees by the dance studio everyday while riding the subway on his way home.His was infatuated with her at first, going to the dance class just to idolize her, but he eventually lets himself go and gets himself into the dancing. It eventually becomes apparent to him that there is more to life than working yourself to death. There is a set of oddball characters also learning in the studio, giving the film a lot of laughs and some sense of bonding between the dejected.There is also revelations of various characters, including the girl he initially admired, giving some depth to them by showing their blemished past and their struggle to overcome it.The dancing was also engaging, with the big competition at the end, but it is not the usual story where our underdog come out at the top by winning it. Instead, there are downfalls, revelations and redemption.All these makes it a moving and fun film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A subtle and intricate film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like "grade inflation" but I just had to give this a 10. I can't think of anything I didn't like about it. I saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it. I'm sure that the Hollywood remake that someone told me about, with J Lo and Richard Gear, will be excellent, but this original Japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought-provoking for me that I am hard-pressed to think of any way that it could be improved, or its setting changed to a different culture.A story I found worth watching, and with o fist-fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort! Imagine that!All the characters seemed well-developed, ... even non-primary characters had good character-development and enjoyable acting, and the casting seemed very appropriate. It's always hard to find a good movie-musical in our day and age, and perhaps this doesn't quite qualify (there is plenty of learning how to dance, but no singing) but I really think that Gene Kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man, successful with a family in Japan, looking for something... he knows not precisely what.To the team of people in Japan who contributed to this film, thank you for creating and doing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming and funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, there is NO way the remake can be as good, because Japanese society is quite different from ours and plays such a major part in this film, as explained in the opening narration. It adds to the humor as well as warmth of this movie. There is slew of different supporting characters/personalities. Each does there part in making this movie wonderful. This movie is full of comedy that isn't vulgar in anyway like most of today's "gross-out comedies." Yet it can still have you laughing out loud. The reality is, in real life, you don't have a choice of who you work with or go to school with...etc. This movie truly emphasizes that and shows that the natural good in people can overcome petty differences. Not to mention, it makes for a great sub-plot and much of the humor. This is a story about dance that actually has a story, and a good one at that. There are a few back stories that are not out of place, but actually support the main storyline. Truly a well written film. The dancing is great, too. I happen to be a fan of any movie with dancing of any sort, for that aspect. However, this movie goes beyond any other with dance, in the fact that, it is a story First and just happens to be written about dancing in Japanse society. Highly recommended.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Passion of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good movie with an outstanding story. Many assume that the movie is a love story from the typical Hollywood style: boy meets girl love affair. This is not. It is a story of a man who forgot to love life. His everyday life has become routine and he has no idea where his life is taking him. He has a house and car payment and a family of 3 that he has to provide for. From home, he takes his bicycle to the train and then he takes the train to work. Everyday, same old, same old. Then, one day he sees something that turns his world up-side-down. Dancing? A new way to express himself, a way to communicate with others and show his true colors. The passion he finds is not in a woman or mere lust, but in living life to the fullest. He begins to stop and look around him as he uses dancing to live. A terrific cast of funny and heart filled characters. This is not a movie about Japan or the Japanese, although it does take place in Japan and the cast is made up of Japanese. The setting and the plot of this movie is timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay. As you can see this is one of my favorite if not favorite films. This is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious. The main character is a business man who is stuck in a "same thing, different day" mentality. He sees a woman looking melancholy out a window of a dance studio from his train everyday and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her. He decides to join the dance class only to find out she is not the instructor. From there he bonds with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing as well as finding out about the mysterious woman.There is no gratuitous (or any) sex involved, just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed.This film was remade with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and the new one while appealing is nowhere as enjoyable as the original. The movie never made it big in America because it was not eligible for the Oscars since it was broadcast on television in Japan (movies cannot be released on TV or they are disqualified for Oscar nominations). It did win numerous awards in Japan for best film, cast, director etc for their "Oscar" awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical and Meaningful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is among my favorite foreign films, some of the others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog. The similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films, is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson. In Japan, a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life, sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio. In the instant that it takes his train to pass, he is enthralled by her. But is it only by her beauty, by her faraway glance, or a connection that they will both discover that they share? Shall We Dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance. Breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of Japanese society, they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away. It is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and, in itself, transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely and Delightful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The accountant Shohei Sugiyama (Kôji Yakusho) is feeling bored with his routine life, limited to hard work and stay at home with his wife Masako Sugiyama (Hideko Hara) and his teenager's daughter. One night, while traveling home by train, he sees the beautiful face of Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari) in the balcony of a dance school, and a couple of days later, he decides to visit the school and secretly take ballroom dance lessons every Wednesdays night. However, he becomes ashamed to tell his family his secret. Meanwhile, Masako feels the changes in the behavior of her happier husband, and hires a private eye to investigate whether Shohei is having an affair.I have just finished watching "Shall We Dansu?" and I really loved it. What a lovely and delightful movie! The story is amazingly good, with drama, comedy and romance. The cast is excellent, and I was particularly impressed with the cold beauty and graciousness of the wife of the director Masayuki Suo and professional ballet dancer Tamiyo Kusakari. On last September 06th, I saw the American remake of "Shall We Dansu?" for the first time, and I found it a delightful entertainment. But now I can say that it is another unnecessary remake, and I recommend this original film instead. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Dança Comigo?" ("Dance With Me?")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie many many times and I will never get tired of it. It is a classic in every sense of the word. The movie is hysterically funny and yet quite touching all at the same time. For those of you who are not a fan of "subtitles" or of foreign film in general, open your mind. This is a great movie for "the beginner" because the story is so entertaining. Don't get me wrong, it is 100% Japanese (and that is what makes it work), but everyone will get something out of it (even if it is just a great laugh at one of the main characters called Mr. Aoki - one of the funniest characters I have ever seen!)I can't even think of this movie without smiling!!

		<shortDescription>Shall We Dance? Yes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie opened in Korea four years later than in Japan due to the now-defunct ban on Japanese pop culture in Korea. But the audiences in Korea were just as enthralled and enchanted by the story as the rest of the world was.Like Japan, there are many salarymen in Korea who are also facing a mid-life crisis. After the movie premiered in Seoul, dance studios were reporting up to a 50-percent increase in the number of new students.I took two years of jazz dance during college, and have seen Strictly Ballroom and Dance With Me. But this movie was the driving force behind me finally signing up for ballroom dance (called dancesport in Korea) lessons.Mr. Aoki was hilarious as the employee who led a double life unbeknownst to his colleagues. It was also interesting to find out the reasons why the other students took lessons.I too would have taken classes just to get close to the sexy dance instructor alone.This movie is a perfect ten in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny. Sad. Charming. These are all words that floated through my head while I was watching this beautiful, simple film.It is rare that a movie truly moves me, but "Shall We Dance?" accomplished that with grace to spare. Gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie-viewing history. It left me with a quiet sense of exultation, but with a small touch of sadness mixed in.And the dancing, oh yes, the dancing. Even if you are not a lover of the art, or can't put one foot in front of another, the steps displayed here will take your breath away, and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can. It was absolutely enchanting, even the parts that show Sugiyama's (touchingly portrayed by Koji Yakusho) stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous, child-like way. And yet, this film was not entirely about dancing, but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings. We witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance, a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art, and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast.Beauty. Pain. Emotion. All the love and little agonies of life are here, expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine Japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another example of Japanese simplicity at its best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing that "Shall We Dance" was remade from this movie, I had to see the original before seeing the re-make. What makes this movie stand out among the trash out there today is that it takes a very simple story about normal everyday people, and shows us that these people have extraordinary ambitions and talents. All this while exploring feelings of fulfillment and achievement. No complex plots, no cheap romances, no action thrills; just the pleasure of dance and its use as a tool for expression of the person within. The whole cast does a great job of carrying the story, and the material is presented as (in the words of most judges on Japan's "Iron Chef") "simple, yet complex" (or vice versa). Try to get this version if you can. Otherwise, the American remake will serve as a substitute until you get the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Knowing the reality of long train commutes, bike rides from the train station, soup stands, and other typical scenes depicted so well, certainly added to my own appreciation for this film which I really, really liked. There are aspects of Japanese life in this film painted with vivid colors but you don't have to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie. Director Suo's tricks were subtle for the most part; I found his highlighting the character called Tamako Tamura with a soft filter, making her sublime, a tiny bit contrived but most of the directors tricks were so gentle that I was fully pulled in and just danced with his characters.

		<fullReview>This movie was charming. An accountant wants more from life than the approved conventional success. What makes it work so well, and makes it so different from the standard dance movie is that it really isn't about becoming "Great" it is simply about finding a way to express one's self. The big triumph at the end is not the winning of a contest, not the discovery of a whole new life style, but the simple joy of doing what you want to fulfill the other parts of your life. No one is discovering their passion, they are finding their quiet soul.The Japanese background makes the subtle oppression and "secret life" of ballroom dancing both understandable and personal. We can all see ourselves in the everyman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Subtitles should not deter you from this charmer of a film. Ballroom Dancing, which is seen as risque in Japan, becomes the unlikely passion of an accountant who has gotten everything he thought he wanted and found he missed out on happiness. He begins classes hoping to meet a girl he saw looking as sad as he was himself, but finds that dance has charms of its own. Like Babette's Feast, the insight into another culture, and the elegant structure of the film leave you more than satisfied.</fullReview>

The novice dancers don't become suddenly flamboyant ? they awkwardly move along.The main actor is wonderful and under-stated. I suppose he represents all us guys who are just too shy and inhibited to start to dance. There are some nice sub-plots ? eclectic dancers, detectives and a daughter who steps in at the proper times.

		<shortDescription>About Mid-life Crisis And Ballroom Dancing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shall We Dance is about a bored accountant Sugiyama,who on his evening commute,always looks at the beautiful woman who gazes wistfully out the window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing. One night he gets off the train, walks into the studio, and signs up for a class. Soon Sugiyama is so engrossed in his dancing he practices his steps on the train platform and under his desk, and becomes good enough for competition, compelling his wife to hire a private investigator to find out why he stays out late and returns home smelling of perfume. Among the colorful characters Sugiyama meets is his coworker Aoki,who transforms himself from geeky systems analyst to hilariously flamboyant (and bad-wigged) lounge lizard. Aoki explains to Sugiyama, "When I finish work, put on the clothes, the wig and become Donny Burns, Latin world champion, and I start to move to the rhythm, I'm so happy, so completely free." Here lies the chief charm of Shall We Dance, the contrast between the ultra-competitive women of the studio--including the one who caught Sugiyama's eye, Mai --and the men who dance simply because they enjoy it.This is a great film tackles issues such as the views on men in the Japanese culture,mid-life crisis and ballroom dancing.The cast in the film were excellent.This is one of the best Japanese films I have ever seen.And it is not a horror film.It takes into consideration the pains of middle-age and the need to feel alive during that stage. Overall,it is the best non-horror Japanese film I have ever seen. Highly recommended to everyone who wants an entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko is someone we know in everyday life. They were so natural, and Sugiyama's transformation is incredibly believable. The score is so moving, it brought me to tears. The choreography was beautiful without seeming athletic. Mai's graceful dancing and charm gave me goosebumps. Tamako is such a wonderfully delightful character. You can almost see the charmed schoolgirl in her face as she reminisces about seeing "The King and I". Aoki's character is both hilarious and pitiful. Masako is so overwhelmingly natural as the bewildered wife, you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be all right.This film is truly a keeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always look forward to this movie when its on TV. Have to get the DVD I guess. The range of different types of people is great. It says to me that anyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. He is so quirky but so full of emotions. It is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing. Unfortunately we never get the chance to see them go to Blackpool. Would make for the perfect sequel if they had. But I guess it leaves it to your imagination to what could of happened.A very simple and innocent story. He stays loyal to his wife and daughter.I haven't seen the Hollywood remake. Not sure if I want to. I don't really enjoy Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere more matches the original than Lopez. I have a feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dancing in Japan can Ruin your Reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A middle-aged accountant in an established, successful Japanese firm has a house, a wife, and a beautiful daughter. He works hard all day, comes home, goes to sleep, and then does the whole thing over again. He's a man who's lost his soul. He's an automaton, a cog in the larger Japanese industrial society. As old Karl Marx would have put it, he's alienated from the larger society of his fellow workers, his family, and from himself. What a predicament.On the way home from work, he spots a beautiful but melancholy woman looking out the window of a dance studio. Every night, she's there, calling to him like a siren or one of the fabled wood nymphs. There's a sexual attraction that fuels his interest. But there's also much more: he immediately identifies with her, feels an instant sense of connection, because she is outwardly expressing his inner angst. So he takes the leap, overcomes his fear, and signs up for dance lessons.In the West, this commonplace occurrence would go unnoticed: we would say that Mr. Sugiyama is having a `mid-life crisis.' We would expect him to have an affair with his secretary, or suddenly buy leathers and a Harley and hit the road. But in Japan, where Ballroom dancing is viewed as lascivious, perhaps even perverted behavior, this makes for a much more interesting dilemma. The main character, Mr. Sugiyama, a respectable accountant, is drawn into dance by the alluring siren. He acts on his impulse to get to know her. But then, when reality sets in that he will never win her affection, he falls in love with dance. It becomes his personal means both of self-discovery, and self-expression. It's a fascinating transformation.One of the reasons that this movie works so well is its rich and varied set of characters, all of which are simply adorable.

		<fullReview>There were some great moments of reality in there depicting modern day life (not only in Japan, but everywhere). It shows how stifling ones culture can be, and wanting to break out of the mold its created for you.The dancing was just a vehicle for saying "do what you love even if its against the norm". Rather Billy Elliot like I would say. I enjoyed that film as well. The humour was well timed, and the touching moments felt so real, you could feel the awkwardness between Sugiyama and his wife, the tantrums in the dance hall. I loved Aoki - him and that wig and his excessiveness on the dance floor made me simply howl!The actors all did a wonderful job, the story was well written. I watched it a second time and caught some little nuances that I missed on the first viewing. Good entertainment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, great look at Japan today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Masayuki Suo, who directed this fine film, is on a role. After the decent "Fancy Dance" and the classic (in Japan, anyway) college-sumo comedy "Shiko Funjatta", Suo has followed his own huge footsteps with a smashing success.The story is engaging. We both laugh often (Naoto Takenaka is hilarious, as he is in Suo's two previous films) and really root for the characters. But to me the big bonus is the look this movie gives the viewer into Japanese society - real life in Japan. Suo has a knack for showing real-life activities with entertaining flair. The result is a movie that will pull you in, make you laugh, make you think, and both entertain you and give you insight into today's Japan.Also look for the the main 8 actors from Shiko Funjatta, as they all appear again in various roles, from supporting characters (Takenaka) to short cameos (many).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at all what I expected :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting a romantic comedy, instead I found a refreshingly funny film about people finding their reason for living. The humor is very subtle, but it builds throughout the film. The people who appear to be the clowns of the movie aren't the funniest part of the film. The movie as a whole and the situations are what make this film very entertaining. However, this film does not only keep the audience giggling, but also shows how two people learn what drives them in their lives. In doing this, it makes one think about his or her own drives. In addition to all of this, ballroom dansing in the film appears to be something that everyone can do as long as you are having a great time doing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Mistake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine dragged me to this movie. I had never heard of it and I was not famous for attending little known, foreign films. However, I have to say that I LOVED this film!The film was a very intense, yet easy film to watch. Our two main characters, the accountant and the veteran dance instructor, have a chemistry very rarely seen. The viewer is dragged right into the story and you feel as if you were the one who was fighting for the love of a woman you know you can never have. But you also felt the compelling will to get out there to dance and compete.In the end, you would not get the woman, but you would have learned something about yourself and the person you are, not the one other people peg you to be.I hope to see more films of this type on screen. I think audiences are tired of the usual shoot 'em up films or the ones with senseless sex. From the audience I saw in the theater I was in, I know there is a market for films like these. I hope they get their due!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one is the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the original one, not an adaptation of the movie "shall we dance" in 1937 (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029546/) directed by Mark Sandrich and played by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers because the story is totally DIFFERENT, though they got the same title. I can't understand why people always argue about Hollywood movies which are adapted from foreign movies and don't want to admit it, though the truth is so obvious. In the website of "shall we dance" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358135/ they also admit that they adapted the movie from this movie by Masayuki Suo.The movie is very beautiful, if you know the Japanese society, the movie creates a character who is depressed by the stressing society. Then a way to get rid of the whole introverted depression is to dance!! The movie is so fun that you can really laugh till the movie is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amateur dancer learns about heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the American cut of this Japanese movie, which has several scenes and characters removed. At that, "Shall We Dance" is a charming movie with tons of heart. Written and directed by Masayuki Suo, "Shall We Dance" has something "Strictly Ballroom" lacks: depth and feeling. I'll compare Baz Luhrman with Oscar Wilde: all flash and showy surface, with nothing underneath. Masayuki Suo has created a film with characters who move us. Koji Yakusho, Naoto Takenaka, Naoto Takenaka, and the other actors are excellent in their roles.The gist of the plot is that Mr. Sugiyama (Yakusho) is an overworked salaryman who spies a lovely younger woman in the window of a dance studio on his way home from work on the train. He has a wife, a daughter, and a mortgage, and no dreams. He takes up ballroom dancing to meet the younger woman, whose father owns the studio and who gives lessons. Dancing, of course, becomes a metaphor, and his fellow students grow from awkward, nameless bumblers to awkward, feeling humans as he (and we) learn to know them. The changes in the minor characters are more dramatic than the subtle growth of Mr. Sugiyama.In "Shall We Dance," learning dance means proceeding from our awkward, graceless first steps to feeling the music and trusting your partner. Feeling emotion and trusting your partner and yourself go hand in hand with learning the dance. The process gets a little heavy-handed as characters spell it out for us, but it didn't detract from the emotional investment we make in watching the characters grow.The movie is often funny without being a comedy, and it's not a romance with budding young love -- Mr. Sugiyama is in his forties, and his dream girl has no romantic interest in him. But they develop a relationship on another, still meaningful level."Shall We Dance" is also the title of a 1937 Astaire-Rogers film, and the Japanese version was remade under the same title in 2004, starring Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez. I have not seen either of these two movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>businessman vs passion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I understand it, much of the humor in "Shall We Dance?" derives from the stereotype of the Japanese businessman. A businessman in the Land of the Rising Sun is supposed to be very serious and motivated, as Shohei Sugiyama (K&#x14d;ji Yakusho) is. He's successful but unfulfilled. But taking dancing lessons just might change that.Much like Baz Luhrmann's "Strictly Ballroom", "Shall We Dance?" shows that dancing is a physical form of communication. Shohei feels cut off from his wife and daughter, but the dance lessons help him open up. The movie knows how to present everything just right so that it comes across naturally and without seeming like a cliché. There was an American remake, but I have no plans to ever see that one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing beats the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the original Shall We Dansu, a Japanese film that takes a look at the society around it and the shameful act of dancing. It is considered out of the society's norms to dance, whether it is in a studio or at home, especially ballroom dancing. This is exactly what the main character Shohei Sugiyama is looking for to break from his mundane life. While the topic of the film is better understood with the knowledge of Japanese culture it is still hilarious to watch while still maintaining its heart-felt plot.Shall We Dansu has a very serious plot of a man trying to break from his daily routine, but also adds in a slew of comedy through gags and dialog. Some scenes are laugh out loud while others just give a chuckle to break up tension. However, this is a very funny film with a very interesting story line.The one thing to be aware of is that this is the original Japanese version. There has been a more recent Hollywood version that falls very short in comparison. The Hollywood version was a flop and took an amazing movie and turned it into a pointless waste of time. Do not see the remake; instead look at this original film, which is able to captivate humor and drama all in the same moment.The most important thing to understand about this film is that in this Japanese society it is taboo to dance. If you try to place this film outside of that context, like how the remake attempted, it loses everything that makes this film worth seeing. While analyzing society, and the norms of that society, Shall We Dansu is a captivating experience that mixes humor with drama to allow for an entertaining film experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Charming and Delightful Film Highlighting Traditional Japanese Societal Norms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this delightful Japanese feature film at the 5th Annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival in the historic Virginia Theatre in Champaign, Illinois.Although this film, subtitled in English, has ballroom dancing as its heart, the film actually shows the world outside of Japan how the rigid structures of family, employment (salaryman), and recreation still exist in Modern day Japan.Writer/director Suo Masauki [I follow Japanese custom of presenting the family name (last name) first and the given name (last)] uses the not so very popular theme of ballroom dancing to show the societal structure of Japan. [Also, I shall not use the movie character names when world readers may not be familiar with Japanese formal names which may confuse. I will refer to theactors by their professional acting name as listed in the Internet Data Movie Base.] He enlists the aid of his real-life wife, professional ballet dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in her first and, so far, only motion picture. She is a dance teacher at her father's dance studio. Yet, her real ambition is to compete once more in an International Dance Competition which she was disqualified from in the past. No, I won't say "why." See the movie.Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the film. A veteran of about 25 films since 1979, he gives a sterling performance of a 40's something companymanwho has a lovely wife, teenage daughter, and just purchased the house of hislonging.And, yet, something is missing from his own inner happiness. See this film to learn how he becomes "involved" with ballroom dancing and secretly goes tolessons. Most of the dancing characters are liberated from the traditionalJapanese hierarchy of social structure. They are friendly and warm and inviting. Of course, this is in sharp contrast to how Japanese society is structured with it's "place for everyone and everyone in its place" philosophy.The movie has so many funny moments. The almost 1,500 theater goers brokeinto spontaneous laughter during many of the comedic moments. This provesthat comedy has no foreign language. Veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is funny and brilliant as well as Watanabe Eriko. They are two funny character actors.One could purchase and read a college text book regarding the structure of life in Japan, or, you could watch this fine film and begin to understand how thepeople of Japan grow up in a fairly rigid societal structure. Watching the movie "Shall we Dansu?" is a quick immersion into further study and viewing otherJapanese films. I recommend this film to all. It's funny, it's charming, it will make you cry a little, and it will warm your heart.</fullReview>

The actors are so natural in their roles it's like you are watching real life. The story is about a man who has everything a man would want in life, but feels something is missing. One day coming home on the train he sees a pretty girl staring out a dance studio window. Drawn to her, he leaves the train and goes into the studio. That's when his life starts to change, though it's not what you think. What unfolds is a beautiful story about learning to accepting others AND yourself. It's funny, romantic, and sweet. Plus the dancing in this film is fun to watch. This is a film that everyone will enjoy.9 out of 10 (A Classic)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I found out about this movie, by it showing up on several critics review lists. I then saw it at the local video store, but the fact that it was Japanese with sub-titles put me off. But after walking by and picking it several times, I thought, what the heck. What a pleasant surprise. It is a simple movie, but it is a joy to watch. I even watched it with my 19 and 12 year old daughters, who both enjoyed it. In Japan , dancing is looked upon as disgusting or disturbing. A middle age man, trapped in a conventional life, passes by a dance studio on his trip home by train every night and sees a beautiful woman teaching. It is enough of a glimpse into another world to push him off the train and up to the studio to take lessons. This is a delightful movie and worth taking the time to view it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised. It is very well done and it beats hands down the ballroom dancing movies of recent years, especially "Strictly Ballroom". While the music is nice and the dancing colourful, for me the movie is not about dancing. It is about the very Japanese institution that gives male office workers long commutes to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. Here we have the man with the complete family and the large mortgage and a flagging zest for life. He is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his commute and this leads him to try ballroom dancing. Also Japanese is the fact that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion are made plain but somehow accepted, at least eventually, by family and audience. Attitudes to ballroom dancing, as conveyed in the film, are definitely non-Western, though the discipline and the music are clearly cultural imports to Japan. The cultural contrasts are thus intriguing. Even without the cultural insights, the colour, the dance and the enthusiasm of the players all make this a fun film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful family film, as much about Japanese culture as Ballroom dancing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film revolves as much around Japanese culture as it does the lives of one modern Japanese family. Physical contact is frowned upon for those over 7 (especially in public) hence all that bowing instead of hugging even when you are close friends/ relatives. Ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around someone else and that in public too! Never the less Ballroom dancing is (on the quite) immensely popular. People who do Ballroom dancing in Japan are viewed a bit like nudists in the west... many more would like to than do but are inhibited by the culture. A delightful family film, which any amateur dancer would enjoy for the dance sequences alone. I understand that it was more popular than Titanic in Japan. I guess the Japanese are just like the rest of us - they like to be hugged too.</fullReview>

It's the tale of one person learning to love life again, pushing past all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once more. The bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern Japan toward everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact. There are scenes that will make you laugh out loud ... a few where you'll want to get up and tango ... and many others where you'll just feel good.This is a great introduction to contemporary Japanese filmmaking for those who might be under the impression that all Japanese movies are "heavy" and inaccessible. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's clear up one thing: "Shall We Dance?" is NOT "Strictly Ballroom". It's what "Strictly Ballroom" wishes it were. The creators of this movie absolutely and perfectly accomplish everything they set out to do in making this movie. It is charming, likeable, and funny in a way that I think only Asian cultures can produce. The only defect in this film is that its story is ultimately cliche and somewhat trite (of course, this applies to 95% of all movies made).The incredible awkwardness and discomfort of the main character as he enters the world of ballroom dancing in order to appease mid-life crisis is classic. The incidental characters in the dance class are appropriately humorous, and the focus is never really on the world of ballroom competition, but on the much more interesting and accessible world of human emotion and interaction.If you don't enjoy this movie, you haven't got a sentimental bone in your body. And if you don't end up thinking about taking ballroom dance lessons, you must have been sleeping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes "Casablanca" the great movie it is is that it doesn't try to tell the history of the world; it is not an epic; it is a perfectly polished little gem, "the problems of three little people" told exquisitely."Shall We Dance" is such a polished gem. Set in the Japanese culture where all dancing is suspect, a middle-class middle-management man who has lost the luster of his life sees a beautiful young woman looking wistfully out the window of a dance studio and, eventually, goes looking for her. He finds much, much more.Does infidelity ensue? You'll have to decide for yourself. What does ensue is magic, not Harry Potter magic, the everyday ordinary kind of magic that makes the world of us common people so wonderfully worth living.I've said enough.

		<shortDescription>At a Commuter Train Stop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shall We Dance? (Japan, 1996) opens to the tune of the same title, from the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musical and movie, The King and I. We are in a ballroom of the Blackpool Tower, England, home to a complex of buildings that host the most prestigious of international ballroom dancing competitions. A Japanese narrator draws a contrast to his own country:"In Japan, ballroom dance is regarded with much suspicion. In a country where married couples don't go out arm in arm, much less say, 'I love you' out loud, intuitive understanding is everything. The idea that a husband and wife should embrace and dance in front of others is beyond embarrassing. However, to go out dancing with someone else would be misunderstood and prove more shameful. Nonetheless, even for Japanese people, there is a secret wonder about the joys that dance can bring."Here and there, the wonder has been inspired by Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr from the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein film production. Other adventurous Japanese, by whatever means, have likewise been drawn to the ballroom dance floor. For Mr. Sugiyama, a middle-aged accountant with a wife and daughter, it begins at a commuter train stop where he spies a young woman looking out the upper-story window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing, and is captivated. This leads to lessons.Koji Yakusho is exceptional in the lead acting role. Tamiyo Kusakari plays the young woman from the window, who turns out to be a professional with aspirations to return to Blackpool. Reiko Kusamura is excellent as the very patient, somewhat older woman who ends up as the instructor of Mr. Sugiyama and his two nearly as clumsy male classmates.This is one of the all-time bests from among Japanese movies, particularly those of the non-samurai genre. Richard Gere starred in an Americanized version in 2004, but the Japanese original scores higher with IMDb ratings voters. If it suits your fancy, explore also the very funny Australian comedy-romance, Strictly Ballroom (1992).</fullReview>

Upon recent viewing, I find it downright charming more so than comedic although it certainly has several funny and amusing moments - mostly with the Mr. Aoki character, Shall we Dansu is charming in it's purest form. The movie seems to have a chance to stray into relationship and infidelity dramatic territory but nicely skirts the sleaze and takes the high road rather focusing on the job of dancing and the amusement involved with the Japanese reception or dissatisfaction of it. I enjoyed all the main characters, and the whole studio/dance development was very well conjured. Only the family scenes seemed run-of-the-mill, but this was intended to begin with. Mr. Sugiyama is especially well played as Koji Yakusho as stoic yet bumbling. The music adds to the class and atmosphere - this movie has a feel of throwback but manages modern charm. It's aged just fine in over a decade, and I enjoyed more on 2nd viewing than 1st I think. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and Meaningful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shall We Dansu delves into the clash between modern day desires and Japanese cultural traditions. Dancing, for men in Japan, is seen as an embarrassment so when our protagonist, Sugiyama decides to take dancing lessons he is faced with a problem. Sugiyama is a respectable Japanese man that works as a businessman and has a wife and daughter, so it is out of the norm for him to take dancing lessons. Sugiyama decides to take the classes in secret and also acquire a love for the dancing instructor Mai, in secret. Sugiyama lives a double life from then on but has a new found passion for life. Masayuki shows the humor of Japanese customs and how people must keep their lives secret to avoid humiliation.The acting in Shall We Dansu was the best part of the movie. Mr. Aoiki stole the movie with his sharp turns while walking as well as Toyoko with her negative outlook on life. The movie was light-hearted and funny while still holding a message, that you should follow your desires even if society finds them humiliating. Another actor that deserves praise is Mai. Mai played the role of a dancer who lost her passion very well and her stiffness added to the suspense of the movie. Her complete disinterest in Mr. Sugiyama made for an attention-grabbing movie since you never knew how the movie would pan out.Masayuki really captured all elements of the film and made all the loose ends tie together at the end. The film was funny yet meaningful and showed the battles of contemporary Japan fighting to break lose of its traditional ties. Shall We Dansu shows the passion for dance and for holding your own desire against societies expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The focus on body-movement in this movie eventually sensitizes you to the movements of the characters to the degree that you start to think they're all dancing, all the time. Then it hits you that they ARE all dancing all the time, from the positioning and repositioning of a group of workers in an office to something as simple as two people meeting on a staircase and doing the "After you!" "No, after you!" dance.The device transforms what is essentially a sentimental made-for-TV movie, suitable for Hallmark specials, into a brilliantly inventive piece of work. Quite amazing. Above all, the main character's transformation from inhibited businessman to daring ballroom dancer is made completely believable by the actor who plays him. The thought of coordinating the dance steps with the emotions is straight out of 1950s Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A sweet and totally charming film, Shall We Dansu? made me laugh and cry. At first appearance, Sugiyama-san was not terribly appealing--an uptight salaryman, seemingly devoted to his family, but all too easily captivated by a face in a window. The object of his obsession is distant and cold. But by the end of the movie, I was in love with him, her, his wife and daughter, all the dance instructors and dance students. This uncomplicated story of transformation and renewal is a little jewel that I would enjoy seeing again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film succeeds where Billy Elliot fails. It's surprising to see that the two films have the same starting-point, however, Shall we Dansu uses surprisingly little sentimental effects and integrates the dancing into the plot wonderfully. (Billy Elliot could have been about cello-playing as well.)The best part of the film is that you cannot really remember afterwards WHY you liked it so much. There are no separate scenes that will seduce you to think this will be a great movie. It's a typical example of the whole being MUCH more than the parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the second time in the nineties, a Pacific nation has produced an international hit about the joys of ballroom dancing, and much like the first time (Baz Luhrmann's Australian blockbuster Strictly Ballroom), this delightful film is full of hilarious flights of fancy, colourful costumes and boisterous music. Koji Yakusho plays a Japanese businessman who has everything a man at his age should have: a good wife, a strong child, a good job and a new house; problem is, he's just not enjoying it. There are just as many touching moments in this great comedy as there are funny ones, and at the end you just might find yourself calling up the local community centre to see where you can sign up for lessons of your own. But first rent the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shows how dance rejuvenates lost emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shall We Dance is an excellent film because it shows how something, like dancing, can rejuvenate the life flow in the human spirit.Dance is seen as the expression of existence, and the birth of individuality. The is certainly the case with Aoki. At work he is a humble office denizen, but place him on the dance floor and all his bottled up intensity is released. Surprisingly, this release is frowned upon in Japan, due to the rigid culture of conformity. At the start of the film, all the characters are ashamed or frightened of their desire to dance. They will be scorned, or deemed perverted, for expressing their passion through dance.This film is well worth watching to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions. It will leave a smile on your face for days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did you like "Strictly Ballroom"? You'll like this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film sounds very similar to "Strictly Ballroom" in that it deals with awkward people going into competition ballroom dance. In fact, there are quite a few things that will seem similar to someone who has seen strictly ballroom (rank amateurs and "crowd pleasing steps"). On the other hand, this film has the difference of dealing with Japanese culture, which seems incredibly uptight. For example, Married couples rarely make public displays of emotion. Which means dancing close to a stranger in a display of ballroom dance is really outrageous. One of the characters is "outed" as a ballroom dancer to be labelled a "pervert" by his co-workers. Also, this is less a love story than the issue of dealing with the joy of dance. A fun movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Movie of Japanese Attraction to Western Styles in Dance and Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shall We Dansu? is a very non-Hollywood take, but it does fit in with it's predecessors - "Roseland" (which spotlighted my college roommate's mother for 4 whole minutes as a Roseland devotee), "Queen of the Stardust Ballroom" and "Strictly Ballroom." In more conventional movies the klutzy dance learners are really Broadway dancers who miraculously learn and become dazzling. Here I think even the "instructors" were actors and there's no dazzle. Odder, the music sounds like it's out of a karaoke machine, like Japanese re-interpretations of Western pop music, which I think is the theme of the Japanese taking on this Western hobby as well. A bit is lost in our ignorance of Japanese culture and mores though the narrator fills us in a bit. (There's a great line where a contestant in the dance competition is disqualified after he interrupts another's routine. "Ungentlemanly behavior - this is a British sport after all.")It's such a relief when the soundtrack suddenly breaks out in "Save the Last Dance For Me" before it goes back to the slightly off-rhythm, slightly off in some way music. The dancers weren't dancing to the music either - they rehearse without music.Regardless, it's a wonderful movie and only music fans would complain . I cried at several scenes. It's quite unpredictable in its comedy and touching in very unexpected ways. The audience clapped at the end. It's very annoying that the credits aren't translated except for a few leads. Stay thru the credits, though, as the dancing continues.(originally written 7/23/1997)</fullReview>

If you are a ballroom dancer or have ever taken lessons, you will draw on that experience as you watch.This could be a good family film if the kids are old enough (12?) and can deal with the subtitles. You might have to explain why a wife would hire a private detective to spy on her husband. I would say this is a great date movie.

		<shortDescription>Cultural Awareness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many pervasive themes that exist within the Japanese community expressed in this film. From the very beginning, there is an accepted social and intuitive understanding of subtext within the culture itself, which is to say that everything is implied and nothing is direct. For example, it is subconsciously known between the communities never to say "I love you" out loud, that dancing is considered "socially embarrassing and for losers", and that husbands and wives sleep in separate beds. With all of these known yet not expressed social taboos, the lead character, Mr. Sugiyama, demonstrates his life within this community as a monotonous and rather robotic workaholic. He is a type of the many who suffer from the same dilemma.The people within the community attempt to disguise themselves from their true inner passions. As for the characters focused on in the story, all of them secretly love to dance. Sugiyama's coworker, Mr. Aoki, renders a very literal disguise of his love for dancing by dressing as a Latin clubber wearing a wig. Later in a conversation with Sugiyama, he expresses his embarrassment for dancing. He states that it is due to the fear of being found out by the office and the ensuing gossip which would then inevitably follow. In essence, the community presented in the film is a community that is subconsciously told to be afraid of being human. In other words, the humane aspect of their nature is being told to be shunned?to not express itself! Coming from a post-Communistic society (at least in various regions of the land), it is no wonder that the community suffers from a lack of expression. To "express" would go against what was once forbidden by law. It is evidence that such negative repercussions have still been ingrained in the community blood and will perhaps take years to completely divorce wherefrom. Even the word "dance"?the predominant form of expression?excites their souls on so many levels both literally and figuratively. The unspoken and renowned Japanese axiom seems to penetrate the very core of every character within the community: "There are fools who dance and fools who don't dance. Everyone is a fool so we better all dance." This axiom is the basis that holds the community together. It suggests that everyone is doing the "dance of life" whether they know it or not. How they dance this dance is strictly up to them and is constantly being observed. The word "dance" itself suggests many things?to express, to live life to its fullest, to overcome fear/anxiety, to standout and be unique and unprecedented, and many others. The heroes of the story are heroes in the viewer's eyes because they choose to dance regardless of how stupid they may appear in others eyes. This ideology forms the basis of the characters enduring through the challenges they face (i.e. the fat man being made fun of for his dance etiquette but continuing to dance anyway; Mr. Sugiyama determined to perfect his dance, whether at home, work or bathroom, despite being rejected by the beautiful dance instructor he hoped to impress). In closing, it is a community that seemingly fails in knowing how to dance correctly, yet continues to persevere such rejections and let downs. There is no right or wrong way with how to dance?it this idea that makes each of us completely unique and therefore irreplaceable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great movie, much better than the American version. To watch this movie is to care about all the characters, all so human and so vulnerable. All the performances are natural and totally believable. Tamiya Kusakari is absolutely exquisite as Mai - I couldn't take my eyes off her whenever she was on-screen. Her acting was amazing for a first-time performance. Sugiyama-san (Kôji Yakusho), a salaryman with a loving wife and daughter, is still in an emotional rut until he sees a beautiful woman gazing out window of a dancing school. Fascinated by her, he begins taking lessons with a group of misfits - but he can't get close to the woman of his dreams. Taught by an older lady, a sweet, supportive woman, Sugiyama discovers the joys of dancing for its own sake. Highly recommend this movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A middle-aged man keeps seeing the same lady at a dance studio across from the train tracks where he commutes to and from work. She's rather pretty, but there is something else about her that gets his attention. One day, drawn by his curiosity, he stumbles (literally) into the dance studio and reluctantly signs up for classes--not realizing he'll become hooked.This is a very unusual film that deals with a very mundane subject so well that I felt sucked into the film and really cared about the people--even though it is just about ballroom dancing. I am not a dancer and frankly I avoided this film because it just sounded so dull. The plot is simple--so simple you wonder how the film could be this good. Of course there's more to it than that, but not a lot. But the wonderful mood and the great writing made me really care about the people so much that I found myself cheering them on or laughing many times during the film. I particularly loved Mr. Aoki--the guy with the crazy wig and very outrageous dance style--though I really found myself caring about them all (even the nasty pudgy lady). Any film that pulls so much out of such a simple setting is a terrific film and well worth your time.</fullReview>

I've seen 'Strictly Ballroom', which was amusing, but this Japanese comedy is so very heartwarming, gentle and elegant that it's hard not to love it.The story of a bored accountant who finds pleasure in dancing is perhaps very simple, yet when one adds to this the Japanese cultural embarrassment of physical contact in public, it takes on a new light. The husband who learns to dance through affection for the teacher, the wife who worries he is having an affair, the work colleague who fears being discovered at the same classes... all are wonderful, rounded characters who draw the viewer into the story.Admittedly, the film won't stretch your mind or keep you on the edge of your seat, but it is an extremely pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. And I dare any viewer not to be touched by the daughter's request to see her parents dance together... :)</fullReview>

But I want to talk about the plot, which some people have dismissed even if they liked the movie. In an ordinary movie, you'd have a love story between the character of the businessman and the aloof dancer/instructor. But this movie is a lot smarter than that, because it really explores different relationships and asks what we need to be human.

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies in the World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instead of reiterating the many thoughtful statements about this movie, I'd like to add the following comments about how this film compares to the American version, in case you were wondering which to watch. I've seen the Japanese film (full length and cut) 4 or 5 times, including once in the original Japanese, and I've seen the American version twice. 1) The Japanese film is ultimately better as it stays with you for years, but I respect the attempt to make a fairly faithful Western adaptation out of a story whose heart depends on being Japanese. 2) A big difference is that the Japanese film uses dance as simply part of the story, while the American version relies on flashy music and more expert dancing to capture the audience, not trusting the story to work by itself. The Japanese dancing is more credible -- Richard Gere becomes a twinkle toes too quickly. 3) Both stories show how one middle-aged man deals with his feelings of being trapped in routine, by doing something difficult and beautiful: ballroom dancing. Although he starts out with a crush on a beautiful dancer, he soon moves on to dance for its own sake. But in Japan, ballroom dancing is much less acceptable. 4) Both films have great supporting characters and story lines, but the American version is more rushed and crowded. 5) The Japanese star is very reminiscent of Gregory Peck -- and even Richard Gere cannot fill those shoes -- but both are handsome and acquit themselves very well in their versions of this movie. 6) The Japanese film has a wonderful storyline about marriage that is more subtle and touching than the American movie version (where Susan Sarandon is too on the nose in some of her speeches). The Japanese wife of the man with a secret dancing life is a terrific supporting character. She moves from contentment to worry to sadness as she tries to figure out what her once reliable husband is doing when he stays out late. Her reactions add poignancy and depth to the entire story, and contribute to the final satisfaction with this movie. 7) Jennifer Lopez is NOT terrible in the American version. I've been watching ballroom dancing for many years, and enjoyed watching her in the American film. I guess she is somebody some people love to hate, but she has matured and here is elegant and credible as the competitive ballroom dancer. The Japanese dancer actually seems more like a ballet dancer than a ballroom dancer, but why quibble? Both women are lovely. 8) The American film has more memorable music, but the scene where the lead dances to "Shall We Dance" is delightful in both. 9) Watch the Japanese film first, when you are in the mood to get absorbed in the characters' lives. Then wait a few weeks to watch the American film, and watch it when you are in the mood to dance along. The soundtrack is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing, Poignant, Engaging, And Just Plain Charming. One Of The Best Modern Japanese Films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed on DVD and Streaming. To date, there are at least three movies out there with this title. Only one is Japanese. And it is by far the best of the bunch. It has become a classic "sleeper hit," probably more popular today than when first released in the mid 1990's. The main plot path is well worn: middle-age family man (Koji Yakusyo) seeking another turn at bat with an unattainable woman-in-a-dance-studio-window (Tamiyo Kusakari). By becoming an amateur expert dancer no less! The script delivers sufficient surprises and subplots to ensure the viewer's full attention. It also leaves no subplot loose ends, and provides feel-good happy endings all around (more or less). Directing, acting, camera, and music (not all of it is original) are first rate. So are the subtitles! In camera shots of the dance studio window from subway windows are especially well done. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.</fullReview>

No chance that, whilst being all of that the film would not also be realistic. True there is much sentiment but not false sentiment and the heartwarming moments are genuinely touching, nobody is tugging at the heart strings, we simply feel for the characters because they are so well drawn and we have become involved. Simple enough story describing a normal Japanese salaryman's gradual involvement in ballroom dancing but so well photographed and written that we find ourselves both laughing at and with the participants.

		<fullReview>Masayuki Suo has produced a melodramatic story set in Japan that features ballroom dancing. Neither would particularly appeal however the film is elevated by a combination of depth, comedy featuring Aoki San and scenes shot in Blackpool! The most impressive aspect of this movie is how all of the characters come to life. Nearly 15 years after its release, its only now that I have had the pleasure of seeing it.The story focuses on a man undergoing a mid-life crisis who spontaneously takes up ballroom dancing. The film proceeds to follow the characters who make up the dance class.I am sometimes amazed how we can interpret characters in a film just by their physical appearance. For example Tamako Sensei is the forgiving type of person that she appears! Also Macho is the sleazy type of dancer that he appears! They wouldn't need to do or say anything and I would still conclude the same.Pros - Every single thing plus Aoki SanCons - The score is occasionally heavy handedOverall - 11 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dancing: The vertical expression of a horizontal desire legalised by music. This quote may have been in the mind of middle aged salaryman Shohei (Kaji Yakusho) who realises that his life is unfulfilled as he watches dance instructor Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari) every night from his commuter train. In a moment of impulsiveness, he signs up for dance lessons to be near the sphinx like Mai. This might have been a movie about the budding romance between the somewhat improbably beautiful leads. Instead director Masayuki Suo focuses more on the excitement and passion of the ballroom than the attraction between Shohei and Mai, and makes a better, less predictable movie for it. Both the lead and supporting roles are played to near perfection, though Naoto Takenaka as the troll like Latin wannabe Mr. Aoki, shamelessly steals every scene he is in.Will Shoheis horizontal aspirations be fulfilled? Will his irredeemably dull wife discover his guilty secret? Will he go to the ball? You can be reassured that these questions will be answered to your satisfaction by the end of this endearingly sweet movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets better &amp; better towards the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning it seems a rather ordinary movie, but further on the characters get better &amp; better. The way the bond that grows between different people and the way they regard each other is expressed by the director is excellent. I would recommend it to anyone that is not a Hollywood fanatic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Near the end of the film, the aloof instructor says of our hero's dance practice, "It warmed my heart." That about sums it up. There isn't a misstep in the script or acting, though there are plenty of them during the dance lessons! It struck me, while watching, how sad it is that any culture robs its people of such innocent pleasure and renewed my appreciation that I live in a place where the pursuit of joy is applauded. The entire cast is marvelous, but Mr. Aoki (Naoto Takenaka) steals the show whenever he's onscreen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Family Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved how much of a family movie this was. I saw both of the Shall We Dance movies and I felt that JLo was being too seductive with a married man.The only thing I didn't like in the Shall We Dansu was that the whole movie was in Japanese so I had to read the subtitles fast to understand what was going on. Other than that, 2 THUMBS UP!!! The dances were so fascinating and I loved the plot of the movie.I believe that even though it was Japanese, people will love the movie all together and want to watch it over and over and over again. I'm even amazed that this movie isn't very popular.Rent that movie and wish to see it again with the family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet film about personal growth/happiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nice glimpse into Japanese culture and how they can be more reserved than us (at least in terms of physical contact) and cross-gender contact.I thought the actors, including the supporting cast were fantastic. I was a little worried about the focus of the movie as it started out w/ his boredom &amp; attraction to Mai. Obviously the main character was the focus but I even felt for his wife and really enjoyed the scenes with the older dancing teacher and the private eye. As others have mentioned, Aoki steals the show whenever he's on camera. In general I enjoyed the film for the character growth - not for any particular scene. I was happy to see that this wasn't a "romance" movie, but something much better than a trite rehash of overdone plots.P.S. I'd like to respond to an earlier post. Shall We Dance (1937) w/ Rogers &amp; Astaire is a completely different movie. It's a musical with a completely different plot. Just 'cuz the name's the same - doesn't mean it's the same movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful quite comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a delightful quite comedy about the heartache of a man who discovers something he really loves which of course is frowned upon. Even though it is subtitled nothing is lost as it slowly blossoms. Well worth watching with nothing offensive, so it is suitable for all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice lingering shots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the assets of this film was the directors willingess to linger (and linger and liner) on some shots. Very refreshing, in a medium where shots are so often economized, to establish a point and then move on to the next one. A very nice sense of realism was rendered by this technique. Otherwise, the film was just better than mediocre. Some "humourous" scenes were rather slapstick,, but not that hard to live with within the overall pleasant aroma of the picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever danced? For most the simple answer is yes, and then of course we each like to add either our stories or explanations. For women these stories are usually pleasant, either their first dance at school, or they actually had dance training when they were younger. But for men, the tables turn. If they had ever danced, they usually say they were forced into it, that it was "only for a little while" or that they simply hated it. We all know that dancing cannot possibly be that horrendous or painful, then why do so many men find it necessary to cover-up their dancing, especially if it was out of personal interest. Now, imagine yourself in a society where dance is socially forbidden, not in any shape or form, not between husband and wife and most definitely not out of personal interest. It is considered shameful, embarrassing ? but it is an escape, a way to enter an alternate universe of your life in a split second, would you do it? What if dancing forced you into secrecy and as hard as you tried to deny it, it became your passion. Would you let dancing go because of society or would you keep it close to your heart forever, if your heart deems it necessary?Mr. Sugiyama was a successful Japanese businessman, a "salary-man" who stayed late at work and went out with co-workers afterward, a custom necessary for your success within a company. Usually coming home late, he knew that tomorrow was going to be the same as the day before and the 20th day from now; his life has been set for him. On the train on the way back home he notices a young woman looking out a window on the top floor of a building. She catches his attention immediately and after many debates with himself, over several days, he decides to come see her, only to find out it is a dancing establishment. He gives it a chance nonetheless, and once he finds Mr. Aoki, a fellow co-worker, hiding behind a wig at this same establishment, he starts to gain confidence and awareness that maybe it is alright to enjoy dance. He becomes engrossed in it, disciplining every aspect of his dancing whether on the train or even at work, and dance gives life to him, showing in simply the way he rides his bike. Yet Mai, the woman who first caught his attention and an instructor within the school, has seemed to lose this passion that he just found for dance. It takes one dancing competition, in which Mr. Sugiyama participates and Mai instructs him, for both of them to face their fears, define their personal meaning of dance, and determine what is truly important and necessary in their lives. Maybe not everyone can relate to dancing, but there may be something that each of us has in our hearts to do that we are simply forbidden. Moreover, I believe this picture correctly portrays the passions of humankind, the lack thereof, and the effects of both on the human being. The director allows us to see Mr. Sugiyama's transformation, how Mr. Sugiyama first develops his passion for dance showing no longer just at the dance school, but everywhere else, at work and at home. In contrast, the director shows Mai, an almost stoic woman who has this opportunity to dance and yet it no longer brings life to her. The acting is wonderful and we are left wondering what it is that happened to her and whether Mr. Sugiyama will continue to dance. However, something seems to be missing in this film. I believe the director could have given more life to the picture itself, especially when representing something so expressive as dance. It may be that factor that I have danced before, but other than some short scenes at the beginning or end, this picture lacked an artistic aspect to give life to the passions of those involved. There is only so much that a storyline and acting can provide, and the artistic element fills in the vacancies. For me, the director failed to do so, both within the dance studio and during the competitions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: accessible &amp; interesting comedy / drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me by admitting that I am an action film buff. And I'm not into swing dancing. So a drama / romance, especially a foreign film (I'm from the USA), about dancing is not me at all! In fact, I have no idea why I even rented this film.But I liked it. While I don't like dramas or arty films (too subtle or sappy for me), I found "Shall We Dance?" accessible. The characterization was interesting and the film was not slow-paced. Similar to "Living Out Loud", it's a very original romance that will not just go to an inevitable conclusion. There isn't a lot of gut-busting humor, but it's sweet and certainly worth some smiles.Finally, again similar to "Living Out Loud", the film has something to say about getting through life's down times.Who should see this film:-- drama / romance types-- foreign film lovers, this one's a keeper-- people like me who don't mind intellectual films if they're not too arty or slow-paced, this one's safeI'll give "Shall We Dance?" a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>charming and funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a nice, funny little movie that one forgives it all sorts of flaws. The characters are quirky and amusing, there are many effective scenes, and Naoto Takenaka as Mr. Aoki is incredibly funny. The overall experience is very enjoyable, and I recommend the movie.What keeps this from being a truly great comedy is a laziness in character development in motivation. Now, some things might make sense in Japanese society that wouldn't make sense here, like actually being able to disappear evenings and weekends without your wife saying anything, so I won't complain about that. But other things in the movie are just lazily sketched out. Mai's attitude change in the movie comes almost out of nowhere, and like a lot of movies Shall We Dance relies on the fact that people have seen certain plot elements so often that they will accept them as valid even if the movie makes no real effort to explore a character. It's a pet peeve of mine.But it doesn't ruin the movie, because it's funny and likable.I was pretty surprised to see in the movie that dancing was frowned upon in Japan, since I'd heard swing dancing was quite popular there. I asked my swing dance teacher, who is from Japan, and she tells me some dancing is popular among the young, but it's done more as a sport or physical activity than as a social dance, and people stop when they get older and it's not really proper to dance again until you're old (she said it's fine to dance if you're 75). I'd be curious to know if this movie had any effect on that attitude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant But Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pleasant, but overrated, film. I'd wanted to see it for a few years. I got the character and acting performances I'd hoped for, but the writing, and to be more picky, use of sound, leave it a lesser film than it could be.To be sure, this is a pleasant, mostly clean, and likable film. Its basic plot within the maleness of Japanese culture is a definite hook: the secure, middle-aged nice guy is drawn to a fetching face in a dance studio that his quiet person would never normally consider. He encounters that face, along with a few stereotypical, but fun, "losers." Meanwhile, equally likable Mom and daughter long to see him happier. The movie is photographed well, if paced a bit slowly.But perhaps a comparison is in order. "Pretty Woman" isn't the likes of "Citizen Kane," but it does well what it's supposed to do: create a light-hearted reality in which we come to care about the characters. Some great acting--and good writing--drive that home. This is what "Shall We Dansu" should do. Instead, it creates some very serious concerns on the viewer's part, taking you away from the fun that should be the film's bottom line. For example, the wife character and the issue of infidelity are treated seriously enough to leave you talking to the screen: "What about this," and, "What about that?!" But the film clearly isn't such a message piece. Also, when certain meeting of the hearts take place, with potentially serious ramifications, there isn't adequate resolution. Finally, the fun that does exist is mostly "hit-and-run," with only momentary giggles that could be fun on a grander scale. Considering the characters and acting involved, that is a shame.The use of sound is distracting. Though the music in a dance film can certainly be given liberties to roam, some choices here are just odd or undercut the humor and romance that could be achieved. In addition, some of the music and background sound are so low as to take the viewer right out of the atmosphere of a scene--think dance hall with live music at a level that's little more than the hum-drum of an office. Also think of humorous music and sound effects from romantic comedies you've loved--perhaps enhancing a facial expression or an embarrassing moment--and then think about them without those clever twists. That's what you have here.In the end, this is a movie you want to love with characters and actors you can embrace--and you can, but only to a point. And that's what leaves it frustratingly short of its potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie yet, though it's been recommended to me and I look forward to watching it on DVD.But I thought I should point something out because a lot of people seem to be comparing the newest version (Richard Gere) with "Shall we Dansu" and referring to "Shall we Dansu" as the original.The Japanese film is NOT the original, and it has had several incarnations, as a search on IMDb.com will tell you. The original was way back in 1936, starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.If there are differences in how the film is paced and the social implications of dancing in the Japanese version of the film, that may be true, but that is not the original writing...rather, that is the Japanese ADAPTATION.Nonetheless, I enjoyed seeing Koji Yakusho in "Kizuna" with Ken Watanabe and look forward to seeing him in both "Shall we Dansu" and the upcoming "Memoirs of a Geisha".I don't know anybody who's seen the original SWD, but a lot of people have told me the Japanese one is very good. They are all done as romantic comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's . . . tedious. (Or, Where's Godzilla when you need him?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you look up the definition of "tedious" in The Cinematic Unabridged Dictionary, don't be surprised to find the movie poster for Shall We Dance as part of the entry. This Japanese offering from 1996 revolves around a point of Japanese culture, an aversion--a taboo really--to ballroom dancing. Unfortunately, it is no more interesting than watching a movie where the characters enact a plot in a culture that avoids eating mushrooms, or disdains golf. One character, a bewigged runba dancer tries to save the show by stealing it, but falls short. As this two hour (was it four?) hour production dragged on, the female lead often was seen looking longingly out a window. I hoped beyond hope that she would suddenly look horrified and shout, "Look, it's Godzilla!" No such luck.</fullReview>
