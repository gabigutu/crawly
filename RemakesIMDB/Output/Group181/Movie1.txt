		<fullReview>I caught this on channel 4 very late , or very early considering how you think of 2.40 am and discovered that it was another Creature Feature movie production . I knew what to expect - Slightly corny and old fashioned B movie values but one that at the very least would be watchable , and I did enjoy the previous effort SHE CREATURE . After the credits rolled I did feel disappointed . HOW TO MAKE A MONSTER while not being a bad horror movie made for television it remains a ratherflawed one The story suffers from a lack of originality and stereotypical characters . A trio of software designers are told there's a million dollars reward if they come up with the ultimate computer game . The trio are a funky black dude , an uber-geek and a sociopath . Since there's a danger of industrial espionage there's special security measures that causes a lock down on the software laboratories . Doesn't this sound contrived ? And I think you know where this is heading . So the trio , an intern and a company director find them selves trapped in a building in a plot that isn't a million miles removed from ALIEN , HARDWARE or THE LAWNMOWER MAN . Unforgivably it becomes very obvious early on who's going to die and who's going to survive meaning there's no surprises for the audience Like most of the other movies by this company there is a comic book charm to the proceedings in that the gore doesn't overwhelm the story , I notice that several people have complained about the laughable make up and effects but surely this is done on purpose by the makers ? Despite having a TVM budget it's relatively well made , but would have been better if the script wasn't so predictable . As it stands if you're going to watch only one Creature Feature watch SHE CREATURE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible. Just terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen. Even for a TV-movie, it's bad. After throwing all shreds of realism out of the window (3 programmers creating a game in a matter of weeks?), they have a few short action sequences before bringing the movie to a close. It felt like some scenes has been cut out of the movie, as Laura immediately going back on her decision was unlikely, to say the least. Horrible acting, bad video game sequences (it felt like Doom or Quake by the graphics and gameplay, which was probably the idea), and a fundamentally flawed idea made this go from a bad movie to a terrible movie very quickly.I wouldn't recommend it, in fact, I'd recommend just about anything else if you were to choose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another enjoyable offering from Creature Features.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thrilled to see that the second film in the CREATURE FEATURE line up HOW TO MAKE A MONSTER,delivered the goods. It is very different from SHE CREATURE. For one it is set in a modern,current time.I love good horror shows ,and was a fan of TALES FROM THE CRYPT. I missed not having something on T.V.that fit that bill besides reruns.But I must say that TALES always sort of seamed like the same show,these CREATURE FEATURES, so far, have put together two films that look nothing like each other. The direction is solid and it has a fun camp begining that turns into some pretty gruesome horror. What can I say ..I liked it a lot...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I have several movieland people I follow because what they do is pretty interesting. I have a (much larger) list of people that I follow casually because they show promise, or have done something interesting in the past.This little TeeVee movie popped up because it has three people on the second list.George is still a hamfisted director, but he started life with a film about film. While unoriginal, it showed what interests him. Such folding in film interests me too. Here he wrote a story about something similar, the folding of film into "real" life and both into the virtual reality of a game. Been done before (the best is "eXistenZ"), and there isn't much new here except for the fake moral on which he goofs.The notion of the building's floor plan being the same as the game's dungeon was nice.The second person on my list is Colleen Camp. Former party girl and cheesecake actress, she is an example of someone who worked her way up from buttwiggling to producing. And she has a history in folding as well. "Clue" is my favorite of hers. Here she is the producer of the movie and appears in character as the producer of the game, and with precisely the same charter. She's red here. I'm sure that the insert of goofy nudity was her idea, and another fold: breasts with attitude controlled by others.Clea DuVall strikes me as a particularly intelligent actress. She's the real murderer in "Identity" and the real victim in "Thirteen Conversations" both pretty interesting experiments in novel folding. She knows what she's about, and can annotate her own character which tends to be shy. She could have been the secretary in "Secretary."The final fold here is that she inherits the characteristics of the four people she "interns" for. Cool word that, and it provides the final twist, which I think may be more clever than it appears at first. Especially given who the new intern is.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Speaking as a game developer in real life, this was about the funniest movie I've ever seen! Here you have a Triple A title being developed by three guys (one sound guy, one AI guy and one weapons guy) along with a business manager and an intern. Bwahahahahaha... Oh my.If you know anything about PC hardware, you'll get a really good laugh about their "mainframe" and the rest of their "high tech" equipment. Their server room is a huge closet right out of the 70s and it looks like a rack of video cards and Cat 5 cables hanging there in disarray. Oh, and I love the fact that their entire network and game assets can be backed up on a single CD-ROM that takes hours to run a restore with... Priceless.This movie could have seriously, SERIOUSLY benefited from a technical advisor. I'm sure any self-respecting game developer would have been happy to consult in exchange for lunch with Julie Strain. Odd, too, that Julie has contacts at Ritual Entertainment, who developed FAKK 2. I'm sure they would have consulted just for kicks.Silliness aside, this wasn't all bad. It's a cool concept... Julie Strain is still nice to look at. Clea Duvall does really well, considering what she has to work with. Tyler Mane was also very cool and there's some pretty good costuming, sets and gore as well.This is no Citizen Kane, but it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half if B movies are your thing. If you're an IT professional, you will absolutely LOVE this movie! But you'll see it as a comedy... This would be great entertainment at an IT professionals conference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, Great Sci-Fi flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this on Cinemax last night, and LOVED it! It's the story of a computer game company which hires three maverick programmers to finish and enhance the "Evilution" game. However, Sol(the guy who develops the game's A.I) fills it with virtually every evil he could download, and a power-surge brings the program to life, causing it to construct a cybernetic-zombie body, and seek to kill the programmers, the intern, and the project boss! A very interesting and well-done sci-fi flick, with a clever script, cool effects, and good acting for a made-for-cable film! The characters are flawed but likeable, especially Tyler Mane, as "Hardcore", who is hysterical! The film also has interesting philosophical points to make regarding greed, competition, and what it takes to survive and succeed in the computer industry, and what the definition of a true "monster" is... better than a lot of theatrical attempts at sci-fi I've seen the last year or so. Five out of five stars! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun B-movie for video game geeks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After sitting through four of these distinctly lacklustre 'Creature Feature' movie remakes that were made for television back in 2001, it pained me to watch the last, HOW TO MAKE A MONSTER. Each film has an interesting premise and plenty of potential, but these elements were usually wasted in favour of the mundane. HOW TO MAKE A MONSTER isn't a perfect film by any means but the key difference is that it's actually entertaining for once. From the word go, the story of computer nerds accidentally bringing a monster to life is a lot of fun, with plenty of larger-than-life characters and humour to keep things amusing; I went through a video game stage myself as a teenager (and have probably never really grown out of it) so much of the on-screen antics are also appealing.Ironically, the first half, which is as usual the set-up, is the most interesting, before the second turns into a traditional monster-on-the-rampage flick. The low budget is evident in the use of one single set and the lack of any CGI effects, but the monster itself is a fantastic-looking beast that manages to scare. It assimilates body parts in a similar way to the Jamie Lee Curtis-starrer VIRUS and looks horrendous, which is the point. I loved the sword-and-sorcery edge the film has to it with the use of swords and axes rather than the weaponry which the usual clichéd soldiers-vs-aliens flicks have. The climax plays out as you might imagine, with a moral epilogue of a twist as well, and I sat through it all and found it amiable enough.The cast is fairly interesting and wide-reaching for what is, in essence, a B-movie. Clea Duvall, who I found intensely irritating in the likes of THE FACULTY, is actually passable here; Steven Culp is the established actor of the piece but makes little impact. The three guys playing the nerds are having a lot of fun and are all fine in their parts, with particular note going to Tyler Mane, he of the massive build; Mane later went on to play the hulking hero Ajax in TROY and Michael Myers in Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN remake. There's also a topless cameo from scream queen Julie Strain, which is the closest this film gets to modern-day B-movies. It's no masterpiece, but I think it achieves what it set out to achieve, which was to create a B-movie for our times with similarities to '50s flicks with added here-and-now updates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it's good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a geek, you'll be laughing your batman socks off watching this. It's great to watch for the old skool gear (green screen palm pilot anyone?)and horror genre references (thumbs up for the 'tales from the crypt' pinball machine). Much of the dialog involves faux techie jargon - guaranteed hilarity for the most part. For instance;the intern character trying to impress her boss by asking how she can compress 9 gig of video data. I can only guess that she had a bootleg copy of LoTR she wanted to upload.The plot premise is a delightful hotch-potch of elements from 'Tron', 'Weird Science', 'Hardware', 'Lawnmower Man' and references various other sci-fi films such as 'Wargames' ('It's learning all my moves').Probably one of the worst films ever made, but that's if you expect a serious sci-fi film. If you're bored of on-line hack 'n' slash for the night and want a film that's unintentionally hilarious to wind down with, this is one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for What It Is - A real life version of a video game cut-scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, first off, I'd like to say that all the negative reviews that think they're being funny by tearing into a low budget sci-fi horror movie are like the bullies who pick on the fat retarded kid. Sure, we all snicker a little bit, but nobody's impressed with your rapier wit dissecting the flaws of someone less fortunate than you.That said, they do serve a purpose...they let you know what kind of film this is. By having a few amateur Ebert's out there talking about how this is the worst movie, ever, you know you're not looking for a truly serious movie. Otherwise, even if it was bad, they would not have bothered to show up and try to be internet wise-guys.I really enjoy this movie and will stop and watch it whenever it is playing on TV. It's a cheap, funny, wildly inaccurate movie about a video game company that accidentally makes a monster when a lightning strike causes a motion capture suit become imbued with the AI of what would surely be a controversial game lambasted by the media for it's violence and gore.The characters are overblown, but they were written (rather well) to be so. The actors do a good job of portraying those characters in an exaggerated fashion. Tyler Mane (Hardcore - Sabertooth/Xmen, Ajax/Troy) is the muscular metal head, Karim Prince (Sol) is the cocky, geek-suave black guy, and Jason Marsden (Bug) is the geeky white guy. All fit some type of stereotype and play a 3 way foil to each other. Clea DuVall (Laura)is always welcome in this kind of role, the quiet, cute for a geek girl. Her abusive boyfriend is even played by Danny Masterson (Hyde, That 70's Show)They worked together before in The Faculty, where the size of their respective parts was about the same, I'm curious what the connection is.Anyway. Like the title says, this movie is basically a film version of a video game cut-scene. The plot's not airtight, the characters aren't deep or dynamic, and the production value's not high. But we suspend disbelief because it makes the experience enjoyable. Many people have commented on the inaccuracy of 3 guys making a triple A title in a week or so, but that was not the case, they were modifying an existing engine, and in the beginning of computer game development, the biggest games were still made by small teams in short time-spans.I don't know why I'm even trying to mend plot holes, because that's NOT the point. The point is, if you like old video games, cheap horror/sci fi movies, or better yet both, you will love this movie as much as I do. It reminds me all over of games like DOOM, Quake, Heretic, Hexen, basically the progenitors of games like Halo and Call of Duty (which have made video games more profitable than the movie and music industries) If you're too immature to appreciate the simplistic technology that made those games (and thus all games) possible, you probably won't enjoy this movie, either. So sit back, dig in, watch it while you download an emulator that will let you play all your favorite games from Middle and High school.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a low budget b movie with lots of holes in the realism. Right off the bat you can spot lots of things wrong with the main logic of the whole movie. i.e. guys having only 4 weeks to complete a game (a ridiculously short deadline), the "computer suit" that goes on a killing rampage and has the ability to move despite the lack of any stable structure, the entire idea than an electrical surge can endow something with free thought "just because". But you can basically look at the movie box and figure out this is a movie that you shouldn't take too seriously.It's a low budget, corny fairly predictable movie filled with bad acting, but it is fairly entertaining, and that's what matters afterall</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cheesy good time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"How to Make a Monster" is a fun and really entertaining cheesy creature feature.**SPOILERS**Desperate to fix a new video game, Peter Drummond, (Steven Culp) assigns intern Laura Wheeler, (Clea DuVall) to fix the game's problems. Rounding up renegade programmers Hardcore, (Tyler Mane) Bug, (Jason Marsden) and Sol, (Karim Prince) to fix the game and are given a month to do so. Several weeks of attempts later, they all have ideas for improving the game only for their feelings for each other and their egos to get the better of them. As they near completion, they attempt a go-round to determine what final changes need to be made. Trying to get it finished, they take off for the night and come back the next morning to find one of the group members is dead. Carrying on in the need for money, the remaining members find that the death is the result of the monster created for the game coming to life through a power-surge and is killing the group. Forced into a struggle to get out alive, they turn to different strategies to defeat the monster.The Good News: This one's not all that bad. Considering the source material, this here manages to get a lot of mileage from it. From the constant video-game play-through to the images achieved through the game and all the background into the business, there's a lot of it and it makes for an interesting viewing. Another great aspect is the interesting monster created. This has a unique back-story, however contrived, and uses a pretty good creepy look to great effect. This one even gets a decent transformation sequence where it manages to acquire more parts and weapons to make it even more frightening. With the spiked horn, shoulder spikes, large frame and huge blades, this one is quite impressive and frightening at times, and with the real scary face, this one scores some great scenes from it's appearance. It's even quite creepy without the monster, as there's some really great stalking scenes early on to be had, due to a plethora of off-screen noises and crashes to get some jumps in. The deaths, though not at all that elaborate, do feature enough blood and gore to satisfy. The last half-hour is the film's best part, as it features a lot of action, some big chasing and stalking and is it's most watchable part. That's the best part of the film, and alone is worth the watch.The Bad News: There's not a whole lot wrong with this one. Most of this one's flaws result from one area, namely the cheapness of the film. Even though the film is filled with computer graphics, there's still plenty of really cheap graphics. It's nearly impossible for them to become fearful of the images generated from the creature, or even the simulated games. They look like computer games, which is great but they don't look good or convincing in an actual movie. It looks quite terrible, doesn't generate any scares or suspense and takes away a whole lot of whatever good it accumulated in the positives. The cheapness also extends to other areas, as the boring beginning, cramped location and lack of any big moments not done without using CGI all attest to. It does pick up considerably with it's great fight, but there's a real shortage of big moments in this one. There's even a real shortage of kills in here, as this one really doesn't have any real deaths on-screen. The number is incredibly low, making the lack of any real blood or gore a real shortcoming. Featuring bloody aftermath and blood splotches during the few kills done on-screen is nothing really spectacular and only serves to make them more noticeable. They are the real flaws in the film.The Final Verdict: It's a clichéd, cheesy creature feature yet that doesn't mean that it won't entertain. Give it a shot if you're in for some harmless fun or have a particular love for these kinds are encouraged to give it a shot, while those who have a disdain for those types should stay away from it.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and Nudity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How not to make a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Culp portrays on of those money loving executives that would think Swimming with Sharks is a masterpiece of how to make it in the world. His opinion, that you have to knock other people out of the way to make it to the top and that making it to the top is the only reason to live, is also the thought of the movie. Since I disagree on both counts, the movie is not worth my time. Culp is good as the shark among guppies, but the high points end there. Clea DuVall and Jason Marsden are wasted in wussy roles while Tyler Mane is very tall and muscular. If you like girls with ungodly large breasts who aren't very attractive, Julie Strain obliges. To make matters worse, the f/x are laughable and the gore is blah. This is really only of interest to lovers of bad movies or people with warped world views.</fullReview>

I recognised Clea Duvall's Boyfriend from "That 70's Show" and I figured that I'd seen Hardcore possibly as a wrestler - he was Big Sky in WCW and also Sabretooth in X-men.The film was incredibly predictable (apart from who'd stolen the back-up disk) and it was pretty obvious Clea Duvall was going to survive.One thing I wasn't sure of, whose head she'd seen when she was thrown down the hole (I assume it was her boyfriend or Hardcore?).</fullReview>

If you're a computer geek you'll probably be chomping at the bit to nick-pick it but many of us watch movies to be entertained, and I have to say this movie was GREAT, imo.

It's a little bit nostalgia and a little bit action. I guess you could say it had a good underlying message, which you'll see in the end... pretty predictable though.

		<fullReview>Very low budget TV movie about a group of game designers who are confronted by a killer demon that comes to life from a game they are developing. They are picked off one by one. Essentially a one-set flick, MONSTER has little to recommend it. It cops its title from a 1950s cornball monster flick, but otherwise has nothing to do with that long-forgotten film. The only recognizable name in the cast is Clea DuVall, who gives it her best. Tyler Mane, who played a villain in some of the X-MEN movies, here plays one of the developers. Unfortunately, he can't act to save his life. Some gore might have helped, considering this is a quasi-slasher flick. Alas, there is no gore to be found.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How To Make a Monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creating the scariest game comes with a price..and we witness this when a group are put to work on "touching up" a video game which doesn't scare or thrill children who play it. Evilution, where skeletal armored creatures do battle, is supposed to go to market soon and it's up to Drummond(Steven Culp)to get the right associates on board to fix the numerous problems keeping the game from truly adhering to the addictive requirements associated with kids and their parents' dollars. Intern Laura(Clea DuVall), a naive, meek, sweet-natured chick who sees the world through rose-colored glasses, interviews three programming geniuses, all with their various short-comings..Hardcore(..the hulking Tyler Mane)a bit too intense/intimidating with an extensive knowledge of weaponry for "battle games", Sol(Karim Prince), a narcissist who loves the sound of his voice and enjoys informing others of how brilliant he is, and acne-faced, speed-speaking, stuttering nerd Bug(Jason Marsden)who is a whiz at producing sound effects. With a promise of a bonus(1 million dollars) to any of the assigned group who can create this game on time for market, the war begins with each individual often at odds with each other. But, their competitive nature will indeed be tested when an electrical current "brings to life"(..Bug has an explanation, but it's in "geek-speak", so I won't bother elaborating extensively)a telemetry suit used by actors for the game characters. The computer is controlling the suit, and the computer is playing the game so the cast are being targeted as if they were characters in the game. The suit actually uses body parts from a few of the victims to form a hybrid and those left try to escape the best they can throughout the well-secure building..but, thanks to Bug's mishap, the doors are slammed shut with limited means(..crawlspaces)of retreat as the creature hunts for them. Along the way, Laura learns a lesson on greed and the evils of the world. A twist yields a surprise regarding the back up disc, the remaining members are seeking, which contains the entire game.Yes, this is as wacky as the premise sounds, but if you can somehow look past this there's some fun to be had here. I thought the cast did what they could under the circumstances, playing it as straight as they possibly could. Still, the film has a grim view of human nature, leaving us with a transformation of Laura when it's all said and done that's kind of a bummer. There's some truth to her logic regarding the dog-eat-dog world we live in, that she learns from her boss, Drummond. The monster suit is a wild concoction of metal, wires, and body parts. Not overly gory, but some heads are removed and blood splatter. The computer effects are rather underwhelming. I think the casting of DuVall succeeds..she's the normal eyes of what is transpiring, but her battle with the creature at the end is hard to take serious, even if you cut your brain off. Food for thought..perhaps the title has a two fold meeting regarding Laura's metamorphosis?</fullReview>

The brief is they need to turn 'Evilution' into a really scary game in one month, if they succeed they will earn a $1 million bonus, Clayton also gives them intern Laura Wheeler (Clea DuVall) as a general dogsbody. How to Make a Monster then cuts to 'Three Weeks Later' as the game nears completion, Hardcore has designed the weapons &amp; monsters, Bug has developed the music &amp; sound effects &amp; Sol has programed a new form of artificial intelligence while Peter does what bosses do. One night a lightning strike causes a power overload which in turn makes a motion capture suit come to life &amp; start acting out 'Evilution' as if it were real. Peter, Laura, Sol, Bug &amp; Hardcore all become targets of the killer game &amp; it's robotic suit...Written &amp; directed by George Huang I personally thought How to Make a Monster was a very poor attempt at horror. The script has no relation to the original How to Make a Monster (1958) apart form it's title, there are so many things fundamentally wrong with this film it's untrue. The whole concept sucks &amp; Huang obviously doesn't know anything about technology as How to Make a Monster has no factual basis or notion of reality at all, motion capture suits coming to life? How can it walk &amp; operate before it kills Sol? How can the mainframe computer control it with no visible wires? Radio control, I don't think so. Only three people to program one game? These days it takes dozens of talented programmer's to develop a good game &amp; a hell of a lot longer than a month. I could go on, but I won't. The title How to make a Monster refers to the films hidden meaning, the moral message if you will. You see How to Make a Monster is all about people turning into monsters because of greed, jealousy &amp; ambition. I bet Huang thought he was really clever coming up with that double meaning title. The characters are uniformly unlikable &amp; clichéd, Sol &amp; Bug in particular are highly irritating to endure. Technically How to Make a Monster isn't too bad considering it's TV limitations, director Huang fails to create any sort of tension or atmosphere which is what a good horror film is all about. The kills are all off screen &amp; have no build up whatsoever, when at the end it finally looks as if we might get a decent sequence involving the monster the film keeps cutting to awful in game computer footage, maybe to save money? It breaks up &amp; dilutes any sort of excitement the climatic fight might had, very poor. There are a few computer game/film references, an Evil Dead video game poster keeps turning up in the background, a Tales From the Crypt pinball machine &amp; a scene where the monster rips someones head off complete with dangling spinal cord which obviously is meant to pay homage to Mortal Kombat &amp; it's infamous gory 'Fatalities'. As a whole the violence is restrained with the aforementioned head &amp; spinal cord ripping, another severed head &amp; a cut off hand. The monster itself as it adds bits of human bodies to itself looks pretty cool but is barely used, it's past the 40 minute mark before it does anything. The acting is poor from all involved &amp; watch out for actress Julie Strain who complains about having to go nude, again considering her other work I suppose director Huang thought this would be a funny in joke of some sort. It isn't. Overall there really isn't anything by which I can recommend How to Make a Monster &amp; in actual fact I think it should be retitled to How to Make a Monstrosity of a Film. One to avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, How could Clea Duvall every agree to this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of B movies but this was absolutely terrible. I only rented it because I think Clea Duvall is a great actress. I think the movie is trying to make a point but the only one I got was that you need to be utterly ruthless to make it in the gaming world!?! ***SPOILER ALERT*** Basic plot is three game programmers, a manager, and an intern are locked in an office building with some electronic suit that comes to life because of electricity. It proceeds to kill everyone but the intern who all of a sudden develops sword fighting skills and kills the monster. Clea Duvall is the intern who starts out as a nice girl with an abusive boyfriend. But for some odd reason she turns into a money hungry software company boss. I think there is a plot somewhere but I got distracted by a wrestler trying to act like a computer geek. Anyway, the movie is a complete waste of time and even Clea Duvall's great acting can't save the movie. Oh and someone needs to tell Julie Strain she doesn't look good topless anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Samuel Z. Arkoff is turning over in his grave.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of "How to Make a Monster" (1958). One of the producers is Lou Arkoff, son of Samuel Z. Arkoff. It has none of the charm, originality nor good writing of the original. Ed Wood had written a script, back around 1955, for his good friend Bela Lugosi-- Bela was to have portrayed a makeup artist who makes real life monsters. It was eventually turned into an AIP movie. In 2001, AIP was making remakes of 10 of their old movies. This remake turns the monster into a video game, and the film seems to appeal to computer gamers only. The movie is dedicated to the memory of Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson, founding fathers of AIP-- it is not a fitting tribute. My advice: watch the 1958 original, and skip this turkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some bad but entertaining pulp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie obviously doesn't take itself very serious, which is the reason why this movie still remains an entertaining one to watch. The movie is filled with some extreme stereotype characters (you know, the kind that's so over-the-top that it misses its mark and looses its effect) bad dialog and an of course silly concept and bad written story to begin with.It's especially hilarious to see how more important the game, rather then their lives is to all of the characters involved. Even real freaks aren't that freaky! That's a serious and gruesome computer-monster that is killing them one by one in a horrible way but who cares when a game its development and a million dollar bonus is at stake...They just hide the bodies and go on with their work for as long as they can.But to be honest, the ridicules concept isn't as poorly developed or handled as you would expect from a movie like this (even though of course the movie is obviously filled with some highly unlikely and ridicules events.) I liked how well the game-world translated into the real world. Yes, that really is how PC games looked like in 2001. Guess people will have a good laugh at it in 10 years from now. The in-game effects are certainly better looking than most movies ever normally try to bother to.Seems like they seriously did some research and were advised correctly and spend some real money on it. It's certainly refreshing and good to see after so many failed and just plain bad attempts from Hollywood to let video-games- and the computer world in general play key parts of the movie.However big problem with the movie remains that's not scary or serious enough for a horror, not science-fiction/fantasy-full/original enough for a science-fiction movie and not bad and/or campy enough for successful cult-classic. It is also hard to tell what the movie actually tried to achieve and in which category it wanted to be put under. Because of that all, the gore also doesn't work out. I mean, the movie is pretty gory in parts, since it features more than 1 cut of limb or head but yet the movie just never strikes as a gross or gruesome one. For these reasons alone you just can't regard this movie as a successful- or great one.Still amazing to see how many great actors are in the movie. It's however an uneven balance of actors who knew that they were cast for the B-movie value of the movie and actors who try to make the movie look as authentic and realistic as possible. Tyler Mane and Jason Marsden are great as the stereotype characters but it was quite sad to see Clea DuVall. I mean, I see this as an actress who will most likely win an Oscar within the next 7 years. Same goes to some extend also for Steven Culp. He's the guy who played Robert F. Kennedy in "Thirteen Days" for goodness sake!The movie is definitely not a great one but nevertheless it remains an entertaining one to watch, since it obviously also didn't took itself very serious to begin with in the first place.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swimming with A Monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Swimming with Sharks" was one of those great 90's movies. It was my first real introduction to Kevin Spacey who just lit up the screen with his performance. The director of that film now brings us "How to Make a Monster." In the same vein as "Sharks," HTMAM is all about the downward spiral that happens when people are trying to get ahead at any cost. This story, set in the world of video game development, throws in the very reality TV element of a million dollar prize to the designer who can push a new game over the top. While everyone's competing and fighting over the money, a creature begins to pick them off one by one. It kind of dawned on me days after watching the movie that the creature represented the designers -- as if their id became manifest -- and began to kill, fueled by what was secretly inside each member of the group. Not to get too philosophic, but watch this movie and you'll see what I mean. This movie makes a lot of statements about consumer culture, targeting violent games for kids and the American fascination with becoming an overnight millionaire. But forget about all of that. At its core, HTMAM is just a good ol' monster movie with lots of biting dialogue, good performances and some tasty horror sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So so 're-imagining'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't really bear any relationship to the original (fun) AIP film, but it does share some of the campy humour of its progenitor. Sadly this straight to cable effort, the second in Creature Features overhauls, is not as good as their take on She Creature. The film starts out promisingly and has a decent cast headed by the always good Clea Duvall and the fun Tyler (X-Men) Mane. Unfortunately it runs out of inspiration after the first half hour and devolves into another slash and burn affair with poor special effects and a paper thin (and dull) tale of mortals being chased through a locked building. By the time the film delivers its heavy message at the end you'll have lost patience. Coming from the director of the acerbic Swimming With Sharks, this is a bit of a let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Metaphor of the Real Business Life Wasted in a Silly Screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four web designers and a trainee are gathered in a computer company for a challenge: if they succeed in developing a scary game within a month, they will earn a bonus of US$ 1,000,000.00. The group does not have sense of teamwork and all of them are moved by greed only, generating an uncontrolled monster and being destroyed in the end. The trainee learns how to become a monster worst than the existing one, wins the prize and becomes a businesswoman. I believe the intention of the writer of this story was to create a metaphor of the real business life. The title `How to Make a Monster' has a double sense with the creature and the trainee. There are many messages between lines in some dialogs and situations. Unfortunately, although having reasonable special effects in the movie, the screenplay is very silly and is only recommended for killing time. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): `A Criaç?o de um Monstro' (`The Creation of a Monster')</fullReview>

The "monster" was cheesy and the violence was dull. There was no scary moments at all. And I think the characters' favorite words were "s***" and "f***". This is one of those "late-night-HBO-movies that they show because there's nothing else" kind of movies. Please, don't waste your time watching this crap-shoot. I did.

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise, "Programmed For Damage!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At a glance this film may seem just a time-filler, but to be fair....While not fresh in originality, How To Make A Monster is a nice diversion from the crop of films out there recently that seem to depend on star power and rock tunes to carry them. This entry in the Creature Features series seems to be what Full Moon was trying to attempt in its hey day if it only had the slightly bigger budget.Basically, several computer game programmers with clashing egos are hired to expedite the release of a new game called Evilution. In the process, a power surge and system overload bring a motion suit to life and the computer then is literally playing the game out with the programmers and office staff, and it's kill or be killed with everyone trapped inside the building.There's a fair amount of suspense, a few twists, and a lot to say about greed, arrogance, and the lessening value of being just plain nice. The special effects mainly consist of the creature, and all else is done rather modestly which helps keep the story on track instead of being bogged down with massive digital effects. The only sad thing is that this film seems to say that in the end, it's dog eat dog and you might as well forget about trying to be nice to anyone. The title of the film aptly applies to the transformation of Clea DuVall's character as well in the final scene.Everyone plays their attitudes to the hilt (to quite an annoying level at times), and some may be put off by the excessive language but things move along rather swiftly so you don't dwell on that too long. I was hesitant at first to view this because I was concerned that it was going to be a Julie Strain "breast fest" (as if she's not getting enough exposure being married to the editor of Heavy Metal Magazine, or should I just call it Heavy Strain Magazine?), but her appearance was minimal. And yes, her "big guns" made the required appearance to satisfy those who just have to see them. That part was not as gratuitous as one would think, and even the violence is just enough without getting ridiculously over the top. Overall, it's a satisfying experience and entertains as intended which is a good feat when you consider how so many bigger Hollywood productions that actually got theatrical release first seem so empty and aren't worth the purchase price on DVD.I'm not a video game fanatic and don't know much about computers, but you don't have to be a whiz to be entertained by the subject matter in How To Make A Monster. While not a masterpiece, it's a fun ride and one of the better bets in the sci-fi/horror genre lately on home video. Not a cerebral experience like SESSION 9 or DONNIE DARKO, not as serious as BELOW, but something you can sit back with a ton of junk food and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes. I liked the film. I have to admit "How to make a monster" is going into my video or (hopefully) dvd collection when it is available to buy. But I have no illusions that this is a brilliant film. I have no illusions that it is genuinely scary. I have no illusions that the actors actually thought they were doing something worthwhile, especially as one of them refers to it as "our crappy little film" whenever he discusses it. After you see the film think "i want to be a yes" and you'll know who I mean ;). Don't get me wrong - the actors were the best thing in this film. Tyler Mane, Karim Prince and Jason Marsden as the computer nerds were brilliant, but they are virtually laughing in almost every scene!~ I can ignore obvious computer illiteracy, unnecessary nudity, and gore and violence, but only up to a point. I would have been laughing too.It is mediocrity at it's best, and the most worrying thing is that it could have been so much more. Less gore, and more psychological motivation. No nudity and this film could have had a PG rating... being much more suited to a pre-teen audience intellectually. More humour towards the end could have preserved this film in my mind, as it was, I was disappointed with pretty much everything. But also surprisingly impressed as well. I had never had high hopes for the film, just some light entertainment in moments of boredom, and it delivered that well, at least.The high points were the humour, unfortunately not carried through to the end, the actors, and the title.I have just spent my words insulting a film I have a admitted I liked, so I am a girl of contradictions. Let your evil motion capture suit come get me ;) :p</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure if the movie is meant as a serious horror movie or if it is some kind of joke.The game looks cheesy as Hell. Only blind morons could produce such a lame game.The publisher know the game sucks, so they hire 3 (THREE) guys for 3 weeks (as far as I remember) to fix "the monster". I guess the movie producers have no clue how long it takes to make a game these days. Nevermind the rest of the game, just fix the monster. If they get the job done they get $Million (again as far as I remember). Insane amount.The scene where the "programmers" enter the company for the first time and the intern walks in the Heavy metal programmer dude thinks she is a spy. Why?? Whyyy?? - One guy is assigned to weapons, and has loads of weapons, like swords and stuff on his desk. HAHA, so lame.The nerdy programmer is in charge of sound, and is actually not a programmer, but a sound guy. Oh well, almost the same thing right?? - A some point the company the security system kicks in and rooms a sealed off and the can't get out of the building. Must be expensive to install such a system, and.....whyyyy? - One of the programmers is doing an AI chip for the game...Hm...so this chip is shipped with the CD-ROM? Will it fit in an ordinary PC?? :) Why does he need a special chip for AI? Will he be able to get a factory to produce this chip with 3 weeks??? I seriously doubt it.The lightning makes the suit come alive. How does the suit move? It records movements when humans wear it, but has no servos or anything to make it move by itself. Arghh....!!! - The ending where the intern has gone evil, is just overdone. One of the worst cases of overacting I have ever witnessed.Even though it should earn a vote of 1 because on paper it should really really suck, I enjoyed it a little because it is so silly. It becomes a sport to spot the many flaws. I gave it 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The message of this movie is to destroy anyone in the way of your greed. The main character is unclear throughout (are the programmers the most important in the script? Is it the boss? Maybe the intern? All of them??), then suddenly at the end you find out the whole story is about only one of them.Worse yet, that character goes from a GOOD character in the start of the film, to totally pathetic. A reverse transformation.Despite the terrible acting, laughable story concept, and disgusting message of the writer's script, somehow, unbelievably, the plot, dialogue, and character development manage to suck even more than everything else in this downright pitiful made-for-TV trash.Well, then again, if you enjoy movies that completely cliche the business industry and utterly skewer the truth of video game development, then hey, you're in for a joyride of totally misinformed, brainless delight!But for the logical-thinkers, don't waste your time; keep flipping through the other HBO channels and choose something that would get at least a 2/10 rating; or better yet, just turn off the TV.Personally, I find it horrifying that 37 people gave this movie a perfect score.</fullReview>

It's not to be taken seriously, so what if the technical stuff is wrong, we are talking about a movie that gets a quick laugh from a woman jumping up and down naked...buy it for a cheap price and crack it out when you need a quick laugh, or a good Clea DuVall fill (that is, if you don't watch But I'm a Cheerleader, Wildflowers, the Faculty, or the Slaughter Rule first)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay this movie has a big major flaw. The term overlord cannot be used when refering to a an EVIL creature from hell. I believe the correct term would be underlord. Maybe when they fix the name of the evil machine they can start to work on the awful plot line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tyler Mane is the greatest actor ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>----slight spoiler-----As a die hard Tyler Mane fan i forced myself to see this . Although he is the third name listed , Tyler's character 'Hardcore' does not get nearly enough screen time. the movie is about 3 unconventional programers who take all the evil of the world and put it in to a videogame creation. Hardcore, is the weapon (designing) expert, who keeps actual weapons in his office. If you've seen him in Scorpion king, and Joe dirt, you'll know that his screen presence alone is worth the money. the scenes where he is fighting with the other programmers, perfecting his art on the computer, or even his finally bloody scene with he actually tried to fight the monster, show that Tyler has the potential to be the next great action hero. I diden't stop watching after he was cut in to pieces (athough i turned off the sound and covered my eyes, for about 10 minutes). the ending leaves you with a sense of personal stregnth, and a powerful message about the true meaning of self worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to sound critical or anything. BUT! There are way too many glowing reviews for this film. People acually seem to think this is as scary as Suspiria. Anyone who actually seeks enjoyment from this film outside of a so-bad-its-good-attitude is a cinematic masochist. Anyone who finds this movie scary has emotional problems.Are we so deprived of good horror movies (or bad ones for that matter) that we have to accept this as scary? SCARY? The acting was scary and that's about it.I think we should crucify Tyler Mane. Hardcore? A computer geek named hardcore? Something wrong here? I mean we all the other stereo-types to make a good crappy horror movie, why did they put him in there? Did anyone try to act in this film? Even Clea DuVall (whom I enjoy very much) seemed to meander through the scenes reading her lines with all the zeil and emotion of a UPS truck.Another problem I have with the reviews of this movie is everybody seems to think it's so original. ORIGINAL? I'm sorry to insult your IQ (actually I'm not) but exactly how many machine-built-for-good-turns-evil-kills-everything-computer-withamindofitsow n movies have there been?The real flaw in this movie is that it takes itself too seriously. The director really thought he was making another Alien. Hence the "claustrophobic" environment. Monster creature running around a small area hiding and killing obnoxious crew members one-by-one seems to be the real theme. Problem, Alien was original in its time. Also, it had good writing, good acting, and characters to care about.But back to the taking itself too seriously part. Besides a few pre-monster shenadigans by the nerds, the film plays it straight. Bad move. Really there is nothing to take seriously about this movie.What's scary about bad writing, sloppy direction, wooden acting, and a plot that's been worn out since the 80's? Absolutely nothing. Unless you have a need to watch a movie you need to make fun of all the through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, in a word, BITES! I agree with a previous comment. These are computer geniuses and they don't think to unplug the stupid suit before they leave? The movie starts off very slow with no point. Abruptly in the middle we switch to a blood and gore horror flick with no point. The action is too close together and too much violence that need not be there. And the end, when she holds up the blood spattered disc. That is SOOOO tacky. Like who wouldn't wash the blood off? Well, they did make a monster. A monstrosity of a movie. But you'll learn, intern. You'll learn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just a bad low-budget would-be horror film. I felt sorry for Clea Duvall and the others involved. Lame predictable plot. Laughable when it tries to get serious with its morale at the end. If you liked this you'll love Hardware (1990) with Dylan McDermott fighting a similar looking cyborg monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it was better than i thought it would have been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first off the best part of the movie was Tyler Mane i think the numour also had a helping hand in making it good.the movie is about a game development company who are trying to make the scariest video game available at first they fail to do that and the team who are working on the game are fired and a bunch of odd balls are brought in to replace them. the team of replacments consist of a computer programming genius and a music expert and a weapons expert(tyler mane).they start working on the game and next thing we know they start fighting every now and again with each other like one time (which i thought was funny)the guy who`s in charge was talking too the intern and she looked at the security monitor in midconversation and said ``oh no they`re at it again`` and you saw (Hardcore-Tyler Mane) having a fight with the computer genius.it is little pieces of humour like that ,that i like when watching a movie instead of a strait up comedy.in between the fighting amongst themselves they work on the game and a flash of lightning hits the powr supply box out side and causes a kind of overload in electricity and the game starts to take control of a specially built suit which the programmers use to mimic the movement of real peole and puts it into the game (when you see the movie it will make more sence) anyway the suit if you can believe it comes alive and kills one of them and uses they`re body to get better control of the suit.anyway what happens after that is they find out that the only way to beat the suit/game is to play the game and win. if i tell any more there will be not much point in watching it so go watch it you may enjoy it :).rating for this movie 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only bought the film because Jason Marsden and Steven Culp are in it. I will admit, it was a terrible movie. But I was highly amused by it. I was laughing all the way through. I was doubled over by the company being named Clayton (and if you know things, you'll get why). And I absolutely love Jason. His hyper and insane antics in this film entertained me to the end. And had I known that a song by Poe was incorporated into the film, I would have sought it out sooner.All the main actors were perfect and wonderful; The score was fun. I know it's supposed to be scary, but I can't help but call it a fun movie. I feel that if they had given more time and money into it, by using the same actors and script, it could have looked much better than it does. I think that's what people mostly have qualms with, the quality of it. Think; If it had been given the thought and care that, let's say, Thir13en Ghosts got, it would have been just as popular as that, and vice versa.Now, I didn't think it was totally obvious at all. I wasn't surprised by the end, but I didn't predict it all, either. Maybe I'm just stupid, or maybe it was 1:00 in the morning, or maybe I just hate you, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Good for a laugh - whether it be at the witty lines or the 'special effects' - no matter who you are.So for the movie as a whole - 3/10. Sorry.But as for the acting and the actors' execution of lines, 10/10.Be amused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this was the only movie from the 5 episodes that was cool and spooky at the same time. This film is about computer software designers and an intern that face a monster that has come out of the video game and attacking the building. It is up to the company to fight the monster before they all die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING SPOILERS*****...A remake of a classic bad movie of the Fifties, this one is about a new videogame that instead of making big bucks for its programmers get a live for itself and start killing out people. Usual stuff, with a really boring first half and a so-so second part, with several twists in the script, trying to capture the essence of business (be a shark or be eaten), that not always work. The better part is the Julie Strain cameo (ah, the Goddess...) as the model for the videogame character (in fact, Julie was the heroine of the game F.A.K.K.2, based on the movie Heavy Metal 2000).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uneven effort from the wonderful director of Swimming With Sharks and Trojan War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this flick last night on cable and forced my girlfriend to watch it with me because I'm a really big fan of Swimming With Sharks, Huang's debut effort. I've been told that this is a remake of an old Hammer classic, but I can hardly see where much more than the title remains. What started off as a fun take on the videogames industry slowly turned into a bad Full Moon horror flick (ARCADE comes directly to mind), then reverted back (uncomfortabaly) to corporate satire. Huang revisits many of his previous themes (the innocent intern/assistant having to become cold-blooded to succeed, people willing to do ANYTHING to get ahead, etc) here, but it really feels like a rushed effort. The cast is well placed however, and this film IS watchable, especially when it's on TV anyway. I hope Huang can move on from these themes with his next picture, and move on to golden pastures. I really like his style, I just feel this flick was a step back, instead of forward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad, bad, bad, bad movie. George Huang seems confused about what type of movie he's doing. The first half is all fun and games, with over-the-top performances and silly banter. The second half turns oddly violent, with people getting beheaded and skewered. Then, to top it off, Huang throws in a theme of "people are evil" at the end. I don't get it: what am I watching here? Oh, I get it. It's a MESS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite decent acting this movie is pretty worthless. if you know anything about computers you'll laugh yourself silly as the makers of the film obviously don't. But, besides the nitpicking the script is just terrible (theres a scene that just consists of the characters realizing their predicament and uttering an expletive - the same expletive no less for about 5 minutes) and the ending is muddled and morally sententious. Not gory enough for gorehounds, not campy enough for b-movie fiends and in general just too boring for everyone else. A decent concept is wasted in the process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it's good?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this movie on HBO last night while flipping through the channels. I missed the first few minutes so I didn't know what I was getting into but the computer gaming theme intrigued me. First off, why is it that when Hollywood makes a movie with computers as a key plot device they always get so many technical details wrong? I may be overreacting since I'm such a computer geek, but this always disturbs me. That being said I think this may have skewed my opinion slightly in a bad direction. I was completely taken by surprise though when the movie turned into a horror flick (again I didn't see the promo and missed the beginning so I didn't know what I was getting into). To me, the acting was subpar although I did enjoy Tyler Mane and Karim Prince a little. #SPOILERS# Also it was quite predictable that the intern would use her video game skills to defeat the monster since we had seen her beat all the programming gurus earlier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...because it becomes obvious in a big hurry that they have never used a computer in their life. The cast assembled to play the programmers is funny enough, but what really gets this viewer laughing is how much arguing goes on about various aspects of the game they are programming. Or the deadline set by the money men. A team of three programmers will not be able to code a complete game, especially not one with all the advanced routines talked about, in a mere four weeks. If you have any doubts about this, check out the list of people responsible for putting together Doom, at the time of release considered the most advanced video game ever made. It took a lot longer than four weeks for that dozen-plus crew.By far the most amusing part of the film is the scene with Julie Strain in a so-called motion capture suit. Anyone who has seen the spandex monstrosity that Andy Serkis wore during photography for The Two Towers will recognise this scene as utterly ridiculous. That Strain (the one depicted in the film) would not see this for the idiotic hustle that it is defies credibility. I find it difficult to believe that the other actors didn't read this script and absolutely balk at it.There is also a reason that most films do not depict things involving a computer without fictionalising it. If one watches what the user does for any length of time, it becomes boring in a big hurry. The problem here is that none of the sequences filmed in order to compensate for this have been thought through. When Clea DuVall is sitting before a computer with VR goggles, trying to fight the game's monster, the number of times she takes them off and puts them back on again is ridiculous. Given that there is no connection between any of the computers and the ridiculous flesh-machine construct, exactly how this solution is meant to work defies belief. You can claim infra-red wireless networking until you are blue in the face. It wasn't in common usage even in 2001, and as anyone who has tried to use it can tell you, calling Wi-Fi networking unreliable is like calling Ed Wood slightly incompetent.Given that the cast includes such B-level stars as Clea Duvall and Tyler Mane, I think the fault for the stupidity of this piece lies entirely with the screenwriters. The cardinal sin anyone can commit when writing a story that involves computers as a central basis for the plot is to overestimate the capabilities of the modern CPU. Giving the computer the ability to learn tactical points would require more storage space, and processing power, than even the most modern supercomputers are able to muster. Every single observation from experience would have to be stored as a programming note, and most home CPUs would turn into a steaming pool of goo trying to look them up.Not to mention that it seems a modern malady that programmers mistake "more enjoyable" for meaning "more difficult". There gets to be a point where you can only do the same thing in a game so many times over before you want to rip the disc out and hit it with a hammer. The modern law, as I put it to game programmers, is that if you have a choice between making a shorter game or making one that feels impossible to win, make the shorter game. The scenes at the beginning with the children telling us how much this game sucks could really apply to any video game made in the past ten years, with few spectacular exceptions (Resident Evil comes to mind).I gave How To Make A Monster a one out of ten. The reasons for this are numerous. It is poorly-researched, poorly-written, and poorly made. Mystery Science Theatre 3000 would have a field day with this turkey. When the highlight of a film is Julie Strain jumping up and down, well, I don't think I need to say more.</fullReview>
