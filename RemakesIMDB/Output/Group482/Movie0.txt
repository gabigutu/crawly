		<shortDescription>Attention: do NOT watch Vanilla Sky before watching this first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly due to the lack of availability of 'Open Your Eyes' in Australia (until now) I saw Cameron Crowe's 'Vanilla Sky' first. Too bad. 'Open Your Eyes' is the original and best version, and would have impressed me even more if the surprises in the plot hadn't been ruined for me by the remake. So I strongly urge you to watch this movie first for maximum impact. It's a real killer, and especially recommended if you are a fan of mind-blowing movies such as Frankenheimer's underrated 'Seconds', Cronenberg's brilliant 'Videodrome' and 'eXistenZ'), or have read a Philip K.Dick novel or two.Eduardo Noriega (star of Amenabar's previous movie, the taut, suspenseful 'Tesis', also worth a look) is much more believable than Tom Cruise as the increasingly baffled protagonist caught in a never-ending nightmare, and Penelope Cruz's performance here is subtler and more appealing than her reprise of Sofia in Crowe's overblown and self-indulgent remake. Alejandro Amenabar has made three excellent imaginative thrillers in a row, and looks like being one of the most potentially exciting directors currently working. 'Open Your Eyes' comes with my highest recommendation. This one is essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Vanilla Sky" turned out to be a moderate success and scored great reviews by most critics, and I liked it myself. But if you compare it to this film, there's almost nothing different! But of course, it's all Cameron Crowe's fault and not the fault of the director of this movie. Luckily, I haven't seen "VS" in a while, so certain surprises in the plot still intrigued me. And I was intrigued throughout the film, I think even moreso than with "VS." Tom Cruise is a fine actor, and I have nothing against him. But I always appreciate seeing unknown actors (at least they're unknown to me; I don't live in Spain, so they might be superstars there) give fine performances. The actor who plays the main character in this film as just as effective as Cruise. He is an extremely attractive man and knows how to express a plethora of emotions. I've never been a big fan of Penelope Cruz's work in the states, because her English still isn't great and that clearly shows in the mangled expression of her dialogue. But in her native language she shows great talent. And since I find her much more attractive than I used to, I'm more appealed by her in the looks department. Plus, as a man I must reveal she has a great nude scene in the film. One element of the plot that I don't think Crowe's "VS" expressed as well was the jealousy between the handsome main character and his best friend. I was able to connect with that portion of the story, since I have a best friend like the main character who's charming girls left and right, while I (the average guy) have virtually no appeal to the ladies. I know what it's like to possess that sort of envy, and so do the average guys all around who see handsome guys doing the same things we do, but get more favorable results just on account of their good looks. The film also expresses the theme that no matter how many times most attractive men claim their looks are of no importance to them, if their looks were one day to be stolen from them, they'd lose the will to live. I'm sure if I saw "Vanilla Sky" after this movie, I'd enjoy it a lot less. This is sheer proof that the general American public is too lazy to read subtitles. Because if you were watching the DVD of "VS" and switched the language channels from English to Spanish, it's the same damn movie! And now I feel sorry for the director of this movie, since he's the genius behind this genuinely original story, but Cameron Crowe comes along and takes all the credit. I am not one of those grouches who hates remakes, but if you're going to remake a film, put your own spin on it! Don't take all the original ideas and conduct it with different actors! And wait a couple decades for God's sake! "Open Your Eyes" was released in 1997 and "VS" only four years later. So unless you're illiterate, please see "Open Your Eyes" before you even consider "Vanilla Sky"!My score: 8 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishing....and really depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Go see this film. Now. I'll wait. Okay, this film is truly one of the most excellent mixtures of genres I have ever seen. It will leave you truly moved, truly surprised, and truly depressed. That's okay, though, because this is such a wonderful movie. The film centers around the life of a rich and handsome young man after a disfiguring accident. We are taken along as he tries to find a way to grow accustomed to a life without the things he relied on (mainly looks) before. After hitting rock bottom, things start to get better for him, and it is here that the seamless weaving of genres occur. I don't want to give too much away, but the film constantly keeps you on your toes and never grows dull. "Abre los Ojos" is a truly stunning love story, psychological thriller, and science fiction film all rolled into a flawless whole. Do yourself a favor and see it before the Cameron Crowe remake, "Vanilla Sky", does to this film what "City of Angels" did to "Wings of Desire".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind-bending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Abre Los Ojos" is one of the most astonishing movies I have ever seen. It's so full of astounding twists that it constantly makes you sit up and wonder what the next shot will bring you. At the same time, you keep wondering if a movie with so many twists will be able to tie everything up at the end, but Amenabar and his co-writer manage to do just that, in a reasonably (if not perfectly) satisfying manner. Eduardo Noriega's acting is so good it's beyond belief, and so is the "disfiguring" makeup. Pair this off with "The Game" for a truly mind-bending double feature and see what cinema should be like more often. (***1/2)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So superior to Vanilla Sky that you have to see it to believe it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How I wish I had seen this film before seeing Vanilla Sky. There is so much subtlety, so many interesting ideas in this that have been butchered or simply lost in translation in the Hollywood version. The ending of Vanilla Sky pretty much explains everything... Abre Los Ojos leaves most of it up to interpretation and the viewers' imagination. Upon my recent second viewing, I realized how many hints there are towards the twist in the film, and how many ideas and subjects for good discussion that are in the film. The direction in Vanilla Sky seemed fine before, but in comparison, it's really daft and unimaginative. The majority of the good stuff in VS is stolen directly from ALO. A lot of it is changed to fit Hollywood's standards(and we all know how... high... they are), and the authenticity of the great idea is almost lost through this. This is the third Alejandro Amenabar movie I've seen(the other two are Thesis and The Others), and definitely my favorite so far. Not many films can catch and keep your interest even when you've already seen a (bastardized and cheaper) version of it already. I couldn't take my eyes off it. Like Amenábar's other films, this is slow and deliberate(whereas Crowe's version, in comparison, seems somewhat rushed, trying to get to the end as fast as possible, despite being a full half hour longer), and it really works to the films benefit. The music is wonderful, and it fits perfectly in every scene. The mood and atmosphere of the film is great. The effects are excellent... by comparison, those of Vanilla Sky are overly flashy and obvious. Here, they're beautiful and very subtle, like the rest of the film. The cinematography is very good, and far superior to that of VS. I realize that this seems more like a comparison between the two films than a review, but I can't seem to find the words to express just how great this is. See it for yourself. And in the name of all that is good and just, see it before you even consider watching Vanilla Sky. I recommend this to fans of intelligent films and/or Alejandro Amenábar. This is quite probably the best film he has made so far(though I haven't seen Mar Adentro yet). 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD -- Also brilliant analysis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many previous posters can't seem to get past the "it was just a dream" ending. Fair enough, but what's important here is that the dream is *created* by Cesar. As Duvernois tells him, the virtual reality is set up to show him what he wants to see. Thus when his life takes a turn for the worse, it's because he wants it to happen that way. The question is, why would somebody who had the opportunity to create a perfect life turn it into a nightmare?The solution lies in the shallowness of Cesar's character. He is a totally self-centered individual, a man who depends on his money and looks to get him whatever he wants. Metaphorically, he is the man in his dream in the opening scene -- alone in an empty city of his own creation. His friendship with Pelayo is in name only. His claims of "love" for Sophia are, at least at first, just as shallow - inspired by pictures on a wall, and easily tossed aside when Nuria offers him a freebie.Why, then, does the dream go bad? Because once Cesar's face is disfigured, he sees that Sophia only loved his outer beauty. He sees that money can't buy him happiness - it can't even buy him a new face. He sees how easily his "best friend" turns away from him when the going gets rough. And Cesar is never able to resolve these issues while alive - indeed, he chooses suicide to rid himself of the pain. But just as our dreams show us truths we'd rather not face, Cesar's dream brings back these questions in the form of contradictions. What if he, like Sophia, fell in love only have his lover reappear as somebody he didn't recognize? (In his case, Sophia switched for Nuria.) What if only he could see how ugly he really was? Cesar's dream goes bad because he wants it to go bad -- as he is trying to figure out the "reality" of his physical life, he is also probing the reality of his soul.I found this to be a fascinating movie, not despite the ending but because of it. Like this year's Mulholland Drive, the film examines the way we construct our dreams both to hide reality and to better understand it. I give it a 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We See Only What We Choose to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some movies that due to their complex nature defy one interpretation and can't be pegged into a certain category. Much has been said -- in fact, entire books have been written -- about Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO which started as a routine thriller to turn into something completely revelatory.OPEN YOUR EYES (ABRE LOS OJOS) falls into that vein of films and in doing so establishes Alejandro Amenabar as one of the most original writer-directors making films today. Here is the story of Cesar (Eduardo Noriega), a spoiled rich kid who lives in a swanky loft apartment in Madrid, Spain, and who carries an apparently no-strings-attached sexual affair with Nuria (Najra Nimwri), but who one night falls hopelessly in love with his best friend's girlfriend Sofia (Penelope Cruz). Nuria in a jealous frenzy decides to take matters into her own hands and literally drives Cesar into an accident where she dies and he wakes up, his face disfigured beyond repair. His life in shambles, Sofia beyond reach, and virtually a freak of nature, he decides to take one last step in regaining his lost life... and here is when the film becomes something totally unpredictable.Amenabar is extremely clever in weaving together elements of very different genres in a way one would never tell when it moves from one to the next. In doing so, there is no way one can ever second-guess what may or may not be the next step in this very intricate story that has to be seen at least a second time, and here is where the wonderful suspense lies -- one that would have had Hitchcock beaming with a smug smile in seeing someone had got it right after he had created (and redefined) suspense film after film. Stunning, maybe a little complicated for some, OPEN YOUR EYES will really make you open your eyes and pay attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just great entertainment from beginning to end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the plot is confusing at times, a second viewing helps to untangle the convoluted story about dreams and reality. Most of the time we are not sure if what we are watching is really happening or whether it is a profoundly disturbing nightmare. Cesar (Edouardo Noriega) whose head is badly fractured in a high speed car crash quite understandably has blurred recollections of events involving his good buddy Pelayo and his girl friends Sofia and Nuria. As his doctor explains: In dreams characters are often substituted, one for the other.There is much I like about this film. First of all I like the script. The dialogue between Sofia and Cesar at first meeting and afterwards is so natural, so believable. The four main characters are absolutely charming and have a rapport between each other that is rarely seen in films. This is either good casting or good acting, or maybe a bit of both. As the story unfolds we are completely absorbed. This is true entertainment on the highest level. O.K. we may not be fully cognisant of what is happening at times, but we glue ourselves to the screen expecting that an explanation will come in due course.There are some chilling lines e.g. Just before Nuria steps on the accelerator: "Do you believe in God?"There are some mysterious questions put to Cesar e.g. "Who is Eli? You called out 'Eli...Eli' while you were dreaming. Is she a girl?" No such person. What then? The mystery deepens.There is quality photography in the film. The rain in the park. And before that the reflections of foliage flashing in the car windows with glimpses of tense faces.The make-up team too does a great job On Cesar's handsome face. What a transformation!On top of all this we get a lesson on cryonics and the possibility of immortality. What more do you want for your money?Take it from me. This is a film you must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with no reservations and was pleasantly astonished by it. I advise anyone else to do the same; it is not like the Matrix, it is not like Hitchcock, it simply exists in its own right.The film attempts to be at least two movies in one. Unlike numerous attempts in the industry, it succeeds elegantly. I was drawn into the first part, the character portrait of the wealthy, shallow young man who undergoes a startling change... and then found myself swept up in a keenly sympathetic, psychological suspense film. Part of the success of the story is that it is centered primarily around several young, uncomplicated characters. In Hollywood, such characters in suspense films are usually knifed up within the first few pages of script.I don't look for anything positive in the upcoming American remake, incidentally. This is a film with depth and yet simplicity, truth and fantasy. It is a pure pleasure to watch, and it simply can not be improved upon without becoming gaudy and confusing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abre Los Ojos is much better than Vanilla Sky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched Abre Los Ojos. That prompted me to then rent Vanilla Sky. I relate that only because the order in which you see these movies is important. Specifically, by the time I saw VS, I knew everything about the story, and there was no longer any sense of unraveling a mystery that is an important part of these movies. But that is not all. On almost every score, Abre Los Ojos is the better movie. First the acting. In ALO, Penelope Cruz is sweet, loving and heartbreakingly beautiful. Reprising the same role in VS, she struggles with her Spanish accent, and there is absolutely no chemistry between her and Tom Cruise. Also, her character in VS repeatedly engages in a strange kind of smart-alecky banter that is not funny and is just plain misplaced in this movie. And yes, I hate to say it, but Ms. Cruz is nowhere near as attractive in VS as she was in ALO. Watch the movies back-to-back and the difference is startling. As for the other characters, I thought the spurned female role was better done in ALO. The actress who played Nuria in ALO conveyed a palpable sense of desperation and sadness, but also vulnerability. When she kills herself, and tries to take Cesar with her, it's believable. Not so with Cameron Diaz's portrayal of that same character in VS, who comes off as a spoiled tramp whose decision to kill herself seems like a hissy fit. That may not be all her fault. For instance, during the critical scene where she kills herself and tries to kill Cruise, Diaz is forced to utter dialog that is dopey and distractingly vulgar. Nuria has more grace, and more depth. Tom Cruise is not a terrible male lead, but the Spanish actor who played Cesar in ALO is much better suited for the role. He is younger, and portrays youthful arrogance and insouciance perfectly. There is also an innocence about him that Cruise can no longer do. Especially physically. At times in VS, I was thinking more about Tom Cruise's weightlifting regimen more than the mental anguish of his character. Unlike the crippling sadness of Cesar, Cruise's character is a turbo-charged superstar. In fact, it's not until the final scene, when the truth unravels itself, that Cruise finally brings his performance down to a human level. Last, the music. ALO has an unobtrusive, Hitchcockian score (see Vertigo to get my drift) that is haunting, and is very effective in creating a brooding, dreamlike atmosphere. Cameron Crowe's blaring soundtrack in VS, conversely, is a slick pop cliché that detracts, instead of enhances, the experience. The musical differences really do speak volumes here. ALO is dark, ethereal, and moving. VS is loud, brash, and coarse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vanilla Sky versus Abre los Ojos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, as it is in most ?fights' one has to see both before being able to see who the winner is and in this case it is Abre los Ojos (the original). It is not THAT MUCH better than Vanilla sky, but the ending does the trick. The ending in Abre los ojos, is much better and more comprehensible than the vague and somewhat pointless ending in Vanilla Sky, which makes the film just a notch better than the star-laden Hollywood remake. The other parts of the films are mostly equal to one another (except Cruz' looks, which are much better than in Vanilla Sky, which is mostly due to the stupid haircut she had in that American film) or should I say, the rest Cameron Crowe copied from Abre los ojos. If there is one thing that I didn't like about this film, is how it was spoiled for me by having seen Vanilla Sky earlier. Almost everything Crowe copied, which made this film rather boring at times and which also makes it difficult for me to rate this one. I can tell you though, that if could choose again I'd definitely see Abre los Ojos first and not see Vanilla Sky at all.7,5 out of 10 (for the statistics, with a 7 to be handed out on voting)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The handsome and wealthy César (Eduardo Noriega) is very successful with women and is having difficulties to get rid off Nuria (Najwa Nimri) that is his last affair. His best friend is Pelayo (Fele Martínez), who is unlucky with women and jealous of his friend. On his birthday party, César meets the gorgeous and sexy Sofia (Penélope Cruz) that is dating Pelayo and they have a crush on each other and spend the night together in her apartment. On the next morning, César finds Nuria stalking him in front of Sofia's building and he accepts her ride home. However, she commits suicide crashing her car against a wall and César survives the crash, but with his face completely destroyed. The doctors do not have technology to restore his face and César is absolutely depressed and missing Sofia. One night, César meets Sofia and Pelayo in a bar and he drinks too much, falling on the street. However, on the next morning, Sofia finds César on the street and kisses him telling that she loves him. Then the doctors tell him that they are able to fix his face. Out of the blue, César's happiness changes and he finds that he is trapped in a nightmare."Abre los Ojos" is an intriguing and fascinating thriller with a journey to paranoia. The twenty-five year-old genius Alejandro Amenábar wrote and directed this masterpiece that is certainly the source of inspiration of "The Matrix", with the concept of virtual reality. This film is among my top-ten ever and the last three times that I watched it was on 16 November 2001, 26 October 2002 and yesterday, but the impact is never reduced with the awesome story and screenplay. The American cinema industry once again decided to destroy this piece-of ?art with the ridiculous remake "Vanilla Sky" that is only a shadow of "Abre los Ojos". My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Preso na Escurid?o" ("Imprisoned in the Darkness")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... You know the one I'm talking about , the one with Tom Cruise OMG this review is impossible without mentioning VANILLA SKY , I mean not only is it a remake of ABRE LOS OJO but it's almost scene for scene the exact same movie , in fact since it's got Penelope Cruz in the exact same role as the original you can't even say VANILLA SKY is the same movie with an entirely different cast ! That's the problem with having seen the remake first because it's very difficult to comment on ABRE LOS OJOS because I knew exactly where the movie was heading when Cesar stepped out of his car and surveyed the empty city scape at the start of the movie . This familiarity of the story ruined the movie for me . If only I'd seen this before Hollywood remade it ! Strangely enough Channel 4 broadcast this the night before they broadcast VANILLA SKY and it's obvious that the strengths of the Alejandro Amenaber original have become weaknesses in Crowe's remake . Eduardo Noriega might not be a film star but he is an actor , when watching him play Cesar he is Cesar . When watching Cruise play David you're aware of a movie star playing a disfigured character , his casting against type makes the audience aware that despite the shock revelation at the end it's only a movie . Amenaber thankfully doesn't drown the audience with pop culture references every five seconds unlike Crowe and because of this the audience can concentrate on the mind bending but totally rewarding plot a lot more Incidentally I awarded this movie seven out of ten the same mark as I gave the remake . If I saw the prior film first I would have almost certainly have given it a higher mark while possibly giving VANILLA SKY a lower one</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new brains of fantasy film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenabar is the new brains of the fantasy film,and maybe of the European cinema.Take the snuff movie topic :he did much better than Shumacher's "8 mm".Now he takes an hackneyed subject which has been treated many times and surprises the audience. Combining Georges Franju 's "les yeux sans visage" (1960)-for the strange poetry which emanates from the mask the hero(heroine in the French movie) wears-,Adrian Lyne's "Jacob's ladder" and what will be LATER developed in "matrix" or "the sixth sense" ,Amenabar creates a disturbing,absorbing and mesmerizing movie.He succeeds in surprising the audience the way only Alfred Hitchcock could do before:the movie begins as some kind of two-bit comedy,with such futile subjects as trying and picking someone up and parties,then slowly but inexorably grips the audience's mind ,and the interest won't weaken till the very end.Like in "psycho" or "Rosemary's baby" or "Jacob's ladder" ,nothing should be revealed.For the French,there's another surprise:Serge Duvernois is played by Gérard Barray.This actor was very famous in the sixties for playing in swashbucklers the likes of "Pardaillan" "Surcouf" and "les trois mousquetaires".He was some kind of Jean Marais's alter ego.Then he completely disappeared from the screens in the late sixties(he probably became a stage actor).So I had not seen him for thirty years or more!Seeing him in such a spooky part adds to the eerie atmosphere.I wish the French directors could think of him a little more now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>César has been left rich by his restaurant owning parents. When he meets the beautiful Sofia at a party he uses her as a way to escape his jealous ex Nuria. After a night of talking with Sofia, César is picked up by Nuria who crashes her car deliberately killing her and horribly disfiguring him. With surgery limited as to what it can achieve César despairs at his loss (his looks, not Nuria) and tries to pick up with Sofia. However when surgery returns his looks he thinks everything is solved ? but his dreams become more vivid blurring his sense of reality. He tells his fragmented story to a physiatrist in a mental institution/prison where he waits trail for murder.Suddenly this little beauty is being sought out ? even if Vanilla Sky is mixed, at least it put the original on the bigger stage. The story is magnificently set out ? it builds slowly and you never know the full story ? even the ending requires you to catch up really quickly. Not knowing what's going on at some points may frustrate some audiences, but it just drives this film on. It is a little far fetched at points but it's handled so well that you don't mind. The story is laced with emotion and passion ? the ending is moving for so many reasons that I won't spoil.Director Amenádar delivers a visually great film ? he uses the dream sequences well and regularly contrasts the beauty and the twisted face of César. He delivers a story that is stylish and clever, using his cast to spin out a human drama before launching into the realm of science fiction.Noriega is great as the conceited César ? his character and his fate can both be taken as comments on vanity and the importance of image ? and he is more than able to handle all the sides to his character. Cruz is good here too ? she is quite attractive and plays well in a smallish role. The most underrated performance is given by the physiatrist ? his role becomes bigger at the end and he handles the complexities thrust upon his character well.Overall this is a superb film that mixes a clever plot, good acting, a great script and stylish direction. It may lose some of it's impact once you know the full story and it should be enjoyed as freshly as possible ? but it will stand repeat viewings to get the full picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, it makes more sense than Vanilla Sky did</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There once was a movie called Vanilla Sky. It made very little sense. It really was a thoroughly confusing mess. That movie was an English-language remake of this Spanish-language one. If nothing else Open Your Eyes at least makes more sense than Vanilla Sky did. Oh, there's still plenty of confusing stuff here but director Alejandro Amenábar manages to pull it together much better than Cameron Crowe ever did in the remake. The fact that I think the story makes much more sense when presented in a language I don't even understand is about as damning a statement as can be made about Crowe's film. Open Your Eyes is clearly the better film of the two. But it comes with its own frustrations. Maybe this story was just a little too convoluted to ever make a thoroughly enjoyable movie out of.Open Your Eyes is a movie which delights in messing with your mind. This is a movie which demands that you be fully engaged when watching it. Turn off your brain and start daydreaming and you'll be lost. The movie's main character, César, has plenty of disorienting experiences which can leave the viewer feeling more than a little disoriented himself. It's a hard movie to pin down. It flashes back and forth in time, it raises questions about what is real and what is imagined. It takes you right inside César's head. Unfortunately César's darned near lost his mind so going inside his head isn't going to give us much clarity.It's best to not say much about the plot because whatever joy you get from this movie will likely come from your attempts to unravel the plot for yourself. If you've already seen Vanilla Sky you unfortunately pretty much know everything. The ending of Vanilla Sky was such a letdown, and made so little sense whatsoever, that as you watch Open Your Eyes you can't help but have very low expectations. You're waiting to be let down and to be thoroughly baffled. Happily Amenábar's ending is a little more focused than Crowe's was. Where Vanilla Sky went completely off the rails Open Your Eyes takes some strange twists and turns but you can follow along if you try. The movie asks you for some serious suspension of disbelief but at least it doesn't throw so much stuff at you that it becomes utter nonsense like Vanilla Sky did. Give some credit to Eduardo Noriega whose performance in the lead role of César is much stronger than Tom Cruise's corresponding star turn in the remake. And this movie's Penélope Cruz also comes across much better than that movie's Penélope Cruz. Strange how the same actress playing the same role can be so much better in one movie than in the other. Maybe it's her comfort level with the language, maybe it's just that she's surrounded by a better movie than she was in Vanilla Sky. Open Your Eyes is not a great movie, a little too convoluted for its own good. Somewhat slow, not always as dramatic and engaging as you would hope. But all in all the movie does have an intriguing story which, if you can wrap your head around it, makes the movie worth seeing. For whatever flaws the movie may have you can understand what Crowe saw in it. Too bad he made such a mess of it when he got his hands on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first Alejandro Amenábar movie and I liked it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Abre los ojos......abre los ojos.... open your eyes.....open your eyes.... This is how the movie begins...César is a real playboy.He sleeps with a woman for one time and then he never calls them again. But one night he sleeps with Nuria, what he doesn't know is that she seems to love him very much. But on his birthday party he meets Sofia(Cruz), his best friends girlfriend. Nuria is also on his birthday party and sees him leaving the apartment with Sofia, after Pelayo, his best friend, left.The next morning: César left Sofia's apartment and wants to drive home when he sees Nuria waiting in front of the apartment. She asks him if she should bring him home. He says yes and that's how he comes into her car. What he didn't know is that she thinks about committing suicide. So they drive along the street and in one moment Nuria drives against a wall. She's dead, César survives but he lost his face. After that event César wears a mask to cover his real face. He comes into a psychiatry because he killed somebody, but César doesn't know what happened. Together with his psychiatrist he tries to remember what happened. And he remembered. One night he slept with Sofia but he hadn't seen Sofia, he saw Nuria so he was that confused that he pulled a cushion on her face so she couldn't breath. But there was something else that he remembered. He remembered that he signed a contract. And this contract is from a company for "Life Extension". So he and his psychiatrist drive to this company and talk with the boss and find out that everything that César did was a dream. His body had been frozen 150 years ago and he lived a dream with all the people he loved. To wake up he had to jump from a building. He did and that's how the movie ends.This is a great movie. My second Spanish movie and I like both very much. Alejandro Amenábar is great director. Now the actors. Eduardo Noriega was great. He played fantastic. He had to be funny and in the next moment he had to be terrific and confused. He did a great job. Perfect cast for this role. And then there is Penelope Cruz. I knew that she is a great actress...but now I know that she is brilliant. She is so beautiful in this movie you want to die lol And she did a excellent job too. She played fantastic. So I would say that this movie should get 9 stars because it is that good. Absolutely worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen VS, and on this evidence, have no need to. It's obvious why Hollywood chose it as a perfect cash cow, though - it's shallow beyond expression.I think this is mystery moviemaking for the X files generation. The cinematic touches are admittedly, excellent - score, cinematography, casting, clever twists. But there's no movie inside it all. Abre los Ojos is a lot of icing and no cake.***SPOILERS AHEAD***As with most crossover sci-fi these days, the science fiction in itself is a mutilated version of a Philip K Dick story (I Hope We Will Arrive Soon), with the message clinically removed. The chief theme of this film must surely be the changing mental state of the protagonist - in whose head, after all, the majority of the action takes place, right?As it happens, no. Here's a plot summary. The protagonist's irresponsible and misogynist playboy lifestyle gets him mutilated - a result worse than death for this shallow, vain exploiter. He can't handle it, because he is so very mentally weak, and tops himself, promised a cryogenic paradise. This is a man who counters the loss of a privileged lifestyle granted him (and denied to most of the world) by his *inherited* good looks NOT by facing up to a more interesting and profound existence in the real world, but by retreating to another granted him and denied to others this time by his *inherited* wealth.So, in his dream world we are to find salvation for this vain, shallow man, right? His emptiness will haunt him by undermining his dream from the inside, and through the collapse of his dream paradise he will experience something greater than he ever experienced in life as he grows to love a woman entirely his own conjectural creation, based only on tidbits he picked up about an unusual stranger in the real world?Well, actually no. In fact that his dream does get all mixed up - but for no reason, and with no purpose or direction. As a result of this he becomes a murderer and spends some time being rather surly and unrepentant in an asylum. However, through a bit of not-particularly-difficult detective work (for the pursuit of which, remember, he has an eternity, and, in the course of which, he murders again) he manages to get himself granted a second chance at real life, complete with a reconstructed face and an unreconstructed personality. Well, I'm so pleased for the weak, shallow, murderous, misogynist monster.***END OF SPOILERS***To conclude, this is a movie entirely without message and for that reason is an abhorrence. It is considerably worsened by its laughably feeble attempt to give itself a full explanation at the end. We have long become accustomed to cod science in science fiction, but this movie's complete lack of irony or concession to its own scientific inanity is really very insulting, especially given that the scientific hollowness is not an expedient for a significant message, as it is in the PKD short story.About half way through the movie, there is a very skilful little homage to Jacob's Ladder, with a shot of the sun shining through some treetops, moving gently from bottom of the screen to the top. Believe me, Jacob's Ladder has everything Abre Los Ojos lacks, and for that reason, is a very good film indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hype doesn't pay off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're convinced that you want to see the "original" before you see the copy (Vanilla Sky) I suspect that you'll be disappointed in both versions. This one is well shot, well acted, and would be a decent if rather boring movie if it weren't for all the hype about the "astounding surprise ending". I found the ending to be far from astounding and even less of surprise- it's practically force-fed to you throughout the movie.I also found the message to be rather confused and shallow- I interpreted it as "if all you have is your looks, be sure that you hang on to them or you'll be really sad." Not exactly groundbreaking cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling and surprising story full of suspense , plot twists , intrigue and excitement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film Abre Los Ojos or 'Open your ears' (1997) was a huge success in Spain and was distributed worldwide . This suspenseful movie starts when the protagonist appears moving by an empty Madrid's Gran Vía, without cars or people . It concerns about a very handsome young named Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) , as he meets the beautiful and sexy Sofia (Penelope Cruz), currently dating Pelayo (Fele Martinez) , but they are immediately attracted to each other finds the love of his life , but a girl (Najwa Nimri) is completely obsessed with him . He then suffers an accident and needs to have his face rebuilt by surgery after it is severely disfigured .The motion picture displays genuine chills , suspense, mystery and dark atmosphere with a twisted finale . Packs excellent creation of tension , thriller , emotions and brief violence . The film's title translates to "open your eyes," which is a repeated motif . It's an exciting , bizarre film ; skillfully proceeded by Alejandro Amenabar and turns out to one of the most unusual Spaniard suspense movie ever made and certainly one of the most unsettling . Plenty of twists and turns , the strange images deliver the excitement united a thrilling score by the same Alejandro Amenabar , including some wonderful songs such as the song playing at the nightclub when César first arrives is "Rising Son" by Massive Attack, in which the phrase "dream on" is frequently repeated . Furthermore , Alejandro also wrote , along with Mateo Gil, the interesting plot , embarking into the phantasmagorical, psychological or even quasi-surrealist story . In fact , Alejandro Amenábar imagined the script after having horrible nightmares while ill with the flu. It includes director Cameo , as Alejandro Amenábar appears with other two people in the bathroom of the disco, when César goes there . Intelligent edition, special use of luxurious sets by Wofgang Burmann and slick utilization of shock images make this one, a magnificent film . Abre Los Ojos (1997) is his "remake" of Vértigo (1958), by Hitchcock. In fact, when the character of Sofia appears after hitting Cesar with a jar, it's the same shot of Kim Novak in Vertigo when she appears from the bathroom in the hotel - with green lights . Colorful and glowing cinematography by Hans Burmann which heightens the suspense . It was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky (2001), starring Tom Cruise , Cameron Diaz , Kurt Russell and Penélope Cruz also stars in Vanilla Sky, Cameron Crowe's remake of this film, playing the same character, Sofia. The picture was well directed by Amenabar in his second movie, after he achieved various hits . Since his perhaps best-known early short-film "Himenóptero" in 1992, in which he directed , produced, acted and wrote the script and the music, Amenábar progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with "Thesis", Amenabar was 23 when he directed this his feature debut , a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene . Later "Los Otros" (The Others) confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world and is Amenábar's first English language film . In all his films he also writes the script and the music, as well as composing the music for other films , most notably "Butterflies tongue" (1999). He subsequently directed ¨Mar Adentro¨ with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and finally the epic/historical ¨Agora¨ with Rachel Weisz . Rating : Better than average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misintepretation of language</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Vanilla sky first so agree that that may have spoilt somewhat the power of Abre Los Ojos, which I believe is a more fly-on-the-wall insight into the film compared to Vanilla Sky.However, as with any foreign language film, I feel it is almost impossible to entirely "get" the sentiment/meaning of the film unless you can understand/hear it in the original language. I can speak Spanish pretty well but I was unable to pick up any particular memorable quotes, without the aid of the subtitles. (and subtitles can be very loosely translated). For example, I'm not sure "f**k buddy" and "the sweet ain't as sweet without the sour" from Vanilla sky would truly represent the intended meaning if translated to Spanish.Overall, I thought Abre los Ojos was a more gritty and realistic version of the story. Contrastingly, I enjoyed Vanilla Sky because of the pop culture references and the soundtrack and the cheesy Hollywood moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than Vanilla Sky, and from Spain. Extremely Good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I talk Spanish, but not Spanish Spanish, if you hardly now what I mean. This movie is so much better than Vanilla Sky. This second is too American. Amenábar creates his own music, the script, the funny Spanish talking, and directs the fantastic performances. There is hardly one song and it really helps to the plot, not like Crowe's version when there is a song everybody knows every single second or during the fall.On the other hand, the movie is terrific. The story is very original, it tells about shallowness in several aspects one rarely imagines, and the ending, like all Amenabar films, makes you think for days. Just watch The Others, the most scary movie ever FOR ME, or Thesis, which isn't left behind. This guy knows what he is doing and hasn't been corrupted by Hollywood even if working with stars from there. He has a great future and I'm waiting patiently for his next film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Having seen the original, I have no desire to see the remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While some people may call "Abre los ojos" ("Open Your Eyes" in English) a psychological thriller, I wish to assert that such a description would be like calling "West Side Story" a plain old musical. This movie blew my mind like almost no other movie has done. I almost wasn't sure whether or not I could trust my own judgment after watching it, see what happens to Eduardo Noriega's character Cesar.I believe that I had seen an ad for this movie before it got released in the US, but it really entered my vocabulary after the release of Tom Cruise's remake. Well, seeing what a great job they did with the original, it's probably safe to assume that the remake is nothing but an excuse to show off Tom Cruise. I, for one, believe that Penelope Cruz has done far better work in her native Spain than outside. So stick with the original and you won't get disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>story of the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A routine party is the beginning of a chilling trip for Cesar. One girl is after him, he goes after another, and before he knows it, very disturbing things are afoot. Open Your Eyes, the second film from 25-year-old Alejandro Amenabar, combines romance with a bit of horror, a heavy dose of psychological thriller, and a splotch of sci-fi into an unusual treat. Rather than satisfied, it leaves you slightly on edge.Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) is a handsome devil, all boyish charm with a very shy act to cover his self-assuredness. Indeed, he's reputed to never sleep with the same woman twice, so naturally when Nuria (Najwa Nimri) tries to bend that rule Cesar declines not so politely. Instead he hides behind Sofia (Penelope Cruz), the girl his best friend, Pelayo, came to the party with.Lucky not only with beauty, Cesar is also quite rich. He has three cars, but Pelayo (Fele Martinez) complains that Cesar only uses the cheap old VW bug to pick him up on the way to racquetball. Is this fact a humorous note, or does it point to a serious character flaw in Cesar? Later, at the party, he ends up monopolizing Sofia's attention, to Pelayo's disgust. When Sofia tells Cesar that if he were a loyal friend he would not try to sleep with her, Cesar replies that he is indeed a loyal friend, and therefore wants to have an affair with Sofia but be sure to prevent Pelayo from finding out about it. Rebuffed, Cesar regroups to try Sofia another day, and as he leaves her apartment he begins the ride of his life.Though the plot to Open Your Eyes is dense, to say much more would reveal too much already. On the other hand, the layers of reality that director Amenabar peels away are numerous, and no piece of the puzzle is the whole answer. Delectably unpredictable, the film casts Cesar as a spoiled rich kid and then makes us pity him, as he's accused of a crime he has no knowledge of and suffers grave disfigurement in an accident. Stuck in a cell, wearing a mask over his grotesque face, Cesar's only clues are the dreams he keeps having, and boy does he hated-reams! The first half hour is riveting, with an interesting romantic setup giving way to a most bizarre world of shame and denial. In the cell, a psychologist tries to coax information out of Cesar that could help in his trial for murder. From that point on the film is fairly hit-and-miss, though there are many more hits than misses, to be sure.The film's main strengths reside in unaffected acting and sparkling direction. All the leads, from the increasingly desperate psychologist, to Noriega, Cruz and Martinez, are very comfortable even within the strange world the director has placed them in. They do their best to respond as ordinary people to extraordinary situations, as the script pushes them farther and farther. The direction, particularly the cinematography, is solid throughout, with several splendid shots taking advantage of shadows and unusual points of view which always serve a narrative purpose.Clearly the major triumph of the film is in blending the mundane with the bizarre, and the truly bizarre, with such seamless transitions. In fact, this blending becomes a focal point of the plot itself, as it analyzes a cadre of colossal questions such as how we could really tell a dream from reality, or how we might know whether other people really exist. These are weighty questions and the film cannot be faulted for achieving no answers. Rather, it treats them as invisible boundaries the characters bump into, and emphasizes them enough so that the viewer may think about them on their own.Unfortunately, not all the strangeness is wholly original. Slightly reminiscent of The Game and Dark City, and made at the same time as these, Open Your Eyes also evokes standard thriller tricks, such as the scary mirror that changes what it shows each time you look. Though the visual direction maintains our interest, the plot lags at such times; the danger of showing incomprehensible things is that the audience may feel no connection to them. Invoking notions from deja-VI to cryogenics to very subtle commentary on guilt and the unconscious, however, the movie has enough freshness and focus in its own right to work as a cohesive whole.Perhaps the greatest shortcoming, ironically, is in the more mundane setup. Does the audience really care that a spoiled rich kid becomes unattractive and therefore may not be able to steal his best friend's girlfriend? At times, but at others the concept appears a ludicrous source of conflict. The movie is strongest in suggesting how bizarre the world is, or can become, and in this guise it's certainly worth watching. The conclusion poses an interesting choice for a character which, given the pace of technology, may become a real choice within a few centuries. Unlike most movies in its genre, the recent smash The Matrix included, Open Your Eyes finally works because it treats its questions about the world not as a springboard to standard film but as questions worth turning over in their own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this after watching "Vanilla Sky" - and agree that it's the better version. In fact both films are very similar which makes you wonder why Crow bothered to remake it. Surprisingly, for a foreign film, this one is more linear and easier to follow than Vanilla Sky (which is the more artistic and surreal of the two). Also surprisingly, for a foreign film, the production values of this movie were as good as the Hollywood version - if not better. This movie is more of a science fiction film than Vanilla Sky which is a bit "new age" and surreal. Although they're very similar, I enjoyed watching the two versions and would recommend that you do likewise. If you've seen Vanilla Sky first then this version will not disappoint.</fullReview>

But please, Mr Abenabar, if you read this : don't go to Hollywood ! We, your fidelios, don't want you to fold into this sterile mold ! (Say : they take a guy from Hong Kong who can do the most breath-taking action sequences in the world and, faster than you can say "Stanley Tong", gets him to direct a bad Leslie Nielsen vehicle !)

		<shortDescription>I'm surprised I never heard of this masterpiece thriller! See it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(c) Karen Dallas Hartig (katydidwritersguild@comcast.net), all rights reserved, USA: rights granted to IMDb.com per its copyright statement and terms thereof, February 2012 and onward.I will put an asterisk (star) before and after any spoiler. This movie, in Spanish (the Spain Castellano-type Spanish), with subtitles, has got to be one of the best movies ever made. It's incredible that I never heard of it! I caught it on cable TV a few days ago (Jan 2012). Talk about a smart thriller! Cesar, the main character, is a young and handsome man who is in a car accident. His face is ruined. It is hideous. You do not see it that much because he covers it with a mask that in itself is strange, alluring, and frightening in a way because it is like a bare face, without any genetic imprint of his ancestors on it. It is a generic face, which has shiny black eyes; about the only feature that is recognizably human. You DO see Cesar's face before the accident while he plays out his life in situations that he would have actually been doing if he were normal. And you will see Cesar's face, before the accident, at the end--which is a total surprise.Cesar is in love with Sophia (Penelope Cruze), but he also knows a woman by the name of Naria, who is dead--so his friend and the lover of Naria tells him. However, Cesar's memory gets mixed up, so in parts of the movie, he envisions Sophia as Naria, and he is very frustrated because he believes that Naria is alive and has taken the body of Sophia.In Cesar's quest for Sophia, although he does find her--at least he believes it (a psychological twist with I will not divulge to you)--he ends up destroying what they had, and that leads him into very serious consequences.Part of the consequence is that he is told, time and time again, to seek the help of a psychiatrist. You understand why because you have seen actions that lead up to Cesar going to a psychiatrist, who hypnotizes him, so that the truth about his life and about Sophia, can unfold. Cesar gets onto dangerous ground while put under, as well as when he dreams, so he must be awoken. However, how can the doctor know what he dreams or dreamed in the past? WE see it, however. The doctor plays a pivotal role, as does a businessman that we see here and there in Cesar's life. * The businessman is from the past. * As the psychiatrist and the businessman bring Cesar into reality--which is quite an amazing truth, not fully disclosed until the end--we are led into a maze of truths of Cesar's life, then, at the end, we figure it out. It is a stunning and unconventional ending.If I were to disclose the ending to you, I'd truly spoil it. Because, it is such an INTERESTING ending that all of the movie has led up to, but we can't imagine it. That's why this movie is astonishing! And it will make you think, for a long time, about your own life and how it might be in the future. And you will think, too, how you may decide to change your life now, in order that it will not be like Cesar's life.Should you care to be fascinated by this thriller, which is definitely one of the best thrillers that I have ever seen, don't get up go to the bathroom or to the fridge for a beer: see it sober and in one sitting. You will get so amazed by the kaleidoscopic plot that you'll feel like I do. This is a masterpiece. Everything is revealed and it all fits. You will not know that, however, until you too walk through all of the turns and twists of Cesar's life.I most definitely give this movie 10 out of 10 stars, and I will buy it too.Karen Dallas Hartig (as above), Chicago, IL USA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abres los ojos or Vanilla sky: great Science fiction Psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ABRE LOS OJOSWhichever you chose to watch, the original "Abre los ojos" or the Hollywood remake "Vanilla Sky", this is a great Science Fiction Psychological Thriller and if you like this genre, the first time you watch it you'll often be on the edge of your seat with your eyes glued to the screen waiting for something unexpected to happen: and it will. Vanilla sky (2001) and Abre los ojos (1997).While most people rate the original "Abre los Ojos" as a being a better film than the American remake "Vanilla Sky", both movies have their pros and cons in spite of being nearly identical in the plot. Abres Los Ojos feels more natural, more realistic, and has that plain, gritty feel of many European movies. The characters feel more real, but the cinematography is also less spectacular than in Vanilla sky. Vanilla sky while containing plenty of drama and thriller elements, has also more space for humor and playful synergy between the characters. The overall feeling is that you are in a Hollywood fantasy. This lends a lightness to it but it also robs it of the realism that Abres los Ojos has. Abre Los Ojos sticks to the drama, to the story, and the interaction between actors is nearly always serious: the filmmaker wants you to believe this is actually all happening and it's no joke. The acting is in any case good in both movies. Whichever movie you chose to watch first is going to diminish the experience of watching the other version. If you're not a Hollywood fan the choice is easily made!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Abre Los Ojos is a dark, beautiful film that can be quite harrowing in parts... it effectively melds a mix of styles into a sharp, thought provoking whole... i've seen comments that claim the plot has been ripped off from one of the science fiction greats... i'm certainly not going to dispute the possibility, as this film does play with some interesting concepts... nevertheless, i think the craftsmanship and strong dramatic development of the characters deserves recognition...the lead character is an unlikeable playboy, who is selfish and handsome... nevertheless he has good friends and a lifestyle which is satisfying in at least a superficial way... something traumatic happens to him which upsets the balance of his comfortable life... his resulting struggle with a new reality leads to a bizarre decision, which has consequences he could only imagine in his scarred dreams...the early parts of the movie set up a dramatic shift, which changes the tone and genre without breaking continuity... all the separate pieces of the movie are well done, without a drop in quality...the supporting actors are excellent, and there are some heartbreaking scenes that have that iconic feel to them... watch for Penelope Cruz as a mime together with Eduardo Noriega in the park... lots going on without a word... although Noriega's character is not the most pleasant man, i felt genuine sorrow for him and his ruined life, and this is an achievement that is hard to match... watching the American remake "Vanilla Sky", you can see Crowe (or Cruise) simply sidestepped this and toned down his main man's shortcomings...special mention should be made of Fele Martinez who formed a complex and good foil to Noriega's character... also Najwa Nimri who had little time on-screen to establish herself, but brings darkness and frailty to her role... Cameron Diaz manages to absolutely butcher her equivalent part in the American remake...although the movie plays in the sci-fi pool, the ending is bittersweet, and mature... not to suggest sci-fi is not mature, but the final moments are in keeping with a drama... and the shots are heartbreaking, in a quiet, reflective sense...i can't say much more without giving away the plot, but it's an unusual movie, and it deserves attention...</fullReview>

Instead of just sitting in front of my TV and letting the information download into my brain without much mental effort , my mind was actually being engaged . The movie kept me guessing and second-guessing myself throughout it's entirety , which made for a very interesting cinematic experience. It was a bit confusing at times as the basis of the movie is basically to blur the lines of reality and dreams but all becomes clearer after additional viewings. This was the ideal "twist ending" type of movie though , as knowing the ending does not inhibit any future enjoyment and may even provide a greater understanding as to what's going on.</fullReview>

The problem is that 90% of the film is so good that it builds up expectations for a final epiphany that should be just as bizarre, involving, and unexpected.Alas, when the moment comes all we are offered is a rather disappointing disentanglement, more akin to that of a soap opera in which the producers have decided to revive a dead character (yes, I am talking about "Dallas") than to such a beautifully made (up to that point) film.If only the authors creativity and imagination had held for another ten minutes, this would have been an almost perfect film. As it is, I regard it as a missed opportunity (although I still appreciated its innovative ideas).I wish I could compare it to Vanilla Sky, but I have a policy not to go see Hollywood star-filled remakes of European films. If they want my eight dollars, they should at least have the decency not to steal a plot just to re-set it in a more familiar American environment. It is really annoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cesar is a very handsome guy who sees his love-life going away after an accident. Don't you know the difference between dreams and reality?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie shouldn't even be compared with Vanilla Sky! VS is Hollywood-type movie that lacks of sense. I know many people say it's a duplicate of "open your eyes", but that's not truth. The movie starts with Nuria's voice saying "abre los ojos, abre los ojos" (open your eyes, open your eyes)for waking Cesar up, and the whole movie is about dreams and reality so, it made sense to say that to wake up you need to open your eyes. The title "Vanilla Sky" is from a painting, a painting that appears once in the movie! It's completely senseless! Then, Sofia says to Cesar she's an actress, but she works at the park as a mime and she's got a lot of mimes in her house. That's the park he dreams of, the park where he goes to see her after his accident. Nuria is a key-person but his performance shouldn't last as long as the performance of Cameron Diaz, just for being Cameron Diaz. I mean, she's awesome, but she shouldn't last that long on screen. When they go to the institute (LE), in VS the explanation of the procedure is so complicated, with the screens and the whole hi-tech, and is better when in "abre los ojos" make it with 2 sticks. And just because VS is made in Hollywood many people say VS is the original and the one. I say "ABRE LOS OJOS" is the one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent surreal nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This surrealist fantasy nightmare from Spain is a fantastic piece of cinema. Despite it's gritty and ugly style, Open Your Eyes is a tale of beauty. Eduardo Noriega stars as Cesar; an overly handsome playboy that was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Cesar leads the good life; women love him, his friends love him and he's got lots of money. His life is turned on it's head when he finds the love of his life, Sofia (Penelope Cruz), much to the dismay of his less good-looking best friend, Pelayo (Fele Martinez), who brought her to the party where she and Cesar meet. Not content with just one major twist in his life, Cesar's life is turned on it's head again, when his disgruntled bed-buddy, Nuria (Najwa Nimri) takes him on a car journey that he'll never forget; and one that will ultimately cost him his precious good looks.As mentioned, Open Your Eyes is a tale of beauty. At many points during the film, Cesar says that his disfigurement has turned him into a monster; but as Sofia says before she sees his new face; "You are a monster", and that he is. He is a serial womaniser, he doesn't care about people; only himself, and that respect; he is monster, but it's only on the inside. His selfishness and material persona is then epitomised again later on in the film during his conversations with the doctors; "I'll pay anything", he pleas for them to fix his face. His looks are everything to him, and when he has them he doesn't care who gets hurt or what pain he causes. When he loses his looks, however, he quickly finds out what life is like on the other side of the fence; and he doesn't like it. The only difference between him at the start of the movie, and after the accident is his face; but he lets the disfigurement consume him. Open Your Eyes is the epitome of the age-old anecdote; "True beauty is on the inside".Open Your Eyes is written and directed by the supremely talented Alejandro Amenabar. Amenabar unleashed himself on the film world with the fantastic 'Tesis' in 1996, which was also one of the best films to come out of his homeland of Spain for years. Alejandro's direction is sublime; he is a master on top of his craft, and if he carries on going the way he has with this film, Tesis and the not quite as good, but still good; The Others, he will surely mature into one of cinema's finest assets. For this movie, Alejandro has re-recruited his two leading men from Tesis; Eduardo Noriega (who also starred in The Devil's Backbone) and Fele Martinez. These two are a great couple of young actors, and Amenabar was right to hire them again. Noriega in particular is great in his role; he creates just the right amount of intrigue and sympathy for his character. Starring alongside them is Tom Cruise's divorced wife to be, Penelope Cruz. Penelope is absolutely beautiful and she's very talented too; and makes for a great leading lady.Open Your Eyes is one of the most outstanding and original pieces of cinema I have ever had the pleasure of watching. When Tom Cruise saw the film, he liked it so much that he remade it as 'Vanilla Sky' in 2001; and it's not hard to see why, as I would have done the same thing if I had enough money. Vanilla Sky isn't anywhere near as good as the original; it's far less gritty, and far more Hollywood, there's a lot of unneeded elements added, such as a silly dialogue about being cats in the next life, and overall it isn't as good as the original. And I'm sure anyone that has seen both films will agree with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With nods to Resnais and Les Yeux Sans Visage, this well-shot and initially attractive film seems to be going all the right places, but 60% of the way through one gets the impression it is on a spiralling collision course with its own rectum. Big Brother-style international corporations and cryogenics, to me, lessen, rather than increase the philosophical depth of what might be seen as a not unusually original psychological thriller. To suggest that this has the qualities of Hitchcock, Kubrick and Lynch is to misunderstand each of those great film makers. Looks good though...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than 'Vanilla Sky'. No question about that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I didn't get to see 'Vanilla Sky' in 2001, when I got the chance to see it was still a relatively recent movie. Back then I didn't know yet that many of the recent movies I saw were in reality remakes. In other words, I didn't know there were original versions.At the time, I had good expectations about "Vanilla Sky", partially because of its delicious title and partially because it appeared to be good. I was frankly disappointed with it.This one, the original and true version, is superior, easily eclipsing the remake. Even what seemed good in "Vanilla Sky" before seems mediocre next to the original. If you want 'Vanilla Sky' done right, don't look any further - this is it.Admittedly, it's still not an "easy" movie, but it's marginally easier to understand than the flawed American version. But even the original requires extra attention, otherwise it will be even more confusing. It's also more intriguing, more suspenseful, more tragic, more touching, more original, more artistic, deeper and more intense, not to mention it has a very nice soundtrack.Overall, a movie of higher quality. And ahead of its time. In 1997, movies this brave and complex were something from another world or even another planet. Nowadays we easily find movies like this, but in 1997 that was another music.On paper, "Abre los ojos" is the predictable story of a young man (César) who has everything in life: he is rich, good-looking, popular among his friends and lucky with women. That's the easy part. Behind this simple idea lies an extraordinary and exceptionally complex story. Unexpectedly, César meets the charming Sofia and instantly falls in love with her. She corresponds but soon César's life changes completely, when his insanely jealous lover Nuria tricks him into a trap by offering him a ride, covering her true intentions. She intentionally commits suicide by crashing the car. César survives, but his face gets seriously deformed.César is willing to pay anything for a cosmetic surgery, so that he can have his normal face again, return to his life and reconquer Sofia. Much for César's sorrow, nobody can (or doesn't want to) operate his face. After that traumatizing experience, César becomes emotionally unstable, aggressive, confused, deeply depressed and his mental health changes dangerously: he suffers from flashbacks, disturbing visions, is unable to distinguish dreams from reality and even confounds Sofia with Nuria - and by seeing Nuria instead of Sofia, he reacts with violence to that and the innocent Sofia is the one who pays. To tell the truth, the film comes to a point which is almost impossible to tell what's real and what's not - but all this complicated mess only makes it more interesting and remarkable. An amazing yet strong movie with also a surprising ending...But the movie isn't all about tragedy. There is also a romance between César and Sofia, and there is some sexuality. The lovely Penélope Cruz is seen naked. Penélope is beautiful with clothes, but naked she is simply divine. And she's got very lovely boobs.Eduardo Noriega is superb, so much better than Tom Cruise. The actress who plays Nuria, despite her minor role, is clearly superior to Cameron Diaz. Penélope Cruz is in both versions and plays the same role in both but she is better in this one. Maybe it was the pressure and boredom of doing the same thing twice, which affects the performance? Maybe because in the original she speaks her native language? Must be that. Not that I blame her. I love Chete Lera's fantastic acting as Antonio and Gérard Barray's terrific acting as Serge Duvernois (and he speaks Spanish so well that you don't even notice any french accent on him). Fele Martínez is good as César's friend Pelayo.Title in Portugal: 'De Olhos Abertos'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow-paced attempt at surrealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Open your eyes" is a soap opera turned surrealistic flick with some pretensions at investigating the relationship between dream and reality, studying the depths of the human mind and passing moral judgments on the nature of wealth and friendship. The sci-fi component is entirely secondary and was only introduced to offer a rationale to the in- and out-of-reality sequences.While not bad, it certainly is not the masterpiece some purport it to be. The plot itself is air-thin and requires plentiful suspension of disbelief. Contrary to the opinion of other reviewers casting is poor, as expected in a low-budget movie. Basically, it does not raise above the level of a commercial soap-opera. Finally, the topic of self-punishment seems a bit inappropriate for so shallow a character like Cesar, a rich playboy prone to womanizing. If you want to do Crime and Punishment all over again, please pick some serious wrongdoer with a lot of thought and self-justification, so that he has some spiritual energy to turn against himself.In order to like this film you need: 1. to be interested in the key element of modern (i.e. degenerate) art, that is, mental masturbation: the idea being that the artist should not relate an interesting story but rather serve the viewer a compound collection of stimuli aimed to encourage his own mental ruminations; 2. to have a high attention span; 3. to like soap operas, because that's what the movie is in its first half an hour. I was so dismally bored after that that nothing could arouse my interest any longer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dream life of Eduardo Noriega</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beginning around 1997, a great many mind-bending films were made such as "Open Your Eyes" (1997), "eXistenZ" (1999), "Fight Club" (1999) "Mulholland Drive" (2001), "Fear X" (2003), "Inception" (2010) and "Shutter Island" (2010). These are often neo-noirs. Quite often they are completely or partially sci-fi films. The plots frequently involve dislocations of space and time, the mixing of dreams and reality, the questioning of identity and reality, and unusual state of minds. Predecessors to these films include but are not limited to "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" (1962), "Vertigo" (1958), "Seconds" (1966) and a good many episodes of "The Twilight Zone". I guess that dislocations, separations and all sorts of disconnections of modern life have made audiences ripe for this kind of story."Open Your Eyes" begins with a dream of its protagonist, Eduardo Noriega. He is wakened by his alarm telling him to "open your eyes". He goes through his morning routine and drives to work, realizing that the streets are deserted. The screen goes black and then we hear "open your eyes" as he is wakened from his sleep, this time for real. In a way, he and we have experienced what Edgar Allen Poe wrote a poem about: a dream within a dream. This opening signals the nature of this story and some of the complexity to follow.This is a well done movie; but as with most movies, audience reactions are likely to be mixed. A story like this challenges one to think out of ordinary channels of belief about the nature of this world, thought, will, dreams and reality. Some people will reject that out of hand, others will find it too confusing, and some will demand closure. Some will feel cheated out of rational or conventional explanations. I personally liked the movie. I've always been a sci-fi fan. Regardless of like or dislike, the movie is well-acted and directed, looks good, flows along quite well, has thorough character development and has some clear themes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Open Your Eyes - Alejandro Amenábar (1997) Classic. Alejandro is one of the rarest gem of the Spanish Cinema and Rare Gem of the world Cinema.Have you ever asked yourself - What is reality ?, If you will ask it yourself now, you will get many answers, May be none of them is true and possibly all of them is true. It's is impossible to prove in theories. Because reality is beyond our knowledge and experience. or depends on what is your belief about reality.and What is Dream ? Real or Subconscious Anticipation, Is it extension of Life we are living ? or is it real than the life ? There are so many questions like that this film may stimulate you to ask yourself. The answer may come and may not come.The film was made in 1997, I will say may be people only considered it as an entertaining film in 1997. In 2013 I will say it's an enlightening film for those who can think beyond, which considered as reality in everyday life. and if you are routine dreamer than everything on this film will make sense to you.Vedanta (The oldest scripture on the planet) mentions that whatever we can see, touch, taste, hear is not the reality but just the projection of something which we can not see, can not touch, and can not hear, The experience which comes form touch, taste, hearing etc. is considered as physical reality The other level is imagination and anticipation which is considered as virtual reality. These are two kinds of concepts of reality known to most of the human civilization. But there must be real reality and everything else is projection of that, and constantly changing, and because it is changing or can be altered can not be considered as reality.Well you might be irritated by now with my article and confusing statement. You might feel the same while watching this film and I must warn you this film does not answer what reality is ? But it questions it ?, and It will leave you with this question in a very powerful way, If you will keep asking this question over and over what is reality ? how we create it ?, How It can be altered ? how it can be realized ? may be you will sense enlightenment.And if you sense that please do let me know :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good entry in a great genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...whatever that genre is. I'm not sure there's a name for it, but if there were, there would be no trouble filling a shelf with the relevant titles. It's the Truman Show genre, the Inception genre, the Shutter Island genre, etc.It's not as strong as the above-mentioned films, but it's still fun to follow the twists and turns on the edge of your seat.Maybe I'm disappointed, in part, because I liked the premise that was established in the first fifteen minutes or so. The film starts out as a condemnation of physical beauty, with the phrase "open your eyes" suggesting paradoxically that one must not look only with his or her eyes in determining the value of a human being. It's a cliché of sorts, but I liked it.This theme becomes less relevant as the film progresses. By the end of the film, the phrase "open your eyes" loses its moral relevance. It just becomes a boring, nearly literal description of how the protagonist has a hard time know what is and isn't real. You can argue that, therefore e, it has a double (triple?) meaning, but it's kind of arbitrary, in that the second half of the movie really doesn't build on or develop the themes from the first half.Yeah, anyway, so it's pretty cool, but IMDb's 7.8 seems a little high to me. Good movie, good entertainment, but not quite brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>many people that have seen Vanilla Sky, may be unaware that its a remake of this movie. now i had seen vanilla sky first and only watched this version out of complete curiosity. i have to say this film is far superior to vanilla sky in every way. yeah sure its subtitled, but so what, once you get past that fact, the result is a generally well made movie with an intriguing story, great acting and an atmospheric and tense soundtrack.one of the things i like about the movie is that unlike David in Vanilla Sky, Cesar, the main character in this seems much more like a normal person. i'm not saying that Tom Cruise's depiction isn't normal, but the way he seemed to always smile in every scene and also the fact that he seemed quite arrogant sort of made him kind of dislikeable. Cesar on the other hand seems more intelligent and more believable. we know both character's are very wealthy however in "open your eyes", his background is mentioned only once at the start of the movie. the character of Pelayo, Cesar's best friend, is also much more believable than his American counter part, Brian Shelby. Shelby just seems to be unable to take serious offence and doesn't seem upset that much when David tries to chat up Sofia. in the original, when Cesar begins chatting up Sofia (played also in this version by Penelope Cruz), Pelayo seems generally hurt and the audience does take sympathy for him. Nuria, Cesar's mentally ill ex girlfriend is also much more disturbing in this film.Another great thing about this film is the soundtrack. the soundtrack really does a great job of making the film seem more tense and atmospheric and kind of gives it a very dark and almost horror themed visual.anyone that is a fan of Vanilla Sky should definitely see Open Your Eyes. the effective performances and overall atmosphere of the film really makes this an unforgettable experience and a much better movie than Vanilla Sky</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>La Vida Es Sueno</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the Spanish original version of the film that was later remade with Tom Cruise as "Vanilla Sky". The action takes place in Madrid rather than New York. The central character, Cesar, is a wealthy young man-about-town, a practised and successful womaniser. At the beginning of the film he is pursuing is the lovely Sofia, even though she is the girlfriend of his best friend Pelayo. His pursuit of Sofia, however, has aroused the jealousy of his own jilted girlfriend, Nuria, who attempts to take bloody revenge. She offers Cesar a lift in her car, then tries to kill both him and herself by deliberately crashing it. Nuria dies; Cesar survives, but his once-handsome face is hideously disfigured.In the immediate aftermath of the crash, Cesar suffers from depression, but then his life starts to improve. His face is rebuilt (something his doctors had previously told him was impossible) thanks to new surgical techniques. Sofia tells him that she is in love with him, and the two become lovers. And then, inexplicably, his fortunes take a turn for the worse again. He begins to suffer from hallucinations; believing that Sofia is really Nuria, returned from the dead, he strangles her while the two are making love. He is arrested but because of his mental state is not put on trial; instead a psychiatrist interviews him, trying to discover the reason for his crime.The above synopsis sets out events in their logical order, but this is not, in fact, the order in which the film narrates them. Director Alejandro Amenabar uses a non-linear narration technique, making extensive use of flashbacks, in which events are not narrated in the sequence in which they occurred. This makes the film, for much of its length, something of a puzzle; it is not until towards the end that we can work out exactly what has been going on, and even then some points are unclear. The possibility is left open that some, or all, of what we have seen may be Cesar's dream rather than reality, even that he is trapped in a nightmare of his own making. (This is a similar idea to that expressed in one of the most famous works of Spanish literature, Pedro Calderon de la Barca's "La Vida es Sueno", or "Life is a Dream").I have only seen one of Amenabar's other film, the English-language "The Others" from 2001. Like "The Others", "Abre los Ojos" ends with a sudden, shocking twist. The twist in the tale is a device which has been worked to death in recent years, particularly by the writers and directors of crime stories, but there are still some directors who are capable of using it effectively. M. Night Shyamalan is one, and Amenabar another. I don't want to give away the full details of the denouement of "Abre los Ojos", but I can say that it has a very strange ending which, unexpectedly, takes us into the realms of science fiction.I never liked "Vanilla Sky" which always struck me as an overblown Tom Cruise vanity project, probably made to help his then girlfriend Penelope Cruz break through into Hollywood films. (The lovely Penelope plays the equivalent character, also called Sofia, in the later film). "Abre los Ojos", however, is much better, for a number of reasons. The plot may be something of a puzzle, but at least it is a puzzle with a solution; with "Vanilla Sky" it was much more difficult to work out what was going on. Like a number of other Continental actors, Penelope Cruz is better when acting in her own language than when acting in English. Eduardo Noriega was better than Tom Cruise, partly because the role of Cesar (David in the remake) is more suited to a young man in his early twenties than to a man approaching middle age. (Cruise was 39 when he made "Vanilla Sky"). Noriega's Cesar, at least before the accident, has all the arrogant self-confidence of youth, something which may have a certain appeal in the very young but which becomes much less appealing when seen in an older man.Like many Hollywood attempts to copy European films, "Vanilla Sky" loses a good deal in translation. That fact, however, should not blind us to the good qualities of the original, a strange, haunting and sometimes poetic film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw this film and I must say it was one of the best films I have seen in a long time.Entertaining from start to finish, the movie begins with some witty banter from the main characters. Very well executed; Especially NORIEGA as Cesar. I haven't seen Vanilla Sky but it would be interesting to see if the non-comedic TOM CRUISE can deliver funny lines in the same way. I have heard that the witty banter has been re-written for Cruise. This would not surprise me.This film works on all levels for me. The SCRIPT is complex. There was a point in the film where I wondered if I knew what was going on. And the answer to that is I didn't. This was because the writers (&amp; director) did not want us to be ahead of Cesar. We shared his frustration, and as things were revealed to him, they were also revealed to us.The DIRECTION was sharp. Not too showy but still stylish. Nice camera angles, used only to enhance our experience. Never overdone.The ACTORS were consistently engaging. They also knew how to be funny when it was required of them. I feel many of the cast would do well in English speaking films.There was NO NEED TO REMAKE THIS. Although I speak a little Spanish, the person I saw this film with does not, and enjoyed it thoroughly. He expected a 'hard going continental movie' but came out of the cinema looking forward to his next viewing of this film.The English speaking audience is not as ignorant as distributors may think they are. CROUCHING TIGER is a good example of this.I sincerely believe ABRE LOS OJOS would have been a bigger international success if they had given it the chance.All I can do now is tell everyone they should see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great stuff. Spoiler warning, as usual.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are films which leave you with a warm glow inside. There are films which make you want to run from the cinema, get into a cab, head straight for the director's house and set it on fire. There are films which you forget as soon they end. And then there is "Abre los ojos". It is, firstly, a very appropriate title. This is a film about looking, about what's on the surface and - hey - what lies beneath. It's about wanting what you haven't got and not appreciating what you have. Our hero, Cesar, is a good-looking guy, with oodles of money, who seems, perhaps not surprisingly, happy enough. Women chase him, he has loads of friends. Life is good. But the mysterious Nuria chases him a bit too much. Plus, he keeps having these strange dreams. I will try not to give too much away, suffice to say that by the end of this movie, everything has changed, nothing is what it seems, and the line between fantasy and reality has all-but disappeared. Eduardo Noriega is excellent as Cesar, going from confident and successful to screwed-up and disfigured with skill and subtlety. Penelope Cruz is her usual attractive self - she has very little to do, really, but she does it well enough. As Nuria, Najwa Nimri is superb, bringing a genuine sense of menace and, later, vulnerability, to her role. The mind-bending madness of this film is such that you never quite know if what you are seeing is a dream or reality. Think "Total Recall" without the insane violence, bad acting and three-breasted Martian hookers. The last act, in which everything gets explained (or does it?) is truly inspired. As Cesar finally understands the implications (this bad dream is one he himself has invented) the film becomes truly warped and completely unpredictable. His psychiatrist (who looks uncannily like his father) goes mad, as he realises he only exists in Cesar's dream. It's a deranged but wholly compelling climax to a movie which takes one unpredictable turn after another. And to all those who question the worth of the "explanation" offered by "the French Guy" I say - perhaps that is only part of Cesar's dream too? Perhaps he's completely insane? Perhaps his addled mind has fixed on the idea of cryogenics as a potential solution to his awful dilemma. Only when this gets "explained" to him does he realise how ridiculous it all is, and he throws himself off the building as the only possible way to get out of it, and then the nightmare starts again. It would appear that in the world of "Abre los ojos", anything is possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when I had lost all faith in cinema, this film proves that it still possible for intelligent, sophisticated, profound, and very entertaining movies to be made - just not in today's Hollywood. Amenabar tops his previous film - the exciting but not very deep Tesis - with this one. Like many great movies, it is unclassifiable in terms of genre. Is it a romance? Yes. Is it a mystery? Yes. Drama? Yes. Sci-fi? Yes.Penelope Cruz looks great, but that's just a bonus in terms of this movie, since everything else is great also. The script, the performances, the music - everything is nearly perfect. Eduardo Noriega is great; the anger he brings to the role keeps his character from being just a pathetic monster and allows us to identify with him. Cruz, Fele Martinez (who looks _nothing_ like he did in Tesis), Chete Lera, Najwa Nimri, and Gerard Barray also give excellent performances. Amenabar obviously has many influences (including Vertigo, which he pays specific homage to), but he and screenwriter Mateo Gil put them together in a way that is consistently surprising, original, and thoughtful. Even after you know the twist at the end, the film stands up to repeat viewings quite well.I can only hope that The Others is as good, and I can't wait to see it. Vanilla Sky, the American remake, might be okay (Cruz is in it too), but it can't possibly be as good as this one. Since American remakes tend to chase the original out of the market, _please_ make every effort to watch "Open Your Eyes" before Vanilla Sky comes out in December. PLEASE. You won't be sorry. This is an all-time classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Brilliant Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenabar is truly a talent to watch. His debut feature "Thesis" was an amazing piece of work, and once I had viewed it, I was dying to see more from this talented director. It took me around another 2 years to see "Abre los ojos", but boy, was it worth the wait. It is without a doubt one of the BEST films I've EVER seen. To go into any of the plot would not be fair to those who haven't yet seen the film yet, as knowing nothing about this film is the perfect way to watch it. Everything about this film is perfect - the directing, the story, the cinematography and yes, even the ENDING!!!! Just a BRILLIANT piece of work, and I am eagerly waiting Amenabar's next film, "The Others"!!!!! Oh, and Penelope Cruz, has never looked better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard the director of Thesis was working on another film, I thought I couldn't wait to see it, unfortunatelly I had to wait almost two years after it was released in Spain to see it in Mexico. The wait was worth it, and Open your eyes has become one of my all time favorites (and so has Thesis). **possible spoiler ahead**- It is incredible how a person can combine drama,suspense, and even science fiction in one movie and develop it without any evident plot hole, and yet have the delicate touch to develop each character enough to feel what happens to them. Amenabar is obsessed with dreams and we could also see that in Thesis, but in this film the director just alternated the real world into the dream world, creating a film that is hypnotizing, thought provoking, difficult to forget, easy to love and extremely clever. Also look for the soundtrack, it's one of the best soundtracks i have heard in a long time, it present many spanish underground rock groups that are incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inventive, well executed thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Open Your Eyes is a great thriller, one of the 90's best. Alejandro Alamenabar is nothing short of a revelation, a genuine talent, who shows that he is capable of guiding good performances from his actors, creating suspense, and juggling a difficult narrative. He is a film maker to watch, one whose talent will hopefully grow.I will not try to describe the plot, summaries of it can be found here and elsewhere, suffice to say, the title clearly points to it- eyes shut for sleep or eyes shut to reality. Thus, that is Open Your Eyes basic construct, for Cesar, what is real?, what is a dream?, what is memory?, what is madness? The final revelation, felt a little flat, but it does work and, in afterthought, was not too bad. Often, when writers desire to reveal all the answers to a mystery and wrap up all the loose ends, it does have that disappointing effect, but, despite faltering in the conclusion, Open Your Eyes is fun and inventive enough throughout to leave most viewers satisfied.Eduardo Noriega is great as Cesar, especially considering he spends a good part of the movie hidden under makeup and mask. He portrays the aspects of Cesar cocky, suave,and later confused and desperate, perfectly. Penelope Cruz is always good. Her character lacks any real extraordinary traits, but Cruz makes her honest, plain, and desirable. You would definitely want to take her home to meet your mother. The real star of the movie, though, is its great construction and excellent execution by Alamenabar's pen and eye. Its got romance, suspense, surrealism, and science fiction melded together into one entertaining ride.In David Lynch's Lost Highway there is a line where Fred Madison says, "I like to remember things my own way...Not necessarily the way they happened." Open Your Eyes cant be summed up with that line, but, lets just say that it and Lost Highway could be cousins.</fullReview>

I don't think i could give away the plot even if i wanted to, it's a film that definitely calls for multiple viewings; once you reach the end, you'll wantto see this one a second time...it's been a few weeks since i've seen it, but i can still feel the impact it's made on my mind. The performances are great across the board, and Penelope Cruz always makes good eye candy, though she more than holds her own throughout the film (acting wise). i have to say though, this film has one of the most misleading box covers/posters i've ever seen; if you've seen the film you know what i mean. this film is not about Penelope Cruz looking sexy, swaying in the wind (though that doesn't hurt the film at all!); instead, it's one messed up, mind trip of a movie that is constantly challenging, and always rewarding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excuse the pun, but that's how I felt when I left the theater. I expected to see a romance, spell-bound and misguided as I were with Penelope Cruz (my guilty Spanish pleasure). Instead I saw a movie about Quasimodo in a sci-fi thriller. I felt cheated and robbed, but eventually I came to terms with this movie. It was spectacular. The plot has more twists than a box-full of licorice and Hollywood has nothing over the production value here. Just when you think you have the story figured out, it spins in a totally different direction. By the end, I thought I had seen ten movies rolled into one and I was exhausted. I felt gipped because Penelope Cruz did not figure prominently in the story (give me Jamon Jamon any day), and so I did my best to find faults in the movie. I couldn't find any. And maybe that's what I don't like about "Open Your Eyes". It's too goddamn perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OPEN YOUR EYES, "Abre los Ojos" is the second collaboration of three promising young Spanish stars (the director and the two male leads), joined by the incredible Spanish superstar Penelope Cruz. The trio debuted together in 1996/97's TESIS, another terrific thriller, which won the Spanish Oscar (Goya) in '97. This film makes one think, ponder over many difficult questions, such as what is reality, what isn't? Are these two often blurred? Is good physical appearance and wealth the definitive keys to success? Go see it and and you might open your eyes to these questions. You'll also see the hottest young Spanish director, male star(Eduardo Noriega already baptized by the media as the next Antonio Banderas), and the beautiful and talented Penelope Cuz, who at age 24 has already appeared in over a dozen European hits (Almodovar's LIVE FLESH, Bigas Lunas' JAMON, JAMON and Oscar-winning BELLE EPOQUE for starters)and is presently featured in several U.S. and U.K. releases, including "The Hi-Lo Country", "Twice upon a Yesterday", and two of the year's most important European releases later this year.

		<fullReview>With Abre los ojos, Alejandro Amenábar not only did not disappoint the moviegoers who admired his first film, Tesis (1996), but went much, much further and made a real tour de force, an amazing display of his talent, of which Tesis had just been a hint; Abre los ojos is much more ambitious and imaginative than his filmic debut, confidently trespassing the limits of the mere thriller and developing a haunting story which apparently starts off as a romantic drama but then unexpectedly and bravely veers into the grotesque, the unexplainable and truly terrifying, and even toys with science-fiction. The central idea of the script is not altogether new: similarities can be established with other well known american and spanish movies (which I won't mention so as not to give away the crucial plot twist), but what is important is that it is narrated with perfect rhythm to make the most of it, and this, together with a very solid cast, which includes two of Spain's finest young actresses, Penélope Cruz and Najwa Nimri, and the two actors made famous by Tesis, Eduardo Noriega and Fele Martínez (both of which, it must be said, have improved notably since then), gives as a result what can undoubtedly be considered one of the best films to come out of Spain in this decade. Amenábar should be heading for Hollywood... soon...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies that I have ever seen in my life even though I have watched lots of movies. This movie touches your heart so much that you get yourself involved with each and every character.Acting is superb especially from Penelope Cruz and Eduardo Noriega.The soundtrack and the background score of the movie is so excellent that it can bring tears from your eyes. There are so many scenes that are memorable especially the picture drawing scene between Penelope Cruz and Eduardo Noriega. Penelope Cruz looks so pretty and especially her smile and the way she smiles and the way she laughs is so beautiful. I think no other actress in the world does have that kind of innocent smile. She looks so beautiful in this movie. Guys like me will easily fall for her, no doubt.The twist at the end of the movie is so brilliant with its background score is superb that I have to consider this one of the best endings in the cinematic history.Direction is brilliant, screenplay is top-notch, cinematography is excellent.One surprising thing is that it does not have any heavy set-pieces, lacks action that is only at the lobby of the Life extension building, a car crash and a few gunshots even though its a science fiction movie.Kudos to Alejandro Amenábar for having directing such a beautiful movie movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A near-miss science fiction thriller; almost brilliant but not quite there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Essentially, this is an intriguing melding of two disparate worlds - one real, one imagined - with a blurring of the two somewhere in between. It's well handled with imagination and a genuine sense of feeling for its characters, but far too often descends into science-fiction clichés; with the final twenty-minutes in particular finding Amenábar disregarding the interpretive abilities of his audience and spelling the whole thing out in bold-type. It felt phony to me, and spoiled some of the deeper, personal interpretations that I had been working towards. Regardless, it was still an interesting and entertaining film for the most part; one that presented an intelligent if somewhat obvious science fiction concept in such as way as to feel fresh, and one that also offered one of the most striking and enigmatic opening sequences ever committed to film.It is notable that the all important foreshadowing of a certain sense of dream-logic is apparent right from the beginning of the film, with the cold and clinical accumulation of shots that lead us to our central protagonist's eventual introduction to the film establishing something of an off-kilter perspective that will escalate as the later themes of the film become clear. Regardless, that initial image of César, plunged into despair and frantically searching a barren ghost world for any sign of life is a potent one; recalling elements of Richard Matheson's I Am Legend as well as the subsequent horror film 28 Days Later (2002). It surmises the themes and ideas behind the film perfectly; with alienation, cultural dislocation and disorientation, nightmares, the disintegration of the ego and the depiction of the central character left cut off completely. These ideas are even more fascinating when we compare them to the eventual and somewhat obvious revelation of the plot and the idea of the car crash.Some of the more clichéd elements of the story foreshadow the hugely successful film The Matrix (1999), though there are deeper themes that are more psychological. You can also see the influence of Georges Franju's Eyes Without a Face (1960) and Hiroshi Teshigahara's The Face of Another (1966), which both deal explicitly with the idea of disfigurement creating a rupture in the protagonist's personality and the eventual means of correcting this creating yet another rift that pushes the drama into darker, more disturbing realms. There's also an interesting framing devise, in which the central character, hidden behind a ghostly, featureless mask, discuses his story with a psychologist. This aspect of the film was more interesting to me than the eventual reveal of the more fantastical ideas, and was really more in tune with the direction I felt the film should have explored in more detail.As it stands, Open Your Eyes (1998) is still an interesting film, and one that I can certainly understand the praise and adulation for. However, for me, it was not a complete success and too often fell back on clichés and easy answers. A real shame, since Amenábar is obviously an incredibly talented filmmaker, whilst the story at hand covers a number of themes that I usually find incredibly interesting. Sadly, the elements didn't come together in the all important final act which marred the experience. At any rate, it is still a film that I would recommend, despite elements of personal dissatisfaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how to start. I rented this movie a while back, along with other Spanish titles, only because I was curious to see Penelope's work in her native country and how Spanish is spoken in Spain. It turned out to be a great experience because I didn't expect this film to be mind blowing. I was also interested in this movie because on the back of the cover, it mentions Vanilla Sky. It did not occur to me that Vanilla Sky is a remake of Abre los Ojos because I had never seen Vanilla Sky and I'm glad I didn't because Los Ojos offers so much more than the remake.First of all, I thought the remake was horrible. Why make this movie again in the first place especially in the Hollywood fashion? In comparison, Vanilla Sky lacks the depth and the drama which Los Ojos doesn't fail to deliver. You can feel the emotion. Its quite thrilling, enigmatic, haunting, etc. The acting is superb, all the actors did an outstanding job. Though I'll admit that the film is not perfect and some parts might seem lame, but hey, its from 1997, made by a small production, and its very good for what its worth. What matters more to me is the storytelling and acting which is why I gave it 10 stars. The storytelling is spellbinding and brilliant. Its such an original story because its not a cliché of some sort and you can feel the depth and the art of the film. I recommend that you all see this version, don't even bother watching Vanilla Sky if you haven't already seen it. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note how this tightly follows the rule of twos, on several levels.At the level of writing, you have two friends, one the protagonist, the other his conscience. The protagonist deals with two girlfriends, one affirms his self-image, one destroys it; the plot involves the conflation of one character occupying two female bodies. Observing the story, you have one doctor attempting to analyze the narrative, and doctor number two attempting to synthesize the narrative. All the while, there is the ambiguity of an untrusted narrator -- implying two narratives that cross or skew in some way -- here involving "two faces".Visually, there are two fields: the foreground and background with no real focus on the middle; and there is Noriega's point of view vs. his obfuscated memory.

		<fullReview>Abre Los Ojos is the story of a César, a young, wealthy, good looking man in Madrid who has an overactive libido and suffers from vivid dreams and nightmares. His best and only friend Pelayo suffers from an inferiority complex when with his more popular and better looking friend César. Nuria is a party girl who is in love with César but he only wants her for no-strings-attached sex when other girls aren't available. Sofia is a beautiful girl with a passion for mimes who Pelayo wants for a girlfriend but his best friend César wants her too. The film begins as a romantic thriller and becomes a sci fi drama. Director/Writer Alejandro Amenábar had so much international acclaim with awards and nominations for this film that it was remade in the USA as Vanilla Sky with Cameron Crowe directing Tom Cruise in the lead role as David and Penélope Cruz reprising her role as Sophia. A young cast early in their acting careers includes Eduuardo Niriega is in the lead here as César with Cruz as Sophia, Fele Martínez as Pelayo, and Najwa Nimri as Nuria. Veteran actors Chete Lera is the psychiatrist Antonio and Gérard Barry is the mysterious Mr. Duvernois. There are so many complexities to this story in it's theme of what is real and what is not that it leaves the entire film open for many interpretations from it's very beginning to it's final scene. It's a good film but a little too ambiguous and dark for me and I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Abre los ojos" is a nice delightful Spanish surprise. The movie has an highly good script that is well constructed and directed perfectly by Alejandro Amenábar. A true eye opener.To be honest the movie was not always perfectly good. Maybe the beginning and especially the middle were dragging a bit too much at times, like more often is the case in European movies. However the last 30 minutes really make you forget the first and perhaps weaker 1 hour and 30 minutes. The ending is tense, mysterious and it keeps you guessing to the end what really is the truth. It really is 'edge-of-your-seat' stuff and perhaps even one of my favorite movie twists and ending.The movie is very professionally made and in many ways looks like an Hollywood production. So why this movie was ever re-made as "Vanilla Sky"? I have really no idea, guess it was made for all of those who were too lazy to read the subtitles of "Abre los ojos". The directing by Alejandro Amenábar was one of the highlights of the movie. He creates a perfect atmosphere and knows how to build up the story and the characters perfectly. Also the musical score by Mariano Marín and Alejandro Amenábar himself was surprising good and suited the movie perfectly.The movie can perhaps be described as a mix of "The Matrix" and "The Game" with a little flavor of "Total Recall". I don't mean by that, that this movie feels like a rip-off in any way, not in the slightest. Fans of any of those type of movies mentioned earlier, this movie is a must see for you!The mostly unknown actors were also surprising good. Eduardo Noriega, Penélope Cruz (who still was mostly unknown at the time, outside of Spain), Chete Lera and Fele Martínez all portray some most excellent characters with lots of profession.Highly recommendable for everyone, even those who normally don't watch European movies.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Even beliefs as abstract as this are challenged by the issues raised in the film. Although you have to watch with subtitles the film is very easy to follow and it runs smoothly. As I don't speak Spanish I found it more difficult to sense the emotion in the acting but from what I could see the acting was excellent and the film left me quite moved by the end. It just so happens that I am studying the theory of knowledge at AS level and we have reached a point in the course that covers precisely the same content that appears in the film: Descartes 'Brain in a Vat' and 'evil demon' argument leap to mind and are parallel with the situation in which Cesar finds himself in (unable to distinguish between the real state and the dream state) If you enjoy this film and have a genuine interest in all its fields then I suggest you take up the study of philosophy and become a recluse in society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>vs Vanilla Sky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with all things ethnocentric, your preference between the original (Abre Los Ojos) and the Crowe/Cruise remake (Vanilla Sky) will depend on your cultural background.Spanish speaking viewers with an understanding of Castilian Spanish and a rudimentary familiarity of Spanish popular culture/idioms are better equipped to understand the undertones and nuances of the original and thus have a greater potential for enjoying 'Abre Los Ojos'.Personally, I viewed Vanilla Sky first. I loved it. The soundtrack is hauntingly superior (Sir Paul?!) Cruise provided a familiar harbor to which I moored my suspension of disbelief long enough to give this flick a chance. Cameron Diaz was simultaneously f***able and despicable. Cruz plays a vision with whom I would spend an eternity exploring her every virtual nook and cranny.The original, 'Abre', did a wonderful job of weaving the dizzying sci-fi rooted plot wefts into a modern Madrilenian tapestry -- sacrilegious Spanish curse-words, seemingly untranslatable Spanish names (Pelayo!), boxy 70's architecture-decor and all. As with all sci-fi masterpieces (for which this film unarguably qualifies) the viewer is captured by the characters and their plight (ah, how we love to see the pretty rich ones suffer!) This happens well before we even realize this is a sci-fi flick. Too, bad it is only the pretty ones (e.g. Cruz &amp; Banderas) that translate into Hollywood material, as it was so very refreshing to watch Penelope in bed with a realistically good looking man, rather than an untouchable Hollywood icon as is Cruise.Director Amenabar, gives us both a taste of Madrid and its faux-nihilist undertones along with a vertigo-inducing sci-fi/fantasy flick -- an intoxicating blend of Almodovar with a twist of Serling. The abrupt end, however, left me wondering whether a sequel was being accommodated. Nevertheless, as with many memorable dreams, this one certainly ended with a jolt. The cinematography did well by not over-relying on special effects to carry the plot-line, but rather on competent lighting and angles to complement, not overwhelm, the story.To summarize, I liked 'Vanilla Sky' for introducing me to 'Abre Los Ojos' and I liked 'Abre Los Ojos' for introducing me to Amenabar -- both of which I will be viewing more of this coming year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>César (Eduardo Norieda) tells his story to a psychiatrist.He tells him how he fell in love with beautiful Sofia (Penélope Cruz) and how he got in the car of Nuria (Najwa Nimri), with whom he had the last affair with, and she committed a suicide by ramming the car into a tree.He survived from the crash but his face was damaged pretty badly.After this some very weird stuff starts happening.Abre los Ojos (1997) is an amazing movie from a talented young director called Alejandro Amenábar.This movie is a great mixture of drama, romance, Sci-Fi and thriller.What really fascinates me is that you can't tell whether César is dreaming or is he awake.What is real and what's not? That makes you wondering are we living in a reality or is life just a dream.The acting work in this Spanish movie is just amazing.Norieda is brilliant in the lead.Cruz has got the looks and the skills.Fele Martínez is terrific as Pelayo and so is Chete Lera as Antonio.In 2001 they made a remake to this movie by the name of Vanilla Sky with Tom Cruise in the lead.I haven't seen that yet so I can't tell anything about that.The original I enjoyed watching very much.I'm sure you would too.Just open your eyes and see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really good movie. I am still baffled as to why it was remade. Everything about this film leaves you wondering what is really going on. I had no idea what was going on in the movie, i was trying to figure things out and couldn't. I enjoyed this movie so much especially since i know Spanish as my second language. They changed too many things around in the subtitles, but that's OK. I let my mom watch this movie too, she said that she was scared by it. That's kind of funny, and sweet... but in a way i was scared with it too since you don't know what's going on and why people that are dead keep coming back to life. It's a mans fantasy turned against him into a nightmare. That's a true sense of what things could become to you. I recommend everyone watch this movie instead of Vanilla Sky. It's just so much better. I felt like Vanilla Sky was giving too much away. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film - try to see this before Vanilla Sky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had one regret while I was watching this film ? and it was a big one. I'd seen it before, almost line for line. No, I hadn't seen Abre Los Ojos before, but I had seen Vanilla Sky, its remake, and I really wish I had seen the original first. **Possible Spoilers Within**Abre Los Ojos tells an amazing story ? gorgeous, rich man sleeps with gorgeous girl, man meets the woman of his dreams, and previous gorgeous girl ends up being a psycho and causes her and man to be in a near-fatal car accident from which man emerges no longer gorgeous, but with a completely destroyed face. His life isn't so perfect anymore, and no matter how much money he is able to spend on getting his old physical appearance back he can't, and he loses touch with the woman of his dreams. This could all be a Danielle Steele novel (and may very well be) but it is told with such incredible intensity and beauty that it actually becomes believable. There are amazing moral issues brought up for the audience to ponder, and many plot devices that keep you guessing as to what is actually happening until even the last five minutes of the film. The acting is very rich, believable and many times raw with emotion and character. The visual imagery is absolutely stunning at certain points. A scene that takes place in a park when Penelope Cruz and Eduardo Noriega meet for the first time after his accident is incredibly beautiful and emotionally devastating. I am very excited to see future films of the director, Alejandro Amenabar because between this and The Others, I think his style is very polished and his vision is exciting. Considering he is a very young director, I think we are going to see him build a very impressive resume. There are many reasons I wish I had seen Abre Los Ojos before Vanilla Sky. Abre Los Ojos was obviously done on a much lower budget than its remake, and its simplicity is very endearing to its theme and plot. Having said this, I think I am one of the few people who really liked Vanilla Sky, and I still do. Vanilla Sky was filmed on a much higher budget, however, and was much slicker in its visuals. Cameron Crowe also did his usual brilliant job in utilizing perfect music to punctuate a scene. However, I can't help but think that I would have had less regrets in saying, `how did they handle this scene in Abre Los Ojos' while watching Vanilla Sky instead of the other way around, because I could just sit back and watch Vanilla Sky and enjoy the visualization and soundtrack. I highly recommend seeing Abre Los Ojos, then watching Vanilla Sky soon after to raise your own conclusions on which interpretation is better. Both films are very good, but it is my opinion that Abre Los Ojos yanks on your emotional cord a little more intensely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When first saw this film, I never expected such a masterpiece was possible...I heard about Alejandro Amenabar and his work, and a Genius....So I check 'Open Your Eyes' out.OH MY GOD! is this the best film I ever seen in all my 24 years living on this planet? it must be, because it haunted me for months on end- I felt like watching it again, I never fell in love with a movie before. It is a Sci-fi, a Horror, a fantasy, a bit of a love story, some added brilliant humour(Eduardo and Pelayo in a Volkswagen convertible talking about sex, and Pelayo answered like it was food "Im Staved")and it does not lose touch that it is a Dark Psychological Thriller, which Vanilla Sky overdoes its own silly humour and lost the darkness into a moral tale and dissipates into a disappointment. (Hence my Review for VANILLA SKY.)Most Hollywood Thrillers such as the Game, 8mm, with international Movie stars end up as predictable Mediocrity, but Abre Los Ojos is not like other that at all - it is a cut above the rest, It will keep you guessing. Know matter how intelligent the audience is, even if you have an IQ of 190, this movie will be way ahead of you - the story is smarter than you think....that is ONE reason why I love this movie.Sexy Eduardo Noriega is HOT! HOT! HOT! and makes Tom Cruise run for his money, which goes to show that a A-list Hollywood Actors should not be relied upon all the time.Please do not be intimidated by subtitles, even if they are not your thing, I hate reading them too, but you will still understand the movie because it is THAT awesome, the atmosphere, the plot, the music score is wonderful all the way from beginning to the end. It is a ride and a half, and worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not shallow at all (SPOILER included)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I believe this is a great movie. Not shallow at all as some reviewers say. Why? Because it deepens the relevance of constructivism in real and future life. Because it is about dealing with the past and karma in a reasonably subtle way (the end should have been a bit less explicit I agree).The main character is shallow and goes insane (and stays insane....in all further virtual deaths and reincarnations). It is only so because his inner soul is rotten and is not dealt with. Salvation will be there only if he accepts true friendship, love and hope. Otherwise he stays shattered and searching for (unreal) happiness.Open your eyes is a multi-layered description of this movie. Open your eyes concerning your own past, concerning the role and influence of media (and false promises) and concerning the (positive and negative) interpretations all of us make everyday. Therefore, I enjoyed this movie in a spiritual way.People who love this movie, I strongly recommend films from directors Medem (Tierra, Los Amantes and above all Sex and Lucia) as well as Almodovar (Live Flesh, Todo Sobre mi Madre).9/10 - memorable plot and movie. Unfortunately, the enchantment within the movie was lacking or minimalistic. Can't have it all right? ;-))</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thematic spoilers, but no plot revealed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, without exaggeration, the best movie I have ever seen. It is the most subtle exploration of the nature of reality: sanity vs. insanity, dreams vs. illusion, perception vs. truth.This is achieved through skillful and nuanced acting (particularly by Noriega, Martinez, and Nimri, but Cruz is wonderful as always) and EXTREMELY insightful direction. The editing (something I almost NEVER notice in a film) is brilliant.I have seen several reviewers complaining that the ending felt "spoon-fed". These people missed the point entirely: that you cannot accept anything you see as "truth"- what you are seeing is being filtered through the narrator's perception. (And what makes you so sure you can trust your own senses, anyway?) Whether or not you accept what's on the spoon is your choice.A lot of people also seem very quick to recommend this film over Vanilla Sky (or vice-versa). I saw Abre Los Ojos first and liked it better; I thought the acting and plot were more subtle, and that the additions and pacing changes in Vanilla Sky did "dumb it down" slightly. However, this is a film that you need to think about and question as it is in progress, and for most Americans, there just isn't time to do that in Abre los Ojos. (I am NOT insulting my fellow Americans when I say this; I'm just pointing out that we are not used to having to follow so quickly, because American movies don't tend to require it.) The slower pacing of the ending of Vanilla Sky is better suited to some of us. I also think that the remake of Vanilla Sky also made it more accessible to many Americans in two ways: first, it's easy to miss the subtleties of the acting when you're busy reading subtitles; second, visual images that are familiar to the audience (i.e., New York vs. Madrid) are more effective.I don't mean to discount Vanilla Sky. It is also an excellent film. With the exception of a few additions, it is very faithful to the original. The casting is superb (I didn't like Cameron Diaz's Julia, but I blame that on changes in the script, not the actress; when you have more to say, you don't have to bring it all across in your face).If you don't like this film, think about it for a few days, talk it over with your friends, and then watch it again. Then do the same for Vanilla Sky. There is a great wealth of things to think about in both movies: separately, or comparing them to each other.If you don't like to think about what you're watching, don't bother seeing either of these films. There is nothing wrong with this. But don't give a brilliant film a bad review just because you didn't want to take the time to explore it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning, disturbing exposition on the nature of reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not know this film until I came across it by accident as late night offering on the UK's Channel 4.One of the most thought-provoking and generally disturbing concoctions I have seen. What starts as a slightly uninvolving love story gradually becomes riveting. You need to see this film, as I luckily did, without prior knowledge. My cynical concern that I would eventually be disappointed by an unsatisfactory or annoying 'explanation' of what the hell was going on was entirely unfounded.A film which defies classification: essentially science fiction, but deeply intelligent and without any Hollywood soppiness or SFX getting in the way of a good story.Some say the ending is ambiguous - I say absolutely not so. a beautifully executed finale, with just enough information to allow the viewer to use his own intellectual apparatus to work it all out. You'll think about this one for days. A stunning piece of work questioning the nature of reality itself. A treat indeed for fans of quantum physics or other disturbed individuals of the sort who liked Photographing Fairies &lt;G&gt;.I've yet to see Vanilla Sky; indeed I hesitate to. If, as I fear, the remake is a Hollywood dumbed-down version with everything spelt out for a mass market, it would be a shame, and irritating to boot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vanilla... what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I'm not ever going to watch Vanilla sky....no,no,no! Why should I? Thanks Amenabar for this movie and, with all the respect for director Cameron Crowe, I suggest all of you movie-fans not to watch his remake unless you watch this before. How can I be so sure? Just take a look at all the remakes and sequels made by Hollywood directors in the last decade and compare them to their respective originals; see the lack of ideas which has infected the Hollywood scene. I have to be honest, I tried to watch Vanilla sky, just to satisfy my curiosity, a couple of months after watching Abre Los Ojos, and I had to switch it off after the first thirty minutes! No way, the two movies are incomparable.Abre Los Ojos is a vivid example of fresh and genuine screen writing and very good acting by actors who were beautifully unknown, at least in 1997. Eduardo Noriega (who plays Cesar, the main character) is as deep and expressive when he plays normally as when he wears a mask as when he's covered in disfiguring make-up! Najwa Nimri (who plays instead the devilish woman who causes all of Cesar's misfortunes) is very convincing, she almost scared me! Penelope Cruz doesn't need any introduction, and I think this is one of her best movies. Hats off to Alejandro Amenabar, who actually wrote the story which fueled not only VSky, but a lot more movies (what about Memento's rewinding flashbacks? and the Matrix' parallel lives?) I may be mistaken, but as far back as I can remember I can find only one movie, released prior to this one, which presents some aspects that we find here much better elaborated, and that's Jacob's Ladder (who have seen both the movies can understand what I'm talking' about). Anyway, I can tell that since I've seen this movie'trailer I always thought there was something strange in it, something that I cannot explain yet now that I've watched it several times; It may be its dark, oppressive mood that steals the air. Or the "insanity" of the whole story once you realize, at the end of the movie, what you've been actually watching. But still there's something fascinating about Abre Los Ojos, something that makes me place it on a peak where only a masterpiece can stand! You people gotta watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Abre los ojos (Open your eyes)was released in 1996, that's two years BEFORE drama Truman Show and three years before Matrix.The picture wasn't so critical acclaimed as TS '98 &amp; Matrix'99, but it's much better than other two orwellian movies of this era. I'm not saying: Truman show &amp; Matrix sucks (I voted first 8/10 and second 10/10), but TS has got too much talk-show sugar (Oprah) and Matrix could be something more than just a non-animated version of KOUKAKU KIDOUTAI (Ghost in the Shell). ALO '96 hasn't got gorgeous special effects as Matrix trilogy (both sequels are ), however is very believable. This picture is one of my favorite movies and deserves to be in TOP 250. Alejandro Amenábar, director of ALO, has made The Others '01, which is in TOP 250. The Others at least aren't so bad as Vanilla Sky with Tom Cruise and not so good as ALO.If you haven't watch this movie, you've missed masterpiece about Narkissos and his nightmare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being a little harsh on Vanilla Sky aren't we?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, I was reluctant to see Vanilla Sky with so many bad reports I was getting from people who had seen it in the cinema, but eventually I got around to watching it and I was simply amazed at how fantastic the film really was. So interested in Vanilla Sky, after watching it a couple more times over the next few months I hunted down the original "open your eyes" and finally seen it last night. I must say I was disappointed by open your eyes. This possibly is because I know the entire story from Vanilla Sky, but because there were different actors in it I expected something different..which obviously I didnt get. Im sure its quite possible that people who watched Open Your Eyes first feel the same about Vanilla Sky, (maybe thats why so many people are putting Vanilla Sky down so much) so I'll try to focus on the few differences in the two films.In Vanilla Sky it was more apparent that Tom Cruise was a young successful rich man, with his nice flat, nice car, and you could see his power in the company. I thought this was a vital factor in the plot - the man who appears to have everything. Whereas in Open Your Eyes Eduardo Noriega appeared to be normal, and didnt really show any signs of being excessively wealthy.Cameron Diaz was absolutely fantastic in Vanilla Sky as the jealous lover, when she lured Tom into the car you could see his motivation - she appeared harmless and fun loving - easy going etc., no harm in getting into the car with her, once the car got moving she played the psycho brilliantly. Hats off to Cameron, what a job she done! The lover in open your eyes didnt quite deliver this same performance, her performance was a little plain.Aside from that, there are lots of other things that Vanilla Sky did a lot better. They didnt emphasise life enhancement as much, which was great because the film had you baffled until the end. Open your eyes made this a little too obvious.Finally the end scene on top of the roof. Vanilla Sky was much, much more epic, much more full of emotion and feel, unlike open your eyes, and surely if anythings important in a movie..its the ending.I would suggest watching Vanilla Sky before Open Your Eyes, I think the acting was superior, and the whole film was so, so much more intriguing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was recommended to me by someone who rejected practically every film released in the last several decades(not that I'm saying the majority of films released have been good), so I had to check it out for myself. On the whole, I was extremely disappointed. The story was fairly interesting, and true enough I had no idea exactly where it was going, but the characters were unbelievable, unappealing, and prompted no sympathy whatsoever except for Cesar's best "friend" who he runs over in pursuit of his own lusts. Cesar himself might have deserved some sympathy for his plight had he not merely wallowed in self-pity and remain self-centered throughout the film. Only redeeming qualities are the cinematography and inclusion of the beautiful Cruz in the cast. Compared to the films of David Lynch by some. Abre los ojos had the potential greatness of Lynch's one true masterpiece, "The Elephant Man," but instead goes the route of most all of Lynch's other movies in an absurd, pretentious, and unfulfilling means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the film is suspenseful enough to watch through once as you try to guess what's going on, it certainly isn't original and "mind-blowing", and resembles more a Twilight Zone episode ("Shadowplay") or the Philip K. Dick short story "I hope I shall arrive soon"(which IS mind-blowing). But originality isn't my criticism, it's the societal "norms" the film shows without question, like Altman's "The Player": our hero is an unresistable, good-looking, rich, talented white male; these are enviable ideals and only his amiable, non-strutting demeanor makes him a sympathetic character. When he loses his good looks, rather than try to adjust as we average/even ugly audience members have to all our lives, he decides he must committ suicide. The film never questions this price of vanity since he's rich and can afford to eventually buy his looks back; this is another depressing truth, since all the advances we hear about in genetic/medical research will serve only the rich, and never trickle down to the common human. Like a fairy tale plot of riches to rags to riches, this story can be a bitter pill to swallow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slushy melodrama is another example of technical mastery and considerable confidence - together with vaguely defined notions of radical story-telling, spirituality and genre-defying leaps - put to narrative and thematic ends that essentially insult the audience. It could have been a compelling piece of pop culture,with traces of Beauty And The Beast and The Matrix and so many romantic fantasies of renewal and immortality, but the movie is so ponderous (despite the superficial gloss and messy twists and turns) and so full of self-regard that the conceit seems mostly like laziness - akin to What Dreams May Come and City Of Angels in supposing that the stuff of great romance can be tweaked through the most cursory evocation of metaphysics and other worlds. Noriega's petulant lady-killer is a lazy creation; the movie never seems remotely human (Cruz has only a few bright moments at the start before settling into window-dressing) so its potential for emotional impact is limited. It does deserve points for its fearless flirting with absurdity though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Beatle, No Redhead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's an interesting case, where the Hollywood remake is better.First, an exploration of why I didn't particularly like this. Superficially I should. I'm fascinated by films that are about films or something like them: manufactured illusion. And its especially nice when characters wonder about where they belong, which layer of reality is true, what it means to be fabricated and how to jump levels. Its all about lucidity.But I'm interested in this because I'm interested in tricks that storytellers can use to make their stories more engaging. So its important to me that when these devices are used, they are used to "fold" the audience into the story. For instance, a simple fold is when we have an on- screen audience that our characters perform to.Its all a much grander and richer notion than self-reference or reflexivity. Worthy of knowing because of the way we build our own stories in life, often using movies.These storytelling devices, a bewildering variety of them are most employed by our Spanish- related filmmakers. Okay, now this.The story in its details is just this sort of thing. But look closely. It is a story that exists independent of the cinematic means to tell it. It uses no cinematic techniques, like say the wonderful "Sex and Lucia." It seems to have been conceived as a book, with no visual hook. Things are "explained." There are some devices like the mask and the mime, but they are grafted on the story-as-words not the story-as-images.To see what I mean, see this and the remake. Crowe is no master filmmaker, but he does know a few things about migrating a story into cinema. Watch it. Its almost precisely the same script, and has Penelope as well. It has Cruise, possibly an apt choice for a self-absorbed man who admires how he is admired. But it also has some very clever touches that aren't in the original. My two favorite are the talk about who was your favorite Beatle, and the insertion of Alicia Witt as the secretary at "the company."That Beatles bit showed that Crowe understood the nature of the defect in the original and the mechanics of projection needed to bring the story into the cinematic. Beatle Paul is the right answer there, and the mechanism has to do with shifting identity, not keeping the same identity in a shifted reality.And the insertion of the redhead was a kind of ultracinematic shorthand. Some people, objects, shots, effects carry special meaning. This woman, as a girl, stunned the film world in how Lynch used her in the otherwise unimaginative "Dune." For years afterward she was inserted in movies to recall that role, or rather the place those few minutes represented. Its the notion that a woman can appear once in your vision and every element of the world is different after that, sort of a diffuse witchcraft of noir. That she was there showed us, the audience that Crowe understood what he was reaching for.None of that is here in the original. Its a rather conventional sci-fi story told in the most mechanical of ways with no mixing of the confusions of reality in the story with the realities of film. And us.And wasn't there some added ambiguity in "Vanilla" about the detective being the hero's father?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

The acting is also better in my opinion.I'm not saying that vanilla sky's acting wasn't good.no...Tom cruise did a good job there but still the original wins.You can totally feel the joy,pain and anger in the characters.as for the soundtrack,I believe both movies have great soundtracks.It's unfair to say vanilla's soundtrack was better.the whole abre los ojos's soundtrack was original ,while vanilla only had one original song(Paul McCartney). Amazing music score.I enjoyed the movie.Overall,It made more sense to me.I highly recommend it to people.

Makes you think about how we define reality, what we base love and our perception of others on, the trappings of society and our own minds, etc. And it's not just cerebral, it keeps you on the edge and involved until the end. You don't have to work to think about it like in many intellectually significant movies, it's so well thought out and executed that it just shakes it into you - you don't think the stuff, you feel it, then let all the thinking come later. Incredible movie. Not to mention that Penelope Cruz has to be the most beautiful girl ever to walk the face of the Earth and can act, as well. I can say without absolutely certainty you should see this and with fair certainty that you'll find it worth owning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Abre los ojos (Open your eyes), 1997, which most people might know better in its American remake Vanilla Sky (with Tom Cruise and Penélope Cruz) by Cameron Crowe. I'm glad I haven't seen the remake when I had the chance some years ago - my mother's been a huge fan of Tom though gladly her interest declined with his Scientology and Katie deliriums - cause it would have spoiled this very nice movie.The story ? Handsome and rich guy César (Eduardo Noriega) leads an epicurean life of one-night stands until one of them, Nuria, wants - not just a little crave for chicken at 2 in the morning - no she really wants him for more than one night. Of course, our womanizer doesn't give a damn and while trying to escape from her at his party, he comes to meet the beautiful Sofia (Penélope Cruz) and.. obviously she turns the Don Juan into a lovestruck Prince Charming. It would have ended there and you had the classical New-York - ahem Madrid - based romantic comedy. You can stop here if you don't want to be spoiled.But, here comes Nuria again. She offers him a lift in her car, and tired Don Juan accepts. He doesn't freak out when his driver swallows a bunch of pills and begin to talk about happiness. He does when she drives faster and faster. Caramba, we're out of the road. She dies. He lives. His handsome face looks more like the Elephant man's now. But it's not the worst. The flash forwards sequences of our protagonist show that he is now in an asylum, accused of murder.I'm not saying more.

		<shortDescription>Open Your Eyes For This One...It's Totally Worth It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe Alejandro Amenábar is among the finest directors in Europe today and 'Abre Los Ojos' is one of my favourite films. I'm glad to have seen this original, imaginative, involving and gripping film before watching the America remake. I don't mean to diss the remake as it is almost a more expensive scene by scene copy (that is lacking in imagination) and he characters were less believable.Not only did Amenábar direct 'Abre Los Ojos', he co-wrote and scored the film (as he did with his debut feature film 'Tesis' and his subsequent films 'The Others' and 'Mar Adentro') which itself is proof of his multiple talent. The execution is effectively simple and minimal as the director relies less on special effects and lavish sets and the result is an authentic look. 'Abre Los Ojos' looks real but at the same time there is a surreal feel to it, a dreamlike feel, as if the viewer is a spectator in the main character's dream. This is exactly how Amenábar succeeds, because he involves the viewer, not only through the character but through the atmosphere he creates.The cinematography and score are superb. The visuals are stunning and the editing is first rate. Amenábar and co-writer Mateo Gil have done an solid job in the writing department.The performances are first rate. Eduardo Noriega effortlessly carries the role. Penelope Cruz and Fele Martínez performs naturally. Najwa Nimri is spellbinding. Chete Lera is very good.Needless to say, I'd definitely recommend people to watch this before 'Vanilla Sky' as the element of suspense is important. After rewatching it, I can add that 'Abre Los Ojos' has great repeat value too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An review of Abre los Ojos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Abre los Ojos is a film that will keep you on your toes and leave you with a dissatisfied feeling because the ending is for the most part open for interpretation. In my opinion there was no real clear and concise ending. A classic love story filled with classic jealously and rage, and a depressing outcome once the truth is revealed. During the time in which he is dreaming, many things happen that reality could not explain. For example, when he smothered who he thought was Nuria but was in fact Sofia makes the viewer think that Cesar is clearly delusional. This is when I began to question what was taking place and I began to have an inkling that this may not be reality. Abre los Ojos reminded me of the film The Matrix in that it felt like Cesar was living in a fantasy world that was controlled by something beyond his control, in this case it was his mind. I felt as if it was a bit predictable if you stopped to question the events that were occurring.One of the themes of the movie is that there are more to people than appearance and to never judge a book by its cover. This comes into play when Sofia did not want to be with Cesar anymore after his accident and this induced the whole series of tragic events that were yet to come. If Sofia had not been so superficial and saw past his deformed face that he acquired in the tragic car accident, then nothing bad would have come. In addition, love is a prominent theme in that he loved Sofia and he wanted her to love him in return and an ex lover became jealous because she loved Cesar and this love that she had for him led to his tragic fate. Overall, I feel as if this movie was a bit predictable and could have gone in a different direction with a little reworking but overall it was a solid plot that was enjoyable if watching strictly for entertainment purposes instead of with the intent to analyze.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent and subtle mind-trip, but story is a little weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Spanish film is quite the mind-trip. And while I found it a little unsatisfactory in the story, I found it compelling enough over all to be quite affected by it.One of the things that I really liked about this film is that it covers mystery, drama, horror, and science fiction without feeling inorganic. There are no bombastic shifts in direction and at times, things can get quite surreal, especially with crazy dreams being thrown into the mix, but while it can be a little disorienting, it ultimately plays to the strength of the work. At first, it feels like you're watching a drama, but after a very crazy car ride, you start to feel like you've traveled down a rabbit hole along with our protagonist.That's a compliment.The direction has a very strong focus and while normally playing things very "real", it highlights very well when dream elements go quite surreal. Tech and craft is all quite good. The one place that's a little weak is in overall story. When it's all said and done, it doesn't leave a lot of anything in terms of what it was that we watched. There is some strains of inner conflict that can be detected--but either the writing is too subtle or it just doesn't go far enough in exploring how one man's behavior can turn his world into a nightmare.When it's at its most surreal, it's like your watching the earlier parts of The Matrix and sometimes even a David Lynch film. The dramatic elements are pleasant enough, but I wish there were a little more meat. Nonetheless, this is an impressive work, especially as it shifts its nature seamlessly as the film goes on. When it was finished, I myself had some doubts as to the reality which I perceived and that shows quite an impact. It's good stuff for those looking for a subtle mind-trip, but I don't know if it's for everyone. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made, with original story. Watch this before "Vanilla Sky"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film on which "Vanilla Sky" was based. It is a superior film than the remake as usually the case. Where as "Vanilla Sky" was a much slicker production this one is much more story and character driven. A movie like this must be allowed to let the story unfold, and this version take its time to do so.The story is that of a man who seems to have everything now finds himself in a nightmarish situation, his face is destroyed and his freedom gone. He begins to question his reality and his sanity as he tries to sort things out with his Psychiatrist. The movie questions what is reality and is he really living it or dreaming it. With a premise like that, a movie needs to have a narrower focus. The problem I had with "Vanilla Sky" was that the direction and the production seems to have gotten in the way of the story. A convoluted story got more messed up because the director, the sound guys, set designers and the actors couldn't figure out when enough is enough. I've notice in a couple of other European thrillers of recent vintage that the same can be said, that less is more.The acting in this movie is very good. Eduardo Noriega playing the lead was very good so was Chete Lera who played the psychiatrist. They both played their roles so as not to overwhelm the story and get in the way. They have a much better chemistry than their U.S. counterparts. Lera especially showing genuine concern for his patient.Personally I wish I had not seen "Vanilla Sky" before this movie, because this movie tells the story so much better. Less slick but with better patience for the material something that I think is missing in American movies these days. I know that he's been getting terrible response lately but I think M. Night Shyamalan might have been a better choice as director for "Vanilla Sky" because he too allows his stories to unfold and not rush to the plot twist, just as Alejandro Amenábar did with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Que es para ti la felicidad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this a couple of days after watching Amenabar's "Tesis", which did indeed screw with my mind. This film took that feeling to a whole new level, and I loved it. The plot is so superbly played out that it was equally enjoyable, if not more so, the second time around. Vanilla Sky, on the other hand, was a disappointment. With all the subtleties of Abre Los Ojos removed, we were spoon fed the entire film, which was laced with excessive special effects not present in the original.Abre Los Ojos faces the viewer with questions of identity and perception, happiness, dreams and reality (i.e does what it says on the tin) and the best thing about it is that it leaves you with enough gaps to fill in yourself. It is this engagement coupled with the presentation of a twisted reality that makes this film a worthy example of Spains' ultra-stylish new wave thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Eyes' feels kind of uneven, even though the plot is fresh and surprising...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Open Your Eyes César (Eduardo Noriega) is a young and wealthy womaniser, who has a slightly jealous best friend, Pelayo (Fele Martínez). At César's birthday party, he meets Pelayo's date, Sofía (Penélope Cruz), and instantly warms to her, and they end up spending the night together, but only enjoying each other's company. When Nuria (Najwa Nimri), one of César's latest conquests who has been developing an unhealthy obsession with him, crashes her car with him in the passenger's seat, it leaves César horribly disfigured. Feeling his life is essentially over, César becomes withdrawn and angry, but his relationship with Sofía helps him to see the world in a new light. He cheers up even more when he learns of the possibility that doctors may be able to reconstruct his facial features, but everything changes when a face from the past comes back to haunt him.It's great that Channel Four broadcast the original 'Open Your Eyes' the night before the 2001 Hollywood remake, 'Vanilla Sky' (which is also good, but suffers from the same problems), was broadcast. Problems, you say? Well, writer/director Alejandro Amenábar has made a very interesting, involving film, but he can't really balance the romance/drama and mystery/thriller elements too well. 'Eyes' feels kind of uneven, even though the plot is fresh and surprising. However, the performances are good, and I can see why Cameron Crowe decided to rehire Penélope Cruz for the remake, as she really is a radiant presence. Just a note, though: this film is more of a thriller, while 'Vanilla Sky' is more of a romance, so I guess your preference depends on which genre you like more, I suppose. I don't have a favourite out of the two, so I think they are both good...just not great.~ 7/10 ~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>kudos to amenabar for making what is **CLEARLY** a very influential film, evidence being that the themes addressed in this movie eventually find their way into films like The Matrix, the Sixth Sense, Mulholland Drive, and others.my only criticism is that the movie introduces the whole "virtual reality/memory implant" theme a bit too late: at the very end when Clause 14 is mentioned at the Life Extension office. the audience **IS** aware that something about life extension is relevant to the movie's final outcome, but life extension is NOT THE SAME AS virtual reality, so the whole virtual reality theme came too abruptly for my taste.despite that, the fact that Los Ojos makes such a good first stab at the subject matter entitles this film to a ranking on the IMDB top 250 in my opinion.</fullReview>

By "American style" I particularly mean that it does not cause headaches to non-domestic (Spanish) audiences. On the contrary, I was able to enjoy this movie for its twisted but understandable plot and the nice cast. Eduardo Noriega fit very well into his role, and so did Penélope Cruz and the others. Because of my delight I had to see "Vanilla Sky", too. But I thought the remake to be unnecessary (but not necessarily worse). It doesn't offer anything else (except for constantly smiling characters).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Alfred Hitchcock teamed up with Louis Bunuel to make a psychological thriller with metaphysical overtones and mind- bending narrative twists, that movie might resemble "Abre los ojos." You follow the mental misadventures of a young man in a strange, discontinuous world of fluid identity and deja vu as he uncovers the truth about his life.Don't stay up too late afterwards asking yourself "what is real or "how much of reality is a mental construction after all".

Of course, by this date, I have seen VS and know that my original dread of what would become of this highly original tale in the hands of the Hollywood machine was valid. If you haven't seen this film, what are you waiting for? If you've seen Vanilla Sky and not this, do yourself a huge favor and see what VS should/could have been.

I enjoyed that Movie more, - even i saw it in spanish. I ordered the DVD because Penelope Cruz is in it - funny because she is together with the Vanilla Sky actor Tom Cruise now. So these are the nice Crosslinks between Vanilla Sky and Open your eyes. I enjoyed the Movie a lot and I am astonished how unpopular it is in my country - also about the missing english Voicetrack on DVD. So the Movie seems more independent to me, but its really nice and strange. The 8 is because its just to have in spain. In english it would be worth a nine.

		<fullReview>I watched the US remake of this movie, Vanilla Sky, 2 times before watching the original. Vanilla Sky, I thought, was an incredible movie. I thought it was incredibly original and really developed the characters. I knew it was originally this Spanish movie, and it took me at least 3 weeks to try and find Abre Los Ojos because it wasn't available anywhere. Abre Los Ojos was even more incredible than Vanilla Sky, if only because it's the actual original version and Vanilla Sky is such a rip off of it. It seems like the writer for Vanilla Sky watched Abre Los Ojos, copied down the subtitles and that was the script of Vanilla Sky. I know lots of movies are made this way, but it irks me that Cameron Crowe got so much credit for Vanilla Sky being this totally thought provoking, original movie that he wrote. Although, I must admit, being from the States the scene of the first dream of Vanilla Sky where Times Square is completely empty was a lot more powerful than that scene in Abre Los Ojos. Alejandro Amenábar is an incredible writer/director and Abre Los Ojos is a real triumph for him.</fullReview>

It was so fascinating.In my opinion, the underlying message of this film is that what we accept to be reality is not necessarily the truth and can be turned upside down in an instant.I would rate the performances in this film very highly. Until I watched this film, I didn't really know anything about Penelope Cruz, other than she was the woman who was going out with Tom Cruise. But after this, it became clear to me that she is a very talented actress. I would also like to praise Eduardo Noriega for his performance as Cesar. I found it moving and also he brilliantly conveyed the emotional torment that his character was feeling. He really did seem lost. I can not mention all of the performances that really struck me in this film as it was almost all of them.I think that the title of this film gives everyone a perfect motto for life. 'Abres los ojos' or 'Open your eyes'. I would strongly recommend this film to everyone. It has everything that I think makes a good film. Conflict, drama, love, friendship, thrills, the ability to make you feel empathy towards all the central characters, even a touch of comedy.I have not seen the remake, Vanilla Sky, yet but I do hope that it is true to this original. I also hope that Tom is as good as Eduardo.You must watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, stupid summary line I admit. But this film is a must watch for the character acting alone. The actors/actresses in this film were unknown (including Penny Cruz) but they all played their roles as though they were really living it (or were they really living it???)The shameful thing is I wouldn't ever have bothered to watch this film until I heard about Vanilla Sky having a good story line. But the Hollywoodization of a classic put me right off so I went looking for the real thing. And this is the genuine article, make no mistake. No oscar nominations, no big headed actors wanting more 'limelight' or 'screen time'. Simply a long humourous and painful journey through a man's shallow existence (well sort of existence).I won't explain the story here, suffice it to say it will satisfy romantics and sci-fi fans for the emotion and detail. I lean towards the sci-fi side but was surprised to see myself get so involved with the characters' lives and motivations. Maybe I saw some of my own characteristics and shortfalls in there somewhere...And don't think you'll be disappointed with the visuals just because this version wasn't done in Hollywood either. Its eery in places and realistic too without ever going over the top. Very well balanced overall.I gave it a 9 out 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>source material for "vanilla sky" is a slow build but ultimately scores</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No american male actor less handsome than tom cruise could've filled Eduardo Noriega's shoes in this really out there mind trip of a movie. trying to explain the plot would only hurt your viewing entertainment, however, i will warn that the small yellow subtitles are sometimes hard to see and, making it even harder, the actors talk very fast so they don't stay on the screen for very long. also the plot has a lot of building to do to achieve its startling climax. this is good in that you get to see the actors work with an intriguing script (and writer/director Alejandro Amenábar work in a few cinematic tricks as well) but it is also bad in that a bit too much of the time the film feels static as the banter tries to convey the exposition, but all in all "open Your Eyes" is a winner of a film despite these hurdles. Penelope Cruz is as usual serviceable, though she is still an actor yet to impress me. the aforementioned Noriega is phenomenal and if any one had to travel across the ocean for the remake, it should've been him. Emoting variously from behind a wall of disfiguring make-up, an actual mask, and his own Greek god face, Noriega really gets the audience to empathize with his character, a necessity for the final mindbending revelation to be believable. haven't seen "vanilla sky" yet, but if it is anywhere near as good as this, and in english (or even with bigger, slower subtitles) then it's got to be a knockout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I already had pieced the twists of this flick together halfway through after many hint-filled reviews, but I didn't care. This is great acting, great writing, and great directing. Forget Vanilla Sky, this is the one to watch. As Cesar goes from rich playboy to disfigured freak, Sofia goes from girl of Cesar's dreams to the unattainable figure of salvation, as the film twists and turns, you are mesmerized. This is a really solid, imaginative film, and Amnebar is an incredible talent. I've never been a Penelope Cruz fan, and I don't think she's as luminous as everyone says. In this film, however, Cruz is sultry, sweet, and angelic. Eduardo Noriega is charming then sympathetic, and Amnebar's music is wonderful. This is a beautiful and tragic love story, one that you actually care about, unlike most films where the question isn't whether or not they will get together, but how they will get together. In a film like this, we honestly don't know. I love this film, and you will at least find it entertaining/interesting. If you're considering watching Vanilla Sky, watch this first. Its better to see the low budget and superior version before the big-budget inferior one. Go rent it, its worth it.p.s. I did like how in Vanilla Sky there was more character development and explanation of the subconscious' hallucinatory actions, which was nice. Aside from that explanation, Vanilla Sky is as I said before, inferior.</fullReview>

The movie is at its best when it focuses on the mind of the main character; the psychological aspact of this film is fascinating. Personally, I would have been satisfied if the film would have ended in the abstract, but instead we get a Matrix-like ending which is only so-so. However, the experience of watching the majority of Open Your Eyes is rewarding, and I recommend this it for those who like unusual films with complex, twisting storylines.*** (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a glorified soap opera. You have the selfish guy who wants his friends girl, when he can have any girl. The dream girl, she's the one, that turns out to be a slut and never seemed interested in the friend, or the selfish guy. Plot holes that never, never get filled in. An ending that doesn't help. A script that changes so dramatically you'd think the writer fell asleep during the scripting and woke up the next morning, forgetting what was written, did not review, and came up with a new idea. Movies that start as drama shouldn't switch over into sci-fi. Why? Because, you get use to the soap opera acting in the first half; then, when the film switches to sci-fi, you're stuck with soap opera acting for the duration. Let's use Total Recall as an example. The characters in that film never mixed useless melodramatics into their situation. They dealt with the problem and moved on. Abre Los Ojos if full of melodramatic performances that never achieve any completion. At the end of the film I was left asking myself what were some of the characters reasons for being there? The whole accident seemed unnecessary, hence eliminating the use of the characters directly involved. Also, if what the end reveals is true, than what was with the dreams? If there was a flaw in the system, why wasn't that explained? This was a 15 minute short film stretched into an annoying almost 2 hour waste of time? Don't discount me yet, I am anxious to see the new Crowe/Cruise/Cruz version. Maybe it will answer the questions raised from Abre Los Ojos. But maybe not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a movie is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely disagree with all these people who want to define a movie saying it's a comedy, or a drama or a sci-fi, or whatever. I think a movie is just a movie, a story to tell. As Oscar Wilde said I think there are just well made or not well made movies. "Abre los ojos" (Open your eyes) is a well made movie. Noriega's performance was terrific. Penelope did just what the movie needed: a beauty, an inspiration. As you can see she was the reason for Cesar's dream. According to Life Extensions you could have a dream from the moment you came back to life after being in the refrigerator, if you chose to sign that 14th clause. César was so obsessed with Sofia that he signed and asked a dream with his old handsome face and Sofia's love. The problem was his trauma with the psycho lover. He screwed-up the beautiful dream and jail, the doctor and some other things were just consequences.The story is twisted because Cesar's dream was twisted. As I said, it's a great well made movie. Amenábar has a great future as a film maker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take a generous helping of Cameron Crowe, Tom Cruise, and an English-speaking Penelope Cruz. Combine it with a great story. Now throw that concoction away and see the original story instead.We rented this solely on the basis of the box blurb, without reading any other reviews. Ignore everyone who says it's like this movie or that, as they only serve to reveal aspects of the latter portions of the movie. Just go check out the movie, and decide for yourself if it's a crime/psychological thriller or something more bizarre. We enjoyed it so much, we rented "Thesis" a couple of nights later. Abre los ojos is definitely a must-see - especially if you haven't heard about all the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just cannot see what it is that makes this movie so remarkable; to me, it is just yet another attempt, and maybe one of the least successful, to build a gripping thriller out of the age-old theme of dreams mixed up with reality: what is true, what is not ? There's not much to the movie, really, besides this constant questioning; don't look for amazing acting, memorable dialogues, fine psychology or even - that's the biggest problem - a really original twist. The final "explanation" is, indeed, pretty unimpressive. This movie might be what revealed Penelope Cruz to some, but to me it's yet another proof that anything she's in is a turkey. In conclusion, if you want to see why Amenabar is (at least sometimes) a great director, go see his masterpiece "The Others" instead - it has everything this one lacks (see above).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, Wild Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I was just in the right mood for this dark, wild film, but it grabbed me right away. I had already seen The Others and enjoyed it and had read good things about Open Your Eyes and one of his other films, Thesis. So, I rented Open Your Eyes and was blown away by the acting, the writing and all the twists and turns.****SPOILERS AHEAD**** I, however, will agree with a few of the other comments. I'm not sure the ending packs the punch that Amenabar had hoped for. I can tell that he leaves it open to interpretation (much like Lynch's Blue Velvet and Mullholland Drive) - with the whole "maybe the whole damn thing was a dream". But even with the ending leaving me a bit underwhelmed, i did enjoy the ride the film takes you on. And I must say, after seeing Cruz also in All About My Mother, my god, this actress should stick to Spanish films - she is so natural and wonderful acting in her native tongue. But maybe she concentrates so much on her English in the American films she has made that there is definitely something missing. And it is a shame that most American movie-goers might only know her from some of the misguided Hollywood turkeys she has been in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Abre Los Ojos (Open your Eyes) is a brilliant movie. It was late when it was playing on TV, and I said I will just watch 15 minutes or so and go to bed, but I just couldn't move from my chair. The story is very gripping, even though the language was a barrier and I had to read the titles, still it was so intense that I watched it all and it haunted me for a while. It is one of those multi layer movies , when you get lost in the middle a couple of times and even when it ends you are still a bit at a loss and thinking what actually happened and what didn't. If you like to think , then I recommend it, if you are in for a joy ride then don't bother. Because when the movie ends it will leave you with a sense of dread and fear from yourself and what your mind can do.The directing was very good, chapeau for the director and the writer. Actors were chosen well and they were very convincing, and the make up was not bad for a movie not made in Hollywood.Finally, in my opinion , the adrenaline rush I got from this movie was only compared by the one I got from the movie Existenz ,which I recommend to people who liked this one and didn't see David Cronenberg's Existenz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my NEW favorite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me just say- everyone keeps comparing this to films by David Lynch. Just a note..Lynch sucks! His movies are ludicrous and serve one point- to be pointless. Anyhow...this movie should not be compared to that at all. It is amazing. I rarely say that about a movie, especially a movie in spanish where I'm forced to read the subtitles, but this movie just blew me away. The story is very original, some compare it to total recall, etc, but I think it is totally unique, and I like the fact that it's spanish, aka in no way, shape, or form made by hollywood. Bad thing is-Tom Cruise bought the rights, and is remaking it, starring who? Yep. To Cruise. I think it's sad, because people will forget the original and go for the remake, and you know how Hollywood can screw up a good movie...I bet they do it here too. One of the things that made this movie so good was the fact that I had never before seen the actors, beside Cruz, who is stunning. The remake has Cameron "annoying, no talent" diaz in it, so I'd stay away. Check this movie out. It draws you in, and you cannot stop watching. It is beautifully shot in Spain, I think, and the cinematography is spectacular, if you ask me. This is a great movie, one of my favorites. 10/10 definitely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never heard of this movie. I don't know any of the actors, actresses, director, or any of their previous work. All I know is that the cat's real name is "Pepe". And I usually avoid subtitled movies, but a friend had rented it already and told me I should see it.This one really surprised me.Picture your typical Hollywood Science Fiction movie. They soak it with special effects. The soundtrack is laced with expensive bands and surround noise and rumbles and thumps and bangs and crashes and aliens and yadda yadda yadda. But when you strip away all the effects from, oh, say, Total Recall and The Matrix, what is left? Mediocre acting and a weak plot.This movie has no special effects (well, it has a groovy distortion effect that looks kind of like animation on his fuzzy memories). It has a few songs hiding in the background that, if anything, sound like the film crew had a radio playing. I can't say anything about the spoken lines, but the subtitles were short and easy to read.It plays like a real Science Fiction story. No flash, no glitz, and unless you are using your brain, you may miss the fact that it's Science Fiction at all. But it is, and it's hardcore Science Fiction (if you don't know what that means, I'm sticking my tongue out at you).Watch this movie. Even if, like me, you don't usually ever watch subtitled movies, this one is worth the effort. It proves to me that there is some very powerful talent outside the US, and some of the Hollywood crowd should be paying attention to how it really should be done.</fullReview>

Never saw Matrix, but I like the idea of that guy (or a girl?) from Madrid who says it's a little bit like 1959 Les Yeux Sans visage. It's also got a bit of Hitchcock. Despite these comparaisons, this film had a very intelligent script. We never really know where's the reality and where's the dreams. At the end, we're in science fiction! Young actors are very good!

What I originally thought was an Antonioni-style (with mimes!) dark philo-psych art film turned out to be little more than "Man Without a Face" jumping around in fake Cartesian boots.

		<fullReview>I've got to say that Open your Eyes is one of my favorite films but it's not for everyone. It's the type of film that you need to sit down and pay attention to. Let yourself be absorbed by it awesome story and your in for real treat. If you find yourself in the situation of having people asking dumb questions, low attention spans or annoying interruptions then give this one a pass.Just because this film is on the slow side does not mean it's bad. In fact I believe that if it had a quicker pace it wouldn't be as good. The film starts off with Eduardo Noriega's character (Cesar) talking from an institution for the criminally insane. Cesar is wearing a mask, but you don't know why. He spends most of the film explaining to the psychiatrist how his life became a nightmare. The question of reality is addressed in the same way as in the Matrix. In fact the best way to describe this film is that it's like the Matrix with no action and more suspense.The actors do a great job.Penelope Cruz is not only beautiful, but she can act. Watch her in "All About My Mother" and you'll be convinced that she'll be a star when she finally makes it over to the U.S. I love the way the director slowly spirals Cesar's life into a nightmare. If you hang in there, I guarantee that you will be engrossed by the storyline as much as I was towards the latter half of the film.So to wrap it up, Open Your Eyes is a great movie. Just remember to hang in there and it'll be worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tale of psychological terror which scares, touches and entertains.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of many films about madness and psychological terror, but never have I seen such a complete package. Perhaps not as outright frightening as The Tenant or Rosemary's Baby by Polanski, it is more touching and quite profound. The characters are well drawn and endearing, despite their human faults. The music , composed by Amenabar himself, demonstrates an ability and sensitivity to the art such as Elfman and Williams show at their best. The cinematography is appropriate for the genre as well, with a few very clever shots which very powerfully elicit the desired emotion. The script shows imagination, taking us from X generation romance to mystery and even to science fiction with deft touches and good taste in the transitions so as not to appear corny and evoke incredulity.It is a very profound movie with many themes: the nature of friendship, guilt and forgiveness, deja vu and Spanish machismo all rolled into a delightfully twisted mystery story which reveals itself bit by bit, at just the right times. All the while one is kept guessing about the truth, and the ending is so poignant the I was touched despite the previous actions of the lead character.With Abre los Ojos, Amenabar reaffirmed the ability of script, photography and music which he demonstrated so well in his first film, Tesis. The original has been subtitled and shown here, and the translation is decent, losing little from the original script. I highly recommend this film, which must take its place among the greats of the genre whether it ever gains popularity here or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A interesting twist on thriller genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who thought that The Matrix was an incredibly original idea has never seen movies like Dark City and this interesting Spanish romantic thriller. Noriega plays Cesar, a wealthy orphan who has everything a person could want: money, looks, cars, women. Just as he is about to win the affections of the beautiful Sofia (superhottie Cruz), his face is horribly disfigured in an auto accident that also kills his nutty ex-girlfriend Nuria. After much struggling with his new ugly existence, things begin to come together: his face is repaired to normal and he finally gets Sofia to love him. One night, he wakes up and finds that Sofia has turned into Nuria, his dead former girlfriend. Things go straigh downhill for Cesar from there.To say what happens from there would spoil it. People may be confused why the movie is told in all flashbacks, as Cesar tells the story to a psychiatrist while locked in a mental institution, or exactly where this movie is going in the first 45 minutes, but if they can stick it out through the first part, they won't be disappointed. If you don't mind reading subtitles, it's well worth a watch.</fullReview>

It is so well shot that one does not mind a few tricks here and there.If you come away, unamused and un-intrigued by the questions posed, then you like other types of movies.

		<fullReview>"Open Your Eyes" Coming off the heels of the rancid "Shattered Image", which in turn came right after "Sliding Doors", I'm a bit tired of the "Is it only a dream?" genre of film that seems to be emerging recently. While trying to keep the audience on it's toes is admirable, these films often rely on sneaky tactics to get the job done. "Open Your Eyes" is a Spanish film about a womanizer who finally meets the woman of his dreams. That is until a vengeful ex-lover involves the man in a car accident and disfigures him. It is there where the film suggests that this accident might have been apart of a larger fantasy world the man cannot quite comprehend. Kind of a tamer "Total Recall", "Eyes" is often an entertaining film with one secret weapon - Penelope Cruz. She appeared earlier this year in "The Hi-Lo Country" and she's exudes a wonderfully warm charm that's very rare. Of course, she's gorgeous, but she can act as well. Lead actor Eduardo Noriega is also very good, making a believable journey into madness. Where the film falters big time is the creation of the dreamworld. The film might feel like a Hitchcockian thriller, it certainly employs all of the trappings, but the film invents it's twists. The effect being a film that has no real linear plot. You get the feeling that the filmmakers are making it up as they go just to claim that you cannot predict the end of the film. When the resolution does finally appear, I couldn't stop myself from rolling my eyes and wishing the film mapped itself out a little better. ------- 6</fullReview>

Not only were the elements of surprise and intrigue abound, the direction was superb. I can honestly say that it was one of the most unique films I have seen in quite some time. Although similar to US films such as The Game and 12 Monkeys, Open Your Eyes crosses many genres like an all-in-one package. It's a love story and a tragedy, a dream and a reality. Ultimately however, you are left to decipher the true meaning. I am anxious for this young director's next film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Open Your Eyes, by Alejandro Amenábar. César (Eduardo Noriega) and Pelayo (Fele Martínez) are a couple of friends. In Madrid, it's César's birthday and Pelayo takes Sofia (Penélope Cruz) to his party. While Pelayo claims to lose all the girls to César as the normal guy he believes to be when near him, César is a rich good looking fellow with everything going perfect with his life. Back in his party, César is trying to get rid of a girl, Núria (Najwa Nimri), who he has been dating. He goes requests Sofia's help with that, upsetting Pelayo. Sofía goes home with César and although nothing happened, it's visible that César fell in love with her. In the following morning, Núria was waiting for him downstairs Sofía's and convinced César to go home with her. On their way, Núria crashes her car whit both in it, on propose. After that the plot is a big mess believe me it's impossible to describe using just words. The most important is that we easily perceive, somewhere in the middle of the movie that César suffers some sort of mental disease, but while the end is approaching, we start doubting it. I don't know about the end (please skip until next paragraph if you haven't watched the movie yet), but as I was saying, the end leaves arguments to a lot of different interpretations. I see most of the people agree on the opinion that the whole thing following the night he got drunk was a dream, but I personally believe that he was mentally insane and the whole EL thing was created in his mind in order to explain everything he went through. Anyway, I kind of think the end wasn't good enough for this movie, thats went in very good manner. Another pearl coming from two great actresses, Penélope and Najwa, perhaps the best female duo from Spain, though only the first one achieved international success. It's a shame this sort of movies don't get the same projection as the American. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Don't Know Much About Spanish Film, But I Love This Example</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few quick thoughts on this one: the homages to past horror films (Phantom of the Opera, Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, The Wicker Man, etc) are awesome, and almost make me want to think of this in terms of horror. Indeed, there are some terrifying potentialities to the plot.Penelope Cruz is great, and I think a vastly underrated actress. She does great in Spanish, in English, in both big films and small. Anyone who does not know her power needs to see not only this movie, but "Elegy"."Open Your Eyes" is superior to "Vanilla Sky" in pretty much every way. I know people who love VS, but I think they're missing out. I, for one, thought it was just average. In hindsight, the only really great thing I can say about "Vanilla Sky" now is that it lead me to discover this film, which I otherwise would not have (and I suspect that, in general, more video stores carried it because of the Tom Cruise remake).The visuals are great, the plot is confusing but yet comprehensible, it's really just altogether a solid film. Credit must be given to Alejandro Amenábar, who went on to make "The Others" and "The Sea Inside".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By chance I read a review in a local paper - and went to a late night show, one rainy summer night ; the operator apologized for not having told the critics about the Spanish original, without being dubbed; no subtitles neither; brilliant, nothing but brilliant; what kinda astonished me was the music for the American version - the Spanish one is amazing !!!! It wasn't available then - when the movie came out - but now looking at amazon, apparently it is made available, though meanwhile discontinued by the manufacturer - as they put it. Cruz, too, seemed to be more at ease in the Spanish version then in Vanilla sky, but that may be due to the fact that I like to hear the Castillano in her case rather than the English, not of great importance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stirring story about dream and reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An impressive film about a handsome and cocky man called Cesar (Noriega) who falls in love with his friend's girlfriend (Cruz). But his life gets turned around when his ex-girlfriend causes a car accident where she dies and his face gets disfigured. He can't accept his new face and the fact that everybody is treating him different. Even his friend and new girlfriend Sofia are avoiding him. Cesar is getting disturbing dreams and is seeing things that aren't so. I like the way how the director jumps from one scene to another and is leaving us in confusion. At a point it's impossible for us to see what is real and what is dream. And then this movie makes a big unexpected spin. After the romance in the beginning and the drama after that the film develops as a sci-fi mystery. Our protagonist is desperately trying to find out what is happening with him and eventually unveils the truth. Or not? Although the protagonist Cesar is at times pretty annoying I kept interested in this very compelling story. The director lets you keep guessing what is going on without explaining too much. At the end he gives a credible explanation of it all. But you keep wondering. I can't wait to watch it again. Mind-blowing movie at the same level as The Game or Mulholland Drive. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It doesn't need a carbon copy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one thing that I didn't expect when getting into this movie, was how Hollywood was able to simply cut and paste so easily. For those who don't know, this is where Vanilla Sky comes from. And mixed in the jumble of the two movies, Penélope Cruz plays the same character with the same name, and the same lines. I would have probably liked this movie much more had I not seen Vanilla Sky first, because this whole charade puts a damper on both movies for me, makes at least one of the two un-watchable, as it's just a carbon copy, and who needs to watch a movie they've never seen when they already know exactly what's going to happen in the first place? This movie is the one that should have gotten all the praise. It didn't need a Cameron Crowe/Tom Cruise makeover. All of the things that made it special were here first, and so this one gets my vote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Slow, Somewhat Uneven But Above Average Mystery-Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over all Abre Los Ojos builds to a fascinating and mesmerizing conclusion. That said, it is in the build up at the beginning where the movie must build. The first third of the movie is slow, plodding, and full of typical over the top acting with loud artificial, overly dramatic performances usually scene on soap operas, particularly Mexican television. Yet the movie builds strongly on its initial scenes into a complicated reality-unreality scenario where the audience can be transported into this confusing yet compelling universe of events that seem to defy each other, where one cannot know what his real or unreal. This powerful but uneven movie is a nevertheless a memorable one. Seven out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent justification of the SBS' resources...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank the spirits for the SBS (aka Special Broadcasting Service). Without this august and sometimes controversial channel, I would never have had the opportunity to see Abre Los Ojos, a film that makes me wonder what other treasures are hidden in the vaults of the Spanish film industry. I am also glad I saw this before I saw Vanilla Sky, for reasons I will get into when I comment on that film.Again, all the flaws of the American film industry are non-existent here (although European film does have some of its own, granted). Instead of using a money hose to wash away creative problems, Europe's film industry is full of types who are, surprise, creative. It's nice to see that people can still make a surreal film for less than a hundred million, and hold your interest even when you mostly don't understand the dialogue. Which reminds me, the SBS' way of doing subtitles is really a model example.I'm about to talk about the plot, so if you haven't seen the film already, read with caution.Abre los ojos ("Open your eyes") at once summarises and sets the theme for the film. It starts out as a fairly mundane melodrama about some working joes in a Spanish neighbourhood, but things take a turn for the decidedly bizarre when the central character is severely deformed in a car accident. When he wakes up, he finds himself wearing a mask everywhere and asking himself why he is still alive. Okay, nothing unusual there, but it isn't until the third act that it all becomes clear.Towards the end of the film, we are presented with two alternating theories of what is going on. One is that the hero is living in a virtual world that he can only be revived from when he "dies" in it, and the other is that people who want access to his money want to con him into making that happen, only for real. The final act of the film is a constant struggle between these two theories that the viewer is only made aware of when they both teeter on the edge of victory. I won't spoil the ending by stating who wins, but the last thing one hears before the credits is the title - "Abre los ojos", or "open your eyes", something that the central character is struggling to do throughout.In all, I gave the film a 9 out of 10. It's not perfect, but unlike the mindless garbage that Hollywood produces in 99 out of 100 cases these days, it does stimulate the imagination, which is high praise indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing I like most about this movie is the romance. The loving feeling Cesar has towards Sofia come across so well on screen. I don't want to give away to much of the film so I will just take about their relationship. The scene when Cesar goes to the park and just watches Sofia, in the midst of her mime performance. It starts to rain and her makeup runs, but I think she is crying. She was put in an awkward position and it shows. Of course, since Cesar went off with Nuria after spending some time with Sofia, she shouldn't have gotten involved with Cesar. Anyway, this film has drama and romance mixed beautifully into a journey that has one of the best endings ever. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This well-played masterpiece is about going crazy. I don't see a sci-fi movie. I see a tragic history behind just another suicide jump. A rich, young and handsome playboy leading a life with all party and no worries. Just as he learns there could be a way to stay Forever Young, he gets his face destroyed by car wrecking maniac mistress. Depression and misery follows, no hope to get his good life back. He tumbles over the thin line to insanity - I would say just about the time of the "Contact Point" under the lamp post. From there on we're inside the head of a hallucinating paranoia patient, with a shrink doing his best helping him get better. There are no cryonics, no virtual dream world, no dead-come-alive-Nurnia. But, tragically for Sofia and for him, he believes it for truth (just as there are people around us, convinced of Elvis sightings and whispering voices). The beauty of the film is that the audience is tricked into seeing the suicide jump as perfectly logical. You can see it as a Sci-Fi movie, but I think the intention is to give a first person experience of going crazy. For example note that, unlike in sci-fis like Matrix, all scenes where crazy things happen, the main character is present.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Abre Los Ojos is ultimately a far more rewarding experience than Vanilla Sky, Cameron Crowe's interpretation (copy) of this Spanish original. While Vanilla Sky is by no means a poor movie, the story is handled in an altogether more satisfactory manner in Abre Los Ojos. The ending in particular is far more convincing - perhaps because director Alejandro Amenábar realises that the viewer does not have to be spoonfed every single detail (as in Vanilla Sky) to enjoy such a challenging film. For those put off my Abre Los Ojos because it is in Spanish, don't be - the subtitles are very easy to follow and not distracting in the slightest. Even if you've already seen Vanilla Sky, make sure you see this - you won't be disappointed by this thought provoking and altogether fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing Perplexity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****Possible Spoilers Ahead*****I've seen this film three times. The first time I watched it, I was fascinated by the film's theme, displaying of another dimension not yet presented in the world. The plot was very confusing at first, because of the film's flashback setting usage on and off throughout. When the man from L.E. explains at the end what is happening to the main character and his psychiatrist, things started to make sense.'Was Sophia real, or fake?' I've asked myself this half dozen times after watching the film the second time. Maybe it was Nuria who was fictitious made up by Cesar in his head, but the image of "Sophia, played by Penelope Cruz" seemed an ideal girlfriend to him as Sophia, denying the true Sophia, played by the other actress who I can't recall the name. And when the psychiatrist tells him that Cesar's handsome after the unmasking at towards the end, was Cesar's face normal, or disfigured? If his face was normal, what was his purpose of making his life miserable by choice before signing up with L.E.? Even after watching it three times, I still don't seem to grasp what's what 100 percent. I've seen this film on Sundance before watching 'Vanilla Sky'. Apparently, many have criticized the remake. But I have to say, I like them both. I think I like 'Abre los ojos' over 'Vanilla Sky' only because I am not too crazy about what's been produced out of Hollywood as of late. Had I not watched 'Abre los ojos', I might have liked 'Vanilla Sky' more than how much I like it now, as I wouldn't have anything to compare it with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More personal than Vanilla Sky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Abre los ojos" was remade in America as "Vanilla Sky". I thought "Abre los ojos" to be a more personal movie than "Vanilla Sky". The story focused more on the characters than on their wealth and social status. The lead character was still a shallow rich kid but he was played as being more down to earth as opposed to Tom Cruise's narcissistic rendering. If you enjoyed the story of "Vanilla Sky" but were turned off by the excessive self-centered Hollywood egos, as I was, then "Abre los ojos" may be an enjoyable movie for you. If you thought the whole story was stupid then avoid this version since the story is essentially identical. I enjoyed Penélope Cruz's acting in this version better. She seemed to be a more sympathetic character. An interesting scene, one played in both movies, is the one with the pictures on the refrigerator. In this version they were of Sofia with family and friends. In the Hollywood version they were of just Sofia. Who puts pictures on their refrigerator of themselves? Aren't the pictures there to invoke memories of others not as self advertisement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if you've seen 'Vanilla Sky', I cannot recommend 'Abre Los Ojos' highly enough as a means of seeing how the story was originally presented. Eduardo Noriega's Cesar spins from an attractive, supremely confident, successful individual to disfigured and desperate, purely on the back of one split-second decision made to placate a girl he doesn't intend seeing again. His heart, however, belongs to Penelope Cruz's Sofia, with whom he has spent only one, platonic, night. In the depths of despair, his life suddenly turns around, but in the tradition of all great thrillers, things are not as they seem... 'Abre Los Ojos' combines romance with suspense and flashes of humorous brilliance, keeping the momentum up right until the last moments. The whole cast is outstanding and every aspect of this finely-crafted movie has been handled with care, from lighting to Amenabar's own music score.Whilst it is Cruz who has expanded her work into Hollywood, Noriega too deserves to be seen by a much wider audience.</fullReview>

Every part of the film is so unique and fits perfectly to the story that it is really not necessary to make a remake. If you have the choice: Abre los ojos or Vanilla Sky, go and watch Abre los ojos. The story: genuine. every 15 minutes there is an amazing confusing twist that your own ideas what the truth might be always break together and you have to imagine new ones...the dialogues are so breathtaking...just compare what Pelayo said at the party and what César later says... The music: I recognized Smoke City´s Flying Away (party scene) and Massive Attack´s Risingson (disco scene). These two songs in fact are hints to the story. Just look at the chorus of Risingson...brilliant! The score itself is great, too. The actors: Absolutely excellent. Really, you cannot top them with someone like Tom Cruise. Overall, this is an amazing European film. Go and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS for both Open your Eyes and I presume Vanilla SkyMy god, I had so many things worked out in my mind as to what I was going to say about this film, that is until the ending destroyed all my theories. Open you Eyes is a good film, almost great, but the ending just took away any chance for interpretation, by having the French man explain the entire plot of the film seemed to lessen the entire viewing experience, for me any way. I remember when a friend of mine had been to see Vanilla Sky, the person wasn't necessarily a big fan of foreign cinema, and when they said they'd had trouble understanding the film, until the plot was explained at the end, my first reaction was: "well, another dumbd down Hollywood re-make"? But alas, no, for it seems that the explained ending of Vanilla Sky was entirely faithful to that of Open your Eyes. This was a great let down, because there was, or so I thought, a great deal of images worthy of interpretation. The beginning for instance, the first scene shows young playboy César, leaving his high-class apartment, and driving round the city, just another day then, but no. For this is a dream, and as César drives he soon realizes that he is entirely alone in the city, there is no one. Later in the film, after César has been disfigured by his accident, he leaves a discoth?que, drunk and depressed, he collapses in a gutter, alone and with no one. I though the opening sequence was foreshadowing this, showing us the isolation he would soon feel, after the loss of his face had robbed him of his life. There where many instances in the film where this occurred, where my ideas of where the plot was going, actual lead somewhere else.Many have talked about the surprise ending, it's not that hard to decipher as the film moves closer to the climax, the only surprise for me was that the film had the audacity to treat its audience like children and explain the whole thing from A to Z. Maybe so may people miss the ending, because the film doesn't set it's self up as science fiction, it feels like a drama, or maybe a horror, the revelation of death and cryogenics comes right out of the blue, and takes away the subtle psychological tension the film had been building. For me, after this point the film just became too far fetched, it reminded me of Fight Club (1999), where after the twist revelation I didn't really care anything for the character of Edward Norton, I still enjoyed the film greatly, but there was just no danger, all the actions in the film where controlled by him, and this is the exact same scenario as Open your Eyes.I haven't seen Vanilla Sky yet, I'll probably pick it up on DVD when it comes out to rent, but I'm in no rush. If the original failed to impress me then the photocopy can only be more inferior. But despite the flaws in the climax, for the most part Open you Eyes was a wholly enjoyable film, not once in the two-hour running time did I check my watch or feel myself getting bored, and both acting and directing where first class. It's amazing to see just how many people have commented on this film since the release of director Amenabar's film The Others (2001), so it seems that he's already developing a fan base, which is good because there is a great deal of originality on display here. The performances are good all round with great work by the lead Noriega (who incidentally looks a little like Tom Cruise) and Lera as his doctor, the only let down was Penelope Cruz, who's growing popularity baffles me, she's not good looking, and she certainly can't act. All in all, Open your Eyes is a decent enough film for the curious, or any one hoping to make comparisons with it's U.S. counterpart. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen a number of foreign films remade by Hollywood, and more often than not something is lost in translation. 'Vanilla Sky', however, is an exception to the rule. There are some very subtle differences between the two films, but none of the differences negatively impact the film overall, and for the most part 'Sky' is extremely faithful to its source material. 'Sky', of course, had a bigger budget, and that becomes evident whenever prosthetics or CGI are used. Also, if you do not speak Spanish, but you do speak English, then the lack of subtitles is helpful. Overall, I would say that both 'Abre los ojos' and 'Vanilla Sky' are interesting, visually arresting, and worthwhile films, but in this case (although it is very close), the remake is slightly better.</fullReview>

Is that why he felt he "loved" her? When you have money and power, how much do you really value friendship? Is health even an issue when you're perfectly healthy? This film keeps your interest throughout even when the story seems a little chaotic. It's wrapped up at the end in a way that doesn't insult your intelligence, unlike "Vanilla Sky". You're guaranteed to have Abre los Ojos on your mind days after you've watched it. If you've seen Vanilla Sky watch Abre los Ojos and decide which you like best.

		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenábar has directed only five films, written the script for these and two others, and composed the music for these as well as that beautiful film 'La Lengua de las Mariposas'(qv). His previously best known film was 'Tesis' (1996)(qv), and of course his latest film 'Los Otros' (qv) is now showing, definitely throwing his name into the front lines, to which we must add the fact that 'Vanilla Sky', at present just about ready for its debut, is a U.S. remake of 'Abre los Ojos' (qv) with Amenábar himself supplying once again the script for this American version, which at the very least will do for flaunting the new-found love for that happy happy couple, Tom Cruise and Penélope Cruz. The Chilean born director is not yet thirty, and people are already comparing his style with all kinds of film-makers, from Orson Welles to Alfred Hitchcock.There is no doubt that Amenábar is a gifted young man and he will go a long way in the cinema world - which usually means ending up in Hollywood, and that will be that, I suppose. The Almodóvars and Amenábars, together with such delightful beings like the aforementioned Ms Cruz, Javier Bardem and Antonio Banderas, figure among Spain's principal exports in recent years.In 'Abre los Ojos' Amenábar falls back on Eduardo Noriega who had starred in his earlier film 'Tesis' (1996), this time pairing up the 'beautiful boy' with the astounding epitome of Spanish loveliness, Penelope Cruz. However Noriega's beautiful features have to be destroyed for this film, caused by a car accident as a result of unbounded jealousies by his would-be lover Najwa Nimri. From there Amenábar launches into a phantasmagorical mix of thriller-mystery verging even on science fiction, in which real life becomes intermeshed with programmed dream-life. Hardly venturing into surrealist dimensions, Amenábar maneuvers through hypothetical life-hereafter in uncannily bewildering scene-shifts that in the end, or rather as some kind of undefinable outcome, leave the story-line in a patently obscure set of parenthesis. It is a totally different angled look at after-life, such as in 'Meet Joe Black', but handled in a rather more effectivist manner.Noriega plays his rôle well, but I should point out he was far better in 'La Fuente Amarilla' (1999) (qv) together with the up-and-coming Silvia Abascal, or even in 'Más Allá del Jardín', film based on a novel by Antonio Gala. Forget about 'Cha, cha, chá' (1998).Penélope Cruz really only has to play herself, that is I mean that playing the part of a beautiful, gorgeous and sexy lover did not need too much effort on her part; those bewitching eyes and superb face just look into the camera and everybody falls at her feet. Not her best part, as I feel she played better rôles in 'Todo Sobre mi Madre' (qv), 'La Ni?a de Tus Ojos' (qv) and 'Belle Époque', for example. It remains to be seen whether in 'Vanilla Sky' co-partnering with Tom Cruise and directed by Cameron Crowe, a better rendering of this mysterious fable can be made. Personally, I doubt it very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miles better than Vanilla Sky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've read my review of Vanilla Sky then you know that I hated it. As a result, I was reluctant to see Abre Los Ojos, both because I knew the plot and so there would be no surprise and because Sky sucked so badly. However, a friend of mine dropped it in the VCR and I was pleasantly surprised.First of all, Eduardo Noriega is a better actor and much more watchable than Cruise. He has actual facial expressions, which always helps.However, the big improvement was in small variations in the story that make me wonder what Cameron Crowe and the screenwriters were thinking when they created Sky.**** SPOILER ****One example: when David Aames (Cruise) finds out that he's in a directed dream, he goes down to the lobby and screams, "Tech support!" After a brief pause (this is supposed to be dramatic, folks), Edmund Ventura shows up and takes him to the final scene.Compare this with Abre Los Ojos. Our hero, Cesar, figures out that he is in a fantasy world. He freaks out. He runs outside the building, where two security guards confront him. Gunfire ensues. Lots of blood, a couple of bodies. Consider the heightened drama here: If Cesar is wrong, then this is about as bad as it gets. If he is right, then nothing has happened. Amenabar gives us a moment to consider the implications, then resolves the situation.Sorry, but that kind of climactic scene beats the hell out of some elevator doors opening and a guy saying, "Yoo hoo! Over here!"This was a problem throughout Sky that doesn't exist in Abre Los Ojos: scenes that should have been dramatic but weren't. Does that make Abre Los Ojos a fantastic movie? Personally, I still prefer his later movie, "Nadie Conoce a Nadie" (Nobody Knows Anybody), which I found more suspenseful. However, if your wife keeps nagging you to see Vanilla Sky, try to talk her into Abre Los Ojos instead. It's the same basic plot with better actors and a better script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let the viewer decide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that I saw "Vanilla Sky" before I saw "Abre los ojos" and I really liked it. I considered it the best movie of last year and I thought it was Cruise's Best film even though it was a remake. In comparison, I think they are on the same plane. Here is the similar evidence.First, the story of both films are very similar. Second, Penelope Cruz did extremely well as the lead actress in both. Thirdly, the leading men are both very contemptuous characters and the immediate supporting men are both always out of luck. Finally, the same man was responsible for the writing of both films, Alejandro Amenabar and Mateo Gil.The main difference is the director chosen to make each film. Alejandro Amenabar directed the original and Cameron Crowe directed the remake. "Abre los ojos" has a smooth but gritty feel. The imagery is not in your face and the film's music is almost strictly classical. This movie's budget is far below what one would expect and it is great nonetheless. In it's own right, "Abre los Ojos" is an awesome film. When Cruise and Crowe came along and bought the rights, they got their hands on a huge budget but made sure they kept the same writers as to try and not drag the original through the mud. They succeeded immensely. With a larger budget, they had more for visual effects, imagery and music. Cameron Crowe has a way of picking the right music for the right scene in a movie. "Vanilla Sky" is also praiseworthy.After viewing both films, I cannot say one is better than the other. Even though they are completely different beasts, they stand together on the same field. Both are well-made, well-written storywise and musically, and well-acted. In my mind, "Abre los ojos" is one of the best I have seen from Spain. It should have been nominated for a Foreign Film Oscar. Alejandro Amenabar is a great writer and director (see "The Others") and I hope he gets some more recognition over here. I give it a 10 out of 10!Here ends my rant!</fullReview>

However, both movies were very very very good.The lead character in this was great. He was speaking Spanish the entire movie as was EVERYBODY ELSE. So, that's why SUBTITLES are necessary.I loved the way the movie was shot, expecially the scenes in the prison room.

		<shortDescription>Pretentious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretentious, self indulgent film making at its worst. A lot of people seem to be confusing complexity with interest. Solving a Rubik's cube is complex but ultimately not very interesting. Actually, now that I think about it I'd rather learn how a Rubuk's cube works than how this plot works. I watched the film with my very smart, film loving, lawyer wife. Neither of us could figure out the plot - we were confused. After finding a plot outline on IMDb we were no longer confused but we were cross. Is that it??It's curious that so many people devote almost as much space to criticising Vanilla Sky as they do praising this film; the main point being that they don't like Hollywood. Congratulations.I gave it a 3/10 but only because we got to see the glorious Penelope naked a couple of times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>César (Eduardo Noriega) is talking to his psychiatrist Antonio (Chete Lera) in an institution while wearing a prosthetic mask. In flashbacks, he was a handsome vain playboy. He flirts with Sofia (Penélope Cruz) who his best friend Pelayo (Fele Martínez) likes a lot. His ex Nuria (Najwa Nimri) offers a ride and deliberately drives off the road. His face is horribly disfigured and Sofia finds it hard to deal with his frustrations. Then it turns into something more surreal.It's an interesting odd relationship movie for the first half. The movie keeps me involved but it also keeps me wondering about a creeping sense of something wrong with the story. The jumbled intercut timeline seems to be off and then it takes off. I definitely want more foreshadowing of the twist but it's still a fascinating turn. This plays like a compelling dream that I sensed as a dream before the reveal. Does that make sense?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Compared To Vanilla Sky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Open Your Eyes is a Spanish film directed by Alejandro Amenábar which was written by himself and Mateo Gil. It stars Eduardo Noriega, Penélope Cruz, Fele Martínez and Najwa Nimri.The movie's intersecting planes of dream and reality is one characteristic it has that will astonish the viewer and would probably find it interesting.I even consider this a superior film compared to its Hollywood remake,Vanilla Sky.The line between dreams and reality become increasingly blurred after a womanizing playboy is nearly killed by a jilted lover.It would seem as if Cesar (Noriega) has it all. Handsome, charming, and with money to burn, he can get any girl he wants, and usually does so on a nightly basis. Following a birthday party in which he chats up Sofia (Cruz), the date of his best friend Pelayo, Cesar is plunged headfirst into a nightmare world when jealous former lover Nuria swallows a handful of pills and sends her car careening into a cement wall with the terrified playboy as her hapless passenger. With his formerly strikingly handsome face now twisted into a hideous mass of scarred flesh, Cesar's ugly emotions are now externalized for all to see. Pining for a plastic- surgery miracle to return him to his former glory so that he can seek out Sofia and take a chance at real love, he is pleasantly surprised when the doctors make a breakthrough and Sofia accepts him back into her life. Although all seems perfect for the moment, the formerly soulless player finds that this is only the beginning of his increasingly disturbing journey. Why is Sofia changing appearance and turning into Nuria periodically? And why won't the police and his psychiatrist believe Cesar's desperate attempts to rationalize a world that is growing increasingly surreal? Could it have something to do with a doctor Cesar has seen on television who keeps appearing and attempting to help him out of his nightmare? Peeling away at the layers of his subconscious, Cesar begins to realize that reality is no more than a state of mind, and that in order to get his life back he may be forced to take unthinkable measures.This is a deeply complex psychological mind warp of a film that begs to be viewed more than once to get full understanding of the movie.At the same time,it takes more than one viewing to realize that it is a is thought provoking feature and allows us to contemplate to live the dream not the nightmare.Aside from that,it is a film that really does challenge its audience's expectations and suppositions at every turn.The performances of this movie were simply outstanding especially Eduardo Noriega,who definitely allows the viewer to care for his character.While Penelope Cruz delivers in her role as Sofia.And finally,this is one visually stunning product is no less absorbing and haunting, not to mention surprisingly moving.In short,it is a masterpiece.It is a must-see for people who love great movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rare film that really grew for me on 2nd viewing. The first time around I found it mostly fascinating, but occasionally too far-fetched for it's own good. This time, not as caught up in figuring out what was going on, I was able to appreciate the subtle deeper themes that Amenebar is addressing; What is beauty? How much of our perception of reality is accurate? How much of what we consider 'love' is narcissistic? How do we know what to trust? Multiple realities and questions of perception always fascinate me, and this was no exception. And the lead performances were very good. Beautifully shot, and full of challenging, interesting ideas, great style and unexpected twists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Open your eyes and watch this instead of Vanilla Sky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I hear that a film has been copied from another one or inspired by another film etc. etc. I usually seek out the original first before I watch the copy because the latter is usually horrendous (well most of the time at least). I have no earthly idea why Director Cameron Crowe decided to remake this film but all I can say it that I hope everyone watched this one first. Perhaps English speaking people need to get over their fear of subtitles sometimes instead of inspiring American film-makers to take us on a horror-fest of journeys.The storyline follows that of a millionaire playboy who uses women like one would use toilet roll but one day, he messes with the wrong lady and gets his ultimate comeuppance, or do he? Penelope Cruz stars as the woman of his dreams whom he meets for a brief period but her memory last such a lifetime that it causes him to begin to rethink his sanity after a life changing encounter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Open your eyes is a psychological thriller that will keep you guessing until the very end. This film is about a 25-year-old César (Eduardo Noriega) who is attractive to women. At his birthday party he flirts with Sofía (Penélope Cruz), the girlfriend of his best friend Pelayo (Fele Martínez). Later on, he takes her home and stays the night, although they don't sleep together. The next morning, César's obsessive ex-lover Nuria (Najwa Nimri) pulls up outside Sofia's flat and offers him a lift. She crashes the car, committing suicide, and César is horribly disfigured, beyond the help of cosmetic surgery. Sofía can't bear to see him like this and goes back to Pelayo. After César's disfigurement, he begins to have a series of disorienting experiences. Drunk, César falls asleep in the street. On awakening everything has changed?Vanilla Sky, 2001 American psychological thriller, a remake (that follows the original plot really closely) directed by Cameron Crowe is a film that we are more familiar with in America. I would encourage seeing the original film by Alejandro Amenábar before you watch Vanilla Sky. Even though it is a low budget film, the mise-en-scene and the cinematography here is amazing. The way Amenábar uses things like rain and the sound to draw out emotion from the audience. The acting by Eduardo Noriega in this film, is very well done, the way he is able to draw us in and to make us feel this sense of hopelessness at one point and this joy the next really shows the talent of this young actor. For me Open Your Eyes is now at the top of all the thrillers I have ever seen, and I would encourage you too see it as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i Open Your Eyes is an amazing piece of film. One of my all time favourite pieces of cinema. I was first made to watch it at school during an A-level Philosophy class. The first time I saw it I was dubious as to whether I would enjoy it, it seemed from my teachers synopsis to be another lovey dovey romance film, plus the idea of Spanish language film was a big turn off. Never the less I watched the film and thoroughly enjoyed it. Everything about it was immensley cool.The characther of Cesar is your average, up his own backside 20th century guy. He is a idiot, but yet just a little bit charming. His the sort of guy, you begrudgingly admire. I am very glad the makers of the film didn't try and attempt to make him reform throughout the course of the picture, as is so often the case, I like that he stays shallow, for me it makes him far more believable. One of the best shot scenes in the film has to be between Cesar and Nuria, when they are travelling along, after Cesar spent the night at Sofias flat. The shooting is really well done for this moment, with clever editing and interplaying of the shots as the scene progresses. The music also adds perfectly to the scene, adding to the effects of the cameras to show the fragility of Nuria, and the bewilderment and bored of Cesar.I really adore the interplay of Cesars prison cell and his retelliing of his story. Cesars psychiatrist, Antonio, is one of my favourite characthers. I love his steady and calm approach to things. The contrast is brilliant, as Cesars world slowly unravels he remains the one steady rock. I must talk about the ending, I do like the fact that it is left entirely open to any interpretation. I love the fall from the building, and how you have no idea what is going to happen. My mind always calls out to the film to reveal what happens. All I get though is a black screen, and then a voice... The film starts as it began with the words, Open Your Eyes. The pause between these words and the credits is enough to make me feel a revelation will happen, but thankfully, it never does.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that Hollywood chose to remake this film as Vanilla Sky is an indication that it may just be worth watching. They seem to find foreign gems and remake them with some regularity. Are there no original ideas in Hollywood? Eduardo Noriega (Transsiberian, The Devil's Backbone, and the elusive Alatriste) is a playboy who only likes one night stands. You know that is going to end when he comes into contact with the beautiful Penélope Cruz.His life is about to change, but not in the way he expects. One of his conquests Nuria (Najwa Nimri) changes it for him.Here is where the sci-fi comes in. César (Noriega) is now in an insane asylum, but we see him on the streets with his friend Pelayo (Fele Martínez) and Sofia (Cruz). Then he is with Nuria, and everyone says it is Sofia. he is all twisted up - and so are we! We find out what happened at the end - or do we? At least we get to see all of the incredible Penélope Cruz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than Vanilla Sky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would urge all of the REAL movie fans to see both and see how very small differences can change the viewer's overall sense of the film.I saw Vanilla Sky first and thought it was pretty good. I did think that it left more unresolved, which isn't always bad, but I felt that the resolution in Open Your Eyes was exactly what was appropriate for the movie. I also felt that the scenery-chewing that Tom Cruise did in several scenes actually detracted from the feel of the story line. There is a bar scene that was almost identical in the two films. The only difference is that the tone and body language of the main character and the bartender, which makes the Vanilla Sky version quite confrontational while in the Spanish version the scene plays as a simple faux pas on the part of the bartender that is quickly resolved.In general, I think the American version suffers from inferior direction and poorer acting. Penelope Cruise is excellent in both. Cruise and Kurt Russell seem to have decided that their roles needed to big bigger and more emotional. They were wrong.</fullReview>

Then, the eerie feel, the feverish visionary quality; ABRE ? is very scary, and extremely suspenseful. The atmosphere, the characters have a weirdness, a eeriness that make the movie an experience.Two minor objections?the solution, with its Sci?Fi ambiguity, is inferior to what was previously seen; --in its beginning, ABRE ? has some of the defining side of the Spanish (and Hispanic) cinema and which marks it as provincial, a kind of vulgar and pedestrian, prosaic bluntness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was curious about this movie because of the Director's treatment of The Others. I was fascinated by this man who also scored the haunting music to that film. I think he's one of the most gifted artists of our time and I love how he takes ownership of his movies.As such, I have to blame him for his overhanded exposition of the final scenes. This movie would have been much better without spoonfeeding the audience with the explanation. This is something you would expect from a movie in the '60s. I've read a lot of comments saying that this movie was better than Vanilla Sky. It really isn't. Cameron Crowe almost did an exact reshoot of the film. In a way, it really wasn't a necessary remake. I didn't detect Cameron's own imprint on the movie. But he certainly didn't drop the ball. If you enjoyed the original, you will enjoy Vanilla Sky.</fullReview>

Vanilla sky 5/5 Open your eyes 4/5 I strongly reccomend you see Vanilla sky first before seeing Open your eyes.If you have any questions or disagreements,please send me an e mail on canot67@hotmail.com.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing--a movie more about sexism and patriarchy than anything else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went out and rented this film after watching Cameron Crowe's "Vanilla Sky" last week. Man, what a disappointment. OK, true, the sciece-fiction aspect of "Abre Los Ojos" is very interesting. I have no qualm with that. However, in my opinion, "Abre Los Ojos" is nothing more than a hollow "femme fatal" movie, a film in which all of the women are referred to as "girls", a film in which all of the "girls" make screechy noises, a film in which all of the "girls" are merely sexual objects to men and nothing else. However, even though I found the film offensive in its sexism, the patriarchy and sexism so evident in "Abre Los Ojos" are what make the "femme fatal" premise of the film work better than it does in Crowe's "Vanilla Sky." For example, in "Abre Los Ojos", the character of Cesar seems more like a selfish spolied brat of a patriarch than does Cruise's character in "Vanilla Sky." And the character of Nuria really does seem to be the "unstable jilted woman" here, unlike Cameron Diaz's self-assured Jenna in "Vanilla Sky." Likewise, Antonio seems more the self-pitying buddy than Jason's Lee's character in "Vanilla Sky." In essence, the sexist premise of this film works better for me in the more machismo-oriented Spanish setting than it does in the less so American one. But, I don't necessarily view that as a compliment for the film maker or screen writer. At any rate, besides the offensive sexism, the whole film just played really flat for me. I was not very involved; I did not care much about the characters; and I found myself wanting to turn it off after about thirty minutes. Perhaps it's because I saw "Vanilla Sky" first (which is filled with flaws of its own), but I just did not find "Abre Los Ojos" worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, as I saw the American remake yesterday with director's commentary it was strange to watch this original vision now all the more that it's in Spanish, it stars also Penelope and the story is really particular.The remake is very close to this movie: the scenes are totally alike: The remake adds a lot of clues that appears a bit useless (TV screens, the best friend meeting Julie/Nuria) and its cast except Penelope is maybe less appealing: Tom Cruise isn't a better Cesar (except maybe his idea to mock his cry in front of the mirror) and Russell is certainly less moving than the Spanish Psy. The real differences appear in budget with the remake having more expensive wardrobe, music and special effects.But the emotional impact doesn't really follow the money raise because this Spanish original is more like us, the audience, thus we can relate to what happens. As for Penelope, i find her more shy here than in the remake: either it's her experience in movies, either American and Spanish have a different feeling about relationship.But as it's about a triangle, an impossible and ideal love portrayed by a smiling and delicate brunette, I feel really touched by those movies.PKD would agree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankly superior to 'Vanilla Sky'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw 'Vanilla Sky' we were in 2003. It was 8 years ago. Although this review is supposed to be for 'Abre los ojos', I can't do it without comparing both versions. The biggest problem is to know where to start, but here it goes.When I saw 'Vanilla Sky', never before I had seen such a confusing and complex movie and the idea I got from it was that I could think of 1000 answers and yet I wasn't even close to guess the real answer. 'Abre los ojos' is simpler to understand, although it still is complicated.Comparing to 'Vanilla Sky', the original is more involving, more intense, more dramatic, more disturbing and more well-done (and not as rushed). Which is good. All in all, a much better movie than the American remake.For example, the car crash scene is longer and more intense. In comparison, it seems somewhat sudden and rushed in 'Vanilla Sky'.The lead character (in this case, César) seems more consumed by despair, depression and rage than Tom Cruise's character. Also, near the ending César goes as far as taking a gun and killing people, something I don't remember Tom Cruise's character doing.The ending is more intense, as César screams increasingly louder as he is about to reach the ground when he throws himself off the building, which makes the scene more horrifying. In 'Vanilla Sky', Tom Cruise's character doesn't make a sound when he falls off the building, if I recall.Eduardo Noriega is excellent as César, more authentic than Tom Cruise in the same role. Najwa Nimri as Nuria is a lot better than Cameron Diaz reprising her role. Penélope Cruz is great as Sofia. Curiously, Penélope Cruz reprises her role as Sofia in 'Vanilla Sky', however her performance seems better on the original. Perhaps she got tired and bored of doing the same thing twice, which damaged her acting.This should definitely be on Top 250.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Penelope Cruz is splendiferous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)This starts out like a love-triangle drama, with César (Eduardo Noriega) the wealthy scion of a restaurateur playing at love with every girl he meets. His latest Nuria (Najwa Nimri) is very aggressive sexually, but other than that of no interest to him. He throws a party, fails to invite her, but she shows up anyway. She knows he's dumping her but she can't help herself and throws herself at him. He evades her advances, notices Sofia (Penélope Cruz) who has come with his friend to the party, goes over to her and asks her to pretend to be interested in him to protect him from his stalker. (Ah, such technique!) Sofia is amused and interested. And so we have our triangle.I thought this was an interesting beginning. I expected Nuria to become increasingly obsessive, and for César to fall completely in love with Sofia, who after all is played by the strikingly beautiful and bewitching Penélope Cruz, who by the way, plays a mime at one point and is seen au naturel from the waist up at another. (In case you're interested.) And something like this does indeed happen. But then somewhere around the middle of the film the world of reality and that of César's dreams become indistinguishable. He becomes disfigured in an auto accident. Nuria is dead. Sofia seems to cool toward him, and then to love him. It is unclear what is going on.Normally at this point I exit. Notions of the supernatural or of virtual reality fusing with reality dreamed up by movie directors to be fed to the movie-going public are usually stupid, confused, juvenile, and entirely unconvincing. However a couple of things kept me around. One, Penélope Cruz. Actually she was enough. But I also wanted to find out how director Alejandro Amenábar would sort this out.I now understand that I can do that by watching Vanilla Sky (2001), the Cameron Crowe remake of this film in which (I am told) the supernatural fusing of virtual reality and reality are made so obvious that even this old guy can figure it out. The fact that Penélope Cruz reprises her role opposite her current flame, Tom Cruise, strikes me as interesting. And Cameron Diaz as the sexually aggressive other seems inviting.Bottom line: Having to read subtitles causes one to miss some of Penélope Cruz's magic with the camera. On the other hand, one can crunch tortilla chips without fear of being unable to hear the dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alas I'm one of the many who only saw this movie because of "Vanilla Sky" for which I'm ashamed - this is the superior release. I've already hashed through "Vanilla Sky" in another review so I'll try and say how this movie is superior.Firstly the characters here are better drawn. "Vanilla Sky" (or VS as I shall call it from here-on) has a need to try and make the character of David (César here) somewhat sympathetic so we feel sorry for him. Here we're treated with a bit more intelligence - César is not a nice guy and he does use the women he's with until he finds the one he loves. Pelayo (Diaz in VS) is played far less like a camp bunny-boiler than she was in VS which again adds to the movie's authenticity and allows us to be drawn into the story. And Penélope Cruz is far more at home speaking her native tongue than in VS - her performance is much better.The plot is remarkably similar to VS for some reason... Certain elements in VS are missing here and generally not to the detriment of the movie - although I appreciated VS' media touches which is lacking here. Although the climatic "twist" is the same "Abre los ojos" treats it with more subtlety and less ram-raiding the idea into your skull. That's a good thing because guess what Hollywood - some of us have brains and don't need everything illuminated in bold.Direction by Alejandro "The Others" Amenábar is perfectly adequate and not overly the top. Some nice moments but the budget of the movie can't compare to VS - seeing Time Square is more effective than Spanish streets alas. Never mind - he does his work well and tells the story with more use of the concepts of subtleness than Crowe did.Overall I'd recommend you see both - if only to see the eerie similarity between the movies. See which appeals to you. Personally I prefer the more subdued, less glamorous original and so it's a 7.3/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a strong film. And it's remake Vanilla Sky although liked by many, still seems a little tame to me.Open your Eyes. Made in Spain, incorporates better acting, better locations, and a far deeper look at the whole, lucid dream theme.The fact it is accompanied with subtitles is also, quite oddly, a good thing, not just because you can actually understand it, but because you pay more attention to a film you're reading, than one you're watching. Overall this creates a far more rewarding experience, and the overall impact of this picture is quite impressive.An original, thoroughly imaginative film that I highly recommend.Gracias :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy, but takes a wrong turn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When spoilt, pretty boy Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) is disfigured in a car crash, his world falls apart. He can no longer take his adoration by women for granted; he seems to be having problems distinguishing dreams from reality; and a usurper appears to have taken the place of his girlfriend. To cap it all, he's under arrest for his involvement in a murder that he cannot recall. The first three quarters of 'Open Your Eyes' constitute a superior psychological thriller, with almost an excess of powerful ideas. Production values are high in every department, while the plot steers a successful line between the nonsensical and the plausible, hinting at a resolution while giving nothing away. Unfortuantly, story resolves its contradictions by diving into science fiction. And while not all science fiction is bad, all good drama shaped by the constraints restraining its heroes. Science fiction provides a means for a writer to experiment with different constraints to those that apply in real life (as, for that matter, does magic realism); but to change the rules three quarters of the way though one story simply isn't on, and the resulting ending is both deeply unsatisfying and trite. This is still a film of much merit; but it's so much better when recalling 'L'Appartement' than when mirroring 'Total Recall' and prefiguring (as it does near the end) the empty philosophising of 'The Matrix'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is this film flawed? The protagonist, Cesar, is too vain and self-indulgent to be sympathetic. It's hard to care what happens to him. He shows no remorse, no sense of empathy towards others and is a rampant misogynist, driven by sexual desire and quick fixes. He even steals his best friend's girlfriend, and this is where this convoluted film begins to go awry. Following a car accident, Cesar, is badly disfigured, and seeks to rebuild his face, but he gradually becomes disengaged from reality. The film's plot is incomprehensible for many reasons. Rather than fall into the trap of making it a straightforward dream, the director uses the fancy conceit of artificial perception and Crynogenics to suggest Cesar actually created his own aritifical nightmare out of his past, confusing the past with his new constructed reality 150 years on from his death. The plot falls on the thesis that Cesar is essentially reborn via artificial perception after being frozen for 150 years, but is unable to know this fact until the end. But the film never analyzes artificial perception - why didn't Cesar construct a better artificial reality for himself? I suppose it wouldn't be a film if that were the case, which confirms how flawed this film really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great idea, but as hard to watch as the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really impressing how 'Vanilla Sky', the stars stricken remake of Alejandro Amenábar's 'Abre los Ojos' succeeds to inherit many of the problems of the original. Here we have one of the most original ideas in the cinema stories of the last few decades, and yet, both films look hard to watch, too long, and a little bit of artificial at the end. Maybe the problem, at least for me, is that the genre which packages the story in the two movies - the rich-to-poor, beautiful-to-disfigured, loved-to-lonely melodrama is by far one of the least agreeable genres for me, and without some early warning I would have abandoned watching the movies at a much earlier stage. As they stand ALS and VS start being really interesting only after half of the screening time. When the story catches back it really becomes fun, but then the ending in the Spanish version is too expected in the unexpected way, if you know what I mean. I ended with the feeling that the film was 'interesting' but not really a great entertainment experience.And yes, let us not forget, Penelope Cruz is wonderful here, as she is in 'Vanilla Sky'. Her presence in the two movies adds to the pair and makes the tandem worth more than the sum of the individual movies.</fullReview>

I really can´t compare the two movies, I just saw one of them (Vanilla) and, the only thing I can say is: it´s a great story, a great movie, great cast and, well, I really liked it... I am almost certain that "abre los ojos" is much better than "Vanilla", but, I, and a lot of people, wouldn´t ever hear about the first if there wasn't the second... i think my point is clear..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember I loved this movie in the cinema. The plot is original and sensitive. When the movie finished we felt like being in another world. Our live is a dream? Is this really happening? Alejandro Amenabar took us to another dimension.Alejandro Amenabar is a very good director and writer and I thought that it would be a good election to take the same actors than his first movie, Tesis, but I was wrong.I have to say that I don't like Penelope Cruz as an actress, so I found no deception in her performance, but Fele Martinez and Eduardo Noriega were very good in Tesis. When I saw this movie for the fourth time last month I realized that all the performance work in this movie is not even near of its level.All the way I recommend this movie because the script is very surprising, the Amenabar air is there, so is a very good movie, despite the performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seen Vanilla Sky for the first time last week and just watched Abre Los Ojos tonight on DVD. I think both movies are great in their own right. I do think it's kind of lame that the movie was remade in less than 5 years, but whatever. I think the acting was much better in the VS version and this made the characters more likable (and I am usually NOT a Tom Cruise fan, but loved him in this role). The thing I liked better in this original version is that they gave more hints as to what the ending really was before the actual ending... in VS I was totally in the dark until the very ending. I don't get why everyone says that in VS that it was like we had to be "spoon-fed" and have everything explained to us.. because they basically do that in Abre Los Ojos too... the man that runs L.E. explains it all to Cesar at the end. So that difference I really don't see at all. If I had to pick one of the two to see, I would choose VS but it's neat to see both and compare and I do give credit where credit is due... this movie DID come first and is a great story and very original idea. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>foolish to criticise an original, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to review any alternate version of something you love with an open mind, and it seems foolish to criticise an original. But to my Vanilla Sky tainted eyes, the original makes everything just a tad more obvious; dialogue and narrative conspire to signpost the twist and generally make the atmosphere of the film's landscape less dreamic. This is a psychological thriller whereas Cameron's remake is an exploration of memory. Would it have seemed so obvious if I didn't know the twist? I guess I'd be more than flattering myself if I claimed I'd still see it coming. Nevertheless, this is a conspiracy theory rather than a nightmare, and I preferred the nightmare. More to the point, Penelope Cruz is a BITCH in this version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic film with an awful ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part this film is amazing. A twisty psychological thriller where you're never sure what is real and what is part of a dream. There's a long and engaging set-up which always seems to be leading you towards a huge revelation as an ending. Unfortunately, the makers then decided to tack the plot of "Total Recall" onto this previously non-sci-fi thriller. The jump from psychological thriller to deus ex machina sci-fi movie is jarring and seems somehow inappropriate. A "cop out" in which the clever twists of the plot are undermined by the cinematic equivalent of "...and then I woke up". Which is a real shame as this is such an enjoyable film.Should you see it? definitely! Is the end disappointing? Unfortunately so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must have forgotten that the absolutely terrible Cameron Crowe/Tom Cruise film Vanilla Sky was a remake of this, the original Spanish film, and it is funny that the actress reprised her role as well, but anyway, I was hoping this original version would deserve it's place in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book. Basically in Madrid, twenty five year old wealthy playboy César (Eduardo Noriega) used to be a good looking young man attractive to women, but now he wears a prosthetic mask due to his hideously disfigured face, he is talking to psychiatrist Antonio (Chete Lera) and telling his story of how he came to be the way he is, in the hope to find some kind of closure. Flashbacks see that at his birthday party he met and flirted with the girlfriend of his best friend Pelayo (Fele Martínez), the beautiful Sofía (Penélope Cruz), he later takes her home, but they do not sleep together, and the next morning his obsessive ex-lover Nuria (Najwa Nimri) spots him leaving her house. Nuria offers César a ride back to her apartment for sex, but on the way she instead intentionally crashes the car to commit suicide, he however survives with the horrible disfigurements that cosmetic surgery cannot solve, Sofía is no longer able to look at him and goes back to Pelayo. Following his disfigurement César has a series of disorienting experiences, including falling asleep drunk in the middle of the street, and when he wakes up he finds that everything is changing for the better, Sofía is claiming now to love him, and surgeons are in fact able to restore his face and good looks, but he finds, when making love to Sofía, she changes into Nuria, he smothers her in panic with a pillow, but everyone claims that the woman he has done it to is in fact named Sofía. He is sent to prison, and while in there bits and pieces of his past come in the form of dreams, he finds out that after he was disfigured he went to Life Extension, a company specialising in cryonics, to preserve a longer, more peaceful and realistic seeming virtual reality of life, in dreams, and returning to their headquarters he finds out they specialise in "artificial perception", where he relives the past when being reborn in the future. When César was drunk on the street, he had in fact committed suicide, and this is the moment he entered cryonic suspension, everything after has been a dream, spliced together with reality and replacing his real memories. The end sees him wanting to wake himself up and be resurrected in the real world, he is convinced the drunken street moment was just a vision created by the company, psychiatrist Antonio tries to convince him he is in the real world, but in the end César leaps off the company's building, hoping he will finally open his eyes and end the fantasy. Also starring Gérard Barray as Duvernois and Jorge De Juan as Encargado L.E. This is a really thought provoking film, I paid absolute attention to everything that was going on because of how fascinating the concept of trying to escape reality and enter a better alternative fantasy was played out, the relationship between Noriega and Cruz is great, the makeup to disfigure Noriega's face is terrific, the murder mystery and twists along the way are clever, and you can recognise the mixes of Eyes without a Face and Vertigo, it is a fantastic psychological thriller. Very good!</fullReview>
