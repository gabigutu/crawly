		<shortDescription>Absolutely amazing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More often than not, it's much better to show nothing than anything at all. Hitchcock knew this, and that's how he essentially became known as The Master of Suspense. Had he shown Norman's "mother" from "Psycho" killing the girl in the shower in greater detail, the horror of the scene would have been more greatly ineffective as compared to just how haunting it is today.Jacques Tourneur obviously understood this idea and used it to his advantage in "Cat People." An experienced director of cult horror films from the 30s and 40s, Tourneur's story of a woman with a mysterious background still works as a pinnacle thriller sixty years later. Movies like this aren't made anymore--and I mean that in a literal sense. A more modern director would use bad CGI effects to reveal the "cat woman" for what she is, and I can only imagine how an idea like this would translate to the screen nowadays. But the key to "Cat People" is that we never even see the cat people. We don't see anything. We don't want to see anything."A Kiss Could Change Her Into a Monstrous Fang-and-Claw Killer!" boasted the tagline in 1942. Of course, this is an ancient filmmaking technique for that age--symbolic of the loss of one's virginity, the essential background of the tale is rooted deeply in the nature and misconceptions of sexuality at the time.The monogamy of it all is very subtle and, at first glance, nonexistent--but the deeper you look into the hints the clearer the signs appear. Irena is not allowed to kiss a man or she changes into a monstrous beast. A metaphor for loss of virginity and the result stemming from this is old folklore, and the film's use of Irena's background is more than just an explanation for her genetic traits--it is a way of creating the central idea that she lives in fear of her own background of sexuality. It's as subtle and effective as the entire film's approach to horror.Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon) is a fashion artist living in New York City. Born from a Serbian background, she lives under the impression that her own family's roots lie in an ancient curse of the "cat people" that were thrown out of a city in Serbia hundreds of years before.Animals do indeed react strangely to her. She is unable to enter into a pet store, because the squawks of scared birds and the barks of sensitive dogs drown out the entire area. It is almost as if she is truly an animal. When she is given a pet kitten, she takes it back and exchanges it for a bird. The bird dies from fright weeks later.When she meets Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) downtown in the city, she falls desperately and hopelessly in love, but the depression of her own fear of unleashing the cat within prevents her from coming in close contact with her own boyfriend--and eventual husband.Left untouched by his own wife, Oliver eventually turns to his co-worker Alice Moore (Jane Randolph) for satisfaction (only lightly hinted at by the film), which ends up sparking a terrifying anger and hatred within Irena. Hounded by a curious psychiatrist (Tom Conway) and feeling like an outcast around her own husband, Irena's inner cat is indeed released and wreaks brief havoc upon those around her.We never see the cat, and we never see Irena's transformation into another species. But, as I said before, it's much better--and certainly more effective--this way, as the suspense and mystery of the film propels it towards repeat viewings. The movie is even a bit like "Ginger Snaps," in a way, only it's certainly more moody and suspenseful. And there aren't any fake-looking dog puppets in this version of the tale.It's always pleasant to watch classic movies late at night on a Friday or Saturday night. No one cares about them anymore--cheap straight-to-video movies air on television earlier than the classics. But these are the staples of every existing genre--specifically horror, when it comes to films like "Cat People." These types of films should be appreciated much more than they have been in the past, say, sixty years."Cat People" is an amazing achievement with a distinct sense of classic horror and a good dose of suspense. If you like horror--or if you don't--this is a must-see film, and it is certainly one of the most memorable cult horror classics of all time, led by some great performances and a very talented director behind the camera. What a treat.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly underrated and hugely influential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have this theory about the horror films of Val Lewton. It is my contention that these movies caused a sea change in the content and tone of the movies of Alfred Hitchcock. The reason I say this is simple, really: Lewton is the only filmmaker I have ever caught Hitchcock cribbing scenes from. He did it twice. Once from The Seventh Victim (dir. by Mark Robson), which I swear to god provides the first half of the Shower Scene from Psycho. The second from Cat People, which provided the pet store scene in The Birds. This second scene is almost a shot for shot swipe. Both of these steals are evidence that Hitch knew and admired the Lewton movies. More than that, though, there is a change in the subtext of Hitchcock's thrillers after the Lewton movies. The movies he made before them were cut from the Fritz Lang mold of political thrillers. After the Lewton movies, Hitch's movies became more psychosexual in nature. Vertigo, for instance, could easily fit into Lewton's output.Cat People is the first of the Lewton movies and sets the tone for them. It pretends to be about a McGuffin (serbian were -panthers), but is actually about something else (in this case, frigidity and repressed lesbianism). This represents a huge change in the evolution of the horror movie. Cat People is the first horror movie to explore these themes as central concerns rather than as sub-rosa undercurrents. It also pioneered the techniques of film noir (which as a genre didn't really exist yet). Cat People is strikingly stylized and its effect is of stranding the viewer in the middle of a darkened room with some dreadful beast circling just outside his sphere of perception. This has a hell of an impact--particularly if you have the good fortune to see this in a theater. I'm not going to claim that Cat People is one of the best horror movies ever made (it does have flaws), but it is one of the four most influential horror movies ever made (along with The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Psycho, and Night of the Living Dead). But unlike its brethren, its influence spreads corrosively through the entirety of cinema through both film noir and the films of Alfred Hitchcock. You would be hard pressed to find any film short of Citizen Kane or Rashomon that is nearly as influential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Lewton/Tourneur Collaboration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the zoo, Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) sees the mysterious Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon), who is sketching a black panther. He's intrigued by her--it seems to be love at first sight--and is surprised when she invites him into her apartment for a cup of tea. While in her apartment, he sees an odd statue of a man on horseback, holding a sword-skewered cat high in the air. Dubrovna tells him of her native Serbia, and the legend of unchristian "cat people" who were driven into the mountains. Dubrovna's behavior becomes increasingly odd, and animals often react strangely to her. Could she have something to do with the legend of the cat people? This was director Jacques Tourneur and producer Val Lewton's first horror/thriller film together (they were to do two others together, I Walked With A Zombie (1943) and The Leopard Man (1943)), and for my money, this is the best of the three. Lewton was famous for understated, atmospheric horror that suggested more than it showed, a style that is also evident in his later collaborations with director Robert Wise (who went on to direct the infamous The Haunting (1963), which is often thought to be a pinnacle of this more "suggestive" style, although it's not a particular favorite of mine).So what does this mean? Well, a lot of younger horror fans, for whom the oldest film that they are really familiar with in the genre is something like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) or an even more recent film, might be reluctant to call Cat People a horror film. It is "talky", doesn't contain any graphic violence, and we don't even see a horror creature/villain until just a glimpse near the very end of the film. But it is horror--the talking is centered on a captivating supernatural "myth", there are a lot of creepy, well-photographed scenes laden with heavy shadows, there are a couple exquisite chase/suspense scenes, and there is a lot of complex, dark psychological interaction.The psychological tension is really the focus, as Lewton and Tourneur's films together are moral parables that function more as a metaphor for horror (rather than the more common flipside, where the horror is more prominent and might be a metaphor for some other kind of philosophical point). In this case, the moral and social situations are varied and complex, but are all focused on romantic relationships, ranging from quick actions taken due to lust, to emotional distancing, adultery and abuse of power. The more one watches the film, the more one is likely to get out of the subtextual messages. They remain more subtextual than they might in modern cinema because of content restrictions imposed by studios in this era (although of course those were a reaction to prevalent cultural attitudes at the time). But in retrospect, the buried nature of the themes is a benefit, at least in this case.Occasionally, the horrific aspect of these types of films can be too understated, so that they simply become realist dramas. That's not the case here. This is a film that is rewarding on many levels.A 9 out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A howl in a concrete jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One doesn't want for a second to take credit away from screenwriter DeWitt Bodeen, one of the most intelligent scenarists the horror film evr had the benefit of. But it's a matter of record that producer Val Lewton, here as on all his horror pictures, was responsible for the initial premise and the screenplay's final draft. And one wonders how much of Lewton - one of those male writers who tended to form his most empathetic bond with his female characters - there is in Irene: like him an eastern european immigrant (she from Serbia, he from Russia, albeit second generation he grew up in an essentially Russian household) living in the very different world of 40's America, both hyper-sensitive (particularly over morbid fantasies regarding cats) and artists of an essentially solitary and modest nature, but prone to fits of violent temper. Certainly, Irene is one of the most vivid and haunting protagonists any horror film ever had. Some critics may disparage the film as inferior to its follow-up, 'I Walked With a Zombie', but although that's a more completely achieved work, none of its characters captures the imagination as Irene does. One scarcely needs to heap more praise on the most celebrated suspense sequences, but the rest of the movie is more than just a set-up for these. It is, for one thing, oneof the supreme evocations of spiritual loneliness in the cinema. As Irene huddles by the doorknob between her and husband Oliver, while the panther in the nearby zoo calls out through the wintery night, this is an evocation of an isolation more than merely physical and tragically irrevocable. Lewton also had on his side, in this instance, the best of his directors, Jacques Tourneur, a sensualist (which could scarecely be said of his successors, Mark Robson and Robert Wise) who makes of the story a sort of tactile poem in the textures of the black fur of Irene's coat, the silk of her stockings, the flakes of falling snow on Irene and Oliver's wedding night, the wet tarmac across which Jane Randolph has to make her scary walk home, the ebony of an Egyptian cat-statue, the fabric of a couch torn by Irene's fingernails, the white enamel of Irene's bath-tub and the gleaming dusky hunch of her wet shoulders as she sits weeping within. This is a subtle movie, but also an intensely physical one. If there is a weak spot, it lies with the casting of Kent Smith as 'good plain Americano' Oliver Reed. His boy next door charm is hopelessly inadequate to the context of Irene's drama and he increasingly seems doltish and blindly insensitive in the blandness of his responses to her torment. The film might have been greater still if Lewton had cast an edgier, fierier actor, one whose incomprehension of Irene might have betrayed its own violent streak and extended the 'cat people' metaphor beyond Irene herself. Think of someone like John Garfield in the role! But Garfield would have been out of Lewton's budget range and one can scarcely harangue the producer for being too modest, in the production of his first quickie horror, for fully grasping how rich a work of film poetry he and his collaborators were in the process of creating. But poetry it is. The horror genre has never produced as much of that as it ought to have done, so for heaven's sake, make the most of this and the other Lewton productions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror classic. Hugely influential and still as enjoyable as ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Cat People' was the first collaboration between director Jacques Tourneur ('Curse Of The Demon') and producer Val Lewton, and is still one of their greatest achievements, and one of the most influential horror movies ever made. It's arguably the best horror movie made between the Universal classics of the 1930s and the beginning of Hammer studios in the 1950s. So many subsequent film makers from Hitchcock on down have been influenced by this movie and yet it rarely gets the respect it deserves. 'Cat People' pretends to be a monster movie but is really something more complex, and relies on atmosphere and suspense rather than explicit shocks or gore (there is virtually none of the latter). Fans of Hitchcock and film noir will probably appreciate it more than hardcore gorehounds. Simone Simon is very well cast as the mysterious and troubled Irena and the rest of the cast range from adequate to very good. The acting is probably one of the weakest links in the film but not enough to spoil your enjoyment (I think 1940s acting is an acquired taste and I can see how a modern viewer who expects more realistic and natural performances could sometimes find them a bit hard to swallow). 'Cat People' is a horror classic and is highly recommended to anyone interested in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror As Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since the heyday of James Whale in the early and mid-thirties had there been anything like this one, a horror art movie. As persuasively acted by Kent Smith and Simon Simon, it concerns a young American architect, romantic if somewhat dry, and his Serbian-born wife, who has an irrational fear of turning into a cat. Since our introduction to her has her standing in front of the lion cage at the zoo, we are inclined to believe her.The couple's sexual difficulties (we see him sleeping on the sofa) lead the husband to suggest psychotherapy, which turns out to have tragic consequences, as it gets the poor woman too in touch with her feelings. Very little of the horror in this film is shown. Cat People was revolutionary in this respect, and had a huge impact on many films that followed, not just horrors. The picture also put its producer, Val Lewton, on the map, making him the first and last wunderkind of B movies, as he became somewhat of a celebrity from this point on, turning out high quality fright films for the next four years. Never before or since has a B level producer achieved such status. Director Jacques Tourneur deserves the lion's share of credit for this movie, bringing his light touch, in itself almost feline, to every scene; and in making the story seem far more intelligent than it is. Like Lewton, Tourneur was a gifted man whose natural refinement was both his making as well as his undoing, since a man of his taste and sensibility could never thrive in Hollywood, and could only expect success in fits and starts, as indeed would prove to be the case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shadow and light.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After several movies made in his native France ,Jacques (Jack) Tourneur makes his first American works in the late thirties."Cat people" is the fifth one;the others are difficult to see and anyway this is this movie that is looked upon as his towering achievement(with the exception of "out of the past") .His female star,Simone Simon,whose English was perfect,enjoyed a career in both countries too:her best part is easily Jean Renoir's "la b?te humaine" ,(human beast:it's funny when you know she's playing a woman-animal here)."Cat people" belongs to the fantasy and horror genre,but it does not really follow its rules.We're close to psychological drama.(Almost) deprived of "special effects" -which is a blessing-Tourneur works with his camera the way a painter does with shadow and light to create strange dreamy atmospheres The pi?ces de résistance are the scene in the swimming -pool that creates a feeling of terror without using the tricks of the trade,and the scene when Oliver and Alice are in the flat,hearing roaring.The movie was ahead of its time in several respects:the Freudian allusions would later be developed by Fritz Lang("secret beyond the door",1945) and of course Hitchcock ("Spellbound",same year).You're going to say that these two great directors give their movies a "realistic" treatment and Jack Tourneur does not.Actually,he takes a divergent way:he introduces ambiguity,this ambiguity dear to Roman Polanski .After all,it could be a mere ,so to speak, neurosis.Few of the sequences actually deal with the supernatural :most of the time,it's a couple then a triangle:the "fantastic" elements could be real :the disturbing woman,who calls Irene "my sister",the scenes with the panther at the zoo,and the pool sequence can be explained by Ir?ne's jealousy.Although,it's only understood ,it's obvious that the marriage Ir?ne/Oliver has not been consummated,because of a not clearly defined reason-how can a man as pragmatist as Oliver believe in such a far-fetched curse?Isn't it the fear of woman,of the original sin?.This topic will be brilliantly taken on by Christian de Challonges "l'alliance" (1970).Note also how Richard Donner aped the pet shops scene for "the omen" (1976).It seems that Alice's character is an easy way out,and the weak part of the movie because she's essentially here to comfort the audience,to show the way to "straight" life and to secure a happy end.The remake (1982) destroys all ambiguity,keeps nothing from the original story but the proper nouns ,and fills its quota of nudity and blood.Stick to the Tourneur version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe even the greatest horror film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror genre has had many of the greatest films of all time stem from it, and Cat People is, without doubt, one of the best and most important. The film represents the first collaboration between (probably) horror's most important producer, and one of the genre's best directors. Under Val Lewton's watchful eye, Jacques Tourneur has managed to put together a film that successfully fuses a foreboding atmosphere with a terrific storyline and the result is a film with merits impossible to deny. The story starts off slowly, with Kent Smith's American gentleman meeting the Serbian beauty Simone Simon sketching a black leopard in a zoo. From there, the two fall in love amidst a backdrop of malevolence stemming from her belief that she is the victim of an ancient curse on her village that means she will transform into a black panther if emotionally aroused. The two get married anyway, but it soon becomes apparent that this curse will play a bigger part in their marriage than either of them first imagined or hoped.There are two sides to this great movie. The first side is the technical one. Jacques Tourneur's handling of the camera is superb, and the way that the characters are manipulated into certain situations allows him to really show his talent. Consider the famous shadow-laden scene at the swimming pool, or the sequence that sees Jane Randolph being pursued by a mysterious presence. These scenes work not because of the characters or the situation; but because of the way that Tourneur captures the scene. He would go on to show this talent throughout his career, but it's done best here. The acting is typical of the forties, with much of it being soaked in melodrama. This actually helps the film because the heavy performances allow you to really get into what the film is trying to achieve and, despite the fact that the subject material is definitely 'B-class'; the acting gives it a grounding alongside the bigger budgeted films of it's day. The beautiful Simone Simon takes the lead role, and it's her persona and European origin that gives the film much of it's intrigue and mystery. Kent Smith and Jane Randolph are great in support, while Tom Conway shines like he has in several other Val Lewton films in his small but effective role as the psychiatrist.The second side of the film concern's its story. This is the main reason why Cat People is such an enchanting piece of cinema. Soaked in mystery, the central plot - which handles themes of lust, aggression and not being able to subdue certain emotions, will always be relevant to whoever is viewing the film. While here it is portrayed in a much more extreme way than in real life, the fundamentals of what the plot is portraying exist in every person. More important than this, however, is the way that the mythology is built up around the 'cat people'. We are never really given a definite explanation as to what the curse is all about, and this allows the director to tap into the fear of the unknown, and this also allows him to keep the cards regarding the ending close to his chest throughout. Obviously, due to the time in which it was made; Cat People wasn't allowed to show shocking violence, but it implies brilliantly; and despite the fact that we never really see anything - it is easy to believe otherwise. The simple plot really helps the film as it allows it to convey what it needs to convey without getting tangled up in sub-plots and other non-essential elements; and this piece of pulp poetry really shows that you don't need an epic running time to create a successful film. I really can't recommend this film highly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes The Less You See, The Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie provides a good demonstration of how you can still generate good suspense without violence seen on-screen. Director Jacques Tourneur and producer Val Lewton liked these kind of film presentations. This was Lewton's first film, by the way. Viewers either seem to really be for this slower classic style, or totally turned off by these kind of films. It depends, I suppose, on what you are expecting and what kind of movies you like. If you are looking for an action-packed film, with some bloody or horrible scenes, skip this film. It will just bore you to death.If you prefer the implied violent acts, horror, and even sexual stuff , then this is your cup of tea. It's very "moody." Simon Simone does well in the key role of "Irena Dubrovna." Animals fear her and she fears getting attached to someone, such as "Oliver Reed" (Kent Smith) who comes along and there is mutual attraction. What happens to those two, and others I won't say. The film is only 72 minutes so why divulge what's in it? Just know what to expect. This is a far cry from today's horror films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An American man (Kent Smith) marries a Serbian immigrant called Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon) , a shy woman who fears that she will turn into the cat person of her homeland's fables if they are intimate together . Dubrovna believes she carries the Serbian curse of the panther . As strange Irena knew strange, fierce pleasures that no other woman could ever feel . She was marked with the curse of those who slink and and court and kill y night . Oliver then sends Irena for treatment with psychiatrist Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway) . Meanwhile , Reed finds consolation with his colleague Alice Moore (Jane Randolph) and then jealousy and envy crop out . Later on , rampages take place through community . Over-the-top classic picture filled with thrills , intrigue , drama , a loving triangle , some moments of shock and results to be pretty entertaining . Atmospheric goings-on dominate this typically tasteful horror study from director Tourner . Suspense , tension and horror is exposed lurking , menacing , harassing in rooms , stairs , doors and a menagerie . Cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca is magnificent , plenty of lights and dark originating an eerie and creepy scenario . The movie was produced by RKO and its most known and famed producer , Val Lewton , the biggest producer of horror classics (I walked with a Zombie , Leopard man , Bedlam , Ghost ship ), plus he produced for director Mark Robson (in Cat people he works as an editor) numerous films (Isle of the dead , seventh victim) with similar technicians and artists . R.K.O. gave Val Lewton only $150,000 to make the film , resulting in "creative" producing . In fact ; because of the incredibly tight budget, sets from Orson Welles' The Magnificent Amberson were re-used . This forced many of the scenes requiring special effects to be done in shadows which many believe increased the suspense of the film . When studio execs insisted that more footage of the panther be included in the movie, Lewton was able to maintain the budget and the suspense of the film by limiting how many scenes the panther could be visibly seen and told the cinematographer to "keep the panther in the shadows" . Thus the panther called Dynamite appeared in another film by the same producers/directors: 'Leopard man' and was only visible in the office and zoo cage .RKO usual musician , Roy Webb , creates a fine score with the habitual musical director Bakaleinikoff . Excellent and evocative set design at charge of Albert D'Agostino . The picture was stunningly directed by Jaques Tourneur , being filmed in 18 days . The film was such a hit at the box office, the releases of the next two Lewton films I walked with a Zombie and Leopard man were delayed . Torneur knew the imagination was stronger than anything filmmakers could show visually and played on it with breathtaking results . Addicts to RKO horror should no account miss this movie . The flick will appeal to classic cinema moviegoers . Followed by a sequel titled ¨Curse of the cat people¨ by Robert Wise with similar cast as Simone Simon , Kent Smith and Elizabeth Russell . And an inferior remake (1982) by Paul Schrader with Natassja Kinski , John Heard , Malcolm McDowell , Scott Paulin and Ed Begley</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie feels like two halves. The early part of the movie through the wedding and the catwoman outing Irena is the slower, lower quality portion, but who knows...? the scares in the 2nd half may be better and more startling because your expectations have been lowered. Kent Smith as husband Oliver Reed has those just-short-of-handsome looks you always find in B-movie leading men and it's amazing that the film can overcome his simpleton line readings.I always wondered how the backstory would be presented, and it's interesting to see how it unfolds. The script doesn't dawdle with playing it both ways. Although characters may think Irenas concerns are psychotic, they are implicitly confirmed for the viewer. The cat transformations are never shown but the thrust is clear. Irena is not delusional. Much can be said about the material which provocatively (for 1942) suggests a connection between sexuality and the release of feral urges. And it's very interesting to see how such overtly sexual content is built on such small touches in the age of full-on censorship (the war years). The movie is charming and creepy.At least one scary sequence (the pursuit of Alice) works so well because they left it unscored. It's much more typical for scary movies to pound you over the head with the score. That terrific little sequence is followed rapidly by the much-admired swimming pool sequence, which is assembled pretty well from the initial growl to the shredded bathrobe. A third unexpected scare takes place in Olivers shipbuilding office; a panther stalks Oliver and Alice across a dark floor to a vivid white pin-up wall; with the beautiful film noir lighting the movie is known for.Something no one has mentioned so far; Irena has a strange dream with animated superimposed panthers padding around.The psychiatrist is the classic slimeball, but the script provides an interesting rationale for his provocation of Irena. Unfortunately the panther attack on him just can't be convincingly depicted on this budget and it ends up being funny &amp; corny.Still it's rare when a movie described as a small pleasure is in fact that. I was smiling as it ended.Paul Schraders 1982 remake, which I saw first, takes itself much too seriously and suffers from pointless additions (Malcolm MacDowell as Irena's cat-brother, an incest sub-plot, gratuitous nudity, gore and effects) and the casting of another complete stiff John Heard in the Oliver role again. Despite Nastasia Kinski's charms, 40 years of film development offered nothing to improve the piece. This malarkey is perfect at the scale it was filmed in 1942.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shadows In the Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cat People" was the first of nine horror movies from the RKO "B" unit headed by the legendary Val Lewton. Lewton had worked for the unpredictable Davis O. Selznick in the 1930s. Lewton left Selznick (who wouldn't have) and was offered a chance to head up his own "B" unit at RKO. And the rest as they say is history.Irena (Simone Simon) and Oliver (Kent Smith) meet at a zoo where she is sketching pictures of a black panther. Oliver is immediately attracted to the mysterious Irena and they marry. When Irena is unable to consummate their marriage, Oliver tries to be understanding. It seems Irena descends from a people whose women turn into black panthers when aroused or angered. As corny as it sounds, the premise actually works under the able direction of Jacques Tourneur and the supervision of Lewton.Alice Moore (Jane Randolph) works with Oliver and confesses her love for him. Irena meanwhile, has sought out help from psychiatrist Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway). Oliver in the meantime has come to love Alice and tells Irena that their marriage is over. Irena becomes jealous of Alice and you know what that means.In two of the film's classic scenes, Lewton gives us the first of his "shadows in the dark" scares. First, Irena follows Alice through the park at night and suddenly Alice becomes aware that "something" is following her. We never see what we believe to be a panther but only subtle suggestions of same.The second sequence takes place in the swimming pool at Alice's apartment building. Irena follows Alice to the pool area. Again, Alice senses that something is stalking her and she jumps into the pool for protection and begins to yell for help. The scene ends with Irena turning on the light and asking Alice if she has seen Oliver. Irena leaves and Alice discovers that her bathrobe has been torn to shreds.A third such scene takes place at Oliver and Alice's office when we clearly see a black panther stalking the pair. Later, Dr. Judd who turns out to be a let ch tries to seduce Irena. She suddenly begins to change and............Lewton was able to create terror in the minds of his audience through skillful use darkness, shadows and suggestion. We never actually see any monster in the films key fright scenes. It lives in the imaginations of his audience. He did this on a "B" picture budget with a limited shooting schedule.The performances are excellent. Simon was chosen for the lead because of her cat-like features and turns in the performance of her career. Smith is adequate as the understanding (to a point) husband. Randolph as the "other woman" plays well against the Simon character. Conway does what he can with the limited role of Dr. Judd. Jack Holt puts in a brief appearance as Smith and Randolph's boss.Followed by "The Curse of the Cat People" (1944).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning to you young people out there who say this movie is "boring": It is true that there's no blood. There's no on-screen killing, no teenage girls take their clothes off, and no chainsaws are involved.What Cat People does have, though, is understated suspense, a great '40s vibe, and a subtext about sexual arousal that is apparently lost on the current generation. (And a super-cute Siamese kitten!) Now, don't get me wrong: Cat People, for all its greatness, is still a B-movie, and the acting is wooden and the plot a bit suspect. Even in a courtroom, and even in the 1940s, "you may now kiss the bride" was part of the marriage ceremony. Did Oliver really NEVER try to kiss Irina before their wedding night? C'mon.But those are minor concerns, and they only occur to you if you're a movie critic (as we all are, at least for a moment, here), or if you've seen the movie 10 or 20 times, as I have.The swimming pool scene and the scene with the bus ("bus"becoming a cameraman's term for that kind of shot) are just classic. You don't want to miss them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film hits me on the most personal level of any film I've ever seen. This tale about a young, beautiful, Serbian immigrant named Irena, who marries a man named Oliver, but can't have sex with him because she believes she'll kill him, is a movie that speaks to me every time I watch it. I see so much of myself in the character of Irena, and I connect so much with her tortured psyche. The way she is afraid of hurting those she cares about, the way no one can understand her, and the way she's her own other worldly being are aspects that I can identify with, and make me look at Irena as a kindred spirit for me. But aside from relating to the lead character, I also adore Jacque Tourneur's artistic direction, the story, the lighting, the music, the dialogue, and the overall poetic, and darkly romantic feel to this movie. This film is a true work of art, I've watched it millions of times, and I'm still not done with it. Val Lewton, I love you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Cat Crossed My Path</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mysterious and alluring fashion designer Simone Simon (as Irena Dubrovna) visits the local zoo, to sketch a ferocious black panther. There, she attracts handsome architect Kent Smith (as Oliver "Ollie" Reed), and the two are quickly married. But, things don't go well for the newlyweds. Get ready to suspend your disbelief, because the beautiful Ms. Simon won't have martial relations with her husband - in fact, they've never even kissed? Simon fears, with any hint of sexual pleasure, she will turn into a big cat and scratch Mr. Reed's eyes out!It all has to do with a dreadful, ancient Serbian curse (of the "Cat People"). Reed is so taken with Simon, that he decides he'll continue to wait for that first kiss (and whatever else comes up) while he refers her to Freudian psychiatrist Tom Conway (as Louis Judd). Mr. Conway's character explains (in the opening quote), "Even as fog continues to lie in the valleys, so does ancient sin cling to the low places," and Conway decides a little kissing of the patient might be just what the doctor ordered. Somehow, Reed also manages to resist beautiful co-worker Jane Randolph (as Alice Moore), who throws his jealous wife into a feline rage.The combination of producer Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur works magically on this modestly budgeted suspense thriller; more of the "horror" is suggested than shown, which is always most effective. With cameraman Nicholas Musuraca assisting, the crew makes excellent use of light and shadows. Note how even the "extras" (woman standing beside Reed and waltzing musician in the opening) and bit players (cleaning woman and waitress) are used effectively. Sets creep, vehicles hiss, and smoke billows artfully.********* Cat People (12/6/42) Val Lewton : Jacques Tourneur ~ Simone Simon, Kent Smith, Jane Randolph, Tom Conway</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More melodrama than horror; brilliant whatever it is.(possible spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fassbinder once applauded the best Hollywood melodramas because they sympathised with the outcast figures, at the expense of the monstrously clean-cut conventional protagonists. He singled out for especial praise brilliant German emigre Douglas Sirk, but his insights are pertinent to the horror B-Movies produced by Val Lewton in the 1940s, rare Hollywood films that privileged the traumas inside their heroine's minds, allowing the audience to sympathise with problematic characters as they are being demonised by society's representatives.Blissfully ignorant of brinks of pretentiousness, Lewton's films transcend their shocker rew materials with profuse symbolic and allusive patterns; otherworldly dream atmospheres, in which the everyday clashes with the unconscious; startlingly inventive direction spliced with irony and tenderness. CAT PEOPLE has had a profound influence on subsequent horror films - its withholding the visual presence of the beast to increase terror - but this is defiantly non-sensationalistic; the restoration of order is a tragic defeat.Irena Dubrovna is a fashion designer who visits the zoo regularly to draw panthers. One day she meets the inappropriately named Oliver Reed, and they quickly fall in love. Irena, steeped in a Serbian legend in which the natives of her village became Satanists who could turn into wild cats at the touch of their lovers, is terrified to consummate the relationship. Professing infinite patience, Reed marries her, but eventually becomes exasperated with what he perceives as Irena's frigidity, and turns to an old friend, Alice Moore, for succour, which eventually becomes romance, while sending Irena to a psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Judd.Betrayed and rejected by Reed, Irena begins terrorising Alice, following her at night, stalking her at her swimming pool, her offended sensibility seeming to turn her into a vicious panther. Reed, Alice and Judd decide to get her committed, and Judd, who disbelieves Irena's stories and fears, concocts a plan to catch her.Such a bald outline suggests a merely sensational horror film, but the two most creepy sequences - when Irena stalks Alice - are as much about Alice's guilt and terror of retribution as they are about suspense. The shocks work because they disrupt the placid complacency of Alice's mind, that has no problem in demonising Irena with doubletalk to get her man.Lewton was arguably the first to discern the intimate connection between the horror film and the woman's melodrama, an insight brought to stunning fruition in Nicholas Ray's BIGGER THAN LIFE. All the elements of the former - the female trapped in a house haunted by the past; the creepy, Expressionist visuals; the linking of female sexuality with entrapment, bestiality, engulfing threat and self-destruction (the brilliant, unexpected variation on the old caged bird trope); the visualisation of mental breakdown; the eruption of the unconscioius in dream - all serve to portray the desperate plight of a lonely woman doubly damned by foreigness and artistic talent. For CAT PEOPLE is an attack on America on at least two important fronts. The scene is set for an anti-Jamesian struggle between corrupted European Irena, paralysed by culture and male-created myth and tradition, and the brave new world of 'Americano' Reed. But this latter is just as corrupt as Eurupe, and as hostile to women, similarly demonising those it can't handle. Irena is an artist, a dark, subjective Expressionist, who brings home to the smug Americans dark truths about their society and inner lives they'd rather ignore (Reed, even at the end, says she never lied). They insist on the straight lines of Alice and Reed's draughting job, and the repressive, sterile psychoanalytic apparatus (ironically European). They try to root out the imagination, the female realm, the circular, the submerged - in the film's climax, a T-square is used (successfully) as a cross to ward off evil spirits. This is reflected in the film's form - the first half is immensely sympathetic to Irena, allowing access only to her mind and anxieties, adopting a repetitive, visual, symbolic, 'female' pattern rather than straight narrative; the second half tries to wipe her away by plot, by turning her into an object, by demonising her, shadowing her, turning her from a troubled woman into an emanation, a symbol of dark things that must be cast out. The three 'normal' characters take over the plot, conspiring to root her out, coldly deciding which method to use - divorce or commital - sympathising with poor old Reed for HIS troubles. This is a leech who broke into the life of a woman of independent financial and creative means. This disjunction between American whiteness and European darkness threatened to overturn her plot from the beginning, e.g. when they get married, celebrating in a Serbian restaurant - the WASPS observe, comment, direct our gaze; the Serbians are dark, enigmatic, bestial. This is a darkly disturbing view that, by refusing to show its supposed anxieties, actually manages to attack the conservative, American, way of looking at the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much Written about and Endlessly Analyzed, this is one of the First True Film Noirs and Ironically it is not a Contemporary Crime Film. In Fact, it not only has a Noir Template, it is also an Early Psychological Thriller. Add to that, the Supernatural Theme and Monster Transformation and it is Simply a very Complex little Movie that contains so much for so Little Money that to this Day many Consider it the Best B-Movie ever Made.The Founding Father of all this is Producer Val Lewton, one of the Very Few Producers, if any, that became Synonymous with Their Films. The Directorial Talent here is Jacques Tourneur, who can also take Equal Credit for the Movie's Artistic Achievements and ultimate Success.It is a Gloomy, Moody, Sensual, and Beautifully Disturbing Piece of Cinema. The Ending is Surprising and Satisfying and the Creepiness is Never Absent.

They fall in love and get married, but run into trouble when she finds herself afraid of intimacy, since she believes the fables and legends of her homeland that indicate she is descended from a cursed line of Cat People, who turn murderous when aroused. He scoffs at this, but when his friend &amp; co-worker Alice(played by Jane Randolph) is stalked by a cat-like creature, he begins to wonder. Meanwhile, Irina sees psychiatrist Dr. Louis Judd(played by Tom Conway) who has designs on Irina himself...

		<fullReview>After the late Medieval King John of Serbia defeated the Mamelukes, he crushed their Serbian serfs, "Cat People" who had turned to demonic worship and thus could transform into big cats. A few, however, escaped into the mountains. The story is better served if "Turks" is used rather than "Mamelukes," but never mind. The legend is related by the Serbian refugee Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon), in her apartment, to the marine draftsman Oliver Reed (Kent Smith), after they had met in the Central Park, NY zoo. Irena, a commercial designer and artist, had been sketching a black panther. Over time Oliver courts and marries Irena. At the Serbian restaurant of celebration, a feline-looking waitress calls Irena "My Sister," one of the hints that helps Irena believe that she is descended from the Cat People. As she fears that arousal of her passions will transform her into a cat (and seemingly kill Oliver), the marriage is never consummated. Patient but incredulous, Oliver persuades her to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway), in order to prove that her fears are unfounded. Time passes, and as Oliver's love grows cold, he seeks comfort from Alice Moore (Jane Randolph), a co-worker who had loved him a all-along. The turn of events does not sit well with Irena, who grows resentful. Thus is the stage set for the movie's three remarkable scenes of terror: 1) After dinner with Oliver, Alice walks home alone through Central Park in the dark. She becomes quite uneasy when an unseen "cat-like" presence seems to be stalking her. It seems to be gaining and growling ? (suspenseful build-up) ? when to her relief, a bus suddenly appears at a stop. She quickly boards. Later several dead sheep are discovered in the area with both cat and human footprints.(2) One evening Alice decides to swim in the basement swimming pool of her apartment. The lighting is none too bright, and Alice appears alone. There are shadows that suggest a big cat stalking her, and she hears strange sounds. Quickly she jumps into the pool for protection ? the shadows are unsettling along the pool walls ... something is closing in ... Alice screams. Suddenly Irena appears with the pool attendant, and the lights are switched on. Alice is not quite sure what had happened, until she finds her robe torn to shreds, apparently by a big cat.(3) After a session with Dr. Judd, Irena seems no longer afraid of passion arousal, but her "healing" comes too late. Oliver is determined to marry Alice. A big cat soon confronts Alice and Oliver in his office, but Oliver fends it off successfully with a T-square (cross?). He now knows that the cat is Irena. This relatively minor scare scene is followed by one even more terrifying. Right after, Irena is in the presence of the sleazy Dr. Judd, who has been lusting over her. Forgetting his professional decorum, the doctor grabs her and kisses her, for he wants to possess her physically. During the subsequent confrontation, she turns into a panther. The violent struggle between man and beast is seen in shadow; Irena the panther kills the psychiatrist but is wounded. Not long after, Irena allows herself to be killed by the black panther in the zoo.The story holds up quite well if one realizes that Irena's passions are not just related to sexual pleasures, but also to jealous envy (still related to sexual issues = the other woman with Oliver) and outrage (also related to sexual issues = attempted rape by Dr. Judd). Producer Val Lewton, Director Jacques Tourneur, and Cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca created a near masterpiece out of a small budget. For there are two ways of presenting shock to an audience: (1) the old artistic and eerie way - creating tension with shadow and sound and imagination, or (2) the modern overt way with plenty of gore and monsters, but without any subtlety. The former way works better, as proved here. The actors were then unknown but effective enough.This may be the top psychological / horror film of the 1940s; justifiably it made Roger Ebert's Top 300 international movie list. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sublime masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This of course is the classic Val Lewton horror film made at RKO and released in 1944 with Simone Simon, Kent Smith and Jane Randolph. Since being released on disc with the full treatment, I can't imagine that I could possibly add any more to the discussion of this unique and beautiful film but I suppose I should make the attempt.It transpires that Irina (Simone Simon), a refugee living in New York, is attempting to lead a normal life in her new country. However, she is afraid of sexual intimacy because she is convinced that because of some ancient European curse, she will be transformed into a panther. On the face of it, this does not seem like a convincing scenario, but under the tutelage of Val Lewton, the film convincingly portrays Irina's emotional turmoil in a number of graphic set pieces. One of these includes her stalking a rival for her husband's affections and almost ambushing her in in a deserted swimming pool. Another setup has Irina being pursued by a na?ve psychiatrist who imagines he can seduce her with little effort but is devoured by Irina instead when she is transformed into a panther by his advances.Irina's immigrant otherness serves as a critique for the tunnel vision of the white, middle class Americans she is mysteriously expected to co-mingle with. America was at that time involved in a European war, but what do Americans know of Europe? Merely a bunch of superstitious nonsense which Irina is glad to provide them with. Medieval European superstitions are set up against American 'common sense', 'progress' and rational middle class values, but for a horror film such as this to work, it's the superstitions that win out in the end. Lewton's films and 'Cat People' in particular are the penultimate result of European influence on American film in which everything from conventional narrative to the concept of 'common sense' is subverted in order to contain a definition of art which does not limit itself to mere realism.The story of 'Cat People' unfolds like a fairy story that cannot be contained by the concept of childhood. Lewton's legacy is that he helped to formulate the genre of the horror movie to contain real aspects of the imagination that could only be found within the European tradition of told tales, imaginary monsters, and neurotic fears of the unknown.I love this film, and believe that it is a true American masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ground-breaking exercise in psychological horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cat People was the first film produced by Val Lewton at RKO's B picture unit. Given a budget of 150,000 dollars per movie, a pre-audience tested title and a remit to out-horror the Universal Monsters Lewton, a man of taste and culture, imprinted his very psyche on the 9 horrors he produced. Cat People was a monster hit, and stylistically very much ahead of its time.The story opens with naval draughtsman Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) flirting with beautiful Serbian dress-designer Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon). Ollie, an amiable but not always bright New Yorker, fails to see that Irena has serious issues over her superstitious beliefs that the village she grew up in was dominated by Satanic cultists, who gained from the Devil the power to change into panthers. He goes ahead and marries her, but grows frustrated when Irena cannot consummate the marriage. She is convinced that sexual arousal will bring on the transformation and lead to a murderous spree.Ollie finds solace in co-worker Alice (Jane Randolph) who has always loved him anyway but never been able to admit it. Director Jacques Tourneur handles these scenes with great delicacy and emotional power, and a technique a world away from the Universal show-em-the-monsters approach. Lewton believed that suggestion was more frightening than explicit horror, and carefully built up his horror sequences.There are two classic terror scenes here - Alice, stalked by Irena in Central Park as she possibly transforms, and later in a swimming pool, again with Alice and Irena, where masterful use of light,shadow and glimmering water create a truly terrifying sequence.There's a startling cameo from Elizabeth Russell ("Moia Sestra?") and the movie balances itself perfectly between a rational explanation and a supernatural one. Is it all, as Oliver initially believes, in Irena's mind? Well, for my money the movie answers this question pretty substantially. We even get some shots (ordered by the studio over Lewton's objection) of the panther stalking the couple in the naval office.Cat People for me is arguably the best horror film of the 40s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most subtle and accomplished horror film of its era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one thinks of horror films from the thirties and forties one's first thought is normally either of Bela Lugosi as Dracula or Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster, but "Cat People" is an example of a very different style of horror film from this period, set not in nineteenth-century Europe but in a modern American city. Engineer Oliver Reed (a name later to be made famous by a real-life actor) meets and falls in love with a Serbian-born fashion designer named Irena Dubrovna. The two are eventually married. Irena, however, hides a dark secret. She was born in a village whose inhabitants once practised witchcraft and devil worship; although most of this community were wiped out by the King of Serbia, "the wisest and the most wicked" of them escaped into the mountains, and it is from these that Irena is descended. Because of this heritage, she believes that she will transform into a black panther if she experiences any strong emotion, including jealousy or sexual passion, and therefore refuses to sleep with her husband. Fearing that Irena is mentally ill, Oliver persuades her to consult a psychiatrist. Irena's apparent mental problems lead to an estrangement between husband and wife, and Oliver finds himself becoming attracted to his work colleague Alice. Another attraction develops between Irena and her psychiatrist, Louis Judd. Films about psychiatry were popular in the forties; examples include Hitchcock's "Spellbound" and John Brahm's "The Locket". "Cat People", however, is not really a film of this sort. Irena's beliefs are not the product of an insane delusion; she really can turn into a black panther under the influence of strong emotions. This presented the scriptwriters and director Jacques Tourneur with a problem as such a transformation would have been very difficult to show convincingly given the limited range of special effects available in the early forties. Tourneur, however, overcame that problem brilliantly. His solution was not to show Irena transforming into a panther; indeed, we never directly see her in her animal form at all. The only black panther we actually see is a captive specimen in the local zoo (which plays an important role in the plot). In contrast to most modern horror films, which tend to rely on special effects and gore by the bucketload, the "horror" in "Cat People" is the result of atmosphere and suggestion. Much of the action takes place at night or in darkness, and small details- a shadow, a set of pawprints, the sound of an arriving bus (which might also be the hiss of a panther)- are used to build up a sense of menace overhanging the characters, especially Alice of whom Irena is intensely jealous. The suggestion is that Irena, in her cat form, is stalking Alice. Both Irena and Alice are attractive young women, and the way in which they are treated is strangely ambivalent. From one viewpoint, our sympathies are with the fully-human Alice, menaced by a savage creature only half human. From another, our sympathies lie with Irena, the wronged wife whose marriage is under threat from another woman. If Irena is a predator in the literal sense of the word, Alice is one in the metaphorical sense. The film was followed by a sequel, "The Curse of the Cat People" in 1944, which again starred Simone Simon as Irena, Kent Smith as Oliver and Jane Randolph as Alice. It is a good film in its own right, but it is very different in tone to the original, having a serenity which suggests that the evil of the original "Cat People" has now been exorcised. "Cat People" was remade by Paul Schrader in 1982, forty years after the original. It keeps (with some alterations) the characters of Irena, Oliver and Alice, dispenses with Dr Judd and introduces a new character, Irena's brother Paul. Compared to the original it is much more blunt, direct and sexually explicit. It has its good points, particularly the performance of that most feline of actresses, Nastassja Kinski, but lacks the delicacy and suggestive power of Tourneur's film, which is perhaps the most subtle and accomplished horror film of its era. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, Eerie and Utterly Fascinating Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cat People" is, without doubt, one of the most influential and fascinating classics the great genre of Horror has ever brought forth. This film is the brilliant collaboration of two of cinema's most ingenious minds - the first film produced by legendary producer Val Lewton, "Cat People" is doubtlessly also the greatest work of director Jacques Tourneur. The film, which tells a uniquely fascinating tale, is probably the best example of indicated terror. While we never actually see a drop of blood shed, Tourneur's brilliant sense for atmosphere and cinematographic style creates unspeakable eeriness by the mere use of shadows, light and darkness.The film tells the story of the incredibly beautiful young Irena (Simone Simon). The young Serbian woman has come to America to flee the haunting legends of her hometown. When she meets a man and gets married, she remains frigid into the marriage, terrified that the loss of her virginity will turn her into something evil... Without giving too much of the story away, I can say that "Cat People" tells one of the most haunting and fascinating stories in classic Horror cinema. After the classic period of the Universal Monster films, this masterpiece heralds the time of Val Lewton's magnificent Horror films. Simone Simon is one of the most beautiful actresses of all time and she is absolutely stunning in her role here - her character of the haunted young Irena is very lovable. She seems very innocent and young, it is hard to believe she was already 32 when this film was made. The rest of the cast are also great, Kent Smith, Tom Corway and Jane Randolph all deliver very good performances. It is still Simone Simon who has all the attention. "Cat People" is a wonderfully cinematic experience which is beautiful and haunting alike. The film is a masterpiece both of storytelling and of atmosphere. The cinematography alone is brilliant and incredibly influential, and the film simply fascinates in all aspects. Personally, I've seen it many times by now, and it seems to get better with each viewing. This isn't only a must-see for all my fellow Horror buffs, it must be seen by everybody interested in cinema. A truly essential classic. 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am never sure of horror from this era. Often I am left cold and unsatisfied. But this movie is OK. I liked it better than I thought. It starts pretty slow and I was quite bored with the corny romance and all but then in the second half, it gets better. I just never saw what he saw in her and their relationship always seemed awkward.Honestly I couldn't relate much to the girl. I kept feeling sorry for the guy who is stuck in this unique situation. What if he had just fallen in love first with that fun loving Alice character? She is so funny and outgoing in contrast to this cold woman. I thought Irena often behaved coldly to her husband and he was as nice as possible to her. Finally after some time with this behaviour, he finally got tired of it. In any case, he could never have a normal life with her. If they did get a divorce, maybe she can mate with that panther and have a happy life. If it was in the current day, he wouldn't have to marry her after just a tea in her apartment. In the olden days, things were different I guess. And what's up with that psychiatrist guy? Ugh. I think some of that stuff isn't exactly legal.In the second half, there are a few creepy scenes done in traditional Jacques tourneur style. The swimming pool scene especially and the scene in the office are effective. The black and white is effective when it comes to these scenes. Simone simon is good as the creepy Irena. Obviously the less is more approach is used often here because of censorship restrictions. But they work as far as this movie is concerned.The movie feels longer than its runtime. I liked it but there are some problems.6/10</fullReview>

Irena believes she is cursed to turn into a leopard when she becomes highly emotional. The two marry but don't consummate their relationship due to Irena's fears. As Oliver turns to an attractive co-worker (Jane Randolph) for consolation, a series of strange occurrences leaves them wondering if Irena's curse is real or if she is just mentally ill.Cat People is a classic. The first of producer Val Lewton's now-legendary psychological horror films at RKO. Filmed on a modest budget, it completely alters the approach to the horror film. Up until that point, with few exceptions, horror films were mostly "in your face" endeavors. Lewton's approach, here under the master direction of Jacques Tourneur, is one of misdirection, ambiguity, and imagination. The power of suggestion was never stronger in horror films than in Lewton's masterpieces.The actors were all great. Simone is perfectly cast. I can't imagine another actress from the period being able to capture both the relative innocence of Irena and the alluring sex appeal. Smith is very good in what could easily be a mishandled role for many other actors. Randolph is solid as well. Tom Conway, an actor I've always enjoyed, is excellent as the sophisticated psychiatrist who may have less-than-honorable intentions toward his patient. Terrific direction from Tourneur and a first-rate script by DeWitt Bodeen. It's an effective, subtle film full of shadows and a haunted, eerie atmosphere. Followed by a 1944 sequel, The Curse of the Cat People, and an inferior remake in 1982.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a chance meeting at a zoo "Irena Dubrovna" (Simone Simon) meets and falls in love with "Oliver Reed" (Kent Smith). They marry a short time later. Not long afterward Irena tells Oliver the story of her village in Serbia where in ancient times the people worshiped Satan and because of their sins were transformed into "cat people" who turn into large, savage cats when angered or aroused. Naturally, Oliver doesn't believe her, but since she is so convinced about it he sends her to see a psychiatrist. Not only do the visits not accomplish much but she also becomes jealous of her husband's coworker named "Alice Moore" (Jane Randolph) which only exasperates the situation even more. In any case, rather than disclose what happens next I will just add that this was a fine horror film for its day. Obviously the special effects weren't anywhere near the level of what one might find today but the director (Jacques Tourneur) managed to use lighting and sound to great effect just the same. In addition to that I really enjoyed Simone Simon's performance and I especially liked her charming accent. In short, this is a reasonably good horror film that is worth a look for those who enjoy this particular type of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The theme of the woman as a hunter goes way back to before the common era. And here we have the woman tangled up with the image of the ever mystical cat. The story is truly ancient, picked up and dropped down into 1942 America. Love, crisis, jealousy, betrayal, weakness of character, tragedy.This film is set substantially in the dark and in the shadows. But you know there is something lurking in those shadows, something evil and dangerous. Something motivated perhaps by human emotions, but also perhaps powered by an extra-human force? The characters have flaws which set things in motion. Less than noble motivations, less than noble actions, and less than noble outcomes. It is like a Greek tragedy. Betrayal is a strong theme here, a bit like Medea. Strong and frightening stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simone Simon is lovely as intriguing Serbian woman Irena who has immigrated to New York to a fashion artists, she meets the average Joe in NY and marries.She is oddly controlled by a type of curse for which her husband wants her to seek psychoanalysis ( a burgeoning profession at the time). Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur team up to create an eerie foreboding world of shadows, a black panther Irena visits at the zoo, that likes to eat birds. Irena brings him the pet canary she somehow feels compelled to kill while in its cage.It is ethereal in the way it is filmed, dark urges and the sense of dread. Simone Simon was good for this part, she is mysterious but not shrill and histrionic. Just dark enough to be sensual without seeming evil.If you liked this film you may also like the sequel, "Curse of the Cat People" and also in a similar vein, directed by Edmund Goulding "Nightmare Alley" starring Tyrone Power. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric psychological horror from Lewton &amp; co.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Producer Val Lewton's horror films of the early to mid-1940's are today revered for their brooding, sophisticated approach to horror. Of these, the first film, "Cat People", is usually cited as the best of the lot.The story concerns a young Serbian woman who falls in love with and marries an American man. However, she avoids physical intimacy since she believes it will transform her into a vicious cat person. Her husband seeks to dissuade her from this childish fancy but soon there are signs that it may not be fancy after all. Screenwriter DeWitt Bodeen wrings considerable suspense out of this set-up, typically relying on a 'less is more' approach for maximum effect.Despite being a low budget feature the film actually has some decent acting. Most notably, Simone Simon contributes a performance that effortlessly alternates between vulnerability and malevolence. Kent Smith capably handles the male lead while the fetching Jane Randolph makes a welcome addition to the mix. Tom Conway lends admirable support in a smaller role.On the technical side, Jacques Tourneur's direction is expertly handled, as showcased by a pair of highly suspenseful stalking scenes. The film's atmosphere is also greatly enhanced by Nicholas Musuraca's moody cinematography and Roy Webb's tense score.The few other Lewton films that I've seen don't quite measure up to this one but they were all interesting in their own way, not to mention a cut above the usual horror fare. I'd recommend checking out this one first then moving on to some of the others (such as "I Walked With a Zombie" &amp; "The Body Snatcher") if you like what you see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's just that cats don't seem to like me".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indeed, this is a stylish and classy, and dare I say, sexy thriller from producer Val Lewton, who's collaboration with director Jacques Tourneur created one of the great psychological horror classics of all time. Simone Simon was the perfect choice to portray Serbian immigrant Irena, feline in both temperament and appearance. Her neurosis, rooted in jealousy and anger, and even more so in her own repressed passions, induced in her a fear of transforming into a great cat should she ever give in to her true emotions. The extensive use of shadow play and sound effects create an intensely stylish atmosphere, a precursor to the noir films that would soon make their mark in American cinema.Tourneur uses all sorts of clever tricks to establish Irena's feral nature - the cacophony of the pet shop when she encounters the birds, and the shadowy panther image before we ever make the connection. The one that really blew me away though was when Irena threw her dead canary into the panther's cage. Where did that inspiration come from? That was uniquely original, and even more horrifying than Irena clawing the sofa, which you entirely expected as she descended further into psychosis.With it's mere seventy three minute run time, one can discern an interesting influence on the work of future Twilight Zone writer and producer Rod Serling. There were a couple episodes of the show that borrowed the themes used here, one of them being the third season's 'The Jungle'. However the more fitting parallel to "Cat People" is a fourth season show titled 'Jess-Belle', in which the main character also appears to be under the spell of an evil curse transforming her into a large jungle cat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dangerous sexuality and deep shadows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Tourneur's low budget horror film Cat People suggested a new way the genre could go. Limited by a very low budget the film had to rely on film-making ingenuity to generate its thrills. What this film will always be most famous for is it's scenes of implied horror. Danger lurks in the shadows. Cat People was probably the birth of the unseen terror movie. The story is about a man who meets a Serbian woman by the panther enclosure at the zoo. He starts a relationship with her and it turns out that she has sexual repressions that are born of an ancient curse that she carries in which she turns into a giant cat when sexually aroused or jealous. The idea linking sexual desire to predatory violence is a good one. Seeing as it's a 40's film these concepts are left mostly implied but its clear what the source of the cat monster is. It gives the film a more sophisticated feel than the more traditional purely supernatural reasoning used in most other horror vehicles. I think this is one of the reasons Cat People still resonates today. The look of the picture too is somewhat stylish, with its Film Noir influenced use of shadows and light. This aspect really comes into the fore in the two classic stalk scenes ? the night street and the swimming pool. In both cases, we never see the prowling cat but we feel its presence. These sequences were so well shot and edited that they have become somewhat iconic and are what the film is best remembered for. For me there was one other standout moment in the film and that was the scene in the restaurant where our leading lady is confronted by a mysterious feline woman, who clearly is one of her kind. She is never seen again and her short moment in the film lends the narrative yet another beautiful mysterious touch.I suppose you could consider Cat People as a film that brought an artistic touch back to the genre at a time when other horror films were turning to parody. It will not appeal to everyone it is only fair to say, as it's subtlety of approach is not everyone's cup of tea. However, if you like mysterious and atmospheric films and don't mind the terror being implied rather than in your face, then this is a film you might very much appreciate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie if met on its own terms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love horror movies--old and new, black &amp; white and color, silents and talkies--and I have made it a point to see all the major films in the genre.Almost ten years ago, I found a copy of "Cat People", and I'm sorry to say that I was bored. I expected to see some cool transformations like Lon Chaney in "The Wolf Man" (or at least something hokey like "Captive Wild Woman"). There were clearly some good scenes in the film, but it felt like it never really gave a good pay off.Well, after reading a few reviews from people who admired the film and almost a decade of maturing in my film tastes, I decided to give it another chance and watch it with a different perspective. Upon a second viewing, I must say that I was really impressed with this film, and I think it ranks right up there with many of the other classics.Don't watch this movie with a 21st century mindset, expecting to see all sorts of crazy cat transformation special effects. If you do, you will certainly be disappointed. What makes this film so excellent is how well it establishes a mood. This film is not about shock and horror, but about a slow and steady feeling of dread and fear.This movie taps into basic fear: Irena keeps everything to herself, holding back her affections and her fears (that she is a cat person). She holds all of these things back from everyone, even the person closest to her, her husband. Most of us have experienced something along these lines--we are afraid to reveal too much about ourselves, because we fear that there is something wrong with us, and we don't want to be exposed for who we are. We would rather be isolated than honest. Most of us eventually realize that it's better to be open and forthright, but before we are ready to take that step, there is that nagging question: What if our fears were right? What if we dare to live life, express our emotions, feel deeply, reveal who we are--and what if this exposes something terrible about ourselves? At different points in the movies, the three main characters struggle with this basic fear in various ways. Perhaps the movies is saying that, ultimately, we have to face our fears and come to terms with who we are, even if it kills us.If you want to watch a special effects stravaganza, this is not the film for you. But if you want a creepy, thoughtful film--and if you're willing to meet it on its own terms--this movie will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best B-horror film of all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cat People" is widely regarded as one of the most influential horror films of all-time, which is probably true, but I want to spend my space here talking about the film itself and not its legacy. I do think it's worthwhile however to look at the differences between this film and the Universal, Columbia and MGM horror product that preceded it. This film was, as far as I know, RKO's first serious attempt at horror. Val Lewton was a protégé of David Selznick and legend has it that he was only slightly deterred when his first solo production was assigned to him with nothing but the ridiculous title "Cat People" ? he decided that even if the film might appear to be beneath him he would go ahead and produce the film with class and integrity. He would use the low-budget limitations of the production to enhance its look through use of shadow and by emphasizing the fear of the unknown and unseen over the exploitation value of makeup and monster effects. And by so doing he launched a revolution in B-movie-making that had an impact on the development not only of the horror film but of the crime film as well. Quite simply, B movies were never the same after Val Lewton, and could never be held to such a low standard as they once had been, although few low-budget films would ever come close to the standard Lewton, Tourneur, Robson and Wise had set.Well now, I'm off-track ? I promised to talk about this movie in and of itself, which is sometimes hard to do. Even some of the film's scenes directly remind us of its impact; the term "bus" in horror fandom and criticism is derived from one of this film's scariest moments.Simone Simon's performance is creepy and very haunting; she seems such a fragile thing, the concept of the beast inside her is truly disturbing. Her fear of becoming a monster is interpreted by her psychologist (Tom Conway) as a neurotic fear of sexual intimacy; interestingly he has his own ulterior motives and sexual designs on Irena (Simone). It's intriguing that a horror film so loaded with psychological undertones would so explicitly condemn its psychiatrist character. The untrustworthy psychiatrist is a standard character from 1940s films but it's particularly striking here in a film that directly concerns our irrational fears. The film seems to be saying that even modern science can only pretend to understand the deeper mysteries of life.One interesting aspect of the film in terms of its narrative is the way that it plays with our sympathies by setting up Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) as an earnest suitor and making us believe his sincerity when he pledges unending patience for Irena to solve her problems but gradually turns away from her affections and eventually reveals that he's in love with his co-worker Alice (Jane Randolph). The contrast between Rena and Alice is perfectly in line with the contrast between the exotic Simone and the cosmopolitan and modern Alice. In another film this story could have easily sided with the more down-to-earth and "normal" Alice, even though the fact that she works in the same office with all these men is a clue in the 1940s context that she is not a traditional woman and can not be trusted. There are many melodramatic stories from the 1920s and 30s, quite a few of them starring Joan Crawford, Barbara Stanwyck, and Mary Astor) which posit a good working woman whose domestic position has been usurped by some seductive exotic woman. In this film however we tend to sympathize with the more exotic character even though she isn't "normal" because we feel that Alice has used her intimacy and her position in the workplace to steal Irena's man. There is, therefore, a certain amount of transgression in our vicarious desire to actually see Alice eaten by the stalking cat.It's a well-written film but it's really Tourneur's brilliant direction that puts this one over the top. The pacing of the film is excellent and we never stop to think about the fact that we really only see 2 or 3 different interiors. The stalking scene with the bus is justifiably famous for its innovative technique and its ability to get the audience to jump out of their seats, but for pure visual pleasure and grotesque appeal I find the sequence in the swimming pool to be the most striking one in the film. Compared to 1930s horror films, this one made a point to stage its terrifying scenes in the public poolhouse, the bus-stop, and the work-place as opposed to some remote Gothic castle. The people that these things are happening to are likewise grounded in realities that would have been easily identifiable to the early 40s audience ? the career-minded vamp who pretends to be "one of the guys", the delicate foreigner trying to learn American ways, the man who is attracted to her aura but doesn't actually love her enough or isn't strong enough to help her get through her problem, and the doctor who aggravates the problems that he pretends to solve. None of these, except perhaps the doctor, are characters who would have been likely to pop up in a 1930s Universal horror film but they all could have been found in non-horror melodramas of the period. So this film is taking horror and putting it into the real "modern" world, and it ridicules the fact that the doctor and the husband feel they are themselves too "modern" to believe in such things as Cat People. The film effectively makes us question exactly who in this scenario is the na?ve one.An excellent film from start to finish and one that I believe will continue to stand the test of time and continue to represent an all-time high in the history of low budget film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have fond memories of "Cat People" - I saw it as a child and my mother told me that Simone Simon had disappeared after the war, which fascinated me. Uh, she didn't, but I guess my mother thought she did. Actually Simon lived to be 95 and had quite the life, giving gold keys to her bedroom to men she considered worthy.The movie was a huge hit and set the stage for horror films to come, and it was producer Val Lewton's first and directed by Jacques Tourneur. The story concerns a beautiful Serbian woman, Irena (Simon) who marries a man, Oliver (Kent Smith), who is incredibly drawn to her. A kitten in the beginning of the film seems terrified of Irena. Oliver exchanges it for a bird which dies of fright when Irena tries to hold it. She often visits a panther at the zoo and, after the death of the bird, she throws its dead carcass to it. Irena has told Oliver the story of her village, where there were "cat people" who were expelled from the city many years earlier. She can't kiss a man because if she does, she will turn into a monstrous cat and try to kill him. This non-consummation of the marriage was something I did not pick up in childhood. Probably my mother didn't either. During the wedding dinner, a fellow Serbian with cat-like eyes calls her "sister" in Serbian (words dubbed by Simon herself) and Irena makes the sign of the cross. Eventually Irena sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Judd (Tom Conway) and like everyone else, he feels these cat stories are nonsense. When Irena senses a rivalry with Oliver's coworker Alice, who is in love with him, Alice gets the distinct impression she's being stalked."Cat People" makes for fascinating viewing and, unlike much of what is on the screen today, you don't see Irena turn into a cat - you only see shadows and hear growls. The film is very well cast - Smith is fine as an ordinary, insensitive guy who can't even figure out if he's in love with the woman he married - one minute he's talking love and the next, he's talking about sending her to an insane asylum. Tom Conway makes a good psychiatrist who is a lecher; Jane Randolph is effective as the woman who loves Oliver and then fears for her life. Simon is perfect - beautiful, mysterious, exotic and sympathetic. And no one was a "sex kitten" like she was, as her performance in her second American film, "Ladies in Love" proves.Many of the excellent scenes in "Cat People" have been imitated, even by Alfred Hitchcock and Dario Argento, but they've never been equaled. Disturbing, frightening, and sad, "Cat People" is one terrific film and an extremely influential one. The cast will return for "Curse of the Cat People" but with a different director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) falls in love with mysterious foreigner Irena (Simone Simon). He marries her despite the fact that she won't kiss him or make love to him. She believes if she does she will turn into a panther and kill him. She sees a psychiatrist (Tom Conway) who tries to cure her. Frustration drives Oliver into the arms of office coworker Alice (Jane Randolph). Irena finds out and gets angry....The plot isn't too believable (marrying a woman who won't even kiss you???) but the films' moments of shock and horror are still as strong today as they were in 1942. Producer Val Lewton had almost no money to work with (look at the cast) so he had to depend on shadow, darkness, sounds and atmosphere to create horror. It works beautifully. Two scenes with Alice work particularly well--when she's walking to a bus stop on a deserted street and the infamous scene in the pool. With the exception of one or two shots (when Smith and Randolph are trapped in an office) we never see Irena as the panther. The studio insisted these shots be added.Simon is perfectly cast as Irena; Smith is pretty wooden as her husband; Randolph is just great as Alice and Conway is admirably slimy as the psychiatrist.Just great--a true classic. A must-see. Avoid--at all costs--the lousy 1982 remake.</fullReview>

The journey starts right at the beginning when the hypnotic music of the organ grinder pulls you into the underworld. Your subconscious recognizes the landscape and leads you through the shadows to a place you instinctively know is home but it is children that most easily go with the flow of the deeper story and don't get hung up on surface elements like for instance analyzing the annoying character of Alice and actually hoping maybe she gets mauled by a black panther.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cat People (1942)A chilling, fun, beautifully filmed B-movie. Directed by the great Jacques Tourneur and produced by the legendary Val Lewton for RKO, this is a great film for its small budget, but it shouldn't be mistaken for a full blown studio film of the same era. That is, this is no "Citizen Kane" (which was made by RKO the previous year, and supposedly was one reason for this low budget stab for success, to make up for Kane's losses.)For one thing, the legend behind the catty goings on is a bit wobbly, a watery version of a Dracula kind of legend, with people turning into evil cats in some rural Serbian land. In this legend, that afflicted must kill the people they kiss (another echo of sucking on people's necks). But this is made dramatic and exciting because the lead woman, the French Simone Simon, speaking with an awkward (Serbian?) accent, marries our lead man, and can't kiss him, or else you know what. This is great tension, even though the leading man, a nice cheerful type (he admits it--he even says, as he gets sad, that he's never been sad before in his life). And so the mystery gradually becomes clear, and a problem. One man does kiss this woman (by now another man's wife, to boot), and he gets what he didn't believe was possible. I mean, a legend is just a legend, right?Expect a lot from "Cat People," but within tight limits. For the kind of fun, genre-horror-B-movie-romance it is, it's really terrific. And then follow it up with "Curse of the Cat People" also starring Simon as the lead--uh--cat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is what you don't see that scares you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1942 film "Cat People" isn't a bloody schlock/shock fest like the 1982 remake. Instead, it's a stylish thriller that relies for effect on the tension between rationality and fantasy, the feeling that the shadow we see is probably nothing, or might be the monster we've almost convinced ourselves does not live under the bed. The film is also a parable of America's awakening from the comforting dream of isolationism to the reallity of old world barbarism in the early '40s. Producer Val Lewton was a childhood Russian émigré, and Director Jacques Tourneur was a Frenchman, son of the great visual stylist Maurice Tourneur who at the time his son was working on "Cat People" in America directed his own horror film, "The Devil's Hand," in Nazi occupied France.As a writer whose literary sensibilities were shaped by an old world background, Lewton was familiar with European folklore and aware of its influence on early romantic and modern occult fiction. And "Cat People" does contain thematic similarities to a 1908 Algernon Blackwood novella "Ancient Sorceries," in which a hapless English tourist visiting a medieval French villa is drawn irresistibly to a beautiful young woman who, with the rest of the villagers, transforms into a cat to attend a black Sabbath in the forest.In the first scene of "Cat People" American Oliver Reed, a draftsman whose work requires drawing precise geometrical designs, puts the moves on Serbian immigrant Irena Dubrovna, who sketches a panther in a New York zoo. Her image of the panther pierced by a sword demonstrates her preference for the emotional and dramatic possibilities of art. Their differences literally draw the lines that divide the aesthetics of American rationalism from those of European romanticism.In Irena's apartment Oliver is introduced to another image of a cat impaled on the sword of a statue of King John of Serbia, destroyer of the witches in Irena's village, the cat people who she says "bowed down to Satan and said their masses to him." She tells Oliver that "the wisest and most wicked" of the cat people escaped King John's vengeance. And Oliver discovers after their marriage that Irena is obsessed with a belief that she is their descendant, and that her sexual passion, if aroused, will cause her to kill Oliver, who is nevertheless drawn to her animal warmth and her scent. Irena makes it clear they cannot be physically intimate until she rids herself of the curse.Irena's reluctance to consummate their marriage some critics have argued points to a preference for women, which?given American morality at the time?identifies her as part of an unconventional and European-influenced lifestyle. Oliver's average American wholesomeness, therefore, is a buffer insulating Irena from her homo-erotic passions. We also learn that Irena's father met a mysterious death in the forest, suggesting perhaps that cat women kill males after mating with them. Lewton's aunt was the actress Nazimova, who had many affairs with women, and whose marriages to men concealed her sexual orientation. Since we know Lewton closely supervised his productions as story editor, it is quite possible he inserted those issues of sexual identity with which he was familiar. And to his credit Irena emerges as a sympathetic character, exuding just enough moral ambiguity to make us distrust her outward friendliness.Oliver's co-worker, Alice Moore suppresses her own love for Oliver to befriend Irena. But even before she lets Oliver know her true feelings, we can see Alice is a better match for him. They both smoke cigarettes, they speak the same American vernacular. But their continued friendship, even after Oliver's marriage, arouses Irena's territoriality, and she stalks Alice?we are invited to believe in the form of a giant cat.Tourneur evokes our dread of the supernatural in the scenes that follow not only with creative use of shadow, but with sound?footsteps on a deserted sidewalk, the low growl of what may (or not) be an angry animal, and Alice's echoing screams as a growling shadow glides through the quivering reflections of an indoor swimming pool. The stalking animal eventually corners Alice and Oliver at their office, and a desperate Oliver holds the beast at bay with a T-square. Oliver's resort to a symbol of rationalism seems to frustrate the beast, but we see that the supernatural beast's reaction is actually to the T-square's shadow, which appears to be a cross.The film is uncompromising in its vision of evil as something that cannot be defined or controlled. And the characters' powerlessness against evil haunts us even after the film is over and Irena is dead, impaled on the phallic sword-cane of psychiatrist Louis Judd, who attempts to seduce Irena and coincidentally to prove her belief in the cat people is a delusion, but who finds out differently at the cost of his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sex in the Forties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jacques Tourneur (under the production services of Val Lewton*) does an outstanding job creating a psychological movie which may be considered a horror classic, but which I see as an introspective examination of a male-dominated society in conflict about the sexuality of women.In the film, Oliver Reed (played by Kent Smith) meets Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon) and falls in love with her. Irena is a Serbian with serious issues, it turns out. If her family superstitions are true, she is under a spell which will turn her into a panther if she is sexually aroused or made jealous, and she'll kill her would-be lover.There are no real special effects in this movie, and it's much more menacing with the terror left to us to fill in. In fact, we can assure ourselves that it's all in Irena's mind. Or maybe that Irena is a blood-thirsty killer. Or maybe there really is a panther loose from the zoo. We can assure ourselves, but we can't be sure. Maybe Irena _is_ a real panther when aroused.Which leads us to the other level, the issue of sexuality in 1942. Good girls might let you kiss them briefly goodnight, but that was it until you got married. The problem is that girls were taught to be chaste, and then marriage was supposed to change that - and not overnight, either. If you've been taught all your life that sex is wrong, how do you make the change to a panther in bead just because you said, "I do" and got that ring on your finger? In the movie, it's clear that Oliver and Irena never consummate their marriage because of Irena's irrational fears. Irena is jealous of Oliver's platonic friendship with coworker Alice (Jane Randolph), and we see bushes moving as Alice walks along a sidewalk, and we hear the low growl of a panther as Alice swims in the basement pool of the local gym. Alice finds her bathrobe shredded, but we never see the cat. Just shadows and movement.Because we never see the creature that is stalking people and mutilating their clothing, we're left in the dark (figuratively and literally) about just what's going on. Irena's conversations with a psychiatrist further cloud our minds. The psychiatrist, played with oily George Sanders goodness by Tom Conway (George Sanders's brother), represents society's modern view of the soul and sin. Dr. Judd assures Irena her troubles are based on some childhood trauma (Irena's father was found dead before she was born, killed by a wild beast in a forest) and that he can cure her of her Old World superstition. Irena has told Dr. Judd that in her godforsaken village, those most wise were most wicked. We see this play out in modern New York at their last session.This movie is significantly different from the 1982 movie of the same name with Nastassja Kinski and Malcolm McDowell, an erotic masterpiece directed by Paul Schrader (which wins my award for the best use of a window ever). The 1942 script deals with the issue of the Code (bad girls must be punished) in a way which is transparent to the story. Writer DeWitt Bodeen lets Irena find the only peace available to the Cat People. The 1982 version by Allen Ormsby goes for the handkerchief instead of the jugular.*Val Lewton produced a number of B-level horror films for RKO Radio Pictures, and if you ever stumble across any of them, I'd suggest watching them for their depth - they're all cheap movies with competent unknown actors, but there is always more to them than the surface.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Head and Shoulders Above Horror Movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baudelaire might have conceived this minor masterpiece.'Hold back the talons of your paws. Let me gaze into your beautiful eyes.' A coming together of superior talent -- writer DeWitt Bodeen, photographer Nick Musaraca, composer James Webb, director Jacques Tourneur, and anonymous prop men and set dressers -- under the management of Val Lewton, an immigrant Russian. Lewton had been a novelist for a few years before being recruited by RKO to produce a handful of cheap horror movies that could compete with Universal's lucrative series of Frankenstein, Dracula, the Wolf Man, and so on.The studio kept throwing these ludicrous titles at Lewton through the early forties -- "Cat People," "The Curse of the Cat People," "The Leopard Man," "I Walked With a Zombie" -- and, since the budgets were so tiny, they paid very little attention to the goings on of Lewton's unit.The director managed to squeeze out a series of haunting little gems that displayed a character, an attention to period authenticity, and something else that is hard to define. This is the first and it's one of Lewton's best.Like all of his movies, this one is quiet, smooth, and logical, until it is punctuated by seconds-long moments of fright that Lewton came to call "buses." "Cat People" has the first "bus". A woman is walking alone at night through Central Park, moving along the sidewalk from one pool of light to the next. She hears footsteps behind her but sees no one. Terrified, she shrinks against a stone wall, the bushes above her rustle ominously -- and there is suddenly the hiss and shriek of a bus stopping next to her and opening its door. It will make your hair stand on end. Later, the same woman is in a darkened indoor swimming pool, paddling in the center, half naked and vulnerable, while a large animal seems to be pacing in the shadows around the side of the pool, coughing and growling. But neither swimmer nor viewer can be entirely sure of the threat because the sights and sounds are almost lost among the shivering darkness and the echoes. The scene merges into the unseen.But the movie is much more than its moments of fright. The Serbian Irena (Simone Simon) believes herself to be descended from a race of people who turn into panthers if they mate with humans. Kent Smith is the tender, puzzled, frustrated, and finally very frightened husband. Jane Randolph is the other woman, stalked by the jealous, felanthropous wife.The movie is full of felicities. Lewton always insisted on showing his characters at work so that we get a sense of their everyday lives. His melancholic shadows hide all sorts of menace. (We only see Irena as a cat once, and then only a murky glimpse.) Logic has no place in the narrative. There is not a drop of blood. The supporting parts are given to precisely the right people. Even the bit parts are memorable -- the whistling careless caretaker at the zoo, the African-American waitress with the Aunt Jemima babushka at Sally Lund's coffee house.Man, what a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ground Breaking Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Val Lewton (1904-1951) was brought to RKO when that studio decided to compete with Universal in the horror genre. As it happened, RKO was teetering on the verge of bankruptcy at the time--and Lewton was given the audience-tested title CAT PEOPLE and ordered to create an inexpensive movie to fit it. Without the budget to create "a monster movie," Lewton responded with a remarkably artful film that relied on suggestion and implication. The result was a tremendous critical and popular office success and the first of nine celebrated horror films Lewton would make for the studio between 1942 and 1946.Directed by Jacques Tourneur, the 1942 CAT PEOPLE offers the story of Slavic beauty Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon) whose marriage to the all-American Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) goes awry when she confesses to her new husband that a man's kiss may turn her into a ravening beast. The idea is absurd, and Oliver quickly sends Irena into therapy with psychiatrist Louis Judd (Tom Conway)--but Irena's psychosis defies treatment. Or is it psychosis? For when Irena becomes jealous of Oliver's co-worker Alice (Jane Randolph), the young woman suddenly finds herself being stalked through the night by a cat-like creature that is more sensed than seen.At the time, CAT PEOPLE was an extremely startling: films of the early 1940s did not often deal with psychiatry, still less present marriages tainted by sexual problems; horror films were expected to be direct in terms of imagery. Lewton's themes and poetical treatment and highly indirect approach were extremely disconcerting. Seen today, however, the film--like many other groundbreakers--suffers a bit from the later works that built on the original idea: while it remains fascinating, and while certain set-pieces retain their power, it no longer has the same "shock of the new." Still, this is not a film that Lewton fans or classic horror film fans in general can afford to miss. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually well made. Not much of a story. Characters not that interesting. Moody and atmospheric. Got its reputation for building suspense by not showing much. One viewing was enough. I don't disagree with the idea to use restraint, especially in the horror genre. But in this example, there wasn't much story or interesting action to justify a feature film. I did like watching the Serbian woman. I think I would recommend another movie over this one called Leptirica. It is also based on a Serbian legend and focuses on a young couple having trouble getting together, but has a much stronger payoff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understated . Is This A Good Or Bad Thing ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1942 film of CAT PEOPLE is as understated as its 1982 remake is overstated and neither of these things benefit either film , though to be honest at least with the remake you know what's happened , what is happening and where it's all heading , you really do need to concentrate on what's going on in the original to understand it I wasn't around in 1942 so I've no idea how the audience in those days took to it but I do hope they were very sophisticated in knowing the difference between love and lust . You see the plot centres around sexual jealousy and euphemisms . When Irena Dubrovna gets emotionally aroused she becomes dangerous to the person she is with . See what I mean about euphemisms ? When I say " emotionally aroused " I mean " sexually aroused " so her marriage to Oliver Reed ( An unfortunate character name but it sometimes happens in movies ) is through necessity a celibate one Typing the above paragraph I've just realised what a human and powerful story this is but unfortunately what you could and couldn't insinuate in movies back then is entirely different from today ( Has any present director any knowledge of the word insinuate ? ) which means the movie seems somewhat twee rather than subtle when viewed today and it's not helped at all when through the years it's been described as a horror film or a chiller when in fact it's more of a psychological drama with a subtext of sexual resentment/jealousy . But despite the flaws I look forward to seeing THE CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE when/if it's broadcast on television</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My girlfriend and I have been watching Val Lewton movies, and so far this is her favorite, beating out Curse of the Cat People, I Walked with a Zombie, and the very beatable Seventh Victim.For me, though, it's a bit too stiff and moves a bit too slow. It's an intriguing idea, and the use of shadows and sounds to create a sense of menace is ingenious, especially in the classic pool scene, but most of the movie is build up, and some indifferent acting makes the pre-thrill section of the movie rather unengaging. I would say it's worth watching, as what it does well it does very well, and there are some very clever moments, but I just can't love this the way my girlfriend does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There's evil in me"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the decades up to and including the 1930s, cinema developed considerably in terms of technique and technology. By the 1940s there wasn't a lot that hadn't been done or invented one way or another. However, what really developed extensively in the 40s was cinematic genre. It was this decade that saw perhaps the most sweeping changes to the Western, the musical, the thriller and of course the horror. The latter was thanks largely to an innovative B-unit producer at RKO studios called Val Lewton. Cat People is Lewton's extraordinary debut.Two things really characterise the series of horrors that Lewton made at RKO. First was to bring the genre to urban America. Most horrors up until then were based on the traditional, European monsters and were set in ruined castles, Gothic mansions and the like. Cat People on the other hand features a new breed of terrors that prey upon ordinary people in ordinary situations. Second is an ambiguity about whether or not the events are actually supernatural. Clever editing and shrouds of darkness ensure nothing is revealed for certain. And Cat People, with its intelligent screenplay by DeWitt Bodeen, is quite open about this ambiguity. The Tom Conway character states that he believes it is "all in the mind", and for much of the movie we are lead to agree with him. The overwhelming blackness of Nicholas Musuraca's cinematography This was also an early assignment for Jacques Tourneur, one of the most influential horror directors ever. Tourneur uses a lot of the more obtrusive horror technique of the last few decades ? foreground clutter, bizarre camera angles, layers of gloom ? but what makes him different is that he is able to use them without making them look obvious. Another director might for example have the camera in some weird position looking out from the corner of the room. But see where Tourneur's camera is in the shot where Simone Simon and Kent Smith are first back at the apartment together. The camera is lower than usual, but only at about waist height, putting it at the level of the table behind the actors and the bottom of the windows in the background. It's a rather disconcerting arrangement, but is not exaggerated enough to make the shot look artificial. This is very much in line with the Lewton mode of horror ? normal settings, normal shots, just tweaked ever so slightly for effect.There isn't much to be said about the acting in Cat People, at least nothing positive. These were B-movie players and by-and-large they tended to be sculpted from the same wood as the set dressings. Simone Simon and Tom Conway just about scrape average, and everyone else is simply bad. But this doesn't really matter much. The strength of a good horror lies more in its technical execution than in the proficiency of its cast. It should also be noted that, in the case of Cat People, it is far better to have sullen lumps of wood than the screaming, growling ham actors of 30s horror. And Cat People still manages to be a classic because it is simply impeccably done. It is a turning point in the genre, the direct or indirect influence of which can be seen in such later classics as The Exorcist, Jaws and The Evil Dead. That influence continues in the horror movies of today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top-Notch Horror Movie That Relies on the Power of Suggestion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cat People" qualifies as a subtle, suspenseful, 73-minute, black &amp; white, B-picture horror movie from RKO Pictures about a delectable young thing who cannot consummate her marriage because she fears that she will change into a deadly panther and turn her husband apart. Russian-born producer Val Lewton, who had once served as a story editor to producer David O. Selznick, advocated the power of suggestion to forge genuine horror in the hearts of an audience. Lewton shunned the standard approach by depicting outright horror as Universal Studios did with their "Dracula," "Wolfman," and Frankenstein" franchises. When Lewton produced "Cat People," the Production Code Administration censored movies and chief censor Joseph I. Breen worried about the implications of this sinister tale of terror. Indeed, you never see anybody get clawed and Irena (French actress Simone Simon) never actually turns into a cat. By comparison, Nastassia Kinski went through a transformation in the 1982 color remake. Nevertheless, it is the ambiguity and the power of suggestion that makes this movie a masterpiece of understatement. The themes of light/good and darkness/evil permeate this yarn as well as the women versus women permeate this impeccable nail-biter."Nick Carter, Master Detective" director Jacques Tourneur creates a spooky sense of atmosphere and freshman scenarist DeWitt Bodeen piles up ideas that brood just beneath the surface in this memorable little chiller. Simone Simon is perfectly cast as the tender young lady who draws fashion pictures and worries about her village in faraway Serbia. The stories that she tells Oliver about King John of Serbia and the witches foreshadow her own demise. Indeed, she has a statue of the regal witch-hunter in her apartment with a cat impaled on a spear. This hearkens back to the first scene when she is sketching a caged panther. She wads up a sketch and hurls it at the trash receptacle, but misses hitting it. A nice, clean-cut young draftsman, Oliver Reed (Kent Smith of "Hitler's Children"), happens to be standing near the trash receptacle when her crumpled sketch lands near it. He retrieves the picture and disposes of it. Oliver converses with Irena, and she tosses aside another sketch that she has drawn of a panther with a spear through its body. Anyway, Oliver accompanies Irena back to her brownstone apartment to drink a cup of tea. They begin a brief courtship that concludes with them getting married. This is where trouble enters paradise.During her wedding party, Irena is approached by a strange woman in a black cat suit who addresses our heroine in her native tongue as her sister. Later that evening, Irena cannot bring herself to have sex with her husband because of her intense fears about her past and what she might do. Patient, understanding Oliver recommends Irena visit a shrink, Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway of "The People Vs. Dr. Kildare"), so she can come to terms with her anxieties about marriage. Dr. Judd is literally a wolf in sheep's wool and Conway turns in a brilliant but unctuous performance and pays with his life for his perfidy. She never kisses Oliver and they never sleep together. Struggling to deal with her own fears, Irena turns on Oliver's office buddy, Alice Moore (Jane Randolph) who has a thing for him, but she only wants to help Irena and Oliver. Irena doesn't like what Alice is doing and one night some strange things happen. "Cat People" is a classic, far better than its graphic remake with its mind-blowing special effects. Nicholas Musuraca's black &amp; white photography is fantastic. No, "Cat People" won't give you nightmares, but it is an effective chiller with two incredible scenes, both between the opposing women. The first scene occurs at night while they are walking down a dimly-lighted city sidewalk and a bus appears. Later, Irena follows Alice home to the latter's apartment and stalks her in the swimming pool. The swimming pool is cloaked in eerie shadows so that we cannot see Irena or the panther into which she has transformed herself. Afterward, Alice finds her clothing clawed."Cat People" contains many inventive touches, such as Irena parading around in a fur coat, particularly when she visits the panther at the zoo. There is another brief scene when Tourneur frames Irena in a shot with tiger lilies. Bodeem's screenplay contains many wonderfully clever lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strange young girl (Simone Simon), fascinated by and attracted to panthers--and yet repelled by their power--finds there may be something dangerously feline in her own blood, which is unleashed when she is romantically inclined. Producer Val Lewton, who had recently moved from the comforts of working alongside David O. Selznick (for good pay but no credit) to churning out low-budget thrillers for treading-water studio RKO, had his entire reputation riding on the results of this picture. He surrounded himself with talent, beginning with director Jacques Tourneur--who does his producer-friend proud with some very stylish work. The script (possibly due to the restraints of the era) never gets into the psychological depth of the girl's unique situation (writer DeWitt Bodeen makes an unsatisfactory try at it), however the handsome presentation more than makes up for the minor deficiencies. Quasi-sequel in 1944, "The Curse of the Cat People", features Simon in a brief reprisal of her role here. Remade (with sex and gore) in 1982. *** from ****</fullReview>

They also did Curse of the Cat People two years later. This film renewed the careers of Lewton, Simon, and director Jacques Tourneur. With a $134,000 budget, they grossed $4 million in 1942. Lewton went on to make 10 horror classics that featured low budgets and were box office successes.Now, you won't see blood and guts, no slashers here; it is sheer terror through light and shadow and sound.Irena (Simon) feels that there is something evil in her. She won't even kiss her new husband (Kent Smith) for fear of stirring passions that could endanger him.An exciting film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur's Cat People can still be an effective thriller if you're not jaded by today's gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In reviewing mainly horror movies for the month that Halloween falls on, I decided to rewatch this, the first notable Val Lewton/Jacques Tourneur collaboration that started a series of Lewton films that explored the atmospheric, as opposed to the thriller, aspects of horror. Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon) is sketching a zoo black panther when a handsome man named Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) notices her and strikes a conversation with her. They fall in love and marry while Oliver's fellow architect, Alice Moore (Jane Randolph) has an unrequited crush on him. There's also a psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway), who has a major interest in Irena after hearing her backstory. I'll stop there and just mention how dramatically things gradually get revealed by initially suggesting, then showing through shadows and lighting, the results of many incidents that gets one intrigued throughout, not by basically putting intentional scares but by keeping a mesmerizing tone. Tourneur's vision of many cat images is especially fascinating. Probably wouldn't go today what with the many graphic horror movies out now, but if you prefer suggestion as opposed to gore, I highly recommend the original Cat People. P.S. With Ms. Randolph's death earlier this year, I'd just like to say Rest In Peace. Ditto to Ms. Simon, Smith, and Conway for their long ago passing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great suspenseful atmospheric horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon) is an artist who meets and marries ordinary Oliver Reed (Kent Smith). But she is frightened to have any physical or emotional contact with her husband because she is descended from a race of un-Christian cat people and believes she will turn into a black panther in the throes of passion and kill him. This, of course, leads to some marital problems and Irena is sent to see a psychiatrist, while one of Oliver's female co-workers starts to put the moves on Ollie.That is the basis behind this wonderful, haunting atmospheric horror movie where little is shown but a lot is implied. And that makes it even more frightening. There is a great attention to detail in this film that just enhances the effect-from the kitten like Simone Simon in the lead role to the very cat like appearance of Elizabeth Russell as she calls Irena "my sister", to Irena's cat like nails scratching the sofa. The little details are everywhere, but we never actually see any physical transformation.The film is simply beautiful as well. The presentation of the scenes and the camera work just make this a wonderful looking picture, and when you add great performances, the lovely Simone Simon and a great, but subtle script, this is really a great movie that is well worth watching over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not quite the masterpiece most critics would have it, "Cat People" nevertheless is a fine demonstration of how the fear of the unknown is perhaps the greatest fear of all. The shadowy night scenes are superbly spooky, and Simone Simon is fascinatingly feline, and a tragic figure as Irena the "catwoman". It's best known for being a supreme B horror movie, but I think "Cat People" works best as a Freudian-tinged romantic thriller. It's a pity that Kent Smith as the male lead who Simon and Jane Randolph compete for is an utter bore. Overall, it's a very good example of a B-movie that punches above it's weight. In terms of Torneur movies, I think I like "I Walked With A Zombie" just a tiny bit more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jealousy Arouses The Beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of French imports, director Jacques Tourneur and star Simone Simon, helped producer Val Lewton create one of the most haunting films you'll ever see in Cat People. After over 60 years it still holds up well today and I don't think today's computer graphic special effects could make it better.Cat People could only in fact have been made at a second rung studio like RKO. Val Lewton would never have known what to do in an outfit like Paramount or MGM. All that wonderful use of lighting and shadow to create that mood was because RKO was such a pinch penny operation.One day young Kent Smith is drawn to this mysterious accented young woman who presumably would be a refugee in 1942. Simone Simon is from old Serbia and she's from what could be described as Hootersville in the Balkans. Back where she hails from the people gave themselves over to devil worship while the Moslems occupied them in the middle ages. What she doesn't tell Kent is that some of the people like herself are still into it, though she'd like to break free.When he courted and married Simone in record time, Smith had to give the air to Jane Randolph who takes it in good grace considering the circumstances. But Simon is still jealous and jealousy arouses the beast. You know it struck me watching Cat People that a lot of this same plot about people turning into animals and back was the same premise Walt Disney used for The Shaggy Dog. I suppose it's all in what you change into as to whether you get laughs like Tommy Kirk or react with fright as you will with Simone Simon.Cat People is no shaggy dog story though, it will keep you glued to the seat and thinking about it long after it's over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a rather odd melodrama which may or may not have supernatural elements to it (I don't want to give spoilers here). The movie has a rather classic 'bookend' structure (the beginning and end of the movie being linked).Even though the movie could be viewed as an absurd melodrama, I think two scenes in it are amongst the greatest in all movies. Before I discuss those, I should just briefly mention what the film is about. It's been many years since I've seen this film, but from memory, it's about a European woman in the US who thinks she is cursed and will turn into a cat or something.Now, the REAL reasons to watch the film: for aspiring movie makers, the scene in the pool is one of the greatest of all time, and just utilises editing and shadows. An atmosphere fear and dread is created on what looks like a shoe-string budget.Another great scene is the scene involving a bus. I don't want to give too much away, but this scene is so great in how it utilises sound to create a certain impression.Lastly, one of the great strengths of this movie is how the movie maker manipulates what you think you are seeing. Rewatching this movie, you begin to question what you originally thought had happened in certain scenes in the movie. E.g. the scene in the office at night with Oliver Reed and Alice Moore. Apparently the studio demanded some other scenes be done differently. I think I know which ones they me, and they tend to make literal what should only be perception.This is one of those movies, I think, which EVERYBODY should see, just to be aware of the great Art which is infused in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric and interesting supernatural drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irena Dubrovna is a beautiful but shy Serbian woman living in New York as a sketch artist for the fashion industry. It is while seeking inspiration in the zoo one day that she meets Oliver Reed (no, really) and the pair quickly fall in love. Marriage soon follows although the relationship has its challenges due Irena's fear of intimacy. Based on a legend of the cat people this lack of physical closeness sees Irena withdraws more into herself despite Oliver's attempts to help her by sending her to see Dr Judd.Having seen a handful of atmospheric and effective films from producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur I eventually got the chance to watch Cat People (having already watched them out of order by see Curse of the Cat People a few years ago). Cat People is a strong and interesting chiller but it is also quite frustrating in regards what it nearly does. Essentially a low-budget film, the relationship drama aspect is build on and feeds from the supernatural part of the story. Those looking to be jumping with fear will be disappointed because the thrust of the film is the mental state of Irena in regards her relationship with Oliver. This may or may not be true as it does appear that something cat-like is stalking the city ? in particular Oliver's colleague Alice, whom Irena jealously regards.This produces two main parts to the film that both weave within one another and work pretty well. The psychology side of the film is interesting even if modern viewers may not be totally sold on the way that everything is so easily explained at some points. That said it is pretty satisfying as it goes along. The "horror" side of the story fits well with this and produces some very memorable scenes where the black and white cinematography and the atmospheric direction of Tourneur come together to up the tension. The cast are mixed but there is no doubting the turn from Simone Simon. She is excellent in the lead role, unsure of her own sanity and being innocent and deadly at the same time. Sadly she is not matched by Smith. He is solid but the role calls for a bit more fire and reality so that he can complete the relationship dynamics with Irena; he is "b-movie solid" but the material deserved more. Conway is enjoyable as Dr Judd ? calm and logical and suitable for the role. Likewise Randolph plays the potential "other woman" well, offering a shoulder to Oliver in the way such things would normally go.Overall then this is an atmospheric and interesting film. The makers will always be remembered for their ability to create tension in the shadows and, yes, Cat People is another example of that skill. However it also features an interesting plot that, unlike Curse of the Cat People, easily fills the running time and is well delivered with a strong turn from Simon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful exercise in hinting at terror, rather than showing it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cat People was made on a budget of $135,000 and was a big hit, establishing Lewton's unit at RKO as something special. Cat People tells the story of a young Serbian woman who believes that she will turn into a panther if aroused to passion or jealousy. Her husband believes its a fancy, her psychiatrist thinks she may be delusional, but another woman believes it may actually be true. What is remarkable about this film is its wonderful mix and balance of elements - an old country legend transplanted to modern America; romance mixed with terror; the exotic and possibly supernatural intruding itself on the workaday world. The film is a masterwork in the creation of moods and atmosphere - especially of gloom and foreboding - using sound and shadow and music and ordinary objects filmed to appear surreal. A caged panther in a zoo becomes a character in the film's background, crouching like a specter of evil, one day to be released upon the world. And what is not seen but merely suggested hiding in shadows is more frightening than if it had been shown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be the best supernatural film ever made. The script and direction are brilliant, and the film soars to a pinnacle of excellence because of the unique performance by Simone Simon, the French actress playing the part of a Serbian émigré to New York. The performances of Kent Smith and Jane Randolph support her brilliantly. Tom Conway is very creepy, louche, and lecherous in this one, but then he is supposed to be. The 1982 remake of this film was pathetic in comparison to this one, and no one should watch it because of its inferiority to the real thing. Remakes are rarely any good anyway, or at least have not been since the sound version of 'The Lodger' by Hitchcock, but then those sound remakes of silent films were in a different category and often worked. How many times have I seen this? I don't know, but one never tires of it. Jacques Tourneur, the director, will always be remembered for this triumph. He proved more than any director since that terror is best caused by what you do not see. Perhaps he was influenced in this technique by Carl Dreyer's 'Vampyr'. Inferior directors of eerie films always show too much. We must never see what it is we fear, never be able to define it. But what we must see is 'Cat People', over and over and over again.

		<shortDescription>A Horror Classic and a Darn Good Film to Boot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Serbian woman (Simone Simon) thinks she is one of the "cat people" who transform into a dangerous cat when emotionally provoked. When her husband (Kent Smith) begins seeing another woman (Jane Randolph), her suspicions seem to be coming true: is a panther on the loose trying to kill the mistress and is it the Serbian woman? This film has an amazing history -- it was produced to quickly recoup the losses from "Citizen Kane" (a classic now but a flop then), using the studio's leftover sets from "The Magnificent Ambersons", and given only 17 or 18 days to shoot. Producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur made a masterpiece.The shadow effects suggesting a cage, the working in of Jovan Nenad (for some reason inaccurately called King John of Serbia) into the script... even the implied lesbianism (which is subtle, but definitely there). This was a ground-breaking film, both for horror and for general audiences.In some ways, this film is more romance or drama than horror. There is nothing really scary in it by today's standards (besides the legendary bus sequence), but it lays the groundwork for future horror conventions. One could make obvious connections (such as the remake, or the Stephen King movie "Sleepwalkers"), but let us give credit where credit is due: this film really excels at blending the scary with the safe, in ways where you do not know which is which. The scene with the bus has us hearing a noise that may be simply the bus -- or may be a panther. Are we getting nervous for no reason? The best scene of this movie, which was worked into the remake almost as effectively, is the pool scene. Thanks in large part to the film being in black and white, the use of shadows blends the image of a cat with the image of a woman relatively smoothly, causing us to be unsure which is really in the room, ready to attack the swimmer (the mistress). Sounds also echo in the pool room, again masking what may be cat roars or simply just reverberations.The film was popular and quite successful -- the director had to hold back from releasing his next two films because of this film's long run in the theater. And a sequel was made (from the point of view of a girl with an imaginary friend), which is always a sure sign of success. And if you watch it, you will see why. Whether or not one likes older films, this is one of the better ones and will appeal even to picky younger audiences. It is crisp, well scripted and eerie in its own way.All horror fans need to see this if they want an appreciation of the genre's history. Others may simply like it for the story and character interaction. Underneath the "cat people" storyline is more or less just the tale of a jealous wife and a husband with a lady friend. That is a story in and of itself, regardless of any possible magic powers or mystical races.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cat People" centers on Irena Dubrovna Reed (Simone Simon), a woman from Serbia who has moved to New York City and has become an artist. While in New York, Irena meets a man named Oliver (Kent Smith), and the two fall in love and get married. But Irena seems somewhat distant at times in their relationship, and then reveals an old folk tale from her homeland about a group of devilish 'cat people' who were forced to flee into the mountains, and hints that she may be linked to them somehow, and becomes convinced that by the kiss of a man she will transform into one of them. And when Oliver begins to stray from their relationship for a co-worker named Alice, it appears there may be some truth to the legend, because Alice finds herself stalked by a beast-like creature intent on killing her.What some hail as a masterpiece of the horror genre (and I'd say deservedly so), "Cat People" is a classic horror picture that, along with many other fright films produced by Val Lewton in the 1940s (another being the chilling 1943 "The Seventh Victim"), has been ignored far too long. Scripted by DeWitt Bodeen (who also wrote "The Seventh Victim") with collaboration of Val Lewton, the script is solid and suspense-filled, and the overall story is crafted well. In the beginning of the film, Irena is seen as a kind, soft-spoken foreign girl who seems a little insecure, but her character transformation (both psychologically and literally) turns her into a much darker, eerie presence, and Simone Simon plays it extremely well. One of the most admirable qualities about this film is how much it gets across with showing so little. We never do see Irena transform into a panther, there is no metamorphosis sequences of any sort, really. Rather, it all relies on camera tricks and some very clever use of shadows. The cinematography is very nice and the quality of film-making is impressive for the time, because the technique and effects still hold up to this day, surprisingly. Unlike with films like "An American Werewolf In London", (which followed 40 years later, and might I say, seems to have drawn inspiration from "Cat People") technology was not well developed enough for transformation scenes from person-to-panther, so everything is done with shadows and camera trickery, which is just as, if not more effective.You can tell that a movie has aged well if it still manages to get a couple of spooks out of the audience. I have two examples, one of them being the nighttime chase scene between Alice and Irena on the sidewalks to the bus stop- it's extremely well photographed and that clever mix of a cat's howl with the screeching of a bus was genius. My second is the swimming pool sequence, because this type of scenario (as well as the way it was filmed) has been seen many times following this movie. The acting here is worthy as well, with Simone Simon as our lead, and Kent Smith as her husband. Jane Randolph in her role as Alice. The ending is satisfying and leaves most questions answered, but is still rather ambiguous.Overall, "Cat People" is a classic of the horror genre mostly because of the groundwork it laid for many films that followed. As you watch it, you'll notice many elements that have been copied and used in countless other films of it's type, and it's influence on the 'creature feature' sub-genre is quite large. Not only that, but it is also worth watching because it is simply a well-told story, and can still engage it's viewers with suspense and a handful of great little scare sequences. Perfect for a rainy day, and one of the best creature-themed horror films out there. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By featuring werecats the two Cat People films from the Hollywood RKO Studio are fairly unique (even though Cat People are also mythical examples of lycanthropy which is featured in numerous werewolf films). The 1942 film is a B movie created on very low budget, there is then a chronological gap of 40 years between it and the remake which is a major feature film made with a generous budget that must be expected to be very different. But considering them together raises several interesting issues which do not arise when reviewing them individually. Both are based on the same De Witt Bodeen story and are very well made, paralleling each other in numerous details, including not only the names of most of the principal characters, but also several of the actual sequences filmed. This makes it hard to readily appreciate how different are the interpretations they give to these sequences; and Paul Schrader who directed the remake has confessed that he should have changed its title and the names of the characters to avoid confusion. The long interval between these films also helps us to recognise that these differences mainly reflect changing social standards and expectations over the period concerned.The 1942 story is quite short and simple. It was originally crafted by Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur to involve nothing supernatural - it is a psychological study of how compelling fantasies can be in creating delusions and influencing behaviour. Irena (played by Simone Simon) was brought up in Serbia to know and fear the werecat legends, and this has been reinforced by dreams that she is a cat person who will transmogrificate into a black leopard if she 'kisses' a man (presumably a Hayes Code acceptable alternative for 'loses her virginity to'). Consequently she is frigid and fears close contact with men. Despite this she marries, and is later unsuccessfully referred to Dr Judd, a psychiatrist, to help overcome this phobia. But she becomes resentful when her unfulfilled husband becomes friendly with a colleague named Alice. Irena scares Alice by stalking her and making growling noises. From the start everything in this film appears (at first sight) to show a totally normal version of Hollywood domestic life. Only very gradually do a series of strange events disturb this image of normality. Whilst these are often frightening, they are equally explicable as the result of acute psychological stresses or of some sort of supernatural behaviour. Every scene has Freudian overtones and this ambiance is used extremely effectively in building up the atmosphere of horror. Unfortunately RKO muddied this simple interpretation of the story against the wishes of the director by insisting on including a late sequence showing Irena attacking Dr Judd in the form of a black panther, thus forcing viewers to believe she was really a true werecat. This attack followed an implied off-screen attempt to rape her (which the Hayes Code would have prevented actually being shown). Since Judd's role was to attack and destroy the cherished belief on which all her behaviour was based, it seems to me intrinsically more likely that the scriptwriter and director envisaged him giving her a severe mental shock (the threat to have her certified insane) - not raping her.By contrast, the 1982 story is more modern in every respect and throws all reality to the winds - countless films today feature totally imaginary scenarios with vampires, werewolves, space aliens, and other monsters or robots created by the film-maker, forming essential elements in a totally imaginary story being presented. This film treats its basic elements not as fantasies but as virtual realities which the viewer must accept as underpinning the story. You may not choose to believe in them but they are a fundamental part of the story which is being presented. The film opens with a fantasy sequence showing a tribe of primitive men capturing young girls and taking one to the lair of a black leopard, which they presumably worship, so it can mate with her (such an opening sequence would have been totally unacceptable in 1942). This immediately stamps the film as a story far from any sort of reality, and ensures viewers assess the twentieth century sequences that follow accordingly.Clearly these two films differ fundamentally and cannot be compared by assuming they are alternative versions of the same basic story. Unfortunately the similarities in both the stories and the names of the characters make it difficult to write meaningfully about either film without discussing the other. Both films were very successful when first released, but neither is often viewed today despite their very competent acting and high production values. Nevertheless both remain of considerable interest to film historians, and this is particularly true of the 1942 version that we are considering here. When it was first released, interest in horror films was limited because of many films released during the 1930's where the horror was too overt and the stories too simplistic. Cat People was the first, although not the best, of a series of great horror movies created by Val Lewton following his appointment as head of a new Horror division at RKO. These all showed implicit horror could be much more effective than overt horror sequences, and cleared the way for similar works by Hitchcock and others to establish suspense films as a major subset of the horror film genre. It is a pity that the studio felt it had to tone the message down a bit before this film was released, but it still marked an important turning point in the evolution of the horror genre which should be studied by anyone interested. A significant majority of IMDb Users have chosen this 1942 film as preferred to the later remake, helping confirm that even today implicit horror remains more acceptable than excessive violence and gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Ollie (Kent Smith) is visiting the zoo, he meets a lovely Serbian lady named Irena (Simone Simon) doing sketches of the panthers. It's "love at first sight" for both parties. After some time goes by with little physical affection between the two, Ollie begins to wonder if there's more to Irena than meets the eye. She'll do whatever it takes to keep her monstrous secret from coming out. I heard a lot about this one before finally seeing it, and it seems to be a general consensus among fans that this Simone Simon owns this film. I'll agree with that, but it isn't because I find her beautiful or entrancing. She's awkward and a bit off, and it works perfectly for the self-doubting and insecure character. Perhaps this is why the fantastic pool scene works so well within the storyline. The viewer has learned to sympathize with this fragile woman's plight up until this scene, when we're given a sign that maybe we shouldn't trust her. At this point, I was of the opinion that Ollie made a better couple with his female pal coworker and began rooting for him to ditch Irena and get with her. That is, until Simon won my sympathies over again a few scenes later! "Cat People" is a film that the phrase "less is more" is often ascribed to, but this doesn't just apply to the horror angle in the film. There's so much subtext going on here about relationships, female sexuality, and gender roles that couldn't be more blatant in the storyline because of the cultural mindset of the era. The few horror scenes that are in the film are done incredibly well with beautiful cinematography and use of shadows and light. My favorite part of the film is that eerie pool sequence, which is on par with the creepy "walk through the sugar cane field" segment in "I Walked With a Zombie." Tourneur really knew how to get under an audience's skin. Overall, this is a gorgeously photographed film with more going on than is on the surface. And it's a total heart-breaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly influential movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was during the shooting of David O. Selznick's production of Charles Dickens' "A Tale of Two Cities" in 1935, when two young assistants named Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur met while working on several sequences of the celebrated film. In those years, Lewton was working as a jack-of-all-trades with Selznick, while Tourneur was a young assistant director still trying to make himself a name by directing short films for MGM. However, destiny had something better reserved for them, as when in 1942 Lewton became head of the horror unit at RKO studios, the first person he hired as a director was Jacques Tourneur. Together, they would revolutionize the horror genre with the subtle and highly atmospheric style of their movies, based more on suggestion than in direct shock. The first of the three movies Tourneur would do for Lewton, was also his debut on feature length films: the now classic 1942 film, "Cat People"."Cat People" is the story of Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon), a Serbian fashion designer who has moved to New York and spends her free time watching the animals at the zoo. And it is at the zoo where she meets Oliver Reed (Kent Smith), a naval architect who gets fascinated by Irena's beauty and charm, and soon they fall in love with each other. But one element seems to be an obstacle for their happiness: Irena believes on an ancient curse placed on her town, which dictates that she'll transform into a murderous panther if she gets emotionally aroused. Oliver tries to help her, thinking it's just a psychological problem, and eventually marries her, hoping she'll get better. However, Irena's obsession with the curse makes her unable to be happy, and eventually this leads Oliver to fall in love with his coworker, Alice (Jane Randolph). This will have disastrous consequences once Irena discovers she is losing him.As every movie Lewton produced, "Cat People" was based on an idea he had and further developed by one of his writers. In this case, it was DeWitt Bodeen's job to develop a screenplay out of the "Cat People" concept, and he truly created one of the most amazing horror stories ever put on film. Given their budgetary limitations, Lewton and Bodeen wisely chose to focus in suspense and mystery, adding a touch of psychology to their horror and putting a bigger emphasis on the melodrama and in the development of the characters. In the person of Irena, they have created one of the most complex and interesting characters in the history of the genre, one that certainly started the exploration of psycho-sexual themes in movies. And this is because "Cat People" is more than a tale of horror and suspense, it is a subtle metaphor about sexual repression and mainly, the fear of losing control over the passions of the body.If the script is worth of praise, the directing by French filmmaker Jacques Tourneur is simply outstanding. Working in Lewton's unit, Tourneur found severe budgetary limitations, but also an enormous creative freedom that allowed him to develop in "Cat People" a style that later would be identified as "RKO's horror" and inspire other Lewton's protégés like Robert Wise and Mark Robson. This style would be highly influenced by the films noir that had began to appear in 1939, and in many ways, the RKO horror films done by Tourneur could be considered hybrids of horror and film noir (Tourneur himself would direct a classic of film noir in 1947, "Out of the Past"). With a high emphasis on mood and atmosphere, Tourneur plays with sensuality and subtlety in ways no other director had done before in a horror film, employing the power of suggestion to create fear instead of direct graphic horror.Now, as written above, Irena Dubrovna is probably one of the best written characters in the horror genre, but it wouldn't had the impact it had without the remarkable performance by the beautiful French actress Simone Simon. As Irena, Simone really captures that mix of mystery and innocence that makes her character not only attractive and sympathetic, but also highly erotic without losing her class (effectively becoming both a Femme Fatale and damsel in distress at the same time). Her descent into madness as her obsession grows allows Simone to show off her enormous talent as an actress in one of the best portrayals of paranoia ever put on screen. While nobody else in the cast reaches her level of talent (Kent Smith is particularly weak), they are all very effective in their roles, with Tom Conway being remarkably good as Irena's psychiatrist, Dr. Judd.While personally I consider "I Walked With a Zombie" as Tourneur's horror masterpiece, "Cat People" is probably the most influential film that came out of RKO studios during Val Lewton's years. Not only it is a beautifully crafted film (thanks in part to Nicholas Musuraca's cinematography) that successfully added Noir influences to horror, but also it changed the way thrillers were made with its inclusion of psychological tension and eroticism that, thanks to subtle touch of Tourneur, managed to pass through Production Code censors without problem. In a time when B-movies were often synonym of mediocrity, "Cat People" appeared to prove that the only thing a movie needed to be good was talent and dedication. While as written above, Kent Smith makes up a weak counterpart for Simone Simon, it is only a small and unimportant flaw in what is otherwise a perfect film. In the end, Lewton's bet worked for the best and "Cat People" became the most successful film of RKO in the year of its release, saving the studio and consolidating Lewton as the head of its horror unit, effectively starting the age of what is now know as "Lewton horror". As one of the most influential horror films in history, Jacques Tourneur's "Cat People" is a definitive must-see. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lewton classic holds up well...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...although I still prefer the Schrader "remake." Be that as it may, there's something very special about this little gem, and its name is Simone Simon. Without her, I believe that "Cat People" would never have attained its cult status, despite the film's atmospherics. The lady simply shines as Irena Dubrovna, a woman with a curse far more serious than the usual monthly one. Character actor Kent "The Invaders" Smith plays Ollie, Irena's love interest, with a certain daft and wooden affability, while Jane "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" Randolph does the honors as Ollie's true love, and Tom "The Falcon" Conway handles Irena's headshrinking needs with professional, though fatal, aplomb.What sets "Cat People" apart from its peers is its reliance on mood and suggestion to create suspense. The stalking of Randolph's character in the park and at the pool is classic what-you-don't-see-scares-you-the-most material. The combination of Jacques "Night of the Demon" Tourneur's direction and Nicholas "The Story of Mankind" Musuraca's cinematography, aided by the prolific Roy "Mighty Joe Young" Webb's music, completes the elements required to bring this lovely fairy tale horror to fruition. Most of these folks went on to do "The Curse of the Cat People" as well, another highly recommended fantasy.There's little more to say that hasn't already been said about this fine piece of cinema. Every film fan should have this on their must-see list, and every true cinemaphile has it in their collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Noir Horror Classic Of Monstrous Sexual Repression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irena is a young woman of Serbian descent living in New York who falls in love and gets married, but is haunted by dreams of her past and convinced that if she become sexually aroused or jealous she will transform into a panther. Her husband is patient, but the strain takes its toll and his friendship with Alice, a colleague, may threaten both their lives ...A rich horror classic, this was the first of several great RKO movies by gifted director Tourneur and producer Val Lewton, which rises above low-budget limits and sensational plot lines to deliver an elegant, spine-tingling, adult fairy-tale of lust, repression and guilt. Like the best scary stories, on one level it's a mythical adventure - do the cat people really exist, how did they become that way - and on another it's a fascinating metaphor for all sorts of social and sexual inhibitions. For its day the subject-matter is very daring; female frigidity and jealousy, and though the psychiatry double-talk is a bit creaky the characters are rich and tragic. I find Irena irresistible - she's one of horror's great cinematic social outcasts, like Norman Bates or Travis Bickle - and Simon is unforgettable in the lead with her haunted fits and pursed lips. Smith and Randolph give great support, although Conway's pencil-moustached shrink is a bit too mannered, but there is a fine peppering of female support-players (a twittering pet-store clerk, a chain-smoking cleaner, a cheery waitress and a blondie whose dialogue is almost entirely "Gee Whizz !" or "Dearie !"). Tourneur's visual style is a real treat - the swimming pool sequence is a very famous highlight, but the whole movie is a film noir delight and a showcase of black-and-white beauty. I was lucky enough to see it in a dark cinema, and it looks magic, all zoetrope-flicker shadows and hair-raising touches, like the infamous bus-braking moment. If you enjoyed this, check out Tourneur's subsequent I Walked With A Zombie (which is stunning) and Lewton's later The Seventh Victim (which has the grimmest ending of any major studio movie ever). Also worth seeing are the direct sequel, The Curse Of The Cat People, which is a diametrically-opposed children's fantasy, and Paul Schrader's good-but-not-as-good 1982 colour remake. Check this classic out though - a brilliantly-made, literate, intelligent, disturbing little movie, not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much has been written about this movie that there probably isn't much to add. I would like to point out something that may not have been felt by audiences in 1942, however. Seeing the film last night after a long interval, I was struck by how really unsympathetically both husband Oliver and his co-worker/romantic interest Alice come off. Oliver is certainly well meaning, and is patient with his wife's strange ideas for a long time. But it seems like Alice more or less deliberately begins to interfere, first by letting Irena know that she is aware of Irena's counseling sessions with the psychiatrist, much to Irena's shock and embarrassment. As Irena tells her husband after Alice leaves," There are some things a woman doesn't want other women to understand!" Not long after, Alice tearfully tells Oliver at work that she loves him and in effect says, " Oh well, never mind, don't forget your wife". Oliver seems more and more obviously drawn to Alice, to the point that he barely pays attention to Irena. Can anyone blame her for getting angry about this? Of course, the scenes of her stalking Alice in the park and the swimming pool have us concerned for Alice; we don't really want anything to happen to her. And Irena does come to seem pretty dangerous by the end of the film. But we never entirely lose the sense of her as more a victim than a monster. There is something terribly sad at the heart of this apparently trivial movie about a supernatural cat woman. Ultimately this movie is about loneliness and alienation, and even manages to raise some questions about the institution of marriage. This is a fine little thriller that holds up well over the years and manages to achieve something really unusual for a Forties b picture: it makes the audience think about the characters and their lives for a long time afterward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love, Frustration, Jealousy &amp; Revenge - A Terrific 'Grown-Up' Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Cat People' is justifiably a classic. Though it does not get the modern press of the Universal horror films of the same era, it clearly holds its own and indeed succeeds as a thriller for grown-ups.What makes 'Cat People' good is that you care about the title character (well played by Simone Simon) and her anguish as she struggles between her love for a man (Kent Smith) and the curse which she believes she is under.The story builds from a common 'young love' theme, to relationship struggles, to outright jealousy and maybe revenge. If you allow the build-up through the early 'talky' section, the pay off is very much worth it. A satisfying wrinkle to the film, as well, is the audience's ambiguity as to whether Ms. Simon is crazy or, indeed, a potential feline killer.This film is not sensationalistic, but frightening. There are some classic scenes which are very intense because we are skillfully placed in the 'shoes' of the characters. 'Cat People' scares you because it takes ordinary situations and makes you feel the sudden vulnerability of the characters within them.As for weaknesses, Kent Smith is not bad, but a bit wooden, and there are some 'stagey' elements as are common to films of the era. Overall, though, the tone of the film is surprisingly fresh and the strengths do far outweigh the few weaknesses.The images you take away from 'Cat People' will most likely stick with you and demand a repeat viewing. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It hits me stronger once it ends how superlative Cat People comes off. It's got an obvious story, a short one in fact, the kind that if it was written out in just pure fiction instead of a screenplay it would be no longer than 20 pages and made almost in total mind for one of those 40s horror serials. And at a little over 70 minutes, the story never then overstays its welcome. What ends up really remarkable, and ultimately memorable even in its B-movie form, is going completely beneath what's supposed to scare us and get to the psychological goodies. I wasn't scared by Cat People, though it goes without saying how tame it comes off on a smaller screen. But I was very affected by the control director Jacques Tourner and his crew had with the mood. This story, and its characters, depend on it to really move us with what's going on. In making it an early kind of noir, more so perhaps lending to Gothic films of the silent era as opposed to monster movies of the 30s, the filmmakers get inside the head of its main character, and then it becomes really the point of view of many key scenes.It doesn't really start off like that, however. In fact what's remarkable to start with is how unremarkable it seems. Simone Simon's Irena meets Kent Smith's Ollie Reed, who become smitten and marry. But Irena's past is always in the background, intruding even on happy occasions (a woman who appears suddenly at a party makes Irena go white with just one word, itself quite a good scene just by Simon's reaction). She sees a psychiatrist, but it doesn't help, and soon what is in her soul starts to 'come out', as it might be, and mostly in Ollie falling for Jane Randolph's Alice, who get along more as regular people do as opposed to the strange connection of the doomed married couple. One of the things that makes the cast work well is pitting Simon, who is as much a character to feel sympathy for as take for a force to be reckoned with, against such a bland actor like Smith and then a near typical leading lady from Randolph. One could imagine more A-list actors of the period filling the parts well enough, but it's even better with lesser knowns such as these. Every scene with Simon is fantastic, just ones with herself too, like before during and after a dream she has. And Randolph finally has to break her mostly one-track character in that pool scene.All the while, cinematically, it gives its audience more than what it might have bargained for, in the best way possible. Part of the artistic decision on Tourner and producer Val Lewton's part was to not show any 'real' panthers, but to mark up the suggestive value. I'm not sure if other horror movies did this before Cat People (probably so), but here it almost makes for a prototype of countless imitations, some good some completely paled in relation to this. That pool scene, for example, which got a bit of spotlight in Scorsese's documentary on American movies, is only a bit of what adds to the tension for the viewer. One becomes more pitted against the central conflict- a woman completely mad over another taking over the man- by the boundaries being pushed with the focus of light and dark, matched together or taken apart and singled out. I loved one shot, for example, when Irena is on the Psychiatrist's couch getting hypnotized- it's a simple one, perhaps, but still incredible in its small way, as one circular light amid all the rest in black surrounds her aside from her profile. Or when Irena is stalking Alice on the street, how it cuts between them and marks up the weirdness as well as the suspense.Granted little moments of humor that almost comes off as cheesy (many a good cat pun, plus the animals in the pet shop all in unison against her) don't add much substance to this pot-boiler. And because of its short length it suddenly seems so sudden- even in its 1940s sort of way- how quick the relationship unfolds and then how soon it disintegrates. But that too is part of the quasi-genius of DeWitt Bodeen's script realized by Tourner; little by little, in the course of a very short period of time, a character that isn't too un-likable has to face her worst fears and delirium, and she becomes the antagonist (almost) against her will. The psychological complexity laden in such an low-budget horror film that's meant just to give a good gasp to the matinée crowd makes it fun, and not totally in a tongue-in-cheek way. It's a studio picture with just that right hint of subversion that kept people like Lewton and Tourner edgy and, unfortunately, not as well known as those who came after them with the same tricks but less nuance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of Val Lewton's films for RKO were low-budget b-movies. Denied big name actors, impressive set-pieces and lavish sets, Lewton did the smart thing. He made the script the star of the movie.Every single one of Lewton's films during the 1940s packed loads of story and characterisation into very modest running times, something modern film-makers could learn from. And the bar was set so high by CAT PEOPLE, the first of these low-budget scare-fests.Not exactly horror films, CAT PEOPLE and its stablemates all strove to instill a feeling of unease rather than out and out horror. By keeping the "monster" in the shadows, Lewton wasn't giving the audience anything to be horrified by, but then true fear is fear of the unknown.Some reviewers have suggested that modern audiences won't like low-key movies like CAT PEOPLE. I'm not sure I agree. I love the classics but also appreciate more modern fare like SAW. True, CAT PEOPLE is a relic of a gentler age, but it's not without teeth. There's at least two points in the film where you'll jump out of your skin.I'd recommend anyone with a passing interest in horror movies to seek out and see CAT PEOPLE if only to find out what scared the daylights out of your grandparents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cat People" is a very effective low key thriller about a young Serbian woman who believes that is one of the accursed "cat people" of her national mythology. Simone Simon who plays the exquisite, but slightly peculiar, Irena is perfect in the role?her offbeat beauty with her broad cheekbones and flattened snub nose even makes her look a bit like a cat. Kent Smith is also good as Oliver, the well meaning, but slightly cloddish (maybe it's the forties' slang) boyfriend and afterwards husband. He is immediately attracted to Irena when he first sees her sketching a panther at the zoo, even though he soon senses there is something a bit off about her--she casually tosses away discarded sketches before a sign asking visitors not to litter, startles him by asking him into her apartment for tea minutes after meeting him , but refuses to even kiss him after they've been dating for months and sends animals into a panic merely by being present near them. He is particularly bemused when she tells him about the curse she believes she is afflicted with, but still finding her quirkiness more attractive than not, he marries her. Initially he is patient with her refusal to consummate their marriage (she is afraid that their lovemaking will transform her into a killer cat), but he eventually grows frustrated and finds himself attracted to his co-worker, a "swell" normal girl called Alice. When Irena becomes suspicious of Oliver's relationship with Alice, it becomes clear that jealousy as well as sexual passion can set off her metamorphosis.Although the movie is billed as a horror film (and there are some very chilling scenes set at night in a deserted park and pool), it is more interested in depicting Irena's anguish over her condition and her husband's mounting bewilderment than gory scenes. All in all, highly recommended for viewers who enjoy subtle horror films, as is the sequel "Curse of the Cat People."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see in the cinema or on TV with the lights off!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this beauty 20 years ago I was surprised it wasn't rated higher, maybe into "classic" status. Having seen it now 8 times I realise it was a fairly conventional '40's Hollywood film hamstrung like all others by all the Hays Office could think of. I also view CP as a lover of all types of Golden Age movies, not primarily as a Horror Historian which has to be the biggest fascination about this film. Nor can I view this as a heavy symbolic fairy tale with any deep relevance to anything: Just a damn good film! The most unusual aspect to me is the underlying un-Americanism of Irena compared to apple pie Ollie and plain talking Alice, the stark contrast between the two sides is glaringly different for movies of the period. For those people watching this with eyes open Ollie's simple but thwarted desire for sex after marriage with Irena is trumpeted clumsily, along with Dr. Judd's later fatal illicit passion for her.The scenes where Jane Randolph going home at night is being followed by something, and in the swimming pool are classic, oft copied seldom bettered even now with better technology to cut and shock. Randolph is the weakest link in this, I liked her in some other films but in CP she talks in a stilted manner like she was reading the script at the same time. Her simple patriotic support for the beleaguered Kent Smith was maybe just right though - leading to the thought What on Earth did either see in either?! Favourite bit: Elisabeth Russell in "The Belgrade" crowded café coming up to Simone Simon with her immortal 2 Serbian words that would mean nothing here - you have to watch it!Nicely atmospheric photography and lighting and high production values make this a treat, a special B picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1942 Horror/Suspense Classic that set the standard for many others to follow over the years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** The first and best of the producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur collaborations in horror/suspense movies that they made in the 1940's that was to start a trend for many other horror/mystery/suspense films for years to come.With a limited budget, the movie "Cat People" cost something like $140,000.00 to make. With lots improvisation on the movie sets and talent and imagination Lawton &amp; Tourneur made a horror/suspense classic that is as haunting and effective now as it was some sixty years ago when it was first released back in 1942. Irena Dubrovna, Simone Simon, a fashion artist, lives alone and shuns having any lasting relationships in the bustling and crowded city of New York. Ireana spends most of her free time at the neighborhood zoo drawing pictures of the big cats, mostly leopards, who are caged there. One afternoon Oliver Reed, Kent Smith, a young architect strikes up a conversation with Irena and before you know it he fall in love with her and she reluctantly with him. Blinded by love Oliver seems to overlook the strangeness and mystery about Irena. Her fascination with big jungle cats, mostly black leopards. Her ability to see in the dark and the fear that animals that he bought for her as pets have of her as soon as the see or sense her presents. One rainy afternoon when Oliver and Irena went to a pet store to buy a canary all the animals in the store went wild with fear at just the sight of her. Oliver and Irena got married some time late. After the wedding at a party in a local restaurant an eerie and strange looking women, Elizabeth Russell, came up to Irena, and as if she were greeting her as a fellow friend and countrywomen, and said to her "moya sestra" which means "my sister" in Serbian.Earlier Irena had told Oliver that she originally came from a small and isolated town in Serbia that was inhabited by strange and evil people who escaped there in order to get away from the Serbian King John from being put to the sword for their practice in witchcraft and satanism. The people in that town were known as "Cat People". Hauntingly chilling film where the past and the present clashes in the big and modern city of New York with some of the most innovating and shocking scenes ever put on film. Scenes where your imagination, not an FX or Special Effects crews, provided the jolts. Simone Simon is both hauntingly beautiful as well as darkly deadly in the best role of her movie career as the tortured as well as doomed Irena. Tom Conway, Dr. Louis Judd, gave a solid portrayal of a psychiatrist who broke one of the biggest rules of his profession, falling in love with one of his patients, and in the end paying for it with his life. Spine-tingling scenes with Oliver's co-worker and later lover, to the resentment and hatred of Irena, Alice Moore (Jane Randolph) in the famous walk in the dark street and park at night scene and of course the classic indoor swimming pool sequence. We see in the movie how a great director, Jacques Tourneur, can scare the heck of of his audience with using nothing more then their imagination. As the movie "Cat People" moved to it's final and tragic ending Irena realized that she could not go on living like she had all of her life. After losing Oliver to Alice Irena is forced back into the dark and lonely life of a "Cat Person" and ended it all at the zoo where she first met Oliver and the black panther that she was drawing that afternoon in what seemed like a lifetime ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes us Scare Ourselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a pivotal scene in Vincente Minelli's The Bad and the Beautiful where Kirk Douglas and Barry Sullivan, portraying a fledgling Hollywood producer and director are given the task of making a horror movie with little more than a title (and a silly one at that). In a flash of desperate inspiration, they eschew the typical men-in-suits method that never works anyway, relying instead on the two oldest and most reliable special effects in filmaking: the Dark and the Imagination. Needless to say their film is a hit. I have no doubt this scene was a direct tribute to the careers and films of an unjustly obscure pair of visionaries, producer Val Lewton and director Jaques Tourneur and their most "famous" film, 1942's Cat People.Shot at RKO in under a month for less than $140,000, this dark little gem stars Simone Simon as Irena, a Serbian woman (immigrant? refugee?) who is convinced that her blood carries the curse of a race of European Satanist druids, and that any hint of passion, love, desire, anger, jealousy will turn her into a murderous cat-creature. The tiny, lovely Simon plays the role beautifully, with a fragile, feline grace that hints at something very dark (kinky?) lurking just underneath her almond-shaped eyes and alluring smile. Kent Smith plays her husband Oliver Reed rather woodenly by comparison, but Tourneur is smart enough not to try making him any deeper than a typical all-American boy type - at one point he describes his life as `swell' and somehow we don't laugh...maybe you could say stuff like that in the 40s.DeWitt Bodeen's script efficiently zips through the boy-meets-girl part, but not without giving us things to think about. After brazenly inviting (luring?) Oliver to her apartment for tea after having just met, we soon find Irena humming an exotically European lullaby in the darkened room as Oliver lays on her sofa.though both characters are fully dressed and on opposite sides of the room, the feeling that something did/will/should/wants to happen is palpable. Particularly chilling is a moment when Irena and Oliver enter a pet shop only to find every single animal in the room shrieking with horror, the din ceasing the moment Irena opts to stand by herself in a pouring rain while Oliver shops in the now peaceful establishment. I've seen more graphic depictions of the excluded outsider, but none more poigniant. At a party thrown in honor of their engagement, a mysterious and beautiful stranger who `looks like a cat' according to one guest greets Irena as a familiar, saying something in a language only the two of them understand. It's a simple moment, but a dark one.dark because the audience realizes that Irena truly is something other than what she seems, and because the people around her don't believe it, something bad is going to happen.This is when Tourneur and photographer Nicholas Musuraca do their work, mixing our own expectation of something awful with shadows, sounds and silence, standing by as we push our own buttons. Utterly normal things like walking to a bus stop, answering the phone, taking a swim and even having coffee and pie morph from the common into hair raising incidents. As we watch we're more frightened each time something dosen't happen, convinced that it's going to be really awful when it finally does. It isn't until the film's bittersweet finale, that we realize that Tourneur and Bodeen have been toying with our very conception of what scary is.conning us into scaring ourselves because we already know how.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A landmark in the Horror genre's development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cat People was the first collaboration between the RKO producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur that later resulted in more two films I Waked with a Zombie and The Leopard Man forming this way now classic and at the time commercially successful Horror Trilogy. Cat People is generally considered the best of the three and it was the first film where Jacques Tourneur used his innovative, which later became his trademark suspense technique in direction, which basically consists in not showing the most frightening moments in the film's action using instead shadows and sounds leaving the rest to the viewer's imagination, a technique that resulted perfectly at the time of film's initial release in 1942, providing its astounding for the B horror movie success at the Box Office and establishing Jacques Tourneur as the master of the genre. Now, 60 years later, it still knocks with full impact generating a chain of the perfect moments of chilly horror.  The film's story is about a very mysterious and beautiful young artist of Serbian origin Irena Dubrovna (played by Simone Simon) who lives in New York and is haunted by her childhood memories of the stories her parents told her about a women who turn into panthers. Soon she meets a handsome young man Keith Smith (Oliver Reed) who promptly falls in love with her.  As the time passes his love to the troubled young woman grows more and more and so the Irena's obsession with panthers that leads her to regular visiting of the zoo to observe and draw the animals. Soon she comes to believe that she suffers from an ancient curse that may result in her turning into a panther every time she is emotionally disturbed. At the beginning Keith refuses to take seriously her mental problem but soon decides to take Irene to a renowned psychiatrist Dr. Judd (Tom Conway). The situation is aggravated when Keith starts an affair with Alice (Jane Randolph) who happens to be the couple's mutual acquaintance and his colleague at work.  A genuine Horror classic, a must-see for every one. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jacques Tourneur's low-budget horror B-movie about a young woman of Slavic ascent haunted by what may or may not be a folkloric curse seems pretty tame by today's standards, but was in fact a revelation at the time of its release thanks to its reliance on mood and atmosphere, having been the first film to avoid depicting its "monster" and work exclusively within the realm of suggestion. All-American boy Kent Smith meets the lovely Simone Simon in the zoo, where she is seen sketching a panther; soon they're madly in love with each other, but she is haunted by the folk tale of her village, whose descendents are cursed to turn into cats and kill the man they love. The plot seems downright na?f these days but the subtext, playing with repressed love and sexuality, and even toying with the then-emerging field of psychiatry, is as potent as ever, especially when stylishly, languidly enveloped by Tourneur and cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca in a high-contrast, textured black and white photography. The acting is generally dismal, but other than that "Cat People" pretty much explains why the low-budget limitations of B-movies have been so influential in the development of modern genre cinema: it's a modern classic, although contemporary filmgoers may attach more importance to its historical value than to its entertaining qualities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effectively made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so good-looking that our eyes just want to eat it up. Deep, moody patches of blackness abound; Jacques Tourneur and his crew might have been making a noir horror to disguise their B-movie budget and sets, but by God, the tactic paid off. Certain scenes see everything as blackness except for the bars of windows; shadows are everywhere all the time; the use of darkness is sometimes even announced, as with the famous scene in the swimming pool, where the reflections on the wall get darker and darker as Jane Randolph gets more and more worried that something is coming after her.It's always pointed out that the movie works despite some very simple, perfunctory dialogue, and that's correct. "Cat People" is blunt in some of its characterisations, and the whole idea that Simone Simon will turn into a murderous cat when kissed by a man is a sexual metaphor that goes right to the brink of silliness. But the atmosphere makes the film involving nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As tight and economical as they come (and as chilling), CAT PEOPLE sets the tone for the Lewton films that followed (thanks, in no small part, to the direction of the brilliant Jacques Tourner). Characters are sharply etched in chiascuro. Lewton and company were right at home in the "Big Dark" (the "Grand Noir"), and their first excursion into that dark is one of their best. (Several years before the much-ballyhooed dream sequence by Salvador Dali in Alfred Hitchcock's SPELLBOUND, Lewton and company did their own low budget dream sequence; the sequence is effective in this context, though it would've been interesting to see what this group could've done had they had the budget Hitchcock had.) Anyone interested in serious fright fare needs to sit down and watch the Lewton films, one and all: for only then will their education be complete.</fullReview>

Most of today's audiences are used to horror movies they can watch with out thinking, with the heroes attempting to avoid being butchered alive by a maniac, and so unfortunately may not even sense what is going on here.

		<fullReview>Strange how a work of pure fantasy like this can tell more about human mental illness than all the "scientific" films about psychology ever made. Compare this to "Spellbound" or "Now, Voyager" or any other movie based on the Freudian mumbo-jumbo so popular at the time and you'll see. (Was it an accident that the psychiatrist is the only truly evil character in this film?)The movie is about a young woman who is living half a life as the film opens. She is alone and accursed, haunted by the past, afraid of love, sex, life, and especially herself. When she meets a young man and they fall in love, it seems that she has been rescued by a fairy-tale romance, but instead she has been doomed. When her marriage begins to fall apart and her weak husband turns to another woman, she gives into the curse, creating genuine terror and gradually losing her sanity.This is an excellent movie at any level. Reams have been written about the wonderfully subtle ways in which Jacques Tourneur scared the pants off generations of viewers with nothing more than shadows and music, and still more reams about producer Val Lewton's wonderful understanding of female characters. In my opinion this is the high point of both their careers. It's genuinely scary, yet complex and subtle, the terror is inspired as much by a deep understanding of the characters as by the danger they face. And by an understanding that the deepest dangers aren't physical.This is one of my favorite movies of all time, something too rich to be called a "Horror film".(For God's sake, avoid the inferior 1980's remake!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great idea of sexual animalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While at the Central Park Zoo, mysterious Serbian fashionista Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon) catches the eye of Oliver Reed. She tells them of the legend of King John who freed the people from the Mameluks. John found some had been corrupted to worship Satan. He killed them all except for the ones who escaped into the mountains. Later, Irena and Oliver get married but her belief comes between them. She believes that an ancient family curse turns her into a panther when she gets aroused. Oliver sends her to psychiatrist Dr. Louis Judd.This movie burns a little too slowly. The acting is pretty stiff. The movie uses shadows and sounds to do most of the horror. There are some very effective scenes. The swimming pool is the highlight of the movie. The movie has a great idea of sexual animalism but it's an idea that really can't be filmed at that time. It's about the denial of the sexual instincts. This movie probably pushed the boundaries a little bit. It's a movie of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A cat just walked over my grave"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Vincente Minnelli's 'The Bad and the Beautiful (1952),' Hollywood producer Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas) brainstorms ideas for the latest B-movie horror project to fall into his lap. Unhappy with the feline costumes they'd been testing, he proposes not showing the titular "cat-men" at all: "And why? Because the dark has a life of its own. In the dark, all sorts of things come alive." Shields was obviously referencing Jacques Tourneur's 'Cat People (1942),' the brainchild of legendary horror producer Val Lewton, who made B-movies so professionally-crafted that to call them B-movies would be to do them a disservice. My first Lewton film was 'The Seventh Victim (1943),' a clash of superb cinematography and a ridiculous plot, but fortunately 'Cat People' has a more palatable storyline ? though, of course, you'll still have to suspend disbelief on the odd occasion. If this film is a triumph, then it's a triumph of atmosphere, with Nicholas Musuraca (one of film noir's most accomplished cinematographers) prolonging the intrigue and suspense through his masterful use of lighting and shadows.When American Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) marries Serbian immigrant Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon), he convinces himself that his wife's fear of intimacy is simply a remnant of her superstitious childhood. But Irena is adamant that she not consummate the marriage, for she fears that, due to a Satanic family curse, her sexual passion will force her into the form of a bloodthirsty panther. Irene constantly surrounds herself with feline imagery, is instinctively drawn to a captive zoo panther, and her fears swiftly become a psychological obsession that threaten to take her over. Oliver confides his concerns in attractive co-worker Alice Moore (Jane Randolph), who is biased by her love for him, and psychiatrist Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway, who oddly appeared in the same role in 'The Seventh Victim (1943)'), who dismisses Irena's worries as mere insanity. The three supporting players give good performances, but Simone Simon is weak; she does display a certain exotic allure and a shy vulnerability, but her dialogue delivery is entirely unconvincing.Val Lewton originally instructed Tourneur to completely avoid showing the elusive panther, but RKO demanded more money-shots. Even so, Irena's feline form is on screen only for a few shots, and never in plain view. The filmmakers evidently understood that seeing nothing was infinitely more frightening than seeing a trained animal, and so the unknown ? a shadow that lurks cunningly in the shadows ? is exploited for maximum thrills. Lewton's initial insistence on not showing the panther, maintaining ambiguity on Irena's mental state, suggests that he had in mind something more than a simple "monster picture." Is this panther that plagues a shy, married woman's mind representative of something within ourselves ? of suppressed jealousy, aggression and lust? Sex and violence have often blended together in mythology. Mafdet, the Ancient Egyptian goddess of justice and execution, possessed the head of a lioness; she was later replaced by Bast, whose image then changed to represent fertility and motherhood. In the same way, Irena's marital lust is intrinsically linked with her aggression, and abstinence alone will only temporarily quell her desires.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cat People starts at a zoo as architect Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) meets Serbian immigrant Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon) who is sketching a Panther, the two fall in love become engaged &amp; get married. However the marriage is a strange one, Irena tells Oliver of ancient stories back home in Serbia as a King John defeated the Mamelukes &amp; that she believes tales of her ancient ancestors turning into vicious Cat women when angered or kissed. Because of her irrational fears &amp; anxieties Irena cannot have an intimate relationship with her husband Oliver, growing ever more frustrated &amp; unhappy Oliver seeks advice &amp; comfort from his co-worker Alice Moore (Jane Randolph) but the two fall in love &amp; begin an affair. After several intimidating incidents of being followed both Oliver &amp; Alice feel that Irena has either become jealously deranged or that her Serbian legend of killer Cat women might be true...Directed by Jacques Tourneur this moody low budget black and white horror film was the first produced by genre pioneer Val Lewton for R.K.O. Pictures &amp; was a huge success at the time of release &amp; has since become widely regarded as a defining moment in the horror genre, while I liked Cat People well enough &amp; found it passed the time harmlessly enough I can't say it knocked my socks off. Cat People is now regarded as the first psychological horror film ever made, a film with a sensationalistic title that conjures up thoughts of mutant Cat people but the script is far more subtle than that &amp; relies on character driven drama as much as scares. In fact I found Cat People was as much as story about a love triangle between Irena, Oliver &amp; Alice as much as it's a story about the supernatural. The script tries to to leave the viewer in doubt for much of the film, are those noises &amp; shadow's really a killer Panther or just that character's imagination working overtime? From the ancient Serbian legends to the modern sensibilities &amp; emotional strain the script tries to leave as many possibilities open as it can, eventually it is made clear that Irena does indeed turn into a Cat person but even then it's low key &amp; done with restraint. The character's are decent, they are well fleshed out if a little stiff &amp; at only seventy minutes long it moves along at a nice pace even tough some may feel it takes a while to get going. The film is tightly scripted with an air of supernatural but also with various rational explanations offered up to counter it, while many consider Cat People a classic it has dated a bit &amp; while there's nothing wrong with it &amp; it makes for perfectly fine viewing I wasn't quite as impressed as it's lofty reputation suggests I should have been.Filmed with great style the budget was apparently so tight that sets from the Orson Welles film The Magnficent Ambersons (1942) were used to save money, director Tourneur uses the light &amp; shadow superbly while the low level lighting &amp; fine black and white photography create a terrific atmosphere &amp; mood with a few stand-out sequences. The two that are often referred to are when Alice is followed down a quiet street before a bus suddenly pulls up which was the first instance of such a scare in a horror film (a quite build up of suspense before some mundane occurrence breaks the silence &amp; jolts the audience) while the pool scene also holds up really well even today as the dark shadow's &amp; the rippling reflection of the swimming pool water on the ceiling creating a really effective &amp; ominous mood. There is zero violence as you would expect but that shouldn't put you off even if modern audiences may have a problem with the tameness.Apparently released on Christmas Day December 25th 1942 (does that sound odd to anyone else?) &amp; filmed in just eighteen days this had a supposed budget of about $150,000 but is extremely well made. The acting is pretty good if a little wooden at times although the two leading ladies are striking.Cat People was a huge success for Val Lewton who in my opinion would go on to make even better horror films &amp; was a defining moment in the horror genre &amp; while many call it a classic I wasn't that amazed by it. Good but maybe not as great as some say or it's reputation suggests. Followed by a completely unrelated sequel The Curse of the Cat People (1944) &amp; remade forty years later in name only as the decent Cat People (1982) which is worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an over-hyped, ineffective thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has won a reputation as a groundbreaker in the horror movie genre. This recognition relies on the device of suspense and threat being implied rather than seen or graphically displayed. Menace can be effectively conveyed by mood and tone but in this film, these two enhancers of emotion fail to bring it to a level of masterful execution. I've watched this movie several times and each time it was an effort to see it through to the end. The storyline of a young woman haunted by an ancient curse involving revengeful killer cats, is a lumbering haul where the viewer patiently waits for some stunning pay-off. By the time this curse is played out, it's anti-climactic. There's no shock or surprise here. What does scream out at you in every scene is the low budget with which they had to work. The actors and their performances are just as cut-rate as the production values. The unfortunate heroine Irina is played by a French actress of limited talent Simone Simon. The husband, Oliver Reed played by a lackluster Kent Smith, is a wooden presence, a well- meaning man who marries the spooked Irina, a Serbian with a jinxed heritage. The match between the two is the kind of walk on the wild side that Oliver, proceeding through his conventional life, never could have ever imagined. Tom Conway, brother of the more famous and accomplished George Sanders, puts in a stint as a representative of the world of science. Dr. Judd is a psychiatrist whose role in this drama is to counter balance the world of superstition that is the thematic thread of the movie. Conway shares his actor brother's beautiful speaking voice and suave manner, which serves to elevate the film, a notch. This movie was a big popular hit when released and gave producer Val Lewton a brand name. Nevertheless, this is a boring movie, one if you sit through once, you'll most likely not be tempted to revisit again. I gave it a second viewing to try to determine what all the enthusiasm for it was about. I still didn't become a fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but the acting is stilted and the dialogue is bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like CAT PEOPLE. There are a lot of good things to say about this movie, even if there's a xenophobic quality to it that's a bit disturbing. The cinematography is great and the atmosphere is amazing. There are several memorable set pieces, like the walking at night or the pool moments, or scenes, like when Irena takes a bath. The two things that keep this film from being an all out classic is the acting and the dialogue. The dialogue is really bad. Painfully bad at times, which really undermines the whole fragile quality of the movie. Then there's acting, which is very stilted, even for 1940s standards. The really bad dialogue probably didn't help the actors much but during some scenes, the combination of bad dialogue and stilted acting made it a chore to sit through. It's a shame really because the concept of the movie itself is good, even if the filmmakers rely on disturbing the audience by playing with their xenophobia/paranoia. The script also has a couple of huge plot-holes which should have been fixed before the cameras rolled.So, all in all, I enjoyed watching CAT PEOPLE even with all it's faults. But because of the really bad dialogue and stiff acting, well, this movie is not on my "I have to watch it again" list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent entry in the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After meeting a striking artist, a man's growing romance with her brings out her fears of turning into a ravenous cat-creature and tries to quell her fears as a series of murders around town sheds light on her story and forces him into a dangerous situation to control her.Overall this one wasn't all that bad but did have a few problems with it. One of the biggest facets against this is the absolutely dull, dreary pace her that doesn't offer a whole lot here. Building up their growing romance and how her superstitions are continually interfering with everything do makes for a really bland time by keeping the story of her beliefs too wrapped up in nonsense most of the time. The folklore tells of cats as being of a great good to their village, yet here the fear of them doesn't see that well-developed beyond her rabid devotions and beliefs which fuels this one and very little of this makes for a scary time without giving this a really grand feeling here. All of this instead makes for a somewhat talkative and really restrained time here by taking of a lot of the time and leaving very little of it for action scenes here. Still, what really ends up helping this one is this build-up to the psychological problems of the girl which is where this one gets the strength, as this one manages to accomplish the incredibly tricky feat of keeping nearly everything hidden away yet coming up with a truly enjoyable and entertaining offering which is what's accomplished here. By delving deep into the storyline here and how her convictions and worries re for the most part mostly in her head, there's a great deal of care done in here about the different means in which they're manifesting yet aren't anywhere near the level of effectiveness her when it comes to the film's stalking scene to generate that kind of impact here. Utilizing the legendary park sequence where an unseen figure chases someone through the park's dark walkways is a fine example while also bringing up the start of several other positives in the other stalking scenes. The other great scene here is the ambush in the swimming pool of a hotel, letting the shadows and darkness come off quite well while the aftermath damage to the leftover clothing is impressive as well in furthering the whole affair, while a really tense encounter at work where they find themselves trapped inside the room only to confront a vicious panther in there with them and the finale where the cat launches the final attack here against the friends with the big sequence in the hotel room attacking the friends before getting to the fine finale in the park for a nice conclusion here. These here make this one quite enjoyable and entertaining.Today's Rating/PG: Mild Violence and mild sexual discussions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cat People along with The Wolfman are the two finest shape snifter films ever made and Cat People stands as the crown jewel of the legendary horror films Val Lewton made at RKO!Lewton became recognized as one of the finest horror, fantasy, and suspense story tellers in Hollywood. Director Jacques Tourneur established himself as Hollywood's top horror/ fantasy director of the 1940's ranking up there with James Whale as the best ever.DeWitt Bodeen wrote a script that was part horror and part film noir and was brilliantly conceived.Nicholas Musuraca's shadowy cinematography is as much the star of Cat People as any of the actors.All that talent comes together to create a suspenseful and even breathtaking fantasy/horror film. The cast of Cat People Kent Smith,Tom Conway, Jane Randolph, and Jack Holt were all character actors and competent craftsmen in their work and were recognizable to theater audiences but none were big stars.Simone Simon's portrayal of Irena is both exotic and vulnerable and remains her best known role to American audiences. Tourneur got masterful performances from all of them in creating the story. Cat People has many iconic moments. The bus stop scene. The pet shop scene. The legendary swimming pool sequence. All of the scenes at the zoo. They are all part of magic of Cat People. Cat People is certainly one of RKO's finest films and one of the best movies of the WWII era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the movie was finished I was sure I had seen a similar movie many years ago. Now I have found out that it was the remake of this movie from 1982 which I consider inferior to this great movie. Not only is the horror much more suggestion and psychological while the remake it was quite explicit, everything else was better than the remake too. The cast is pretty small, with 3 protagonists 4 if we also include the psychiatrist. All of these roles were well acted and well developed. I really loved the back story/legend of the cat people and Simone Simon's character struggle with what she was. She definitely tried to fit in but couldn't help fighting her fate. The relationships and love triangle was done wonderfully and believable, great chemistry between the 3 leads. The ending was pretty clever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Influential and holds up terrifically well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cat People is one of the horror genre's most influential films, it's one of the first psychological horrors or at least one of the first to play on the fears of the audience. But Cat People is more than just an influential film, it's also a great one and holds up terrifically well.It's very well made, with beautiful cinematography and great and effective use of shadows and shadowy lighting. The sets are also hauntingly sumptuous. Cat People has a haunting music score and a very intelligent script that has a good amount of tension as well as a bit of subtle wit. The story, and the atmosphere it has, is one of the main reasons why Cat People works so well, this is more than a monster/ghost feature, this is more a psychological horror that relies on suspense and playing on the audience's fear. Both of which Cat People does splendidly, the suspense in the best parts is positively nerve-shredding and the whole film has a constant eeriness that makes it creepy without resulting to cheap shocks, jump scares or gore. For me the two most effective scenes have always been with the pool and the walk through the park, the latter being justifiably famous and contains a very clever "false shock". It's beautifully directed by Jacques Tourneur, the characters are interesting and the acting is mostly solid if not the best, with Simone Simon being superb. Simon brings a sensuality, menace and poignancy to her role, that makes her presence chillingly mysterious but at times moving. Tom Conway does just fine too.If there is anything to criticise, Kent Smith is very stiff here. Other than that Cat People is great, both of its genre and as a film in general. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as they say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it is atmospheric, and the famous moments (the chase, the swimming pool) really are that good. I've just watched it again and find my memory had distorted some details: I pictured Anne in the pool in an unflattering cap, and the hotel receptionist with a twangy Brooklyn accent - which she doesn't have, she just calls everybody "Honey" or "Dearie". She is good in her small role, as is the waitress (a black character with a character, even if she does have to make a "characteristic" remark about nobody liking gumbo).What struck me this time around: there are subtle clues. Irena's fur coat, the way she stalks Oliver and Anne, fading behind conveniently placed potted palms (jungle). The shadow of a chair behind her head giving her "ears". The cleaning lady who is first seen crawling on all fours through the revolving door, animal-like until she raises her head and is revealed as an ordinary woman who collects matchbooks.Another point: until well into the story, the spectral panther could have been the real panther from the zoo, released by Irena (who has stolen the key to his cage). But then you realise that this is misdirection: the panther could not have walked unnoticed into the hotel! And it could not have broken into Anne and Oliver's office - or could it? Did it come through that revolving door? But surely if it had got loose we would have heard about it.The script by the wonderfully named De Witt Bodeen deserves a mention - especially the scene where Anne confesses to Oliver that she is in love with him.The music adds a lot, too. The lullaby Irena sings, that the characters later play on the gramophone. The Irish song the zookeeper is always singing, that Irena picks up.Oh, and the Other Catwoman is sitting in the background at the restaurant when Oliver goes there on his own.If you liked this, you will like The Seventh Victim, which features Dr Judd, mysteriously resurrected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can't Fool a Cat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little does carefree Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) know that the cute Serbian (Simone Simon) he picks up outside the panther cage at his local zoo has some emotional baggage. It turns out that she's an immigrant from a backward village steeped in witchcraft, and believes that she will turn into a panther if she is angered or sexually aroused. This doesn't discourage Oliver, who marries his foreign bride without ever having so much as kissed her. However, their relationship is doomed by Irina's inability to commit physically to Kent.The story's quite ridiculous when you think about it, but no more so than the b-movie horror movies put out by most of the Hollywood studios of the 1940s. The reason Val Lewton's Cat People outscores all others of its ilk is its rich atmosphere, fine acting (for its budget), intelligent script and creepy cinematography. It also contains a couple of truly unsettling scenes - both involving the stalking of Jane Randolph, who plays Kent's closest friend - that are today looked upon as the first of what became known in the industry as 'Lewton Buses' - apparently sinister moments of danger that turn out to be ostensibly benign.Simone Simon, as the cursed Serbian, provides the most moving portrayal; a victim of her heritage, she possesses a touching vulnerability that slowly mutates into something far more unstable as the pressures she places upon herself begin to take their toll on her mental health. Smith gives a solid, if workmanlike, performance as her worried (and ultimately very nervous) husband, while Tom Conway provides the obligatory psychobabble with typically suave aplomb. Tourneur's direction - dictated to some degree by budgetary limitations (so often the spark that lights the creative fire) - is tight and efficient while remaining sensitive to the diverging requirements of plot and budget, while DeWitt Bodeen's script finds masterful ways of circumventing production code restrictions that prevented his characters from openly discussing the real problem that's bugging Irina.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliantly Executed Film Teeming in Psychoanalytic Symbolism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cat People" follows Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon), a commercial artist who emigrated from Serbia. In America, she Oliver Reed (Kent Smith), who quickly marries her. All is not well for the newlyweds, however. Irena believes that she is descended from a line of satanic witches who, when struck by lust or jealousy, would transform into a panther and wreak havoc on those who have wronged them. Because of this, she and Oliver never consummate their marriage. Sexually and emotionally frustrated, Oliver turns to his friend and coworker Alice (Jane Randolph) for support, with whom he begins to grow increasingly intimate with (emotionally). Irena, suspecting that Oliver is having an affair with Alice, stops seeing her psychoanalyst, Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway), and stalks her husband and his supposed lover.As a horror movie, "Cat People" will undoubtedly disappoint the contemporary viewer. It's not nearly as stylized as earlier, more expressionistic films (such as "Nosferatu" (1922), "The Phantom of the Opera" (1925) and "Frankenstein" (1931)), nor is it as dark and violent as films that came out during and after the sixties (such as "Psycho" (1960), "Night of the Living Dead" (1968) and Halloween (1978)). It was produced following the PCA's strict censorship (of horror films in particular) and with director Jacques Tourneur's preference for suspenseful, suggestive horror (covert, rather than overt). One must dissociate it from its genre trappings in order to appreciate what kind of a film it really is."Cat People" is loaded with remarkably vivid symbolism and complimentary foreshadowing on a level that truly sets it apart from its cinematic compatriots. Phallic symbols abound within the film, particularly the statue of King John skewering a cat and Dr. Ludd's cane (which conceals the sword that he likewise penetrates Irena with when he attempts to rape her). These two foiling images (the draconian King stabbing a cat and the immoral doctor killing Irena in cat form) are brought together in Irena's dream of King John wielding a broadsword, fittingly also played by Tom COnway. In the opening scene of the film, Irena sketches a panther stabbed by a sword, which she promptly throws on the ground (which is the exact same place where she dies after being stabbed by Dr. Judd). After Irena begins to suspect an affair, she starts wearing a heavy fur coat, suggestion a half-transformation into a panther. Numerous more examples exist in the film, but if Rick Worland can write a 20 page case study on it and still leave some examples out, I won't even attempt to do so in this review.The writing and directly are so impressive that there are two radically different interpretations for the events of the film. The first is that Irena slept with Oliver the day that they met (as suggested by suggestive, flirtatious dialog between them at her apartment door followed by a fade to black in which the following scene is night, all the lights are off, and Oliver is relaxingly smoking a cigarette - an obvious visual euphemism for a sexual encounter). The religiously repressed Irena, guilt-stricken by her moral transgressions, tricks herself into believing her native Serbia's superstitions about cat people (and on-screen panther attacks could then be interpreted as her delusional perspective of what's going on). The second interpretation is that she really is a Cat Person and must repress her sexual identity in order to remain human (which, in turn, drives her husband into the arms of another woman, likewise opening the floodgates for Irena's sexual jealousy).In either scenario, the film is a powerful and brilliantly-executed depiction of a woman's repressed sexuality and the consequences for such fervent self-denial. Fans of werewolf and doppelganger tales will find this a brilliant and chilling addition to those sub-genres. Likewise, fans of symbolism, foreshadowing and deeply psychological films will find a singularly unique film to dissect and theorize about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A SUGGESTIVE, romantic horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film features an odd couple: An all-American marine engineer, Oliver (Smith) &amp; a superstitious Serbian-born fashion designer, Irena (Simon). Irena is convinced that she will transform into a panther if aroused to passion. Because of this; the couple has never indulged in sexual activity with one another which leads to Oliver falling for his assistant, Alice (Randolph). When it is revealed that Alice feels the same way about Oliver, jealousy is provoked within Irena. Now we will find out if Irena really is one of the Cat People! The plot is intriguing isn't it? I think it is. Maybe kind of silly...but intriguing. And original. And simple. Like the film. The film is simple yet effective. Very entertaining, too. However, their are some boring parts in Cat People. But the movie is too effective to let those flaws stand out. You see, Cat People is a romantic horror film. A SUGGESTIVE romantic horror film. What I mean is that the fright scenes never expose the villain until the final chapters of the picture. This technique works so much that it is the highlight of Cat People. And as far as acting goes, every actor &amp; actress does a fine job with the given dialogue, even the minor ones (typical for a B&amp;W (horror) motion picture) &amp; the direction is basically great-ditto the script...a slightly underrated gem this is.All in all, this is an effective little horror film. Pretty suggestive in the fright department which is a good thing but slightly underrated. TRIVIA: Cat People was followed by a sequel &amp; a loose remake RATING: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Birth of a Great Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Cat People because I've fallen in love with the work of Jacques Torneur: Out of the Past and Night of the Demon provided me with so many delights that I wanted to watch the movie that first brought recognition to Torneur. Although I think it pales immensely in comparison with these two, it is nevertheless an amazing exercise in creating atmosphere, rising tension, suspense and how to pull off a movie with very limited resources.The premise is pretty ridiculous: Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon) is a woman who descends from a line of people who can turn into cats. She marries and tries to lead a normal life, but anxiety over her secret causes marital problems that only distance her husband from her and into the arms of another woman. Jealousy is the catalyst to bring out the beast within Irena.One of the movie's qualities is that it's quite short: the story progresses at a fast-paced, economic rhythm, keeping in only the essential. It's a tight narrative, one of Torneur's best talents.What also makes the movie good is the way the crew got around the short budget. Many decades before Spielberg chose to imply the presence of a shark showing just a fin because the automated shark was rubbish, and making Jaws much more suspenseful than it would have been otherwise, there was director of photography Nicholas Musuraca (surely the most underrated DP ever) implying the presence of a leopard using but shadows cast against walls, and when it was present, hiding it in partial darkness.There's also a remarkable shot implying the cat's transformation into Irena by tracking bloody cat print on the sidewalk for a few seconds and next showing a bloody human footprint; it's a clear, effective transition. This is masterful visual storytelling! In terms of story and acting, I'm afraid I don't have much to say. It was efficient for the purposes of the movie, but frankly I was paying more attention to the visuals. This may not be Torneur's best movie, but it already shows the seeds of his talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil Psychic Vibes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a horror film, "Cat People" is rather tame. One could just as easily tag it as psychological thriller, in that fear and an overly active imagination create effective motivators.The lead character is a young woman with an elf-like face, named Irena (French actress Simone Simon), a sketch artist who lives alone, and is lonely. Along comes Oliver (Kent Smith), a man who falls in love with her. But Irena, while wanting a romantic relationship, is afraid. Her fear pertains to cats and to her past life in Serbia. The story's opening sequence includes cats, and throughout, there are references to cats of all kinds, from a harmless domestic kitten to large, menacing caged animals like leopards and panthers. Oddly, Irena relates psychologically to these animals, which take on a demonic connotation. It's as if the cats are evil, and they transfer their evil to Irena through psychic vibes.The film's B&amp;W lighting is quite effective. Many scenes use dim light and ghostly shadows to enhance suspense. In the film's second half, another character, a woman friend of Oliver, walks alone down a street. Someone is following her. This stalking sequence is chilling by way of sound effects, eerie lighting, and an absence of dialogue.Overall, this film explores people's fears and phobias. Its theme is the psychic need to put evil into the world, a theme not unlike the "monsters from the id" motif, in the sci-fi classic film "Forbidden Planet" (1956).The connection of cats with evil is unfortunate. But I guess no harm is done, given the fantasy nature of the story. This is a low-key film that shuns gore in favor of oblique suggestion and implication. It's an approach that will be welcomed by viewers who find contemporary in-your-face shock effects off-putting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done psychological thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 10/24/2008 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Jacques Tournear): Well done psychological thriller about a woman who believes she is haunted by her past to the point of being possessed by a cat. This is a very suttle horror film that doesn't really scare it's audience but entices them with hints about Simone Simon's character and what she will eventually become. Simon's acting is OK, but the main star here is the story and writing done by Dewitt Bodeem. He spins a tale that you want to follow to find out what eventually happens despite the "B" movie type that it is and the low budget used for the movie. There is obviously censorship at work that holds back what could have been a very risqué and sensual movie because the plot revolves around Simone denying sex to her husband for fear that she'll turn into a cat and kill him. This fear actually comes true later in the movie as she kisses and kills an unsuspecting victim. There is also a love triangle that complicates matters for Simon's character as her anger and jealousy brings out her cat claws as she stalks the third part of the triangle. Given all this, this is a very adult horror movie that uses subtlety and hints rather than real blood &amp; guts horror to entertain and entice you instead of what modern fair tends to do. Bravo for this well made entry into the psychological horror realm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irena Dubrovna : The original Catwoman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I said it before, I do love a good scare from a horror film; or just watch retro horror films. This is one of my favorite horror films from the 1940s, about a woman who is a werecat. A werecat is like a werewolf, only feline and with no full moon for transformation. And I am a cat-lover too. The film became a cult favorite to supernatural/horror fans, that there was a sequel maded in 1944 called The Curse of the Cat People.The film's story starts when naval construction designer Oliver Reed sees Serbian-born beauty Irena Dubrovna at a zoo, he flirts with her, and soon they fall in love and marry. Complications arise because Irena believes she is the victim of an ancient Serbian curse that causes her to turn into a panther if a man tries to make love to her,and the marriage is not consummated. Oliver sends Irena for treatment with psychiatrist Dr. Louis Judd, and Oliver seeks "consolation" with his colleague Alice Moore. Irena becomes jealous when she learns that she may be losing Oliver to Alice.As I said many times, I don't have a favorite scene, because I love the WHOLE film it is awesome. I recommended it for those who love classic films and a horror films - old and new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The right one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the trashy 1982 remake; this one satisfies even with its limited resources.For the lack of sophisticated effects and an obvious lo budget, the 1942 version is a sophisticated look into a superstitious view of the world that has much behind it -- a young woman obsessed with cats as reminders of an evil not completely disposed of in the Old Country (Serbia). The psychoanalytic angle makes sense without slipping into the usual jargon, and the script allows Irena to become what she most fears when strong passion of any kind overtakes her-- an evil that a national hero of Serbia, King John, couldn't quite drive out. Strong emotion of any kind brings out a "cat" in Irena, who at one point kills a canary much as a cat of any kind would if it gets the chance; reverting to her humanity, Irena regrets anything that she does when her feline nature emerges.This story reminds me much of werewolf literature, but instead of a man turning into a howling wolf (typically in neighboring Transylvania), a woman turns into a devious and stealthy cat. No, it's not the harmless Siamese cat that she rejects perhaps of a reminder of the animal that can take her over; it's a dangerous and destructive black panther.This is a horror story, but it is comparatively lacking in gore for the plot elements. It's too sophisticated for pre-teens to get, but unlike most horror movies, even some certifiably better, it's not going to brutalize the sensibilities of a child who sees this movie by accident. But whatever you do, do not take the dreadful 1982 remake, much less sophisticated and far more explicit, as a substitute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let your mind do the scaring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the comments already in place reflect my feelings about this film. It's representative of the genre of films that required the audience to participate in the "horror". Let's face it, there's nothing that can exceed the scary images or situations we can conjure in our minds. It's sad that this approach as been all but abandoned.I put Cat People and Invasion of the Body Snatchers at the top of my list in this approach to horror. Hitchcock, of course, is in another league. In Body Snatchers, critters from somewhere or other are replacing humans with their own kind by putting "pods" beside the beds at night, and the creature in the pod absorbs the body of the human overnight. It took me years before I could look at a collection of watermelons -- even in grocery stores -- and not think of them as pods. The director's approach required my participation which, in return, scared the hell out of me, even to the point of carrying it with me for years after I'd seen the film.I guess these comments are more along the line of telling a story on myself. The first horror double feature I ever saw was Frankenstein and Cat People. I was 11 or 12 at the time and thought I was quite the cool character. If I got scared at either film (which I did, especially Cat People) I was too cool to let it show. As my friend and I were walking home from the movies (having spent our bus fare on sweets) we heard a clatter from a house we were passing and then some loud and angry cat noises. My friend and I took off like we were shot from guns! He and I both went into an every person for themselves mode and ran all the way home. I ran into my home, locked the door and then ran up to my bedroom, put some furniture in front of my door and jumped under the covers. So much for being Mr.Cool! I hadn't any need for the gore in the second coming of Cat People. I didn't need to see an arm ripped off to be scared. Give me a film that gets me involved, not one that has to show me everything so I can turn my brain off. The 1942 version far exceeds the later version in delivering true horror. Why do you think the otherwise marginal Blair Witch Project did so well at the box office? We never actually saw the witch except in our own mind's eye. Let's have more "thinking people's" horror films. I'd like to be scared for real again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Produced by Val Lewton, directed by Jacques Tourneur. Unlike typical "horror" films with stiff-walking rubber monsters, etc., Lewton's films are psychologically based and use your imagination to more effectively fill in the intentional blanks. "Cat People" is increasingly tense, gorgeously photographed and lit, eerily calm most of the time, and just plain creepy in that "world is at war/paranoia/good vs evil way. It is not profound ? it is entertainment - but it IS stylish, moody, and in my mind (pun intended) much creepier than some man in a rubber lizard suit coming up out of the lake with outstretched arms and shuffling feet. Yawn. This one also uses animation for a dream sequence and dark, moving shadows before "things" happen? which, even then, are mainly left to your imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a fantasy (or even film-noir) than a horror film, "Cat People" is an otherworldly experience drenched in atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure if "Cat People" is the masterpiece that many other users and critics whose opinions I take seriously have made it out to be, but its still a horror classic. I'm partial to either "I Walked With a Zombie" or "Night of the Demon" as Jacques Tourneur's best horror film, but "Cat People" is still quite impressive. Some have commented on this being the first b-film. Thats an inaccurate statement, but its possibly the first b-film to be of value artistically. Its also probably one of the top five horror films of the 40s.Tourneur's direction is, as usual, the main component of what makes his films so successful. He effectively uses film noir techniques to conjure a fantasy atmosphere full of both dread and wonder. The film never becomes scary but is quite unnerving at moments. The dreamlike lighting and use of shadows is also superb. This is a film very heavy on style and overall feel. The film is very mysterious even though I wish that the studio hadn't entered in the panther shots so whether this was reality or all in Irena's mind was left up to the viewer ("Night of the Demon" was a similar situation). The acting is typical of the 40s and may seem awkward to modern day viewers, but Simone Simon turns in a stirring and otherworldly performance as the cat woman. Its a shame she didn't become a bigger star as a result. "Cat People" isn't perfect but is a classic and looks absolutely gorgeous. One of the best fantasy films ever made. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrifically Spooky Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Val Lewton takes the Universal Pictures horror film idea and brings it to RKO, with tremendously improved results."Cat People" is far superior to any of the horror offerings Universal dished up during the same time period. This superb chiller was helmed by Jacques Tourneur, director of what may have been the best film noir to emerge from the 1940s, "Out of the Past," and he brings the same dreamy atmosphere to this film that he did to that classic. "Cat People" sounds ridiculous on paper -- it's like a female version of "The Wolf Man," only set in the middle of New York City rather than rural England -- but it makes for a spooky movie. Simone Simon plays the Eastern European émigré who turns into a cat when her passions are aroused; and nothing arouses them more than the jealousy she feels toward her husband's female co-worker, with whom he falls in love when his chilly wife won't perform her wifely duties. The plot is a feminist's nightmare -- the idea of a female "cat fight" being taken to literal extremes -- but it's not to be taken so seriously. Indeed, the best scenes in the film are exactly those that show Simon stalking her female nemesis, first down a foggy, shadowy pathway in the dead of night, then in an apartment swimming pool. Tourneur shoots everything beautifully; he allows imaginative camera work to take the place of any sort of special effect, and hardly a frame of the movie goes by without an arresting image.Terrific stuff.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In The Cat People the issues that still reverberate in America today female empowerment,sex,violence,and isolation are displayed in a noir world. Irena Dubrovna in order to coexist with the humans must deny herself sexual satisfaction lest her inner beast destroys her partner and brings attention to herself. It is implied that she will find her true mate in the caged black panther since perhaps male werepanthers are rare or nonexistent. Alone in the human world in a foreign country she meets and attracts with her feline grace Oliver Reed and steps between a possible romance he has had with a female colleague.Because of her condition she fears to consummate her marriage a fact which doesn't concern her "sister" it seems who recognizes her at the wedding celebration held at the neighborhood restaurant. Reed tries to understand but can only hold out for so long until he and Alice his working partner rekindle their romance and Irina is sent to the care of the urbane Dr. Judd,Tom Conway doing his brother George Sanders proud,who may have practiced his charm on other attractive female patients,but he finds out too late this is no case of simpering upperclass girly neuroses he's dealing with. The violence inherent in Irina's nature is directed at her rival Alice, with sheep and Alice's bathrobe being the chief victims. All in all this belies its low budget origins and stands out as a class A movie horror or otherwise with its atmosphere of doomed self control,fear,and the lovely Simone Simon who would appear in another spooky drama THe Devil and Daniel Webster two years later</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CAT PEOPLE (Jacques Tourneur, 1942) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film in a series of 9 low-budget horror classics, produced by Val Lewton at RKO, manages to be effortlessly eerie: the curiously prophetic sketch; the scene in the pet shop; the 'cat woman' at the wedding party (played by Elizabeth Russell, who would eventually return for the sequel - THE CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE [1944] - but in a different role!); the bird's death at the hands of the doomed heroine (in which she goes from innocent playfulness to being ridden with guilt); the simple yet stunning hallucination sequence; the girl turning her frustration onto the sofa, tearing it with her fingernails as a cat would. Besides, the two major stalking sequences are still effective after several viewings - with the swimming-pool set-piece inspired by an incident in director Tourneur's own life; but so are the two scenes involving a genuinely prowling panther (the film, in fact, can be seen as an alternative take on the werewolf myth): mainly it's done suggestively - being, in essence, a study in sexual frigidity - and was intended to be happening all in the heroine's disturbed psyche (but commercial minds prevailed!). Other assets are to be found in De Witt Bodeen's smart dialogue and the thoughtful performances - suitably enigmatic yet enticing Simone Simon, likable Kent Smith, sexy but complex 'other woman' Jane Randolph (the film carries a subtle yet potent erotic subtext) and suavely shady Tom Conway.While we all love the coziness and the sheer entertainment value that the Universal horrors provide (particularly during their second coming), it's undeniably refreshing to be able to get a soupçon of intelligence along with the fun and the cheaply yet professionally-crafted atmosphere - Tourneur, here on his first significant assignment (and first great film), was assisted by legendary cameraman Nicholas Musuraca, resident RKO composer Roy Webb and editor Mark Robson (soon to be promoted to director under the aegis of Lewton himself!). In fact, having just gone through a number of Mexican horror films (and, particularly, trash like THE BRAINIAC [1962] and NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES [1969]), watching something like CAT PEOPLE couldn't fail to be an infinitely rewarding experience...and, though I was initially somewhat wary of having to go through the Val Lewton films in quick succession (since I had previously watched all but three of them a number of times), I began to look forward to experiencing them all over again - particularly with the wealth of supplements that Warners saw fit to shower their Box Set!The transfer, however, is disappointing - displaying as it does a surprising amount of damage! Greg Mank's Audio Commentary is quite good at exploring the symbolism throughout the film and detailing behind-the-scenes anecdotes, as well as biographical data for the cast and crew - though his clipped delivery does rather necessitate the listener's full attention (ditto for the few interventions by the film's late star Simone Simon, given her heavy accent)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of Suggestive Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strange woman sketches a black panther in a zoo and is soon engaged in conversation with a young man who finds her attractive. Soon the two marry, but problems shroud their newly found romance as the young woman, Irena, fears she is a cat woman - a person from Croatia that cannot kiss a man nor get too angry without turning into a cat and tearing the object of either affection into ribbons. While not blessed with the fastest pace around, Cat People does build to a very satisfying denouement because of solid Val Lewton production values and input, good acting, atmospheric music, and the great, roving, almost ethereal lens of director Jacques Tourneur. How much does Tourneur contribute to this film? Watch this then its sequel in the same night. Tourneur had nothing to do with the sequel. The evidence is overwhelming that all the suggestion, symbolic lighting, build-up of mood, etc... owe much of their being to Tourneur. I believe this is his best film, because the film is over-laden with so many strong, unforgettable scenes. The pet shop scene where Irena and Ollie(Kent Smith) walk into a pet shop only to upset every single animal. The pool scene is perhaps the most effective as Alice - the object of Irena's jealousy - played very nicely by Jane Randolph - is frightening, creepy, and beautiful at the same time as a woman treads in a pool having heard someone or something come into the area. The tension builds slowly as Tourneur does not reveal anything quickly - or at all. Shadows of the cat or of Irena or of some special object with special meaning are highlighted by a similar means. Tourneur does this kind of thing better than just about anyone. The casting is excellent all around: Simone Simon is lovely and has a dark, innocent quality about her. Smith and Randolph are believable as well, Tom Conway plays a doctor of dubious nature well and serves as the impetus to the wonderfully shot climatic scene. Cat People is a great horror film not for what it shows us but rather for what it suggests.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic of the forties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film is considered a grade B film it really shouldn't be. It's a classic film of the forties that was a box office hit. It's beautifully photographed, has interesting characters, the dialog is crisp and it's loaded with sexual symbolism.Director Jacques Tourneur's technique was to show little and leave a lot to the imagination. It works to great effect in this film. Simone Simon is a bride who fears she will turn into a panther whenever she gets sexual desires. As a result, her husband Kent Smith sleeps on the sofa. Tourneur manages to create a very eerie atmosphere and Simon's character is mysterious. Is she really changing into a panther or is it all in her mind? The film has two classic scenes: the stalking and the swimming pool. The DVD version shows this film in all its gorgeous cinematography. It's a shame that for so many years all that was available was the washed-out video version seen on late night TV.Simone Simon is adorable. She was a big star in Europe, came to Hollywood and did a few films and returned to Europe to finish a long, illustrious career. Try to see how many cat references are in the film, a testament to director Tournier's attention to symbolism. There is one scene that even today will make you jump. This is a film you can see multiple times and still enjoy. The film was produced by Val Lewton and if you like it you'll probably like most of his other films as well. Followed by the sequel Curse of the Cat People.</fullReview>

It doesn't make the movie confusing but it does make the movie a bit uneasy to watch at times. On the other hand there are some truly brilliant horror/thriller moments and scene's which alone makes the movie more then worth to watch."Cat People" is original, innovating and stylish with a wonderful atmosphere which makes the movie a must see for the classic horror movie fans.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Cat People' manages to be an interesting insight into the early 'classic' horror films! The film creates it's suspense through suggestion, with the use of darkness and shadows through lighting: creating an atmospheric look! The two scenes with Alice are the most interesting both visually and in creating suspense, but unfortunately the pacing of the film was quite slow, and the story was plain ludicrous and predictable!(minor spoilers) The character, Irene, was just plain irritating rather than mysterious and evil. There was still this innocence within her character and she could never quite explain how she knew about her so-called condition-it was just passed off as ancient folklore and myth! The story is filled with plot-holes such as the appearance of the the woman who calls Irena "sister" just to name one. For an old classic and a low-budget film, great use of lighting to create a 'film noir' look especially during the pool scene! Unfortunately there was no fear of the unknown for me, it would have been more suspenseful and mysterious if the audience didn't already know who was the 'cat person' from the beginning! There was simply no need to show Irena following Alice twice- that just wouldn't be done nowadays! I haven't seen the remake but I intend to see how the 80s version would be like!In general, 'Cat People' is not really very scary or well written, but it is an interesting and somewhat entertaining insight into old-school horror from the 40s. It beats some of the horror,suspense films that have been made recently! *** out of *****!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The basic plot: A beautiful and mysterious Serbian girl becomes married to a journalist , but has strange and insane fears of turning into a panther at extreme moments of passion . These can not be apprehended, and her husband falls for his office friend and partner, Alice. But Irayna gets angry when she suspects their affair.......The praise: A persuasive and visionary horror movie. The use of shadow and light, suggestion, restrained imagery and noise create a psychologically entertaining and convincing atmosphere, enhanced by a handful of carefully placed creepy moments. Some of the more famous ones are the pool sceneand the even more eerie " I'm being followed scene". Suspense toward the end. It will probably disappoint because it is rather overrated in fan circles as the "masterpiece " of the Lewton team........The flaws: ......and what weakens it from excellence is it's creaky script, dialogue and characters. This dates it structurally. Still a must-see, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neglected classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every so often there comes an artist who works in a disrespected genre, yet who has enough talent and vision to almost make that whole genre seem respectable; at least in his own takes on it. And, when two such artists get together, their synergy is even greater. Such was the fortuitous pairing of film producer Val Lewton (née Vladimir Leventin) and film director Jacques Tourneur, who double-handedly resurrected the RKO Radio Pictures film studio after the financial losses of the two artistically great but financially disastrous Orson Welles films they made: Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons. They did so by collaborating on a series of horror films that, while intended to rival the box office of the Universal monster film series, starring Frankenstein's monster, Count Dracula, the Wolfman, and others, were several cuts above those films in terms of maturity, sexuality, artistry, and depth.Their first film together was 1942's psychosexual film noir/horror classic Cat People, which became a critical and box office smash. Forty years later it was remade by Paul Schrader as a bad, silly, and sex-filled campy sendup starring Nastassia Kinski and Malcolm McDowell; but the original is still far superior, and one of the best horror films ever made, despite being made on a shoestring budget, with B film talent, in less than a month, with spare sets from leftover A films the studio was making.The tale is rather interesting, and more believable than other such horror films of the day, for the characters are all real people, who work and have real lives. They just don't take off on adventures at the drop of a hat. Also, Lewton and Tourneur were masters of suggesting horror, rather than showing it, for both knew that black and white photography was perfect for the netherworld they were to depict, and that the human mind could dredge up all sorts of horrors at the slightest prod, and even big budget films today cannot equal those monsters?. The film was so popular that it made over $4 million, after being produced for about $140,000- a nearly thirtyfold profit. Imagine a routine Hollywood horror film, with a budget of $40 million, and it would have to gross over a billion dollars to be as successful an investment. Two years later a sequel, The Curse Of the Cat People, was released. That film was the first directorial feature for Robert Wise, who would direct future classics like The Day The Earth Stood Still, West Side Story, The Sound Of Music, and The Andromeda Strain. It is also included on the Warner Brothers DVD of Cat People, along with its own commentary and features. The two films are part of a five disk, nine film (including one documentary on the works of Lewton) package called The Val Lewton Horror Collection, which has all the classics made between 1942 and 1946. The features for Cat People are a theatrical trailer and a commentary by horror film maven and historian Greg Mank. Mank gives a sterling commentary. Although scripted, it is concise, ebullient, informative, and punctuated with several interludes from a recorded phone conversation with Simon. Were all commentaries as good as this even the worst films would be enjoyable DVD experiences. The DVD print of the film, however, is solid, at best. There are several instances where spots and scratches are abundant.Of course, success breeds all sorts of ridiculous claims, such as bad critics who see Irena as a lesbian- thus her frigidity, the approach of the other cat woman at her wedding, and the stalking of Alice. Of course, the film's every frame undercuts such claims. But, the film is so good at letting people imbue scarier things into it than are seen- for Tourneur and Lewton know that the average viewer can scare themselves better than they could, that it's only natural that bad critics will read much more into it than is seen, as well.Cat People is a great treatise on human loneliness, for few film characters have ever been aloner than Irena Dubrovna; only Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle- another transplanted New Yorker with a violent streak and sexual problems, may surpass her. It also starts and ends with epigraphs, something that European arts films only picked up on later. The film's opening has a fictive quote from a supposed book by Dr. Judd, who apparently survived his seemingly fatal encounter with Irena (for the character- still played by Conway, shows up in the later Lewton film The Seventh Victim), and the film ends with a quote from John Donne's Holy Sonnet V. Yet, at its center is loneliness, and Simone Simon's eyes, vaguely feline as they are, are the perfect receptacles for that lack, and why the film can be watched over and again, and seen anew each time. With that fact in mind, it may have enough going for it that greatness as a pure film can be claimed, even outside of genre. I, for one, will watch it again to see if it does. So should you.</fullReview>

Simone Simon,(Irena Dubrovna Reed),"Temptation Harbour",'47, had a family history of being very closely connected to cats and in this film she portrays a woman who has very strange feelings and seems haunted all through out the film. Simone Simon gives a great performance and has a great supporting cast. Tom Conway,(Dr. Louis Judd),star of the "Falcon Films during the 1940's, tried to help Irene with her problem and fear of cats.

		<shortDescription>Cat People in Serbia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really profound movie ? and I never heard about it or Val Lewton until I started exploring the Internet. Thus does the future lead us to the past.Simone Simon is perfect as the cat-lady. The story is at pains to bring out what a kind and loving person she basically is, in contrast to the evil nature she might unwillingly have inherited. It would be too obvious to have a fierce woman turn into a fierce panther; it is much more provocative to have a sweet and gentle woman who changes against her will, and who hates herself for doing it. (We have all felt guilty at some time for giving way to our nastier impulses, and this movie captures the feeling brilliantly; notice how genuine is the moment of grief when she cries in the bath after a cat-evening.) This is the reason for the softness of her acting, not any lack of dramatic ability. Note also how this softness conveys also a feline quality, unconsciously there at every moment she is on screen. And her uncomprehending gringo husband is just right too; an angrier character would have turned the story into conventional melodrama, not the complex exposition of character that we see before us. As one critic said, the result is more tragic than frightening; but it makes for great drama.HISTORICAL NOTES: The legend of the Mamelukes and the cat-people told by Irena should be compared with the past and present of Serbia and vicinity (especially Bosnia, which used to be part of Serbia in the Middle Ages). Bosnia was the home of a pacifist Christian sect called Bogomils, much persecuted and demonised by the orthodox church; horrible stories were manufactured about their deviant ways, as was done to heretics in western Europe. They converted to Islam after the Turks conquered the area.You can see how the legend might grow out of orthodox propaganda against the nonconformists, accusing them of witchcraft and turning into monsters; more vulnerable members of the sect might come to believe themselves if isolated and exposed to indoctrination.Ah, but what about this business of eating a man who kisses you, so central to the story? Consider the horrible atrocities so frequent in the recent Bosnian war, and reflect that such things must have happened often in the history of the region. Those who survived such horrors must have had their personalities greatly changed; frigidity and unpredictable violence would be natural consequences, even as they are now, and the church would have blamed this on witchcraft. Irena's story becomes all the more poignant in light of recent history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Cat People, average American guy Oliver (Kent Smith) falls in love with the mysterious Irena (Simone Simon), a Serbian woman he met in a zoo, where she was drawing the big cats next to their cage. They start dating, and she is too keen on telling him ancient legends and curses from her home country, that tells that once a certain woman loses her virginity, she will turn into a panther. He initially gives no importance to these legends. But birds do seem to fear Irena. Eventually they marry. But when Irena finds out that Oliver is flirting with one of his coworkers, Alice (Jane Randolph), her true nature will come into the open. Nicely filmed, with the terror more suggested than seen (the scene in the swimming pool is a minor classic), it only fails in the silly psychiatric angle (then in vogue in much of the world). I haven't seen the remake from 1982, but given the mediocrity of Hollywood film-making during the 1980s, I have no doubts in my mind that it is a much inferior movie. There is also a sequel, the Curse of the Cat People from 1944, which doesn't have to do much with the original movie, but which is a very fine film in its own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*The Picture* Great little picture, nice and short, mysterious and evocative for an early 40's picture. Interesting concept, only a bit of stilted dialogue early on (mainly due to Joe American's inability to act). Direction and cinematography are superb. Bit corny in first twenty minutes, but from then on its gold!*Highlights* *There's an electric scene forty five minutes in where one woman is following another down a dark street, passing from darkness into streetlights, and we follow the women's feet from one to the other - holey moley! *Incredible dream sequence *swimming pool scene! *Simone Simon's bare back sitting in the bath. *Gorgeous close-ups of a panther. *lighting scheme in the night scenes in the office.*Cast* Mr Joe American "I've just never been unhappy," is a fairly two-dimensional character, but Kent Smith is still unconvincing and tries his best to spoil the mood. In fact, the rest of the picture is great - only the scenes he's sort of let it down.Playing Alice is lovely, busty actress Jane Randolph you won't seen in hardly anything else - but she's wonderful to watch at least here. She looks stunning in a nipply swimming costume at one point.Luminous beauty Simone Simon was never lovelier than in Renoir's Human Beast, but seeing her here is lovely too. She delivers her performance in a subtly cat-like drawl which seems to have been the influence on Michellie Pfieffer's catwoman in Batman Returns. This is the role that Simon is best known for in the US (though she should be better known for her sensual lead in The Human Beast, one of Renoir's best films).*Music* A nice haunting theme every now and then, but this is balanced by a terrible piece of corny music that accompanies the happy dialogue scenes between Simon Simon and husband. Overall, average.*Subtext* The picture has a sort of subtext about foreigners: it mixes French and American styles of the time. The film looks French (purity of images and painting-like compositions were popularised by Renoir in France), and has an exotic subject very un-Hollywood, yet it sounds American, and has those corny scenes between husbands and wife early on... which are only there to be upset very quickly...Tourneur is a French filmmaker, but he's working in Hollywood with American actors. His counterpart in the picture is lovely Simone Simon from Renoir's The Human Beast. All this becomes relevant when the story is about a woman from Serbia newly arrived in the US, who makes her "first friend" in America, and marries the american - so the film is about the difficulty in marrying French and US cultures.An interesting sidenote: this was made at RKO studios, the famous studio who gave Orson Welles carte blanche for Citizen Kane, and then had trouble with his Magnificent Ambersons (which is still a magnificent picture!). It is well known that in RKO pictures of the period, you can see the famous staircase from Welles' Ambersons. Cat People, made in the same year, is one of them: that same staircase is the main structure of Irena Dubrovna's house.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my God, I just love it when a film overwhelms me after the first viewing. I think I have a new favorite movie because only a very limited amount of films left such a first impression on me than this Cat People. The story of Cat People is well written, extremely fascinating and intelligent?it handles about a young woman who emigrated from Serbia. She fled from her home country because she couldn't bear to live on with the legend of her town anymore. Young attractive women are believed to be pure evil there, slowly metamorphosing into the Cat People. She finds love in America but even her dedicated husband can't help her get over her fear and frigid sexuality. Cat People is much more than just a frightening and suspenseful tale?the depressing love story and the sober psychological background makes it a class example of the perfect Film Noir. But it doesn't stop there! The status of this production is taken up to an even higher level thanks to the superb acting performance of Simone Simon. The wondrous angel takes your breath away every time she appears on the screen?Her timid and na?ve character steals your heart right away and she completely sucks up all your attention. All put together very professionally by director Tordeur (Curse of the Demon), Cat People is a must see for every fan of cinema?and now I'm just strictly mentioning the entertainment values of Cat People.The film is unique for multiple other reasons as well. It can easily be considered as the very FIRST B-movie ever! The first in a immortal series produced by Val Lewton. After Cat People, the road was open for several more traditional and elaborated fables like The Leopard Man, The Body Snatcher and I walked with a Zombie. Despite all the ?milestone'-characteristics, Cat People still is extremely underrated and not appreciated like it deserves to be. I'd say even more, historically spoken, this is a very essential and important film! How many titles can claim that they were a direct inspiration for the Alfred ?the Master of Suspense' Hitchcock himself?? I recently re-watched The Birds, and I can come to no other conclusion that the pet store sequence in Cat People stood as a model for a similar scene in Hitchcock's classic. In case you're not convinced yet: in my eyes, this is pure cinema perfection. Art like they could only create it in the black and white era. Straight to the point, chilling set pieces and an unbearable ? yet irresistible ? and petrifying atmosphere!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb Man &amp; the Catwoman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why this is considered to be such a classic. Cinematography is beautiful but the characters and the plot are so stupid that I don't believe I ever care to see this again. There are a couple of nicely suspenseful scenes but the characters are rather dull (even the much praised Catwoman). Almost any old "noirish" crime film contains much more atmosphere, suspense and shocks than Cat People. What kind of a man marries a woman who doesn't even let him kiss her?? And who does not even TRY to claim his rights as a husband (this was made in 1940's folks!) just calmly turns to another woman? Cat People is a movie that has certain historical value but it's really not that great to watch this time and age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Metaphoric Suspenseful Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the naval construction designer Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) meets the Serbian Irena Dubrovna Reed (Simone Simon) in the zoo, he flirts with her and they sooner fall in love and marry each other. However, Irena is afraid of an ancient course of her town that women can not be touched by a man, otherwise she will transform in a panther, and the couple does not consummate their marriage. Irena is sent for treatment with the psychiatrist Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway), while Oliver looks for "consolation" with his colleague Alice Moore (Jane Randolph). When Irena sees that she is losing Oliver to Alice, she becomes jealous and hateful, leading to a tragic end."Cat People" is a metaphoric suspenseful classic, where the viewer has to "read" between the subtle lines of the narrative. In accordance with the curse, Irena can not "kiss" a man, of course meaning that she can not make love with men, otherwise she will unleash a wild animal. The encounters of Oliver with Alice are not explicit but obvious: he is not allowed to have sex with his wife, so he has with his coworker and friend. Dr. Louis certainly rapes Irena in the end, maybe seduced with her beauty along the sessions. The black and white cinematography is very beautiful. Although criticized by many critics, I like also Paul Schrader's 1982 version of "Cat People", which is exactly the opposite of this original film: very explicit, showing an erotic, sexy and violent story. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Cat People"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't expect horror films to scare me because they generally don't, so a horror film either has to have something else in it to really attract me or has to do something new to be interesting. The approach of this movie is no longer new, but it was new at the time. Thus I didn't really know if it would be dated or not, it was a toss-up over whether I'd enjoy it (especially since despite it's low-budget and small production, it still is pretty serious about what it's trying to do).But it's really good. Again, I wouldn't say I was scared by it because movies don't scare me, but I could see how this movie could really freak out an audience unaware of what to expect. One of the key things is that despite all of the publicity it has about being entirely psychological and having the horror occur offscreen, it still feels very real and experienced.It helps that Simone Simon is just a very creepy woman. But generally this is a very successful film for what it was trying to do, and for that I do consider it a classic.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a true suspense experience. Filmed in the noir format, the use of black and shadows, is enough to make the goose-bumps come out! What amazes me is this movie is from the early 40's, but it still holds up. The scene in the pool at night...? YIKES!!! If you like old black/white scare flicks ...peep this one! Afraid of the dark? Well watch this one (at night)with the lights out!And keep your eye on the family cat. Trust me! ...Hey, you never know!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When an American falls in love with a Serbian immigrant who tells him of an ancient curse on her family, he refuses to believe in her stories of supernatural enchantments. Later, when his relationship turns sour and he falls in love with somebody else, he realises that he might be wrong after all...That's the basic plot of this Val Lewton-produced horror film directed by Jacques Tourneur, who later went on to direct one of my favourite horror films of all time ? 1957's superlative NIGHT OF THE DEMON. CAT PEOPLE, like the rest of the Lewton-made horrors in the 1940s, is an understated and atmospheric mystery that works to develop a spell-bindingly sinister theme rather than relying on aged horror stars or on-screen shocks.Indeed, many of the well-remembered set-pieces in this movie: the bit in the swimming baths, or the long walk down a lonely lane ? don't actually show anything at all, but work thanks to murky, shifting shadows and the well-timed interlude of a sudden loud noise. It's a masterclass in mood, with the technicians at the top of their game.The story itself is rather slight and lacking in incident, and it's fair to say that the film has dated somewhat as the years have gone by. Still, it's worth a look for those interested in how the horror genre has developed over the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relies on your imagination to create the horror...still one of the best Val Lewton films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever shortcomings it has, and however dated some of the dialog and situations are, 'The Cat People' does what the radio programs of the '40s did to create suspense--leaving it up to the viewer's imagination to fill in the details. The crisp black and white photography makes clever use of shadows and lighting to create a mood for the strange story--and the fright scenes are well placed for maximum effect. Because of the dialog and slow pacing, it is a film rooted in its 1940s era of filmmaking. But don't get me wrong. It's far superior to 1982's garish color remake that featured graphic displays of blood and violence.An especially interesting moment occurs early in the film when a woman with a distinctly feline look approaches the heroine and mumbling a phrase in another language addresses her as "Sister" -- eerily suggesting she recognizes her as one of her own kind. It's a shivery moment in a film full of subtle terror. Touches like this are what make 'The Cat People' as absorbing as it is. My chief complaint is that Simone Simon delivers some of her dialog in a whisper. Her softspoken voice, combined with the French accent, make some of her more important lines unintelligible. A good dialogue director should have recognized her deficiency. Kent Smith is appealing as the man (who, by the way, falls in love a little too quickly for credibility)--and Jane Randolph is excellent as his co-worker who is later stalked by a cat-like creature. The swimming pool scene and the lone walk along the park still stand out as scenes of subtle horror. She rivals Fay Wray in the scream department. Tom Conway, sounding a good deal like George Sanders (his brother), is good as the psychiatrist who makes the fatal mistake of falling for his patient.Let your imagination roam and you'll enjoy this one. Definitely one of Val Lewton's best during his RKO period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard of this film all my live but never seen it - or its so/called sequel - until now, and all the things I've heard about it were positive so it was perhaps inevitable that seeing it for the first time in 2013, some 70 years after its initial release, my eye would be drawn to the flaws rather than the triumphs. I found it unrealistic if not bizarre, for example, that a man who turns out to be an architect would have either the time or inclination to hang around a zoo; then the zoo itself is something of a joke, consisting solely of a cage housing a panther. Okay, it was early forties (not one mention of the War from beginning to end) but would a young, single girl, invite a strange man into her apartment within minutes of meeting him, and isn't the apartment a tad opulent for a young immigrant. And so it goes on right until the climax, a direct 'steal' from Eugene O'Neill's 'The Hairy Ape'. Having said that the psychological rather than in-your-face horror would have been really effective at the time and the film is still well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>63/100. I have never understood the huge appeal to this film. It's not a bad film at all, but I thought it was just a bit too hokey. Anyone who follows my reviews know I love the classics, but I just don't get it with Cat People. The cast is fine, it has a good atmosphere. Great cinematography and the lighting is extraordinary, decent pacing, but for me it just does not have that "wow" factor. Jacques Tournier's direction is good, but it just isn't a great film. I just thought it was a bit to silly to really work on a classic level. The performances are okay, but a bit bland. It does create an amazing atmosphere. Simone Simon has the look, but her acting is merely adequate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great at setting a scary mood, but also a rather silly plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie had been given higher production values (such as "A-list" actors and a large budget), I might have scored it a 7. However, given the film's very modest budget and pretensions, it was an extremely effective film.The movie stars the French actress Simone Simone as a strange Serbian woman who falls for nice-guy Kent Smith. While she is quite cute and pretty, she is also a woman who is either mentally ill or fated to be cursed to turn into a leopard when she is jealous or sexually intimate! Through much of the film, the director and writers did an excellent job of keeping the exact nature of Simone's problem uncertain--you never really knew for sure what's going on until about the last 10 minutes of the film.The actors all did a fine job. Simone and Smith were very good, as were Tom Conaway (George Sanders' older brother, by the way) and Jane Randolph. For second-string actors, they all proved quite capable. The writing, direction and camera work were also excellent--proving that smaller budgets CAN still result in great films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original "cat" woman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cat People (1942) was the original film that was made forty years later into a sleazy remake filled with more issues than Time magazine. But that was the revamped version. This is the original horror film filled with many expressionism influenced imagery and film noir overtones. The story line is the same (except the bizarre sets, coked up fantasies and gratuitous sex &amp;nudity). A young woman from Eastern Europe comes to America to fulfill her career. She meets a nice man who falls for her. But she also has a woman on the side who likes him as well. The young lady has many strange quirks. Does she have a hidden past? Why can't she walk into a pet store? Who was that strange feline looking woman whom calls her "Hemana"? To find out the answer to all of the questions I raised you'll just have to watch the original CAT PEOPLE.This film is more old school horror. It's stylish and it was filmed on a low budget. I wished the remake would have retained some of the story line in it. But Paul Schrader was diving head first into the nose candy and it screwed with his better judgment.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be very good despite the slow plot. One must remember the limited special effects available in 1942. The cast and scenery make this an enjoyable classic. Simon Simon's bathtub scene is pretty racy for 1942 and Jane Randolph's swim in a basement pool to avoid being attacked by "The Cat People" is possibly the most suspenseful part in the movie. Be sure to listen for the Doctor's comment about the "Silver Bullet". The doctor seems to have feeling for his patient. Does Simon's accent remind you of "Green Acres" when she says "Oliver Darling". Although this is not one of my favorite movies of all time I still enjoyed watching it and I hope you enjoy it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Credit where it's due</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do Americans always refer to this movie as a Val Lewton movie? Are you afraid to admit that the creative genius behind it was a European called Tourneur? I mean, he directed it and his signature which was furthermore illustrated by brilliant works like "I walked with a zombie" and "Out of the past" should be enough to give the man credit where it's due. Having said this, the movie is a masterpiece of understatement and subtlety, always creating the fear and anxieties where they count: in the viewer's mind. The absolutely stunning use of light, a trademark of Tourneur, creates a spellbinding athmosphere that never lets the viewer off the hook (just think of the brilliant swimming pool scene). Tourneur's hand makes this movie the masterpiece it is: it's first and foremost a visual movie, dialogue plays a definite and very distant second role. In any other person's hand, for the sake of argument let's call him Paul Schrader, the movie would have been standard horror fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I probably need to see it again to understand why it is such a "revoltionary" and classic film. Basically naval construction designer Oliver 'Ollie' Reed (Kent Smith) meets Serbian Irena Dubrovna Reed (Simone Simon) in the zoo, and not long after flirting fall in love and get hitched. However, she Irena is afraid to be touched by a man, otherwise she will turn into a black panther, so they do not consummate the marriage. Irena is sent for treatment with psychiatrist Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway), while Ollie looks for "consolation" with colleague Alice Moore (Jane Randolph). Irena sees she is losing Ollie to Alice, and becomes jealous and hateful, leading to her turning into a panther, and a "tragic ending". Also starring Jack Holt as The Commodore. I can see what the critics mean about manipulating "fear" through shadow and suggestion, and a couple of moments where the camera looks away (like that ear cutting scene in Reservoir Dogs), but I still need to see it again. A sequel, The Curse of the Cat People followed in 1944. It was number 94 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Good!</fullReview>
