		<shortDescription>Brilliant film, but should not be thought of as a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After looking for years for his long lost sister, Irena Gallier (Nastassja Kinski), Paul (Malcolm McDowell) finally finds her and has her come to New Orleans, where he's currently living. While there, she gradually discovers the truth about their bizarre past and falls for a zoo curator.First, a caveat. Director Paul Schrader, in his interview on the Cat People DVD, says that he regrets that he didn't just change the name of the film to remove some of the perception that this is a remake of Jacques Tourneur's Cat People from 1942. It is wrong to look at this as a remake. Aside from mostly superficial similarities, Schrader's Cat People really has little to do with the original--no more in common than, say, The Grudge (2004) and The Ring (2002), assuming that "Kayako" from The Grudge would have been named "Samara" instead, or no more similar than any two random vampire films. Irena's first name is the same, there are similarities in her background story and what she is, she visits a zoo, she falls in love with a man with the same first name of "Oliver", and there are maybe two and a half scenes similar to Tourneur's film. That's it. Yes, I'm a fan of Tourneur's film, too--it's my favorite out of his collaborations with producer Val Lewton. But you have to forget about Tourneur's film when watching this one. This is a remarkable work of cinematic art in its own right, with its own story and goals.Schrader's Cat People deserves a 10 on visual terms alone. The cinematography, production design and lighting are nothing short of genius throughout the film. Almost every shot is one that deserves to be paused and studied. Director of photography John Bailey never ceases to find interesting perspectives, angles and tracking. The sets are elaborate and exquisitely constructed for visual impact. In conjunction with the lighting, the film is mired in a rich, varied palette of colors similar to (and as good as) Dario Argento's best work.Of course the film is more graphic than Tourneur's--it would be almost impossible for it not to be, both in terms of blood/gore and nudity, and all of that is shot brilliantly as well. The only cinematic instance of blood that I can think of that is as effective as the scene in this film where blood runs by Irena's shoes and down a drain is the shower scene from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). The event leading up to this image has more impact of most similar scenes, as well. The copious amounts of nudity throughout the film are never gratuitous (not that I have anything against gratuitous nudity, mind you), but always interestingly blocked, with some grander artistic purpose. These scenes range from creating juxtapositions between prurient voyeurism and horror, to surrender to and (sometimes perverse) domination of animality, to interior psychological conflicts--just look at the ingenious placement of a window frames during a full frontal nudity shot in Oliver's "swamp cabin".The music--both the score and the incidental songs, are just as good. Most of it is an eerie, synthesized score by Giorgio Moroder. It often approaches the tasty moodiness of Brian Eno's excellent work with David Bowie (Low, Heroes, Lodger), which is perhaps ironic in light of the fact that Bowie contributed a great song for the closing credits. The limited incidental music--such as Jimmy Hughes' "Why Not Tonight?" during the cab ride to the zoo--fits the mood of the film perfectly.Of course, the film isn't all just visuals and music. There's an intriguing, surreal story here, and great performances from a seemingly odd combination of actors--ranging from Kinski and McDowell to Ed Begley, Jr. and John Laroquette. Setting the film in New Orleans was an inspired choice, as it allowed for eerie voodoo-weirdness ala Angel Heart (1987) and moody swamp vistas ala Down By Law (1986) to seep into the already creepy story. Setting the more dreamlike imagery in a desert (albeit a studio-created desert) also helped draw me into the film, as there is probably no environment I find more aesthetically captivating.I first saw Cat People as a teen during its theatrical run. I didn't like it near as much then, and that fact caused me to put off re-watching it for a number of years. I think at that time, the film may have been too slow for me, I may not have understood it very well, and I certainly didn't have the visual and overall aesthetic appreciation that I currently have. Now, I think it's a masterpiece--perhaps one of the better films of the 1980s. It's worth checking out at least once, and if you've seen it awhile ago and think you didn't like it so well, it's worth giving a second chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sex, Violence, Silliness, and an Emerging Cult Favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In general terms, the basic premise of both original 1942 CAT PEOPLE and the 1982 Paul Schrader remake are the same: an exotic European beauty is given to transforming into a black panther when sexually aroused. But Schrader unravels this fantasy concept in some very overtly Freudian directions, setting his version in against the decadent charm of New Orleans, introducing a theme of incest, and ramping up the original with a lot of nudity, a lot of sex, and some of the most graphic violence around. The result is an American blood-and-gore horror film with a hypnotic European sensibility that equates both sexual frustration and orgasm with violent death.The story line concerns two orphaned siblings (Natasha Kinski and Malcom McDowell) who are reunited in New Orleans as adults--but they are, unbeknownst to the sister, the descendants of a mutant race who can only mate with their own kind without transforming into ravening beasts who must then kill to regain their human form. When sister Natasha rejects her brother's advances and then falls in love with a hunky zoo director all hell breaks loose.In some respects the film is extremely, extremely frustrating, often sliding over the edge from a sexually provocative shocker into moments of annoying silliness--but on the whole it works extremely well as a both a sexual fantasy and a semi-camp statement in gratuitous sex and violence. Kinski is ideally cast as the sexy but virginal Irena; you can literally see the "cat" side of her nature emerge more and more as the film progresses. McDowell is equally interesting as her mad brother, and John Heard, Annette O'Toole, and particularly Ruby Dee offer excellent performances in the supporting cast. The New Orleans backdrop is extremely effective, and (speaking as one who has been there) the darker side of the city is perfectly captured; the Moroder score--which includes some sultry vocals by David Bowie--is also extremely good.A great many people will loathe CAT PEOPLE, and the reasons will be diverse. The film is extremely bloody, often to a can-you-stand-to-look-at-the-screen degree; there is tremendous nudity and considerably sexual activity; and the combination of sex and violence into a sadomasochistic eroticism is quite disturbing. Beyond this, more critically inclined viewers may find themselves annoyed by the script's silliness and the fact that it does not always go as far over the top as it leads you to expect, and certainly the film's very literal depiction of fantasy elements will not be to every taste. But if you have a hunger to walk on the wild side, CAT PEOPLE (which is rapidly gaining status as a cult film) will suit your need as guilty pleasure.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Good as the Original, but Still Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many horror films, `Cat People' has at its centre an inherently absurd concept. The central characters, Irena and Paul, are brother and sister and the descendants of a long line of human/animal hybrids. In their normal form, they are human, but they turn into black panthers whenever they have sex with a normal person (but not when they have sex with one of their own kind). After such a transformation, they can only revert to human form by killing.Absurdity, however, is not always a bad thing in the context of horror films; indeed, the success or failure of such films frequently depends upon the director's ability to persuade his audience to believe six impossible things before breakfast. Once the ground-rules have been laid down, they have to be developed with strict logic; if this is done convincingly enough, the audience can overlook the fact that those rules are implausible or even impossible. In `Cat People' this is largely achieved. At the start of the film, Irena is an innocent girl, still a virgin and unaware of her true nature. Paul, by contrast, is well aware of the truth, and has no compunction about killing to regain human form after his many promiscuous sexual encounters. Irena finds out the truth about herself after she moves to live with Paul in New Orleans. He proposes that they should have an incestuous relationship as this would mean they were free to indulge themselves sexually without transforming. Irena, however, recoils from the idea of incest, and falls in love with Oliver, a curator at the local zoo.`Cat People' reminded me of another early eighties horror film, Tony Scott's `The Hunger'. Both are frankly erotic, both have an absurd concept at their core, and both are shot in a self-consciously stylish manner reminiscent of a pop video, aiming for a deliberately aesthetic look. (Another link is that David Bowie, who starred in `The Hunger', sings the song at the end of `Cat People' as the final credits are playing). `Cat People', however, is in my view the better film, precisely because it remains true to the rules inherent in its central concept whereas `The Hunger' does not. To take an example, Catherine Deneuve's character in that film is supposed to be ageless and immortal, yet nevertheless dies at the end. `Cat People' can develop its basic concept without departing from it. Moreover, it develops the idea in such a way as to arouse sympathy for the characters, or at least for Irena. She is confronted with an essentially tragic dilemma; she must either resign herself to a life without the man whom she loves and without any possibility of sexual love, or else become a killer. She is aware of this dilemma, and her conscience is troubled by it. As a result, we find that she is a character with whom we can identify, even though she is only half-human. In `The Hunger', by contrast, the vampires played by Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie have absolutely no conscience about killing in order to feed, and therefore seem more alien.As she showed in `Tess', Nastassja Kinski has a great ability to suggest a disturbing mixture of innocence and sensuality, and this was much in evidence in `Cat People'. While the film is not on the same level as Polanski's, and does not test her as an actress to the same degree, it probably shows off her beauty to even greater effect. With her lithe, slim figure, her piercing gaze and her short, dark hair, she seems physically perfect for the role of Irena. It would be difficult to think of another actress who could have suggested the feline side of her nature more convincingly. Malcolm McDowell, as Paul, showed that he is much practised in the art of combining the charming with the sinister. John Heard gave a more stolid performance as Oliver, but this was not necessarily a fault; the intention could have been to contrast the safe, conventional Oliver with the dangerous but fascinating Paul.The film is not as good as the Jacques Tourneur original from 1942, lacking the earlier film's ability to convey mood and emotion through suggestion and nuance. Schrader's film is much more direct and less subtle, but nevertheless it is still worth watching. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great erotic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cat People" is one of those movies that, by all rights, shouldn't be shown on network TV. That's not a comment on quality; it's one of the best erotic thrillers ever made (next to "The Hunger"). But when you have a movie where, for the last half hour, the female lead is mostly undressed ... how can you *show* the last half of the movie?Very simply stated, they *don't* show it. I tried to watch Cat People on USA or some other network one night, and the last half hour had been cut down to about five minutes and made absolutely no sense. Worse, I was watching it with someone who had never seen it before, and when it was over, she was thoroughly confused and unimpressed.So, number one: See this movie, if you haven't already! And number two, when you do ... rent or buy the video, or catch a revival on one of the premium cable channels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm a cat person...and I liked "Cat People"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Joe D'Amato's "Buried Alive," this remake of "Cat People" is technically a love story with a tough horror exterior. Both aspects of these genres fit quite well to create an unconventional entertainment. The movie gets especially high mileage out of two inspired leads--Nastassia Kinski as the young, attractive virgin (she also looks like a more predatory version of Isabella Rossellini); and Malcolm McDowell, who still glows with all the playful malevolence he brought to "A Clockwork Orange," as her brother, who morphs into a panther when sexually aroused. In spite of an ill-defined supporting cast, Paul Schrader's assured direction, the bizarre script (by "Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things" star Alan Ormsby), those lush New Orleans locations, and the chemistry between Kinski and McDowell keep "Cat People" afloat. It's a sexually charged horror story told with a straight face, and it works.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** Paul Schrader's remake of the 1942 horror classic "Cat People" this time set in New Orleans La. not in New York City. Irena Gallier, Nastassja Kinski, comes to live with her older brother Paul, Malcolm McDowell, in the hot and sweltering southern city. Feeling for the first time in her life wanted Irena was orphaned at the age of four when her parents killed themselves. She spent her formidable years in and out of orphanages and it wasn't until her brother tracked her down that she fond a home of her own in Louisiana. It turns out later in the movie that what Paul wants from her is more then what Irena is willing to give him. Nastassja Kinski in one of her most sexiest roles is both seductive and innocent as Irena and gives the film the electricity that keeps the movie going even though the cast has trouble keeping up with her performance at times. Malcolm McDowell is both creepy and unnerving as Irena's older brother Paul who's like a Tom-Cat in heat during the entire movie having no trouble getting women for his sexual pleasures. Paul also ends up murdering them because of his submerged animal instincts that those affairs bring to the surface. John Heard, Oliver Yates, is very good as the zoo curator and Irena's frustrated lover who Irena, who loves him, avoids having an affair with Oliver in order not to be forced to kill him. Annette O'Toole, Alice Perrin, is also very good in a small but important role as Oliver's co-worker in the New Orleans Zoo. Alice later becomes the focus of Irena's jealousy and resentment for being the woman who's standing between Oliver and her. The movie recreates a number of scenes from the 1942 version with the cat-like woman coming up to Irena at a bar, in the first film it was at Irena's wedding party, and greets her in a foreign language calling her "My sister" or, what it obviously meant, fellow cat person. There's also the classic indoor swimming pool scene with Alice. This time around with Alice being topless which of course she couldn't have been in the 1942 version due to the censorship of nude scenes by the Hollywood Watchdog Hayes Commision. Alice taking a swim in the indoor swimming pool has the lights suddenly shut off and what seemed to be some kind of big cat in the shadows hounding her in the dark. Unlike the original movie the new version of "Cat People" has a number of extremely gory scenes that are really shocking. With the black leopard in the movie who both Irena and Paul turn into being so horrific and terrifying that he makes the villains in horror/slashers movies today look as scary as Pee Wee Herman in comparison. With his eerie green eyes and ferocious and deadly fangs and claws you just cringe with fear every time the big cat comes on the screen. There's a blood splattered sequence where the enraged leopard grabs the zoo-keeper's Joe Creigh's, Ed Bagley Jr, arm between the bars of his cage. The sight of the big cat, who was really Paul, going wild when as saw Joe together with Irena, his sister, was one of the most terrifying scenes I've even seen in a motion picture. Joe foolishly tried to settle the leopard down with an electric prong as the dangerous feline suddenly and cat-like grabbed and ripped Joe's arm off with the ease as if it was attached to his body with just a rubber band. The frighting thing about the leopard's actions is that, unlike the killers in most horror films, it was so realistic knowing that a big dangerous jungle cat like that can do that in real life just like in the movies. Even though Paul Schrader's "Cat People" doesn't in any way measure up to the original the ending was more interesting and innovative with Irena not being killed and Oliver ending up together with her instead of leaving Irena for Alice like Oliver did in the 1942 movie. In the end of the movie we see that Oliver finally accepts Irena for what she is with the knowledge that the only way he can be with her is between the bars that separate them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>on its own terms it's 'moody', creepy, and also campy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What made Paul Schrader tackle this production I'm not sure. In a year when John Carpenter was doing his rendition of the short story, not even entirely so much the film, of The Thing, Schrader and his screenwriter decided to go back to the source of one of those stories no one really reads but pretends they have when in reality it's the original film everyone remembers. But this is an opposite case of Carpenters: where the original The Thing was, arguably, not really the masterpiece everyone remembers (albeit influential), the remake truly was. Jacques Tourner and Val Lewton crafted one of those quintessential horror films that scares precisely because how little we see of the actual panther on camera, while Schrader's film, actually, isn't a masterpiece of horror, not quite close at all really. And it's not even because Schrader decided to show the cat on screen, many times over (maybe it's a leopard, they look similar but it's closer to panther to me).No, it's a different film due to permissiveness of the time period (it's the 80s vs the 40s, so this time we get plenty of nudity, "bad" language, and the Giorgio Moroder musical accompaniment which has dated pretty terribly), and with its subject matter being far more based on the romantic than in the original film. It's a strange effort this Cat People, where incest even comes into question (or rather it's right out in the open, at least between the two parties), the look and feel of New Orleans and the Bayou becomes another character, and the characterizations become enhanced by the mere presence of Malcolm McDowell's inimitable face and Nastassja Kinski's irrepressible sexual charisma on camera. Not to say she can't act, since she can hold her own very well even when she's seemingly doing not much except walking naked through a field at night or, um, walking naked in a room or, you know, not naked in a swimming pool.How much is actually taken from the original Tourner film or the short story I really can't say for certain. The pool scene is the only one I can recall specifically lifted from the original (and, not too sorry to say, 42 for the win on that one). But comparisons can get too petty in this instance, perhaps, since Schrader's goal is to analyze the characters in this setting, what sex and desire and the psychology of a were-cat does to a person, or to people who realize what they're capable of, as opposed to just simple horror. Schrader's direction has some genuine moments of thrill, or just plain artistic satisfaction, like a not-so simple composition of a tracking shot of one of the hookers walking along on a street at night at her foot level. I'm even reminded of De Palma, whom Schrader worked with once before.But at the same time, for all of the versatility of the actors, and the occasional moments of surreal imagination, there's also much camp as well (Ed Begley's character's fate for example) and a few really cheesy parts or just scenes that don't work or, perhaps, are too saddled with a need to push the button of sex on film. It's a hot number that works well, more or less, and would take a deeper analysis to dissect than I can give it right now. It's respectable, at the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schrader remake - on fire, with gasoline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Erotic thriller with Nastassja Kinski starring as a young female who's gone searching for her own, inner self. In many ways a remake of the 1942 original, but also in many ways not a remake - a film that stands its own ground, this has a quality of sexual awakening and excitement that the original didn't have. Fabulous music by Giorgio Moroder (also featured is David Bowie's hit-single "Putting Out the Fire") accompanies many of the bloody and sexually occupied scenes that hammers on like they belonged in a artsy-fartsy porn flick. Kinskis performance at the center is typically her: odd, tactless, awkward, outlandish and sensual - in other words, highly enjoyable. She's fantastically beautiful, and she moves through a New Orleans during the fall, shot by John Bailey. And even though the level of thrills ain't always sky-high, the film has a charm and atmosphere that makes it a interesting, stylish and sexy cult picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nastassja Kinski in a feline fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This '80s film is more of a love story than a horror although it does have a few fairly horrific scenes in, in particular a rather graphic scene where a zoo worker has his arm ripped off by a black panther.The film opens in the prehistoric past with a girl being tied to a tree and left for a big cat... the action then moves the the present day where a beautiful young woman called Irena arrives in New Orleans and is met by her brother Paul who she hasn't seen since their parents died when she was a child. The next night her brother disappears around the same time a panther mauls a prostitute in a seedy hotel, this creature is captured and taken to the local zoo.Irena goes looking for her brother but can't find him so decides to do some sightseeing and ends up at the zoo where she seems drawn the the recently captured panther which she starts to sketch, in fact she is so engrossed that she is still there an hour after the zoo closes. When Oliver, the zoo's curator, finds her there they end up going out for a meal of oysters together and she is offered a job in the zoo's gift shop. Her first day at work doesn't end well though as she witnesses one of the zoo workers being killed by the panther, and when Oliver arrives to put it down the panther has escaped. Once home she finds that her brother has returned, he explains their families strange heritage; that they are part panther and whenever they have sex with a person they become a panther and can't be human again until they have killed a person. He also tells her that the only exception to this is if they do it with another of their kind and as they are the last too that means incest. Irena is horrified at this and flees, bumping in to the police outside, they search the house's basement and find human remains they assume that Paul has been feeding people to a big cat rather than being the cat himself.Oliver takes Irena to his house out of town which can only be reached by boat, here she starts to feel more in touch with nature and goes out at night, removes her nightdress and prowls around naked till she finds and kills a rabbit. On their return to the city her brother kills again, this time however he is trapped as a panther and killed, when Oliver performs a post mortem on the creature something rather strange occurs.When Oliver's colleague Alice is out running she has a feeling she is being followed. Later when she goes for a swim she hears a strange growling and is scared when Irena enters as if she somehow knows she is dangerous. Later Irena sleeps with Oliver and as predicted becomes a panther in an impressive transformation scene. She does not however kill him, instead she leaves him but she is cornered by the police on a bridge, when Oliver arrives she jumps from the bridge into the river. Oliver heads back to his river side home and finds a friend dead in a tree and Irena at the house. I won't spoil the actual ending although.The film is pretty good and the effects have aged well, it is good to see such scenes as the transformation done with makeup and prosthetics that than CGI. There is a fair amount of nudity in the film, some scenes like Irena walking around naked can be justified as it shows she is behaving in an animal rather than a human way others such as Alice swimming topless seem to be there just to show off Annette O'Toole's admittedly nice breasts.The acting was good, especially Nastassja Kinski's portrayal of Irena which was positivity feline and switched from an innocent to a predator believably through the course of the film. While this film is by no means perfect I'd certainly recommend it to fans of "creature features" or Nastassja Kinski.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Channeling A Sexual Beast: 80s Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite having been young, semi-conscious (I was under five years old) and possessing few actual memories of the nineteen eighties, the decade has a certain personal eroticism for me. The powdery skin, shimmering camera-work, the outrageous kink and camp of the clothing, the archetypal section of dim-minded actresses performing with the joyful vacant-eyed faces of children: these all stir my heart. The film Cat People was a smarter film when compared to too much of the artistic output of the nineteen eighties but it also suffered from the strangeness of the times. First of all, Nastassja Kinski has a sublime beauty that would attract in any decade but was especially characteristic of ideal notions of sexiness for those years. Her eyebrow were that exquisite Madonna-esquire thick, her lips in a permanent state of partial openness with full-on pout, her hair cut to that boyish cute, and her shoulder pads speaking volumes about her feminine authority. Even her cat-like demeanor, connected to the premise of the film, was equivalent to popular depictions of women as sex kittens. In essence, her performances in the film can be interpreted as one of the finest expressions of the nineteen eighties soft-lit, softcore pornographic aesthetic.Secondly, as a horror film, it managed to offer moments of decent creepiness in the vein of the times. Fear, of course, has been a universal and timeless emotion yet it can be provoked in a manner reflective of the era. The Germans of centuries ago used grim and blood-spattered folk tales to frighten, director Paul Schrader used shadow. Shadows were such a magnificent aspect of the nineteen eighties aesthetic because their perfect in lockstep with the soft-lit light (consider the Vogue video). Schrader employed shadows in an eerie manner that kept the viewer guessing, achieving what few horror directors actual get from their audiences: fearful concern about what was in the dark. Consider two scenes: when Malcolm McDowell lunges from the shadows as the beast and when Nastassja Kinski has a passion moment in that darkened room. Schrader brilliance was to make the shadow both fearful and erotic: the dark has been traditional as fear-provoker and yet can be quite intimate as well. In mixing the two emotions successfully, Schrader made the film a unique creature for the horror genre.Third, that soundtrack Giorgio Moroder and Bowie crafted must be one of the strangest in the history of film. Starting off on a campy note, the music over the reddish desert of the first scene ought to make a person either laugh or weep but it does get better. Listen to it; it goes with the images on screen like magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a highly charged, visual, erotic feast that transcends the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Cat People," Nastassja Kinski indelibly seared her erotic image into the American male psyche. There is no American actress today who would dare take her role in this film. "Cat People" is a landmark film that has never been equaled. Paul Schrader, the director, made this movie his own, turning the original movie upside down. That effort has withstood the test of time that is nearing twenty years and still counting. The film has a visual style that is stunning. Without Nastassja, this film fails. Beginning with a demure, vulnerable character in Irena Gallier, Nastassja transforms herself into a smoldering film presence that spontaneously erupts and torches the screen. With the lone exception of Ruby Dee, none of the supporting cast is capable of withstanding Nastassja's considerable presence, meaning that their character portrayals are quickly forgotten - an effect that separates her from most actresses and is an all too real hazard for most actors appearing in her films. Notorious? Infamous? However one puts it, Nastassja redefined eroticism on screen with not one of today's actresses ever coming close. It is a legendary performance that knows no peer within its genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under-appreciated treat in the '82 film bumper crop...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...director Paul "Blue Collar" Schrader's "Cat People" is a mostly successful revamp of the Val Lewton 1942 classic, thanks to a sexually charged script by Alan "Dead of Night" Ormsby (tweaked by Schrader), solid performances from a well-chosen cast, fine production design from a lot of Schrader regulars, and excellent cinematography and lighting by John "Groundhog Day" Bailey (another regular Schrader collaborator). The plot centers primarily on the turmoil of female sexual awakening in the personage of Nastassja "Tess" Kinski, freshly immigrated to New Orleans in search of her brother, Paul (Malcolm "A Clockwork Orange" McDowell). What she discovers is ultimately not to her liking, as it turns out she can never consummate a love affair without turning into a big cat and then killing someone (typically the lover) in order to revert to human form. Unless she sticks with incest. Bummer for her.Despite decent critical reception, "Cat People" tanked at the box office, possibly from an ill-timed release date, early spring not being the ideal time for a slick exploitation horror film, no matter its pedigree, and never mind its perversity. It has since maintained a healthy reputation on video, for good reasons: choice nudity, ample gore, flashes of humor ("Top Cat"), and a compelling story with very few "oh, c'mons" that trades on unsettling fears of and fascinations with female empowerment. If I have any real complaints storywise, they would center on the somewhat murky parameters of the transformation from human to big cat (is it volitional, are there specific triggers?) as well as certain questions concerning Irena's ultimate willingness to suffer a submissive fate. But these are small quibbles that don't seriously impinge upon the core story. Kinski and McDowell sell their characters beautifully, while John "Home Alone" Heard and Annette "Smallville" O'Toole are strong foils heading up a support cast that includes Ruby "The Stand" Dee and Schrader favorite Ed "St. Elsewhere" Begley, Jr.Eminently entertaining (and no doubt multiply so for Kinski and/or O'Toole droolers), "Cat People" is near the top of my list of horror movies that might actually deserve another retelling with the right actors and an improved script. Still, Schrader's version is certainly recommended to genre fans everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cat's Meow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the 1940's classic, is the cat's meow, literally, especially with beautiful Nastassja Kinski in the starring role! She has one problem though, when she gets sexually aroused, she becomes...well...lets just say, a tad feral.Malcolm McDowell, as Nastassja's brother, always had a penchant for bizarre films &amp; roles, this is no different, as he wants to mate &amp; be mated to his sister for life. This is because their both of the same affliction, sexual arousal causes them to change, to kill, to become a cat! A BIG cat! The only way for them to have sex, &amp; have their partner survive it, is to be an incestuous pair. Though this will repulse people, it makes sense in the film, for our morals don't apply here, &amp; this makes for a unique film of surrealism, as Nastassja spurns her brother for another. The idea of incest repulses her too, but maybe for different reasons than normal. A portrait, a metaphor, of a young beautiful woman coming to grips with her growing sexuality."The Cat People" is not for everyone, but those of you that are, will know it, as soon as the cat scratches you! The ending scene is as profound as they come!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most erotic horror films I have ever seen. Cat people who mate with their own kind is typical, but suppose one of them decides to go outside her kind and just want to find romance and not save her species from extinction. The two cat people are orphans and they want to mate with each other because there are no others around. Irena(Nastassja Kinski) and brother Paul(Malcom McDowell) are the last of the breed who follows the way of their kind. Paul on the other hand venture on the hunt and is later found in the city zoo. in panther mode. Irena finds a human mate, and is smitten by him. The brother disapproves, and decides to have him killed. Well he did kill one of the keepers in the zoo by tearing off him arm and he bleeds to death. He really did more damage when he called up a call girl and and attacked her in cat mode. This movie has a lot to go by, the erotica, the mood, the intensity, and the humor this movie got to offer. It's a real keeper in my book. Tired of werewolves or vampires? "Cat People" is for you! 4 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sex in the 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cat People (1982)This is an archetype erotic film with the beautiful Nastassja Kinski as the sexually conflicted Irena Gallier, Malcolm McDowell as her brother, Paul Gallier, and John Heard as Oliver Yates, her would-be lover. This is not a remake of the 1942 version; it has the basic premise of a woman in conflict, but the sexuality is not sublimated and there are no shadows to hide the gory effects. In this movie, the panther is real, and the forbidden fruit was created specifically to be eaten raw.The reversal of the taboo from the 1942 version is a reflection of the year 1982. In 1982, Irena makes love as a woman, then is transformed into a black leopard. To regain her human form, she must kill someone. There is backstory, of course. Paul fills her in on the story (she was adopted and has no idea; she's still a virgin). He has spent his post-pubescence having sex with prostitutes, then killing them to change back to Paul. Paul tells Irena that as fellow cat people, they can have sex with each other without the change taking place - Irena is repulsed, but Paul tells her their parents were brother and sister living as husband and wife. It's either sex with each other or sex and murder. What a difference in movie outlook in forty years.Kinski burns up the screen with her sexuality, and Heard is no slouch, either. As cat people, Paul and Irena have superhuman strength, making impossible leaps to escape when hunted. Director Paul Schrader makes excellent use of their lithe muscularity and grace in the special effects. And he makes the best use of a window frame I've seen, separating two would-be lovers with a riveting view.In 1982, psychology is out and sex is in. Unlike the 1942 original, here there is no sublimation. Irena's refusal to mate with Oliver is not based on Old World superstition and morality. Instead we have the foreshadowing of lethal sex, a year after the discovery of GRID. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Alan Ormsby (writer of this version of Cat People) has not obscured the real issue in the shadows as DeWitt Bodeen did in 1942. Sex (and bodies) are out in the open in 1982. In the 1942 version, Irena's problem was dismissed as superstition, but here the problem is an established fact: If Paul and Irena have sexual intercourse, they will turn into panthers until they kill; the exception is mating (as Paul puts it) with each other - in that event, all is well. Paul has accepted this situation and has turned to prostitutes for his gratification, killing them after the sex. Paul has the only line with any compassion in the entire movie: Don't make the mistake of having sex with someone you love - let me warn you away from _that_ disaster, he tells Irena.Otherwise the film is devoid of any real human feelings. Oliver loses two friends to death by panther, and he's unfazed by both, curiously dead to their loss. Death is just a way to advance the plot, not a human tragedy to be mourned. Because of the lack of feelings, we feel no chill when Oliver assures Alice he knows what he's doing, although we the audience know he has no clue.Ormsby is incapable of condensing his plot points into a reasonable time and more nearly clear meanings. Oliver and Irena drive a long way out of town, then row a long way to a secluded house occupied by Oliver's friend, for no apparent reason until near the end when we have the aha! moment and realize the friend was needed for the panther to kill. The opening of the movie is a silent sequence that makes no sense at all and takes way too long. Later, Paul and Irena visit that same set again in a dream sequence, and Paul explains what we were shown - without his voice over, we had no clue. Either the first dream sequence should have made sense or it should have been eliminated and only the second dream sequence shown.Taken with the erotic themes and views, Kinski, McDowell, and Heard rise enough above the script to make the film worth watching. An interesting thing I noticed is how much alike McDowell and Kinski looked in the film - not like brother and sister, but _alike_. Paul discloses to Irena that their parents were brother and sister, so there's one reason, but the other is more chilling: Paul has sex and kills his partner, and Irena must do the same unless she chooses her brother as her mate. They are _alike_. There was a great deal of potential in "Cat People" quite apart from the original screenplay, but it is not fully realized. The human component is necessary and missing here. We're left with an erotic thrill but no catharsis over Irena's choice of freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Immediately Giorgio Moroder's score captures you in the darkness with its sensual rhythms, then Schrader entices us into a labyrinthine journey of sex and death seen through the eyes of the dark &amp; beautiful Irena (Kinski). Her brother Paul, played by a Malcom McDowell welcomes Irena to New Orleans ( a perfect location for this erotic &amp; fetishistic tale ) dressed as a priest, this is their first 'reunion' since infancy &amp; orphanage. Paul takes her home and introduces her to his housekeeper Female (played by the great Ruby Dee). Their joy is short lived, as Paul's incestuous overtures are rebuffed by an innocent Irena and his disappearance coincides with a visit by the police to investigate Paul's possible involvement in a 'ritualistic' murder involving a panther. Female is arrested as a possible accomplice to Paul's crimes. In jail, she advices Irena to 'not love' and 'pretend the world is what men believe it to be'. Irena is quickly taken in by Oliver ( John Heard ), curator of the New Orleans Zoo, after he startles her sketching a recently captured black panther. Irena settles into a life working at the zoo and begins a relationship with Oliver, much to the dismay of Alice ( Annette O'Toole ), ostensibly Oliver's love interest until Irena's arrival. Paul resurfaces after a tragic attack by the panther on a zoo keeper (played by Ed Begley, Jr.) in front of Irena, Alice &amp; Oliver. Paul's presence is now menacing and his previous advances are now violent and threatening. He tells Irena that 'only she can save him': by being with him as they are like their parents- brother &amp; sister and of an ancient and incestuous race, unable to mate with only their own kind, lest they transform-returning to human form only after killing. Schrader captures the dark, sensual and moody atmosphere of the New Orleans night with this tale of occult, sex, blood &amp; lycanthropy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Paul Schrader, I don't think you are a brilliant director or anything. But The Cat People had a lot going for it. You set it in a really interesting place like New Orleans. The architecture, heat, people, the food and the culture of the place are a big part of this horror film. You had two beautiful women in Natasjja Kinski and Anette O Toole. Malcolm McDowell is never boring. And good job filming that leopard. It looked sinister and evil. You packed the film with thrills and some great camera angles. You were working on a pretty big budget and it showed. The film was quite provocative with themes of incest and well ..... mating between leopards and humans. But I hated the scenes from the medieval era. They belonged in a low budget music video. While David Bowie's score was great, it did not really suit the place the film was located in. The film could have used a tighter editorial hand. It was really long at two hours. Some of the scenes went on and on. What was up with that? And some of the supporting actors and bit players were completely unremarkable. Nonetheless, this is a very entertaining erotic thriller. I don't think anyone would have the balls to make a film like this today. Best regards, Pimpin. (7.5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kinski steals the show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Schrader's version of Cat People is a movie that I've heard of, but never seen. After reading some of the reviews of the movie, I've decided to see on my own for the first time. I must say that I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this movie because a lot of people who have seen it compared it to the original 1942 Val Lewton picture from RKO. Well, I was very impressed by this version of Cat People and I must say that it's a exceptionally well made, well acted psychological horror film.Irena, (Nastassja Kinski), arrives in New Orleans, visiting her brother, Paul, (Malcolm McDowell), for the first time. As the movie begins, Schrader sets up the movie very well. Hundreds of years ago, the feline group of mysterious people, called the Cat People, have the ability to change into a black leopard after mating. Unknowable to Irena, Paul starts to develop a incestuous feeling toward her as in one scene, which is, one of the best scenes in the movie, he stalks her while she sleeps in his house for the first time.Soon enough, Irena is given a job at the local zoo in New Orleans by Oliver Yates, (John Heard). Yates soon starts a relationship with Irena after he witnesses her watching a black leopard, roaming around its cage, milling for food. Irena doesn't tell Oliver about her family secret. Instead, the movie gets even better when Heard and Kinski start a relationship between the two while McDowell takes a turn of the worse, using his cat-like instinct to kill and prey on women, living in New Orleans. Almost some of Paul Schrader's films walk a tightrope between sexual tensions. He never back away from that particular theme in Cat People. Schrader, as you may know, written the screenplay for Taxi Driver and also directed two feature films, Hardcore, which shares some of the same elements in this film and American Gigolo. His films are quite daring, but nevertheless, interesting and engaging.Some people might look at this movie as a sleazy exploitation horror film. But, to the tell you the truth, it is not. This is a very good looking movie, with great cinematography, showcasing many colorful sets and sights in New Orleans. Some of the scenes are quite suspenseful, almost ranking up there with the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. The imagery that is used in this movie are very well shot and photographed. One scene that sums it up at all up is when Kinski witnesses a leopard, tearing out a zookeeper's arm. What makes that scene work is that Schrader cuts that with a shot of a pool of blood, running through Kinski's shoes and into a drain in the floor of the zoo. That's very well done, indeed. You can almost feel the darkness and mystery of the picture itself, thanks to the superb music score by Giorgio Moroder.Nastassja Kinski, I think, steals the movie, away from John Heard and Malcolm McDowell. She is one of the most interesting and mysterious actresses I've ever seen. She provides the movie with a spice of eroticism that lights up the scenes. You can't talk your eyes off of her nor ignore her. She is really something in this movie. Unlike so many other female characters in horror movies, she gives Irena a mind of her own when she develops sexual feeling toward the two completely different men. That's very daring for a actress to do in the movies.Cat People is a very scary horror film that's very well made by Paul Schrader and also scored very effectively by Giorgio Moroder. An very good movie for adults to see. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 1/2 3 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visually Stunning But Emotionally Hollow Erotic Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though widely regarded as one of the finest horror films ever made, the original "Cat People", released in 1942, always struck me as a visual masterpiece luminous to the eyes but cold to the touch. It liked to hide in the shadows, keep its menace restrained, its mood gothically opulent; but when it placed fear directly in our line of vision it forgot to match emotionally, emitting a shallow kind of dread felt more cerebrally than physically. Horror should pump in our veins, causing us to look over our shoulder the second the film closes. Yet despite being called a horror film time and time again, I've never much considered "Cat People" to be one. Instead, I've figured it to be a grotesque fantasy of bloodlust and erotica, inventively packaged but too empty to make much of a lasting impression.Its remake, a 1982 fear-fest directed by Paul Schrader and starring Nastassja Kinski, is similar in its ability to optically arouse but remain intrinsically hollow. Whereas 1942's "Cat People" stimulated our sights with hypnotizing darkness and noir-tinged doom, the 1982 version conversely stupefies with its richly saturated colors and sexual heat. The original had a small budget to work with, director Jacques Tourneur and cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca perhaps accidentally making things visually unmistakable for the purpose of making up for monetary deficiencies. But Schrader, given larger financial opportunity, is able to work on a much larger scale, providing us with a more plentiful plot, more ocular risks, more enigmatic intrigue. I can hardly say if it's superior to its '42 counterpart ? they hardly resemble one another, one restrained, one indulgent ? but "Cat People" is an artistically formidable fantasy mostly worthwhile. If its overwhelming inability to do anything besides look great wasn't such a pressing issue, it could be considered a masterpiece.But the storyline doesn't allow us to become emotionally invested; conceptually marvelous yet unmistakably outlandish, it is difficult to do anything besides stare, mouth agape, unable to grab onto anything happening on the screen. Because it has to do with The Cat People, a race of centuries past so far evolved that, as of 1982, they resemble sexy humans who literally have an animal deep inside them. But things aren't as simple as they used to be: years ago, when The Cat People were still dominant cats that laboriously reclined on tree branches in windy red deserts (shown in the form of a prologue), mating would come in the form of a female sacrifice from a nearby village. Now, though, the race is almost completely extinct, save for Irena (Nastassja Kinski) and her brother, Paul (Malcolm McDowell).In the first few minutes of "Cat People", the two are meeting for the very first time ? and while the impish Irena, sensuous but virginal, remains an innocent figurehead, Paul makes for a more sinister presence, not because he's a Shakespearean villain in the making but because he's more aware of his heritage than Irena is. In everyday life, The Cat People look like anybody walking down the street; but when in the throes of an orgasm, they transform from sexy human to black panther, killing their human mate in the process. Paul understands his threat to society and isn't afraid to utilize it; Irena, on the other hand, is afraid to unleash the beast that resides within her. The anxiety comes to a head, however, when she falls into the life of Oliver Yates (John Heard), a mild-mannered zookeeper who instantaneously bills her as the woman of his dreams. With her sexual nightmares looming in the background (and not to mention her brother, who wants to embark on an incestuous relationship like all Cat People before them), Irena just might have to accept who she is ? at a price.The plot is less preposterous the less you think about it; this is, after all, the kind of film that thrives on eccentric chills that trickle down the spine, expecting us to come along for the dangerous ride and forget about any sort of question we might have. Thanks to Schrader's knowing handling of the material (he treats most of "Cat People" like an erotic art house picture, which is more fitting than something akin to a more conventional horror movie), the film doesn't face many concerns when it comes to structure. The problem with "Cat People" is its futile characterizations, which allows for interesting characters more fascinating to look at than to actually care about. Irena is fearful for what will become of her, but because the screenplay is more interested in giving Kinski ample opportunity to smolder, never is the impression quite made; Paul is maleficent, but it's unclear where his villainy will go. And Oliver, taking over Kent Smith's role from the original, is drawn out blandly. The actors are all lensed brilliantly ? it's a shame they all remain so one- dimensional than even the more erotic elements of "Cat People" are slightly unexciting.But when John Bailey's cinematography isn't seducing our eyes, Kinski makes for the best thing about the film. A better actress than Simone Simon, she makes it impossible for us not to look at her; her full lips, sphinxy eyes, and Audrey Hepburn-like demeanor makes her a lithe sex object far too knowing to be exploited ? she is magnificent. And for the most part, so is "Cat People". But it's so devoid of any kind of emotional interior that any sort of reaction is kept hidden. Fear? Arousal? Allure? It all wants to be there, but "Cat People" remains a devastatingly beautiful film without a heart.</fullReview>

Irena is drawn to the leopard at the zoo and befriends Dr. Yates.This remakes a 40s horror that is honestly a bit boring and slow to me. What director Paul Schrader does is to elevate the eroticism and the visceral horror. Ed Begley Jr. getting his arm ripped off is classic. Kinski has great exoticism. Heard is a solid lead and O'Toole is a great girl-next-door. The swimming pool scene was a classic in the original and continues to be a great scene in this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cat People" came out in 1982 and is a modern take on the 1942 version.There's something about this flick that makes it engrossing. It has style and pizazz. For instance, the flashback scenes of the ancient panther tribe doing rituals in an orange desert are surreal and captivating; the accompanying atmospheric music adds to the mood nicely.Nastassja Kinski and Malcolm McDowell are siblings cursed to become were-panthers if sexually aroused. The only way they can become human again is to kill a fellow human. The idea is absurd and fantastical, but "Cat People" takes the subject absolutely seriously. John Heard plays a zoo manager who falls in love with Kinski, while Annette O'Toole plays the third person in the romantic triangle.The casting is great. Both Kinski and McDowell are properly cat-like. McDowell has a fittingly weird and diabolic air about him. John Heard is fine and O'Toole is simply gorgeous.If nudity offends you then you might want to skip this one as many of the characters are shown totally nude or near nude.Kinski is indeed quite attractive (be on the lookout for the scene of her fishing with Heard in hot pants and wader boots) but I'm a bit perplexed by Heard's decision to drop O'Toole for Kinski. Check it out and see if you share my confusion; pay particular attention to the pool sequence.One thing I don't get about the story is that it is established that cat people can only safely have sex with other cat people; therefore because Kinski and McDowell are the only cat people left they can only have sexual relations with each other (shudder). The problem is that it is revealed that other cat people DO exist as Kinski obviously runs into another cat person in the diner. If there are other cat people out there why would McDowell insist on having incestuous relations with his sister? Is he just a sick bastage or am I giving this too much thought?Keep in mind that this is indeed a horror flick and it can be pretty brutal at times.GRADE: B+ or A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worst remakes are those that do not bother with doing anything interesting with the source material. Shot-for-shot remakes are the most unnecessary and annoying, but others that stick too much to the formula that made the original film successful are also not to my liking. Paul Schrader's 1982 effort "Cat People", the first film in Schrader's body of work as a director that was not written or co-written by him (at least not officially), is, regardless of whether or not it works for you, an interesting film. It is interesting in that it is its own film, entirely different to Jacques Tourneur's excellent 1942 film. It builds on and expands the mythology present in the 1942 version of the story, and that is in itself worthy of praise to me."Cat People" features plenty of inexplicable shifts in tone and some pretty awful dialogue, but none of that could matter less in a film this wildly entertaining. The wacky mythology behind the film, the almost unbelievably sincere-feeling performances (which feel out of place, almost, in something as crazy and ludicrous as this film), the convincing and entertaining gore moments that pop up out of nowhere, and just about everything else make "Cat People" a must-see film, no matter how far-removed it is from the 1942 film.If possible, completely forget about Tourneur's film when watching this. It's not like you need the frame of reference, this is an entirely different sort of film. On a technical level both films are solid but I might have to give the advantage to Schrader's work as director. It's confident, stylish, creative, and helps the film move at a fast pace. The earlier film had a much better script, however."Cat People" is a confusing film. It is tremendously entertaining, but it is also essentially a film with the mythology of an epic fantasy (an X-rated one) that is also a collection of successive contrivances to set up scenes featuring excessive nudity and gore. Schrader, by his own admission, was too stoned on one day of the filming to come out of his trailer. Let's just say that definitely shows in the end result here, not because Schrader's work is bad or sloppy, but because it really begs the question: "what on earth were they on?" The answer here appears to be just marijuana. The music here is excellent. The early 80's synthesizer music is used very effectively here and David Bowie's contribution is among his best songs."Cat People" is downright idiotic in places. It also obviously has no intention of being high art (although I'm sure many would argue it is), which means it is really just massively entertaining trash with a very sexy and pretty solid lead performance from Kinski. One thing you cannot accuse this film of being is boring. It simply isn't boring in the least, not for one second. If you're allergic to contrived instances of perverse sexuality and bizarre violence, don't bother with this film. If you aren't, "Cat People" is worth seeing, although I'm still not sure what to make of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of Classic Film Not Surprisingly Falls Short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irena Gallier (Nastassja Kinski) has not seen her brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell) since childhood. When she shows up to visit him in New Orleans, she's shocked to find he's a total pervert that tries to make it with her. Paul tells her that they are the last two members of a race of cat people and have to mate with each other. Sex with humans causes them to transform into panthers.Remake of 1942 classic has none of what made the original work so well. It clubs the Lewtonian approach of ambiguity and psychological horror to death. There is no doubt lingering over the plot. We know the cat people are real. We see them transform. The remake repeats some of the memorable scenes from the original, but offers new elements of its own. I can appreciate that, at least. I hate shot-for-shot remakes. Unfortunately, none of the repeated scenes here are equal to the original, let alone improved upon. This film lacks any of the eerie atmosphere of the original. What it does have is breasteses. Lots of them. Very nice ones too. It's a much more explicit film with T&amp;A and gore. This should come as no surprise given Paul Schrader is the director.Judging Cat People (1982) on its own merits is difficult if you have seen the original. This is always the case when a seminal film is remade. However, I believe a fair assessment is that it's a watchable though uneven werewolf (werecat?) movie. Kinski is attractive though not a patch on Simone Simon. McDowell does fine. John Heard and Annette O'Toole are good. O'Toole's naked as a jaybird in one scene, for those who are taking notes. David Bowie's title song is memorable. Ultimately, it's worth seeing once though certainly no classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Purrrrrrrfect But Hypnotizing None The Less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, I couldn't resist making a pun. All bad jokes aside however, 1982's re imagining of "Cat People" is a pretty entertaining erotic thriller that borrows the general concept from the original '42 version but manages to stand as its own film. Set in the seemly magical city of New Orleans, it all begins when Irena Gallier (the stunning Nastassja Kinski) arrives in town to meet her long lost brother, Paul (Malcolm McDowell with his usual devilish charm). But the happy family reunion doesn't go as planned as she soon discovers that she and her brother are members of an ancient line of cat people who transform into larger than normal black panthers when excited or sexually aroused and can only mate with one of their own, that being Paul. As you can imagine, this comes as quite a shock to Irena who comes to realize that she cannot make love to kindly zoo keeper Oliver Yates (John Heard, the father from "Home Alone") without the possibility of killing him. The film does a very admirable job of bringing the old story into the 80's while injecting it with a certain erocticism and dream like quality that the '42 version probably was not allowed to do. Part of this infusion comes from Nastassja Kinski's seductive charm who, with her catlike eyes and vulnerability, would be enough to entice any man (it also helps that the producers could show Ms. Kinski without clothes in a good many scenes). But it's also the over all direction of the film by Paul Schrader that gives "People" a dream like quality, with brilliant shots and cinematography of New Orleans and the Louisiana bayou set to the electronic synth sound of Giorgio Moroder (the brains behind such memorable scores like "Scarface" and "Midnight Express"). There are some noticeable lapses in realism, such as why wouldn't Oliver be a little bit more concerned when Irena comes home naked and covered in blood in one scene! But the over all look and feel of the film more than makes up for these draw backs. To sum it up, for anyone who holds the original near and dear to their heart and can't bear to think of it being remade, then you probably want to avoid this. But for anyone who is open to seeing a decent re imagining or who hasn't seen the original and is in the mood for a good erotic thriller, then I'd say go for it. Also featuring Annette O'Toole, Ruby Dee, Frankie Faison and a very cool theme song in the form of David Bowie's "Putting out the Fire". Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Respectable Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Val Lewton's brand of implied horror, I avoided this second version of Cat People because of the current addiction to special effects. To me, the latter leaves too little to the imagination, which is after all the real theater of fright. In Lewton's 1942 original, much was implied rather than shown because of budget limitations-- he was working with RKO's second unit cranking out cheap wartime entertainment. Nonetheless, he came to the potboiler material with an artistic sensibility that managed to turn a financial liability into an artistic asset, resulting in a minor horror classic.Of course, comparisons with the original are inevitable among film buffs. But, I've got to say that, expectations aside, Schrader's 1982 film stands as a worthy remake, thanks to a generally intelligent approach to the permissiveness of today's movie standards. With one exception, Schrader wisely avoids the overpowering use of special effects, thereby allowing the story to stand on its own, even though I'm sure the temptations were great. Moreover, the surreal sequences are very well conceived and truly spooky, creating a haunting atmosphere for the background story. And far from being a cheap add-on, the overt eroticism brings audiences into the conflict by making them feel the temptations in a compelling way. Of course, the analytically inclined can have fun parsing the rich symbolism of the plot; nonetheless, the movie can also stand on its own as sheer entertainment.Two reservations?I agree that the pacing is generally too slow. Some of the scenes either sag or go on too long. A faster tempo would have produced more cumulative impact. Also, I thought the necropsy scene with the dead panther was a cheap concession to special effects and probably inspired by a similar scene in 1980's nail-biter Alien. On the other hand, the scene where McDowell leaps cat-like onto a wall was truly unnerving and connected him in realistic fashion to that other, surreal world. Special effects in that case would not have been nearly so effective. And certainly the acting here is an improvement on the shaky original, although I don't think the centerpiece swim scene equals the former, mainly because of b&amp;w's unrivaled capacity to produce threatening shadows.Still and all, this 1982 version of the '40's classic manages a respectable place of its own in the competitive world of horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cat People Visually Arresting But Ultimately A Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Paul Schrader's Cat People is another one of his visually arresting, dramatically static, and ultimately failed attempts at reconciling his conservative roots with a provocative storyline or setting. In this case, Nastassia Kinski stars as a virginal long lost sister of Malcolm McDowell. No sooner are the siblings reunited and a series of murders unsettles the community, which includes John Heard and Annette O'Toole as zookeepers. The real stars of the film are John Bailey's cinematography, Ferdinando Scarfiotti's production design, the lighting, make-up,and special effects. Kinski displays the right combination of confusion and naivet but lacks the threatening menace her role requires. McDowell is just right for his part, but the script is a letdown. The film remains caught between its eroticism (which will be too much for many viewers), its mythology, and its murder thriller aspect. In addition, despite Schrader's claim his film has nothing to do with the original Val Lewton production, he ends up copying a few scenes closely. The nudity and suggestive eroticism will turn off some viewers for sure. It's another interesting Schrader film that fails to succeed because of too many miscalculated or poorly executed ideas. ** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was not a dull film, the plot was just very odd and seemed far too unreal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main reason I watched this film was due to the fact that Malcolm Mcdowell has a leading role, and as I have recently seen A Clockwork Orange (1971) by far his best film, I hoped to see something that might also be good. While I did not find the film at all slow moving, I just thought that the plot was a bit odd, and the whole idea of people turning into Cat's was juts far too surreal for my liking. As you may know, this film was based on a version from 1942. At this time films of a horror genre were very popular and ideas of Frankenstein, Mummies and mutant like beings intrigued people, so this was probably why the idea of 'Cat People' was chosen. However, by the time this version was released in 1982, the idea was a bit old, and it was nothing particularly groundbreaking nor spectacular. While as far as I could see, the acting was hardly weak, yet I did not really get 'sucked in' as it where to the film's plot, as a good film should, simply because I thought the whole idea seemed like the sort of stuff you might see in comic books or cartoons. If the 'cat people' where some sort of violent religious cult, then perhaps it may of been more believable. As well as this, the amount of nudity surprised me, whether the director wanted to somehow relate cats and their jumpy, frisky nature to sex may perhaps be the reason but I do think that the film uses sex as one of it's bases. And so, while the film is an interesting watch, it is by no means a film of any significance. If you did enjoy this film however, try watching 'An American Werewolf in London' or 'Conan the Barbarian' (why I suggest this film, I do not know, i think because it shares an equally unusual plot along with some bizarre characters).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cat People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long ago the ancestors of Irena and Paul Gallier(Nastassja Kinski &amp; Malcolm McDowell)sacrificed their children to the leopards. The souls of the children grew inside the leopards until the leopards became human. They were gods then. They are an incestuous race and can only make love with their own..otherwise they transfer. Before becoming human again, they must kill.This is explained in a dream sequence to Irena because she is falling head-over-heels for Oliver(John Heard), the main man at a New Orleans zoo. His assistant is Alice(Annette O'Toole)and they have to tranquilize a leopard that has almost killed a hooker in one of those sleazy hotel rooms. That panther is actually Paul having succumbed to lust he must needs kill somehow. Unfortunately his wish comes true when Joe(Ed Begley Jr), another one of Oliver's assistants, gets his whole arm ripped out of the torso when he is trying to calm the cat down. Paul's sole desire is to mate with Irena so their torment will end regarding that change that occurs when one strays away from their own kind. But, Irena is so attracted to Oliver that Paul doesn't stand a chance. There in lies the conflict. Oliver deeply desires and wants Irena and vice versa, yet she is caught in an unfortunate situation thanks to her bloodline and heredity. If they partake in wanton sexual activity, she will turn and have to kill.I think the film looks great. Special thanks for the film's visual style goes to Ferdinando Scarfiotti. Director Paul Schrader said that if the powers-that-be would've allowed it he would've added Scarfiotti as co-director. His ideas behind the zoo lab(how it is set-up is quite original and unique..it really gives Schrader a chance to be creative with his camera and how he lenses Heard's zoologist walking throughout it)and the sandy landscape of the ancient sequences at the beginning where we see the leopard sacrificial ritual are stunning. Splashes of color and how Irena sees are flavorful to the eye.Though, despite how wooed I was with how it looked, I thought the story was a bit corny. It's quite lurid and sexually free. Kinski really gives herself over to the part and Schrader's camera hypnotically embraces her. She must expose her beautiful nude body frequently. Though, one might call the film unabashedly sleazy. I mean, I'm not about to complain regarding seeing Annette O'Toole's nice breasts, but one could make a pretty good argument that it was unnecessary. This film only has really one relation to the original film too many people tried to compare it to..the pool sequence where O'Toole's Alice is possibly threatened by Irena. The transformation sequence isn't too shabby if quick. What's funny(..this is how I felt anyway)was that the film feels so sophisticated it seems to come off less perverse than it really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are cat people and then there are dog people.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comment may contain spoilers *** There are two pretty extraordinary shots in this film. In the first, Nastassja Kinski is sitting with her head back on the seat rest. She's traveling in a train. She stares into the camera. And the background changes into a busy railway station where she opens a door and walks into an oneiristic room of tangerine and black leopards and all is explained to her by the image of her brother, Malcom MacDowell.The second is the last shot in the film. We see a screen full of the panther's face behind the bars of the zoo. The panther roars open mouthed, then closes its jaws and the frame freezes on the gigantic cat staring into the camera with its hypnotic green eyes and vertical pupils and its glimpse of pink tongue, a beacon of the uncanny. The shot lasts for many seconds. There seems to be no one else in the world but the viewer and that panther, staring at each other. By this time we know pretty much what the panther is feeling. And, our gaze locked on the frozen image, we feel at one with the beast. We can easily imagine that the cat's stare is a knowing one, that she knows what we feel too. It's like Rilke on mushrooms, describing the starving soul of a caged panther. "Just at times the curtain parts quietly inside his eyes. Along a nerve, awareness darts - arriving in his heart, it dies." But, apropos, maybe we'd better not make too much of that shot. Many years ago I used to feel the same way after a refreshing dose of herbal tea, staring at the four Beatles staring back at me from the open cover of the Sergeant Pepper album. And besides, when you come right down to it, I'm not sure it's a good idea to have a man-eating carnivore reading your mind.Anyway the director, Paul Schrader, should have his hand shaken for those two scenes. His work throughout is professionally competent. He has a tendency to see the world in terms of good and evil -- usually with someone caught between -- and the results aren't always pretty. "The Cat People" isn't too different in that regard. And the cat theme of the original is giganticized: these cats are real monsters.The thing may be another remake but it's a good one. The production design and lighting are magnificent. The original was done by Val Lewton at RKO on a budget that was probably one nanobillionth of what was spent on this one, and the earlier version is at least as good. We must at least give the first version bonus points for originality.I don't want to get into the story because it's either simple enough to have been adequately described elsewhere or so complicated that it would take too much space. Essentially it's about a brother and sister -- MacDowell and Kinski -- who inhabit a world between black panthers and human beings. MacDowell and Kinski seem to be the only specimens around, although the legend suggests they ought to form a community through chain migration. They remain human as long as they mate with their own kind. (MacDowell wants to put a little something in the kitty. A frisson of incest here.) If they mate with humans they turn into killer panthers and in order to get well again they must kill. But how can they pass on this catabolic capacity without belonging to a community of cat people? Right away there's a problem with the plot, similar to the one in the original. Simone Simon in the original was apparently human UNLESS she mated with a human. (Her long-suffering husband was Kent Smith.) She morphs into a panther when her psychiatrist puts some moves on her and she tears him to shreds. It took me many years to realize that he must have raped her before this happened, but it couldn't be shown on screen. The problem is that Simone Simon morphs at will twice earlier in the movie, in two truly spooky scenes involving a bus and a swimming pool. Kinski, virgo intacta, also apparently morphs in order to kill a rabbit. It all strains the logical faculty.The acting is pretty good. John Heard comes across as a likable kind of guy. Annette O'Toole, as the colleague who loves him, is too good to be true. In real life, she'd be a woman who disarticulates her rival Kinski from top to bottom. Now there's an idea. How many more magnetic actresses have there been than Nastassja Kinski? Not too many. She seems so innocent, with her softly modulated infantile voice. Her lips are askew. Her right eye is open and clear, her left is heavily lidded. She seems rarely to look straight at someone else, so the other person can't know whether Kinski is being shy or sly. She glows with an inner heat, a human Franklin stove with trim legs and a saucy rear. Madre de Dios, that crabbing scene with Heard, when she bends over in her shorts and waders! The original is the better movie, I think, partly because it was a true original and partly because of the producer's good taste and imagination. You only saw the cat for a few seconds. Here, the animal should get second billing. And in the original too, one had a sense of everyone's leading an ongoing unhurried happy life until Simone brought her sad, diseased nature into it. In this one everything seems at least slightly deranged from the outset.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The real Catwoman! (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Armed with a desire for a strange feline erotic fest and the decade for great special effect techniques, director Paul Schrader's remake of the 1940s horror of the same title hardly holds up to the beauty and suspense of the original.The story, slightly changed here, is that of a woman who is a descendant of the Cat People, who came into existence when a tribe sacrificed their women to a clan of leopards. Now, she is hiding out, and trying to avoid the clutches of her brother (a weirdo played well by b-movie regular, Malcom McDowell) who is trying to track her down because, despite the connotations of incest being inapplicable to the cat species, she can only continue the species by mating with others of her kind. This element is absent from the original (she turns into a panther as a result of a curse). As in the original film, however, she befriends a man who eventually becomes. curious into her odd, and highly secretive life as he eventually begins to fall in love with her. Here, he is a zoologist (because that's a good cover when you're part kitty cat).This movie provides greater insight into the cat woman's origins and that of her species, adding extra (unnecessary) eroticism complete with some unpleasant nude scenes of McDowell, and dragging out the movie far longer than necessary. In it's own right, the movie is not that bad for an 80s horror film (though, it ranks low on my own list), but when compared to the original, it fails to compare. I think it may've been the surrealist hyper drive on behalf of the filmmakers that may keep anyone from taking it too seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it was the first film that he directed from a screenplay he didn't write, Paul Schrader claims that his 1982 erotic nightmare Cat People remains one of his most personal films. And as he reveals on DVD producer Laurent Bouzereau's 25-minute Cat People: An Intimate Portrait by Paul Schrader, found on Universal's new edition, much of that stems from the affair he had with his leading lady, 21-year-old Nastassja Kinski. `She sort of invaded my life and threw it askew for a period of time-not without my complicity, of course,' he admits. (He also makes a point of mentioning that as his relationship with Kinski was collapsing, she approached Universal executive Ned Tannen about removing many of her nude scenes. Tannen refused.) The featurette and Schrader's commentary focus strongly on the meticulous color scheme and production design of visual consultant Ferdinando Scarfiotti and DP John Bailey and the film's mood of `prurient voyeurism vs. a fear quotient,' as Schrader puts it. `The idea was to get [the audience] ready for sex and show them violence and vice-versa.' The Dolby 2.0 mix is quite invigorating, giving uncomfortable prominence to such effects as the cat-like screech of a cable car and Kinski's growing talons tearing through her sheets, not to mention Giorgio Moroder's sexy score. Other supplements include a 10-minute on-set documentary from 1982, an 11-minute discussion with make-up effects artist Tom Burman and a look at Albert Whitlock's stunning matte paintings</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>reason for not making remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original movie (Cat People, 1942) was a classy thriller. Adding an erotic angle detracts from the original script. In the original, strong emotion turns people into cats; in the weak remake (this one), sexual arousal and only that, does the trick. It is easier to understand anger than to understand sexual arousal, and sex almost as a rule is a stupefying addition to any movie plot. For it to work, sexuality must be attractive to the viewer without qualification. Maybe it's my values, but if something is sleazy it isn't sexy. I know, I know, I know... sex was the great focus of America circa 1980, or so the "culture creators" thought was so for everyone. This remake fails -- badly. See the original flick and you will see a better movie -- if less flesh.</fullReview>

Maybe it's better that he dumped his weaker musical work into the sound track of a crummy movie, so his fans wouldn't have to hear him fail on an album. But unfortunately we saw the movie anyway. Even bad Bowie isn't really all that bad as music goes, but it's fitting that some of his worst work ended up in a bad movie. I'd rather listen to Bowie's good music, or see him in a good movie like The Man Who Fell to Earth.The movie itself really stinks. When the nudity in a movie is its main attraction, the movie has to be pretty bad. If that's all it stands on, it might as well be a porn movie. The cinematography was excellent, but it was a shame to see that talent wasted.Spoiler warning (not that this movie wasn't already spoiled by its script): Beings that change form between human and great cat? And eat people if they have sex? But don't have to eat people if they have incestuous sex? Give me a break.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-ambitious remake of a 1942 horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Way back in 1942, Jacques Tourneur made a subtle low-budget horror movie for RKO studios entitled Cat People. This 1982 remake of the same story comes from director Paul Schrader, but despite the forty year hiatus between both versions it is the earlier version that remains the better of the two films. Schrader&#x2019;s take on the story is much more graphic, with an emphasis on kinky sex and a few bursts of gore. But the story gets bogged down in pretentious imagery and philosophies, and Schrader hurts the film with his insistent exploration of themes that are not easily compatible with each other. Sexual desire, incest, physical metamorphosis, ancient curses and brutal violence could, individually, form a strong basis for any horror film. But in this case, all five themes are rolled into one and the result is a self-indulgent clutter of ideas and half-ideas that seems to lack a clear sense of where it is going.Irena Gallier (Natassia Kinski) arrives in New Orleans and is reunited, after a long separation, with her brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell). Paul&#x2019;s behaviour towards her seems strange and uncomfortably sensual, but Irena is too innocent-natured to read much into it. Later, Paul mysteriously disappears and a short while afterwards the police turn up hoping to question him regarding some brutal killings that have taken place in the area. Not really sure what is going on, Irena tries to go about her business and keep her mind on other things. She meets Oliver Yates (John Heard), the curator of the city zoo, and the pair of them quickly find that they share much in common. Before long Irena is working at the zoo - much to the annoyance of Alice Perrin (Annette O&#x2019;Toole), a pretty zoo-keeper who had designs on Oliver before Irena arrived. A recently-captured black panther is brought into their care at the zoo, but it kills one of the other zoo-keepers in a horrific attack. Shortly afterwards, Paul returns to the scene&#x2026;. and gradually Irena begins to realise that dark forces might be guiding her destiny. She learns that she and Paul are plagued by the curse of an ancient legend, and that any sexual activity between herself and a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; man will result in her transforming into a panther. In order to turn back to human form, she would have to kill again (this is what happened to Paul when he disappeared &#x2013; first he had sex with a woman and metamorphosised into the panther that was taken to the zoo; later he killed the zoo-keeper and transformed back into human form). Irena faces two choices: either to lead a life without sex, or to mate with one of her own kind (e.g. her brother!) Cat People is pictorially most impressive throughout, with John Bailey&#x2019;s photography creating a creepy atmosphere which is further heightened by Giorgio Moroder&#x2019;s eerie score. The performances are quite good, especially Kinski in the film&#x2019;s most challenging role. She has to convey sensuality, innocence and menace all at once &#x2013; not to mention being subjected to numerous nude scenes &#x2013; and she throws herself full-bloodedly into the role. McDowell&#x2019;s job is merely to look mysterious and sinister, which he does with characteristic verve. Cat People suffers, alas, from its overly deliberate pace and (as already noted) its incoherent jumbling of themes. There was the potential for a good &#x201c;straight&#x201d; horror film here, but Schrader has ultimately fallen prey to his own abundance of ambition. Still, for sheer moody atmosphere and its twisted view of sexuality Cat People remains curiously watchable. On the whole, though, it must be marked down as a missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irena Gallier (Nastassja Kinski) arrives in New Orleans for the first time. Irena is greeted at the airport by her brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell) who she has never met. Paul takes Irena back to his house but soon disappears. A prostitute named Ruthie (Lynn Lowry) is late for a client. She enters the seedy room and finds a strange slimy substance on the bed. She also notices a black fury thing sticking out from under the bed, she kicks it with her high heeled shoes and it turns out to be the tail belonging to a huge black Leopard which mauls her ankle but she manages to escape. Oh, and her bra 'rips' in the middle exposing her breasts. The massage parlour's manager (John H. Fields) traps the Leopard in the room and calls the authorities. The city zoo's curator Dr. Oliver Yates (John Heard) and his team, Alice Perrin (Annette O'Toole) and Joe Creigh (Ed Begley Jr.) are called in to capture the Leopard. Irena decides to see the sights that New Orleans has to offer. Irena eventually ends up at the zoo where she sees the Leopard, now safely behind the bars of a cage. Irena stays behind after the zoo closes and is found by Oliver. They strike up a friendship and within a few hours Oliver has given Irena a job in the zoo's gift shop. One day while Joe tries to feed the Leopard it rips his arm off and Joe dies, Oliver decides to shoot the Leopard but when he returns with a gun he finds the Leopard gone and a strange slimy substance on the floor. That night Paul returns home and confronts Irena, making sexual advances towards her. Irena runs from Paul and stops a police car. Back at Paul's house they make a grisly discovery in the basement. Paul needs Irena and will do whatever it takes to convince her she needs him too. Things become even more complicated when Irena and Oliver fall in love but Irena refuses to have sex with him, as events unfold it becomes clear that Irena and Paul both harbour a dark secret.Extensively re-written and directed by Paul Schrader I thought this was one of the dullest and most boring nothing horror films that I have seen in some time. The script that was originally written by Alan Ormsby before the re-write by Schrader is so slow it's frightening, and at almost two hours long the Cat People outstays it's welcome well before the end credits roll. For most of the first hour, maybe a little more, it's no more than a drama as the film focuses on Oliver's and Irena's relationship and not much else. The film also has many unnecessary sequences and drags, badly. Another small problem is that the film tries to present it's story as some kind of mystery, well I don't want to seem fussy but the films title is 'Cat People' and that sort of gives it away and it doesn't come as a surprise that people turn into Leopards if you know what I mean. One more thing I don't understand, if these cat people turn into Leopards during or after sexual contact why has Paul already turned into one before the prostitute even enters the room? Most of the characters are a little on the bitty side and somewhat underdeveloped. I also think it was a mistake to cast Kinski who can't act and on occasion looks like a man with her short hair (hey, it's true) and McDowell seems uninterested and unsuited to the role of the bad guy. I have to say that I didn't care about any of the characters involved which is never a good thing in a film. The film has lots of nudity with Kinski the main culprit as she exposes her breasts and body numerous times during the last 30 or so minutes, having said that though most of the female cast take their tops off at some point. There are some strong sex scenes too, especially at the end when Oliver ties a naked Kinski to the bed by her wrists and ankles and then has fairly explicit sex with her. Unfortunately the horror element of the story is severely lacking, in fact there is very little horror in it. There is very little gore either, an autopsy on a Leopard, a bitten off arm and a mangled dead body is about it. The transformation sequence is so short as to be almost inconsequential, although the meagre screen time it does get the transformation looks quite cool. However I will admit that the film has a really nice look throughout and great cinematography by John Bailey which captures the New Orleans locations extremely well. Personally I really didn't find much in this film to like, I will admit that it's well made and tells a story competently enough but I just found the whole thing so dull and uneventful. This is not a film that I can recommend, there are much better horror films out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie takes an approach I prefer for remakes... and botches it. It's desirable to rework a movie if you remake it. There's no point in re-executing a movie without finding something personal or new in it. And so it does. Unfortunately some vapid production design and odd inclusions (incest, an obsession with breasts, explicit effects) add nothing to the charm of the wonderfully schlocky and more effective original.Paul Schrader's version of Cat People is unfathomably formless. Stiff actors portray stiff, dull characters. And casting Malcolm MacDowell as a sexually active human being is just a huge turn-off. As bad as this is, it's still better than some late Schrader films which should show some development by now (Auto-focus? ...geez!). Paul Schrader exorcising his sexual demons again, and studios left to market it; "...um, Let's call it an 'erotic fantasy.'" Only if you have some secret wish to bone your homely brother. Exactly no one watches the original and thinks "This would be so much better if it had incest." Paul Schrader wouldn't know 'erotic' if his psychotherapist seduced him while he yammered on about his guilt complex.You'll remember some good roars if you have a set of decent speakers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Skin of a Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Pity Paul Schrader. He loves movies but is oblivious to storytelling. So his movies -- whether he writes or directs -- always focus on some fairly simple cinematic ideas. One should approach his projects as less of a meal than a cooking show.In this case, we have a few cooking tricks worth watching. The most obvious of course is Ms Kinski. Like Mia Farrow, she has done her most beguiling work with directors with whom she was sleeping, one of whom (in both cases) was Polanksi; they both adjusted and expanded film sexuality toward vulnerability; they both starred in an artistic horror film as first a reluctant then a willing player. Both of them, incidentally were daughters of show business people, had a long relationship with a world class musician and in later life became active in humanitarian endeavors. In both cases, those lover-directors unlocked normally inaccessible nuances in the face. Interesting, that. She made Michelle Pfeiffer's mouth possible.Here, the story has Moxie, literally. It is to my mind a minor "Sgt Pepper" of films: the last drug-supported studio film; the last one done using analog methods. (Anyone who listens to "Sgt. Pepper" on vinyl in the original 4-channel mono mix will know what I mean. It has an open, honest depth in its texture -- just like Nastassja.) Like Sgt. Pepper, is in a exploration into the erotic nature of texture, color, even spiritual perversion. Something between Bertolluci and "The Cell," and about as successful.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails on so many levels, bores on every one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not opposed to the idea of remakes, although this film shows just why it's a better idea to remake bad films with unfulfilled potential than great ones that far exceeded theirs. Even ignoring comparisons with Val Lewton's classic, it's rare for a film to misfire on quite as many levels as this early Bruckheimer movie - and it's much more of a Bruckheimer movie than a Schrader one - but sadly, like all Bruckheimer movies, this promises much but then resolutely fails to deliver (after all, Bruckheimer is the guy who made a car chase movie and then forgot to include any car chases until the last reel). The sexual fantasies may be Schrader's, but the style is all Bruckheimer's ? glossy visuals, marketable soundtrack, good-looking cast given little to work with, meandering script and a dogged refusal to make good on the hype.However, even ignoring the fact that the producer is more interested in the marketing than the movies themselves, taken on its own merits, ?Cat People' just doesn't work. For a film about a race of incestuous cat people, it's astonishingly boring. Nothing much happens in the most uninteresting way possible for 90 minutes until Kinski's character undergoes a sudden complete moral u-turn and the filmmakers try to wrap everything up in a hurry so they can get home before the pubs shut. As a film about sexuality, it has no insight. As a sex film, it has no sex or eroticism. As a thriller, it doesn't thrill. As a horror film, it has no atmosphere or menace. Worst of all, it's just so astonishingly dull. And don't expect much in the way of special effects or gore ? most of what was shot hit the cutting room floor (and don't go looking for them on the DVD ? no deleted scenes there).Suddenly the omens for 'Exorcist IV' are looking very, very bad indeed?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film Doesn't Get the Credit it Deserves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cat People (1982) *** (out of 4) Irena Gallier (Nastassja Kinski) arrives in New Orleans to visit her brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell) but soon falls for a man (John Heard) she meets at the local zoo. It doesn't take long for the young woman to realize that there's something not quite right with her or her brother and soon her sexual design brings something else out in her.Paul Schrader's remake of the 1942 film really doesn't have too much in common with that Val Lewton production. I think Schrader and screenwriter Alan Ormsby made the right decision in not trying to just remake that film and instead taking on a different approach. That approach was like several other remakes from the 1980s in that it added up a notch of sexuality. CAT PEOPLE didn't get too much credit when it was released outside the full frontal Kinski but that's really too bad because the film itself is quite good.I think Schrader did a very good job with the material and I thought he managed to milk the sexuality for everything it's worth as well as create a very interesting lead character. I thought the film did an extremely good job at the psychological stuff as the lead character is constantly wondering who she really is and the very also questions what we're actually seeing. The director managed to build up the psychological drama as well as the sexuality in the material. Some have argued that there weren't enough horror elements, which I can understand them saying that but even the original played with your mind more than actually showing you anything.A major reason for the film's success is the performance of Kinski who is simply wonderful in the lead role. The film works because you can believe her as this sweet and innocent woman that we meet at the start of the film. She plays a virgin here and the actress makes you believe that as the innocence just leaps off the screen but she also handles the character once she begins to change. The supporting cast is also great with McDowell is especially believable in the role of the creepy brother. Both Heard and Annette O'Toole offer excellent support as does Ruby Dee and Ed Begley, Jr. in their small roles.The sexuality of the film is certainly something that sets it apart as is the full frontal nudity from the lead actress. I'd argue that the film runs a bit too long as some editing might have helped but there are still plenty of effective scenes. Even the start inside the hotel room with the leopard was quite intense. Schrader's CAT PEOPLE has never really gotten the credit it deserves but it's a nice little gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young woman's sexual awakening brings horror when she discovers her urges transform her into a monstrous black leopard.Something went wrong with this film. The director is a hugely talented man, and has made some great films. Even here, the film looks beautiful and has an incredible color palette. But it drags in spots, seems to switch gears without warning, and just never hits the high notes.The film infamously has been said to have "more skin than blood", and that is quite true. For anyone looking to see Nastassja Kinski naked for long periods of time, this is the film for you. But if you want suspense, go for the original. This one has more gore, which is welcome, but that does not make up for the weak plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Atmosphere makes a film and this film has lots of it. The use of color and shadows, the shots of dry desert compared to the humidity of New Orleans, the nights-all make for an inviting film. This film has a moody, swampy, wet feel to it. It's hard not to get pulled in and be mesmerized by all of it. The acting is excellent by everyone. This could have become a joke if it had been overdone but they nailed it perfectly. It could be viewed as an art film but it's more than that. The film is perfectly cast. Natassja Kinski has the stunning looks for her role and Annette O'Toole keeps things sunny and light. In Body Heat they worked very hard at humidity but here they don't need to. You can feel the warmth and wetness. There a few small scenes here and there that I felt weren't needed but the rest is great to watch. This is one of those films one wants to watch over &amp; over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film back in 1987; a sanitized TV version without most of the eroticism. Upon watching the full version on DVD I was still as enthralled by the story as back when I was a preadolescent. I understood the film as a rich parable of the demise of wild things in a supposedly civilized world. I greatly sympathized with Irena as the new girl in town who is trying to "figure things out" and find her own way, only to keep running into these arrogant guys (one being her own dissolute brother) who wish to have sexual intercourse with her, all while acting as either her guides or her owners, never her equals. Also, Irena faces the sad reality of being one of the last of her kind, doomed to pay a gruesome price in exchange for an ever treacherous existence among humans. I highly seconded Irena's choice "Let me go back to my own people" while crying my eyes out because the remaining safe havens for her people--the big cats--are in zoos. Would that it were not so!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lett'n the cat out of the bag......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the tradition of erotic 80's thrillers, "Cat People" stands out as a very unique and entertaining piece of work. Young, innocent, and virginal Irena (Nastassja Kinski) can barely remember her parents or brother. She knows they were circus performers and that is about it. Having been raised in orphanages her whole life, she is finally contacted by her long lost brother Paul(Malcolm McDowell ), who is now a priest living out in New Orleans. So... she packs it up and hightails out there to go live with him. What she begins to learn is that her brother is quite an oddball, and she herself is beginning to have feelings and connections that she doesn't quite understand. Ya see, Irena and Paul are from actual feline ancestors, and they themselves turn into panthers upon heightened sexual arousal. Once they turn, they are kitty killing machines-who don't turn back to normal until after they have made a kill. AWESOME! Not only that, but they are incestuous-and they only way for them to function as humans, have a healthy sex life and pro create is to of only sleep with one another. HA HA! As Irena begins to establish a life and job for herself, her family demons began to take shape in many bizarre ways. As the truth unfolds, Irena is left with a series of perplexing dilemmas &amp; questions:1. Should she believe and join her brother? 2. Should she continue to develop a relationship with that nice man at the zoo she works at? 3. Should she give in to her daily animal instincts? 4. Should she remain a virgin out of fear of killing?"Cat People" has a purrrrfect blend of nudity, blood, &amp; erotic/ sexual images. I can remember how this movie would always get me fired up as a young lad, and after having just revisited the film some 20 years later-it still holds the power to mesmerize and entertain. And folks to me.....that's what makes for a good time in front of the TV. Recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi there? I watched the remake one night, and the original the following night, and I'm just going to address various issues about both.Personally I liked the remake. It's a MESS, sure, but an interesting mess. A lot of times an interesting mess is better for me than a coherent but unimaginative film. The one word that comes to mind to describe the remake is LURID. The colors, the tone, the story? and I love that.If you don't know, the original is about a woman who can't kiss a man or she'll turn into a panther and kill him. Her husband gets sexually frustrated and turns to a co-worker, and the cat woman gets all feline on 'em. In the remake there's the same plot, with the addition of a brother who claims that only he and the sister can have sex--that's right, incest--because if she has sex with someone else she'll turn into a panther and then have to kill someone before she turns human again.Okay so the sudden inclusion of this new character and the move into incest--this is quite a jump, no? My theory is that the screenwriter divided the original husband character into TWO characters, the boyfriend and the brother, one representing his fidelity, one representing his raw lust. Does this lead anywhere? Not really, but it certainly isn't dull.One interesting thing about the remake is that they seem to have made an effort to match the physical looks of the actors. This is especially noticeable with the mousy, annoying co-worker, who you will INDEED want to see clawed to death just for being such a goody-goody-gumdrops.There are a few cool special effects in the remake where Malcolm McDowell does some creepy catlike movements, and you're like 'How'd they do that?' Then you realize that they have integrated BACKWARDS footage very cleverly in. That's better than another digital effect in my book any day.The transformation to and from cat is an incoherent mess in the remake. Apparently the cat grows inside you and bursts out, fine, and then the human presumably bursts out of the cat the same way, okay, but then there's this bizarre thing where the cat melts for no reason, and the human comes back some other way (presumably)? and it just doesn't make sense.There are a lot of good creepy parts of the remake, like when the prostitute thinks she's alone in the room, and there's this thing sticking out from under the bed. Then the thing moves--it's the TAIL!--and we realize the cat is under the bed. Also when John Heard wakes up and knows someone is in the room, and the shock when he turns on the light. There are also a bunch of confusing things. I don't know why they preserved catwoman (forgot her name) drawing the cat obsessionally, as it doesn't add anything. And, at the very beginning, we see a young catgirl in Africa or wherever morph into Natasha, which in standard movie vocabulary means that she IS that girl grown up, but it turns out she's not. That confused me for a long time.Ultimately the storyline of the remake falls apart, but I still enjoyed it all the way there (though it IS a bit on the too long side). If you're watching this for thrills, you may be disappointed, but if you're watching for technique and general filmic coolness, there's lots to feast on.--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge of the 80's: The Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cat People (1982)was a prime example of Hollywood's excesses. Too much time, money and tinkering ruined this picture. Oh the stories I've heard about the making of this film. This movie was made during the final stages of the great partying era of the 70's. The decade was ending but many of the producers and directors didn't know when to quit the tomfoolery. One of the results were movies like Cat People. A highly erotic, steamy remake of the 40's thriller. Natassja Kinski is HOT in this movie, and I do mean HOT. Whoa, they should've just followed her around with a movie camera and made the film about her. I understand that they have to have a story and a plot but if they made a film just about her,you know what I mean. Well, the movie itself is a tepid remake filled with wild F/X and an over the top performance by Malcolm McDowell, the weird story shows signs of a drug induced psychosis (cocaine probably) and too much fooling around and tinkering. Highly recommended for Miss Kinski's appearance alone. Yow-wee!Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Malcolm McDowell gives his best ( after Caligula ) as the demonic and tortured brother who is the only one who can save irene from transforming but dies before they can consumate their relationship.a powerful and gripping movie especially the part where irene discovers she is more than just a woman with a strange appetite as she discovers the power of hunting in the swamp. but my all time favourite is the dream where paul makes her remember her past.... and ends with the immortal lines..

That gives you a good idea of the sexual tone of the film.And this film is very much about sex. Malcolm McDowell meets some very well-endowed chick at a funeral, of all places, but he can't quite get his whatsis to function. So she (is that Annette O'Toole?) gets all naked and says, "Don't worry honey. Momma will make it better." And then she bows to him, so to speak, and goes about making more than just his fur stand up. Of course, in lieu of an orgasm, he turns into a cat and eats about half her body.Poor Malcolm. He knows that he can't find true sexual satisfaction unless he gets one of his own kind. So when Nasty Kinky (or is it Nastassa Kinski?) comes to town, he makes it his goal to get her in heat. We get to see Nasty Kinky walk around naked in the woods, eat a live rabbit in the nude, and finally do it kitty style with brother Malcolm.So invite Mom and the kids over and get ready for some family fun!

		<shortDescription>Not just a simple remake.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first RKO "Cat People" film was budgeted as a B movie at $140,000 and was created at a time when the studio was on the verge of bankruptcy. It was extremely successful and generated large profits which helped restore the financial state of the studio. Although this might have led to a plethora of other Cat People films from various studios, it did not happen. Instead 40 years of continuing content changes in typical U.S. feature films went by before this 1982 remake was undertaken by the same studio. During this period the Hayes Code requirements had been abandoned and violence, nudity or highly erotic sequences had became commonplace (or even expected) in mainstream films; but heavy Freudian obsessions were no longer in favour. Not surprisingly this longer duration wide-screen remake, which was produced in colour and with a much more generous budget, took a very different form to the 1942 film; but rather confusingly they have many similar sequences and the principal characters have been given the same names. (IMDb User Comments on the earlier film, which discuss some of these differences, help minimise this confusion.) In this remake Irena is younger and has no idea of her heritage, her animal trainer parents died when she was very young (we wonder how?) and she was brought up in an orphanage, but her brother Paul in New Orleans eventually traces her. The film has a short but photographically very dramatic introductory sequence explaining how legendary werecats were first created when our distant ancestors sacrificed young women to service the sexual needs of the black leopards that they worshipped; then opens when Irena joins Paul. She quickly learns that he is inherently randy and regularly calls on the services of prostitutes who must be surprised when he transmogrificates into a black panther and rips them to shreds after their union, so regaining his human form. The cause of death is obvious and there are long, obviously unsuccessful, searches for an unknown escaped cat. Paul explains to Irena that they are both examples of surviving but now very rare cat people. He wants her as a mate so that dangerous transmogrifications can end although they are still able to attain sexual satisfaction. Unwilling to accept incest, Irena forms a relationship with Oliver a zoo-keeper in the New Orleans zoo, and later becomes jealous of Alice, a colleague of Oliver's. This leads to a re-run of the famous swimming pool sequences from the 1942 film.This 1982 film has become a cult favourite noted for incorporating a great deal of violence and gore. One very graphic scene shows Paul as a panther attacking Oliver's assistant zoo-keeper and effortlessly tearing out his arm, later when Paul has been killed before he could revert to human form we see an autopsy on the panther during which its belly is cut open and a complete human hand and forearm extracted. The film also incorporates copious nudity. The legends of lycanthropy make the shedding of all clothing (possibly apart from a small symbolic piece of the fur of the were-creature whose form is sought) one way to initiate the morph process. The film makers have used this to justify extended sequences showing Nastassja Kinsky as Irena roaming in the New Orleans swamplands completely naked. This is probably artistically justified - it is certainly not depicted lasciviously. But why should Alice have been shown as topless in the swimming pool scene which presumably takes place in a public pool? For a direct comparison I re-watched both Cat People films recently. In both the photography is way above average, and so is much of the acting - with near Oscar worthy performances by the two Cat ladies. Both films are vastly superior to most of their contemporary releases. One might define a good movie as a melding of good acting with good photography under a great director. Jacques Tourneur was the better director and this makes the 1942 film the more memorable, but Ferdinando Scarfiotti and Albert Whitlock's use of matte paintings in pre-computer days to create the introductory sequence of the 1982 film was for me the most memorable single feature of either film. The most striking impression I got from watching these films in sequence was the way in which both so closely reflected the culture of their day. In 1942 the Hayes code dominated movie-making. The story used in the re-make would have been totally unacceptable for both sexuality and violence - let alone incest. A simple kiss, rather than an orgasmic frenzy, had to be the initiator of transmogrification; reducing the legend to little better than the fairy stories where the frog Prince needs a kiss from the Princess before becoming her glamorous suitor. Horror films of this period were usually slasher films with cardboard cut-out characters and totally predictable endings. The studio may have expected this film to be similar, but the vision of Lewton and the craftsmanship of Tourneur overcame such limitations completely and successfully. By 1982 film-makers had become free to exploit their greater freedom and establish new limits, so any remake needed stronger meat. In those pre-AIDS days nudity and eroticism had become open doors, whilst public acceptability of extremes of essentially unnecessary violence was being increasingly tested. Films such as 300 and Gladiator show this process has not yet ended - Cat People shows the start.(ULTIMATE SPOILER AHEAD) This film ends with Irena making passionate love to Oliver in full knowledge of what will ensue. He waits with a tranquilliser dart at the ready, so that after the Irena panther has been caged in his zoo they can continue to love each other - although with bars eternally separating them. Symbolically effective, but not quite a conventional happy ending, this was presumably acceptable to most viewers of the period..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cat People" made quite a splash in 1982 with its bold sexuality, stylish images and David Bowie soundtrack, but it has not held up well.Nastassja Kinski and Malcolm McDowell look somewhat bored here as as two siblings with a bizarre genetic code: They turn into panthers when sexually aroused, and the only people with whom they can safely mate is each other. Kinski's character upsets the family balance when she falls for a zoo keeper, played by William Hurt.There's plenty of sex, gallons of blood, and an excellent synth soundtrack, but ultimately this film has the substance of a two-hour music video. The dialogue is wooden, the plot drags on, and even the sex scenes lack passion. A better adult horror film from the same era is "The Hunger," with Bowie and Catherine Deneuve as ancient vampires seeking fresh blood.</fullReview>

When Paul goes missing before promising to show her around, she goes looking for him and runs into zoo worker Oliver Yates, (John Heard) who was called in after a series of calls about an escaped cat roaming the city. After giving her a job, Oliver and Irena start becoming friends, as well as with the other staff members Alice Perrin, (Annette O'Toole) Joe Creigh, (Ed Begley Jr.) and Bill Searle, (Scott Paulin) at the zoo. When Paul returns and threatens Irena, fully revealing a dark secret of both of their pasts, she is forced to accept the truth and face her destiny.The Good News: One of the genre's classic movies, it's hard to believe that the remake would turn out really decent. The best part is just the same as the original: the story is one of the strongest and most creative ones around. So simply, so elegant, and it sets up potentially greater scenes late in the movie. That is a great strength to have, and it luckily has the same thing here. The film really picks up more towards the back end, with the final twenty minutes in particular being of considerable importance. That is where the two key moments in the original, the chase in the park and the pool attack, are both placed, and they still strike the exact same cords as they did then. The pool attack, in this one, is much better as the feeling of suspense and dread comes across just a little better, helped along with some more nudity than in before, but the dread comes out through that part just a little better. The new-era special effects also give this a new sheen, allowing it to have some acceptable gore for the time. There's a really brutal arm ripping-off, a nasty, throbbing scratch etched on a leg and series of very brutal dismembered bodies found. The transformation scene is also well-handled, and shown on-screen instead of hinted at in the original. The erotic elements of the general story allows for some decent nudity as well, giving this another leg up over the original. Overall, this was really good.The Bad News: There was a couple problems with this one. The main one is that the beginning is pretty slow. Not much occurs until mid-way through, when the murders start, but that's way into the movie and the beginning could've used a little more action to beef it up. It's still watchable, and really sets up the story well, but it's still a tad slower than most. The majority of kills transpiring off-screen is another big problem, merely resorting to stumbling upon the body at a later point. They really looked savage, but there's only a few actually killed on-screen. In this one, the park chase is a major disappointment, especially since the pool attack is superior. The music played over the chase is totally inappropriate and runs the entire mood. The one point where the original still beats this remake.The Final Verdict: Hard to say which one of the two is better. The remake certainly makes a valiant attempt, and succeeds in certain areas, but the original still comes in first in certain areas. For the curious, give it a shot, it's surprisingly good, while those who love the original will want to compare the two and decide from there.Rated R: Nudity, Graphic Language, several Sex Scenes and themes, Graphic Violence and themes of incest</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It starts with terribly long opening credits. And it doesn't really get better. This movie is not complete waste, but it's a far cry from being good. It offers cheap thrills and bad script. This "make love to me to save me" thing didn't really cut it for me. And there's too many loose ends to make the movie really interesting. And why (ex. the autopsy scene) does the director always need to exaggerate a little bit too much? And what a botchy job these zookeepers do! Nastassja Kinski makes for a great feline (we even see her go fishing!), but it's not enough to save the day. Malcolm McDowell is bad and John Heard is only slightly better. I must say, though, that I enjoyed the New Orleans scenery. As for the music, it's like in most movie from the 80's: outdated (even though it could have been a lot worst).Not a terribly bad film, but I'm sure there's something better you could be watching.Seen at home, in Toronto, on March 28th, 2006.63/100 (*?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irena Gallier(Nastassja Kinski)is a young girl orphaned and sent to live with relatives,including her brother Paul(Malcolm McDowell).There is a little family secret that must be discovered by Irena,she and her brother are descended from a race of people that transform into leopards upon completing the act of sexual intercourse.The only way to return to human form is to stalk their prey and kill.She is also drawn to the local zoo where she meets a man,Oliver(John Heard)who awakes an attraction in her.It also causes her to feel jealous of his co-worker Alice(Annette O'Toole)."Cat People" is an okay horror film.There is a nice amount of gore and Nastassja Kinski's full-frontal nudity,so if you are prude don't watch it.Unfortunately the pace is really slow and the film is quite dull.However if you liked the original "Cat People" give this one a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are not too many remakes that are better than the original but this one is. The remake of the fly was much better and so was invasion of the body snatchers but not too many people believe that. I didn't even like the original cat people and i thought the sequel Curse of the cat people was better but it really wasn't a sequel. I thought that this version went on too long and John Heard wasn't very good in here. Natasssja Kinski and Malcolm McDowell are brother and sister but they haven't seen each other since they were kids. Kinski is still a virgin and every time they have sex they turn into a leopard. This was directed by Paul Schrader and this movie has the two best scenes from the first movie included here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an interesting interpretation of the original, using the same themes of repressed emotions and sexuality and taking it to the next level. Nastassja Kinski is a young woman, newly come to America to live with her older brother, Malcolm McDowell. What she doesn't know is that she and her brother are the results of incest (parents were brother and sister) and, as if that wasn't bad enough, descended from a long line of inbreeding shapeshifters. It seems that the members of her truly twisted family can only mate with each other. To do otherwise causes them to transform into vicious black panthers, which must kill to regain their human shape. Set in New Orleans with dreamy flashbacks to a mysterious desert land of red skies and massive bare trees draped with exotic panthers, Cat People is visually stunning. Haunting and moody, it moves at the pace of a dream that gradually turns into a nightmare. It doesn't lack for good performances either. Nastassja Kinski is flawless; sultry, vicious, frightened and innocent all at once. Her scenes with her transformed brother/wild panther, are absolutely hypnotic as the two beautiful creatures lock eyes and blood flows. Malcolm McDowell is perfect as her perverted brother, casually menacing and always bestial, killing with barely a shrug and raging as the transformation overtakes him. I've never understood the bad reviews this film has always received. I thought it was very well done, very atmospheric and nicely tense, plus I couldn't resist the double billing of Kinski and McDowell. It paid homage to its predecessor with a great swimming pool scene and a spooky jog through a night time park. You'll either love this film or hate it. I loved it.</fullReview>

What actually makes this such a good picture is that Schrader, although not his best movie though, kind of avoided the trap of falling into werewolve-syndromes... There have been more than enough adepts of this genre but Schrader makes a very personal movie with it. Just a shame the brilliance of McDowell hasn't been more explored as it just feels like he was just some background....

		<shortDescription>Confused remake of a horror classic by the usually great Paul Scrader. Apart from the Kinski nudity has very little to recommend it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't know what Paul Schrader was thinking when he made this confused remake of Jacques Tourneur's 1940s horror classic. He doesn't recreate the wonderful atmosphere of the original and fiddles with the plot to include some incest and gratuitous nudity. If you are a fan of Nastassja Kinski the latter will interest you, but apart from that this a very disappointing film with little to recommend it. Kinski co-stars with the underrated John Heard ('Cutter's Way') and Malcolm McDowell ('A Clockwork Orange'), but none of them are given much to work with by the lame script (NOT written by Schrader, which is probably a big part of the problem). The supporting cast also includes Ed Begley, Jr ('This Is Spinal Tap') and Annette O'Toole, best known these days as Clark Kent's TV Mum, but - sleazehounds note - has a topless scene in this one. I'd love to be able to say that 'Cat People' is a misunderstood classic or something, but really it's just not very good, and if you haven't seen it don't bother, rent the original. If you want to see Paul Schrader at his best watch 'Blue Collar' or 'Light Sleeper', not this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actors need to have chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nastassja Kinski and John Heard had no chemistry together. Putting these two together as love interests was like putting a silk hat on a pig. The script lacks many needed elements including time. After a 5 minute dinner date scene, John Heard has fallen madly in love with this quiet, imperfect, strange, and troubled women who he earlier chased up a tree. John Heard was down right suttle throughout the entire film. Once you get to see Nastassja Kinski in the nude, its worth waiting through the first 45 minutes of boring story. Then, you lose all interests in Kinski. Once you see her nude again, there remains no desire for what happens next. The entire cast of the movie was either a villain or a sap. With regards to Annette O'Toole, I feel nothing but pity for her role. Not only will I admit that her pool scene is one of the top reasons to rent this movie, but her character is the only one in the entire story that makes sense. Everybody else is walking around like zombies wondering how the black panther got out of the cage? In fact, why was the not even questioned that a giant panther made an impossible escape? If you haven't guessed it yet, this movie is not one of my favorites. If not for the special effects, early 80's musical score, and the nudity, this movie would have flunked with both cat and dog lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A variation on the vampire theme that's both refreshingly original and quite entertaining. Giorgio Moroder's throbbing score does a lot to add to the overall atmosphere (he's one of my favorite film composers). Add some fine acting by Malcolm McDowell and Nastassja Kinski, and you have the makings of a "minor" cult classic. As a cult film, it's not quite as engaging as "The Hunger," but if you like the "vampire" genre you're liable to really enjoy this film. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Schrader's version of Cat People is, despite many gore and sex scenes, quite entertaining on its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just rewatched the original Cat People, I now had to check out the Paul Schrader remake which is set in New Orleans which is a two-hour drive from my current home city of Baton Rouge (which gets a couple of mentions in the movie). It begins in a dream-like desert of long ago with a woman about to be sacrificed to a black leopard. Before this leopard kills her, he seems to make love to her on the tree. We then flash forward to present time as we see Irena Gallier (Nastassia Kinski) meet her brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell). He lives with an African-American woman named Female (Ruby Dee). When Paul temporarily disappears, Irena goes to the New Orleans Zoo (actually called Audubon Zoo) where she meets head Oliver Yates (John Heard) and his associate Alice Perrin (Annette O'Toole). I'll stop there and just say while some scenes seem a bit pretentious (like the POV of Irena when she's a leopard) and the film may be a little long, I enjoyed this version of Cat People almost as much as the original one and appreciated many of the twists and changes made as well as some similarities (like Irena sketching the leopard, a woman saying "my sister" to her in her native tongue, and the pool scene with Alice). In fact, writer Alan Ormsby-with some uncredited contributions from Schrader-expands on DeWitt Bodeen's previous take with modern sensibilities and Southern Louisianaian flavor. Other acting turns I enjoyed include Ed Begley, Jr.'s role as Joe Creigh who provided come comic relief before his tragic scene and N. O. native John Larroquette's cameo as Bronte Judson. And the score by Giorgio Moroder is hauntingly pulsating. In summation, while this version of Cat People can get a little out of hand, it's still quite entertaining in its own part that I quite highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 40's Jacques Tourneur directed a movie called Cat People, it was a horror film that scared no one, it was naive and so innocent; but it was a masterpiece of that genre. It that film there's no blood, no scenes of killings, and of course there were no sex scenes. It was also a short-length movie, no more than 70 minutes, and I remember myself watching it with a smile on my face. Forty years after, in 1982, a (brilliant) cinema director called Paul Schrader makes this remake from that Tourneur's film. And now we got blood, and killings, and sex in almost every scene.. The duration is twice the original's, but there's nothing new about the story. Schrader even copy shot by shot some scenes from Tourneur's classic (the one in the swimming-pool), but for worst. And I wonder, are remakes necessary? Hollywood studios seem to assume that people won't enjoy a movie made 40 years ago, so they have to re-make it and update some of the stuff -usually related with sex and vocabulary, making it all much more explicit-. In my opinion this is completely unnecessary and it's not worth spending the money in doing that. I compare this remakes with those awful techno-remixes from Elvis Presley's songs... The only thing that deserves to be outstanding at this movie is the presence of Nastassia Kinski. But her beauty and her talent should've been exploited in a better cause.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talented cast wasted in essentially pointless film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... So the director wants to get Nastassja Kinski nude? Fine, I have no problem with that, it's a very admirable goal; but why dress it up? Why gather a bunch of talented character actors (and Nastassja Kinski) and chuck in loads of gore and some half-baked philosophical musings about sex releasing the inner potential for violence that is within us? In doing so in his remake, Schrader probably ruined a finer movie.I reckon it would have worked much better if the premise had even been slightly metaphorical, or else played out off-screen. The notion of people ACTUALLY turning into panthers is too absurd. Alas, subtlety didn't seem to be one of the movie's strong suits.Self-awareness is probably what I'm talking about. There should have been stronger evidence of some sort of character struggle. In "American Werewolf in London", David is horrified to learn that he has been killing people in the guise of a wolf whilst his real persona was trapped in that body and in a fugue. Maybe it was just me, but Nastassja never seemed THAT perturbed that she could morph into a panther and potentially go on a random killing spree; unless that sort of thing happens to people all the time where she comes from, I dunno...Come to think of it, any kind of ironic touches would have been welcome in this movie; but no, it's all played straight, and the kind of humour to be found is strictly that which is unintentional.Kinski is used as window-dressing (smart move) and everybody else competes to humiliate themselves in the worst way possible. The soundtrack is awful too, despite having Bowie on it...Worth watching for: a) Kinski's body; and b) laughs; but unfortunately, not much else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this when it first came out in 1982. I thought it was terrible then. I totally forgot about it, but then read some good reviews, so I thought I would give it another chance. Sorry, no change. It was still terrible.I say that while acknowledging that any movie that has Natashia Kinski walking around naked for three minutes and Annette O'toole topless for one minute, has at least four watchable minutes in it. Unfortunately, the other hour and 54 minutes have virtually nothing interesting happening.Natashia Kinski and Malcolm McDowell give Razzi worthy performances. I've seen six years old act better cats, although usually they are not so broad. Kinski seems to go from playing an innocent sixteen year old to playing a precocious sixteen year old. McDowell is the bigger disappointment. After being terrifically cool in "If", "Clockwork Orange" and "O Lucky Man," he turns into Bela Lugosi and not young Bela Lugosi, but 1950's Bela Lugosi.The film alternates between scenes that are banal and dull and scenes where bad spooky music plays and actors scream unconvincingly. In most of the scenes they cut at the dramatic moment of horror, but a couple of time they do provides some cheap-looking gore.Everything has a cheesy, 1980's made for television look. The cinematography establishes no style for the film. Sometimes it is shadowy, sometimes it is dismally rainy gray and sometimes it is bright pop.John Heard and Annette O'toole actually turn in solid, even believable performances, but that doesn't help much. Their characters have no depth, and their acting just reinforces the over-the-top performances of the two leads.I generally like Paul Schrader movies which often portray interesting, intense characters under pressure, think "Taxi" "Blue Collar" "Raging Bull" "Mosquito Coast," etc. However, these characters are not under any pressure, so the behavior is just laughable. The explanation for the supernatural premise of the movie involving some ancient race of Cat People is just dumb. It is "Cat Women on the Moon" dumb. Schrader takes it far too seriously for the movie to be any fun.I would have to put it in competition with "the Hunger" as the most non-erotic and unscary "erotic-horror" film of the 1980's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Schrader's remake of the Jacques Tourneur classic is not unnecessarily gory...it's just plain unnecessary. That said, it's still fun. Nastassia Kinski, sporting short hair and a long pout, arrives in New Orleans to reunite with her brother and soon realizes that she and he are VERY different from everyone else. The fact that the brother is played by Malcolm McDowell will clue the audience in that something odd is going on. Kinski and McDowell have great chemistry, but few scenes together. John Heard plays the zoologist in love with Kinski, much to McDowell's chagrin. Annette O'Toole, Ruby Dee and Ed Begley Jr. are in it too. Begley has a particularly nasty encounter with McDowell and Dee speaks with some sort of incomprehensible Cajun accent. It's not great, but the glossy production values help a lot as does Giorgio Moroder's synth score, complete with a very slick theme song sung by David Bowie.</fullReview>

The 1982 version, however. . . isn't.I already knew the plot beforehand, and thank God for that, because it allowed me to fast-forward through the boring bits. And believe me, there are a *lot* of boring bits. Scenes last way too long, stupidly inappropriate camera angles are used, and several of the actors seem to be sleepwalking their way through the film. Not to mention the fact that the whole project is overblown and pretentious. There are some good parts -- chiefly when Paul and/or Irena are in between pantheric and human form; the sense of the too-wild human and the too-human animal warring with each other is very well conveyed. But they don't redeem what is essentially a dull, flabby, incompetently made film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm writing this review after just having finished watching Cat People and I'm suffering from mixed feelings a bit.... I certainly expected it to be better and more valuable than this?especially because the I heard so much praising on it. Paul Schrader remakes the brilliant 1942 classic with the same title. The original Jacques Tourneur version was terrific because of the simple ? yet very effective ? basic plot story, but Schrader adds so many elements to this that it loses its charm. Also, there were the stress was on the mystery in the original?Schrader fully goes for the erotic undertones (like incest, virginity or just plain voyeurism) . And unfortunately?the negative elements don't even stop there. As a viewer, you never really have feeling with the main characters in Cat People and the whole film just is too slow! For a movie that constantly features a black leopard?it could have used a little more tempo. Still, this film can't be bashed entirely of course, as it still is a stylish and very brutal 80's horror highlight. Nastassja Kinski basically makes every film look good and she's damn sexy here, as the confused beauty torn between incest prepositions (by Malcolm McDowell?famous for other cult-hits like Caligula and A Clockwork Orange) and sincere declarations of love by John Heard (C.H.U.D) . Some of the sequences in Cat People are really fascinating and fairly gore?like for example the thrilling arm-amputation, Kinski's colorful hunting adventure and the descent in Malcolm McDowell's terror dungeon. You can almost smell death in that scene. Unfortunately, the pivot scene are practically copied from the original shot by shot. Like the pool-scene only updated with a little bit of naked Anette O'Toole flesh?If you're intrigued by the synopsis of Cat People, I strongly recommend to hunt down the original version and most likely the sequel `Curse of the Cat People' as well. I haven't seen that one myself, but I can easily imagine it's more than decent. Or, if you want to learn more about Paul Shrader's work in cinema, you'll be better off by renting Mishima, Light Sleeper or even American Gigolo. Cat People doesn't really represent his talent if you ask me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bit Dated but Some Good Elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed "Cat People" especially for it's interesting beginning and hope for a strong movie. It definitely shows it's age in effects, settings, and most especially music that on the whole I didn't care for. And although not a werewolf tale, people will certainly compare the 2 ideas. (spoilers) Some of the aspects of the movie I liked were the constraints of the fable, and while the character development was a bit mishandled mostly seriously in the way she does a reverse 180 after her brother dies, I liked the movie leading up to that point. The ending is mostly a compromise that makes sense for Kinski's character, but seems sort of too safe. Was hoping there'd be more "Cat People" involved in the story, and a bit more history and development as opposed to violence. Anyway, this is a fair movie and fairy-tale if you can look past it's aging that shows up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopefully these cats don't have nine lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Cat People is considered to be a masterpiece. A masterpiece that sometimes doesn't get as much attention as it should, but still holds a positive view among people. The story is about a woman named Irena who falls for and marries a man named Oliver Reed (no relation to the actor and it's a different last name in the remake). The only problem is Irena believes an old curse upon her people from her native country will turn her into a panther if she gets too upset or displays her love in any physical way. While she's getting therapy Oliver finds out he's actually in love with his co-worker Alice and plans to divorce Irena and the result isn't very pretty.The film was given to Val Lewton to produce with a low budget and no real story behind it. But with a little imagination a lot can be achieved. It specializes for fear of the unseen and psychological messages. We don't know at first whether Irena's really able to change or just crazy at first. The film keeps you guessing with some great build-up and developed characters and some truly suspenseful scenes when Irena decides to follow Alice around. The sequel isn't half bad either showing us a somewhat troubled child and mixing reality and fantasy so well it was shown in college psychology classes.Now the remake is pretty much the same story but with some differences. You see a lot more this time and instead of a psychological tone it takes a sexual tone. Irena now has a brother who like her is one of the Cat People. Instead of Cat People being supposed witches in the myths Irena believed in the original their explained to be the result of children being sacrificed so much to the panthers they become them and can only have safe sex if it's with one another. Her brother desperately craving a passionate yet safe experience stalks her while in the meantime she learns about her dilemma and falls for Oliver.Nastassja Kinski plays a good Irena and while not quite as pitiful as Simone Simon's can still be felt for and Oliver too. The real star is Malcolm McDowell as the brother. He's so creepy and yet somewhat sympathetic too. He's so desperate for a woman to be with who he won't kill he's willing to go as far as mate with his sister. There's a lot of nice visuals and set designs, great lighting many more scenes with the panthers creating a bigger body count as a result. It sort of reminds one of American Werewolf in London at first with the transformations, but there's enough originality to make it it's own movie. The music is great too and features David Bowie doing a short yet haunting song and Paul Schrader's direction is great too.What the remake falls short in is it's ability to reflect the original effectively. Some time in the last third or so it tries to imitate the remake in having Irena stalk Alice in almost entirely the same way though with the pool scene a bit more darkly lit than the original by the look of it making it easier for a panther to hide from the camera. However Alice isn't really with Oliver in the movie (she only wishes they were for the most part) and having done so much to make it it's own movie I feel the times it tries to be a remake almost take away from the plot than add to it this time. I love when a remake can be original and still follow the original, but this time since the psychological and horror tones are decreased for a more sexual and visionary style it makes those scenes almost seem like a completely different movie and makes Irena's motives seem more cruel to Alice than defensive about her relationship. It's as if the movie was meant to be filmed completely differently at first and they decided halfway through filming they should include the stalking scenes even though they not only feel out of place but are never mentioned after wards. It's pacing seems to vary at times too.Overall Cat People is a decent film. Not a masterpiece and not really recommended for those demanding an accurate remake with the same style. Those who just want to see Kinski naked in several scenes and plenty of panther scenes complete with gore and all may feel satisfied. It all depends on taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evocative, a bit awkward, but not terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If nothing else, I'll probably remember Cat People, for its award winning theme from David Bowie, recently reincarnated for Inglorious Basterds, but the movie has a few other things going for it. At first glance it resembles An American Werewolf in London, without the humour, but from a 21st century perspective it reminds me even more of Candyman, which had yet to be adapted for film. Clive Barker's story was more inventive, and the film was scarier, but Cat People (remake or not) is pretty evocative as well. It's not as cheap as it may sound. The animals here are real. If anything Cat People has a bit of a throwback attitude to a time when monsters were sexy, (or some monsters at least). After vampires, cats may be the next most seductive of creatures. So Cat People has a few things going for it, but some things it has too much of. The film is so focused on style, and generally low tones, that it comes at the cost of believable story. The first half is not bad, but the second half feels sort of muddled and confused, not to mention anticlimactic. I like the way the movie ends though, one of those neither happy nor sad finales. So Cat People I suppose is a good movie for the monster fans. It is certainly not as cheap as many others, but its lack of story is somewhat degrading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How they became cat people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to disagree with the women being sacrificed to leopards and they mated with them thing. Puh-lease, what planet did that come from? It was children who were sacrificed to the leopards, and as time went by their souls became entwined with those of the leopards, and evolution took it's turn. I liked this movie. OK it's no Jurassic Park or Schindler's List, and I didn't come away all enlightened and a better person, but it's moody, atmospheric and sensual, and Natassja makes a lovely vulnerable predator. Malcolm Mcdowell, is at once compelling and frightening. He's the ultimate stalker. He's had more experience being a "cat person" and therefore the whole thing is very simple to him, where as Irena (Kinski) is only just becoming aware of her sensuality, her sexuality and the power that lies within. Her romantic notions are just beginning to emerge and suddenly she has to deal with the whole sexual arousal = black leopard = death for anyone NOT a cat person. Fatal Attraction could have taken a whole new direction if Glenn Close had been a cat person.</fullReview>

I have seen much more graphic and violent films in the past that attracted much less attention. I confess I have not seen the original and perhaps maybe it is better. If it is then fine. This version wasn't bad. I can think of a half a dozen films released this year that couldn't hold a candle to this in terms of acting or scares. I don't think I would watch it twice as it doesn't hold any special appeal but that is beside the point. MacDowell is the star player here as far as acting credentials goes and he is a likable if otherwise sick villain. I don't know how they got the black panthers to do what they did they might be the true stars here. The special effects were on par and this did make the list of 100 scariest moments on film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>20 years after, still a great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw 'Cat people' when a teenager; this had the effect of making me immediately fall in love with N. Kinski. Obviously I didn't succeed in approaching her but this motivated me to follow her career as years passed. I got the opportunity to watch the DVD a few days ago and i must confess the magic spell worked again.Several reasons for that: Paul Schrader's movie's truly good. Several brilliant actors make their way around the panthers: J. Heard is very convincing as Oliver, "a 34yrs old man who spent most of his life trying to find someone he could be in love with", and the attraction he's meant to feel for Irena becomes nearly palpable at certain moments. I think everything has already been said concerning N. Kinski (Irena); i will simply add that she's been able to make intense the movie's last 30 minutes which focus completely onto her disorientated character. A. O'Toole (Alice) is very good also in the role of the assistant having a crash on her boss. Besides that, the "chasing scene" ending up in the swimming pool makes the spectator feel tense and prefigures the bad events to come. Only M. McDowell (Paul, Irena's brother) seems not to have had the opportunity to express himself properly; his appearances don't last long and his part couldn't reflect all the actor's potential.The music is awesome: G. Moroder wrote two wonderful themes. A frantic one for Paul and another, softer, more sensual for his sister. The score of the "dream sequence" is great. The opening theme succeeds in quickly dragging the watcher inside the plot's general atmosphere and David Bowie's closing song makes him/her read the credits until the last line!Other IMDb reviewers spoke about the great work achieved by visual consultant Ferdinando Scarfiotti for the exterior sequences in New Orleans. This together with the music surely contributes to render them in a pleasant lively way.A lot has been said about the fact Schrader and Kinski were lovers at the time the movie was shot. Well, according to certain sequences, i'd say that i'm happy about that! Just because it's more than possible that personal involvement helped in making expressions emerge on the face of the actress to the spectator's benefit. Eroticism (and getting the main character feeling comfortable with it) was surely an important aspect of the movie.20 years ago, a friend of mine made the following comment: "this story's just stupid because it means that if i eat potatoes, my grandchildren will turn into potatoes after making love". Many pseudo-Freudian interpretations have been proposed for both versions of the movie (see also the 1942 one by Jacques Tourneur). Well, in my opinion, all this just demonstrates that the tagline "an erotic fantasy about the animal in us all" was indeed well suited: what's the point of trying to find out whether or not such a tale is logical ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining exploitative remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of remakes and I'm not saying that this film deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the original, but I did enjoy it on a simple exploitation level. Even the shortcomings are fun. John Heard and Nastassja Kinski really have no chemistry and when Heard dumps Annette O'Toole for her you have to scratch your head. The casting is funny. I can see the producers thinking of "Catlike" actors to use in their film. "How about Malcolm McDowell"? "He's catlike"! It is kind of strange that a terrific director like Paul Schrader made this film when he usually makes gritty dramas. But with Schrader at the helm you know he'll hold nothing back! And the result is a lot of blood and even more nudity. Kinski has (Or was) never reluctant to be nude in film and she looks quite comfortable doing it. Schrader even got O'Toole to take her clothes off and their is a glimpse of McDowell's shortcomings (If you know what I mean). One of the routes to take if your going to remake a classic is to make it exploitative. And this sure is. There is good music accompanying the film and its very well shot in the south and the heat of the day seems to enhance the lust of both virginal Kinski and Heard. I felt sorry for O'Toole's character who seems the most level headed. If you hate this version because you love the original, I'll understand. I personally like the original a lot also but I can't resist a well made piece of exploitation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is almost a vampire flick, which is a risky thing for a movie to be &gt; how many GOOD vampire movies are there? Only a handful. How many Vampire flicks are there? A lot. Cat People was an interesting, but on the whole, a mediocre film. I will start with the positive aspects. This has excellent dialogue (in many parts) as written by writer/director Paul Schrader. Nastassja Kinski shines in her role as Irena; the seduction is very real. The soundtrack created by Giorgio Moroder accentuates the suspense, which is also very real.Now for the negatives. This film starts out on the wrong foot = I felt like I was watching Conan the Barbarian and not an Erotic Thriller (which is what this should have been) This film has a horrible soundtrack whenever suspense is not the main focus. The film actually freezes at one point just so we can take in the David Bowie score. This might have been good in the early eighties, but it isn't good anymore. Maybe I thought this was more than a horror flick...maybe it was. The point is that it throws in nudity and cheesy gore in excessive doses. This is not erotic or thrilling in the long run. Once I see Nastassja Kinski naked once, I probably won't have an "emotional" response if she does it many times afterwards. Part of this is probably due to the fact that Paul Schrader is not much of film director when it comes to "love." He does a nice job when he's trying to scare us, but really, why can't he just stick to writing? The actual plot is very weak, despite the witty script. The whole panther thing (I don't want to give too much away) is inconsistent as far as timing. The end of this movie feels like an unwanted encore. It never ends. Irena's purpose and motives are never clear because reasons are never really given. This is a good remake of a bad 1940's movie. This is a mediocre movie; I can't stress this enough. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true horror film classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> The 1982 remake of the 1942 horror film classic "Cat People" is perhaps one of the best remakes of a film in a long time and one of the best horror films ever to come out in the '80's.Veteran Martin Scorsese writer Paul Schrader who directed Richard Pryor's critically acclaimed "Blue Collar","American Gigolo",and the Oscar winning "Affliction" directs the film with style,gore,and visionary warmth.It tells the story of a beautiful girl Irena (played excellently by one of my favorite actresses,Nastassja Kinski)who visits her brother{played chillingly by "A Clockwork Orange"'s Malcolm McDowell)who turns into a violent and precocius black leopard.Irena experiences love with a zoo curator (played brilliantly by John Heard).Irena's sexual powers immediately turns her into a leopard also,but this time more dangerously.It contains a great deal of gore and graphic special effects any horror film had ever seen up to that time especially the scene where John Heard's character takes Irena's brother (as a panther) to a operating room and opens up the stomach and a hand sticks up in the air causing the body to decay rapidly.Georgio Moroder's music score and David Bowie's title song are also big plusses.Nastassja Kinski's performance as the short black haired Irena is one of the best performances I had ever seen in her career.The only problem with this film is that this film should have been directed by the king of horror films,Wes Craven or perhaps should have been directed by Tobe Hooper,but to no avail.If horror films don't satisfy your tastes,then don't watch this.But for those fans of horror films(or Nastassja Kinski)watch it and see watch you've been waitng for.Well,I warned you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller and all around fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie made in 1982, this is actually a very well made movie and shouldn't just be seen as a remake as it really makes a whole new life out of the story it was based on.The acting was actually pretty good and believable and the story worked nicely as they weren't afraid to take chances and be daring. The chemistry between all the character was really there and it seems like they put some effort and actually took the movie they were in seriously and considering the fantasy thriller this is that can be hard to do sometimes. The music score was excellent especially during the final chase scene of Irena as a panther chasing down the girl she is jealous of for moving in on the one she loves. The scene alone is amazingly done and dark but with the music it is really on the edge of your seat as you watch it all unfold before you.The movie is pretty simple on the surface but there's a lot of twists and turns that take place as the movie progresses. The main girl in the movie, Irena who seems to have no clue about her family origins or what she truly is, develops full circle from the innocent young girl at the beginning to a raging roaring stalking killer big cat at the end and she seems to not want to fight what she is to become. more like accepting it rather then being scared of it. Oliver, a zoo curator, falls for the young helpless seeming girl as he too chances from beginning to end. Not hating what his love interest is but doing what is right for both of them.The movie doesn't hold back any punches. They pretty much tell the viewer everything they need to know. Irena's brother Paul already knows about the family curse and has been on a life mission to reunite with her. What seems like a family reunion turns out to be a mission of freedom for him. Any time any sexual desires or actions dealing with one of these cat people, they will transform into a black panther only able to change back after taking the life of someone else. The twist is that the brother and sister can only have sex with one another in order to prevent the transformation. From that point on the movie seems to take a new life of its own. Instead of embracing or even believing him she rejects the whole notion or possibility.There are quite a few graphic and gore filled scenes with Paul in his panther form, killing a hooker at the beginning and totally ripping the arm off of a zoo worker as he lays prisoner in a cage. These really set the stage, almost foreshadowing what is to become of poor Irena. Once her brother is killed there is a feeling of real trouble for her and the movie doesn't disappoint to deliver a wonderful ending and great special effects which weren't overdone like some movies of the late 90's and 2000. The transformation where Irena doesn't fight her sexual desires anymore is really an amazing work of FX. They show in detail her almost becoming like a werepanther all the way to her 4 legged form where she roars in the face of Oliver as they were making love. Quite suspenseful and unexpected and that's what this movie did. Took chances and delivered.I would give this movie 3 1/2 stars and recommend this to all who like a good piece of fantasy as well as suspense and horror. Story is easy to follow and is well explained and the use of actual panthers instead of animatronic or computer created animals is refreshing to see as it adds that much more realistic feel to the film. There's a little bit of everything and if you don't take the movie to seriously or try to compare it to other movies this is a real classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cat People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered how it might feel to make love to a black leopard? In "Cat People," one more or less finds out. "Cat People" is one more in a series of updated horror films that have had a renaissance in the contemporary cinema. Although it boasts Malcolm McDowell and Nastassia Kinski in the starring roles, "Cat People" (a remake of the 1942 film of the same name) fails to add any original material to the horror genre.The film suffers from a case of split personality and ends up with two half-baked versions of what it wants to be. The storyline is basically hackneyed: an unknown tribe of fanatical animal worshipers-large cats in this case-becomes extinct, except for one brother and sister separated at birth who finally meet some time in their mid-20s. Brother thinks the only way to save their dead race is by an incestuous relationship, and when his sister refuses, he goes on a rampage. Having numerous one-night-stands, he mauls his victims after transforming into a black leopard.The plot does not twist very much and it is easy to keep one step ahead. But the director, Paul Schrader (author of "Taxi Driver" and "Blue Collar"), cares more about style than function and lets the film meander. In order to let the film fully develop, Schrader shapes it around the basic principles of a cat and lets it adapt accordingly. The scenes naturally creep by, the score glides across the action effortlessly and the chase scenes flex and retract with a grasping rhythm. With the synthesizer work of Giorgio Moroder ("Midnight Express"), an almost fluid feeling of anticipated fear is laced through each scene and very comfortably compliments the real stars of the film: the camera and the visual effects. Black and red are the two colors the camera is fond of, which intensify as soon as they are noticed. When Annette O'Toole goes for an after-hours swim at the Y and the lights mysteriously go out, the cat seems to pace alongside the pool even though it is pitch black. And when the blood flows onto the floor of the zoo, the cat claws its way around Kinski's legs. Kinski, though , is treated royally by the cinematographer. In the scenes where she removes her clothes, the outside light does not just shine off her nude body, it glistens.Her large eyes are the key to her character, letting her slip from a look of innocence to a savage scowl in minutes. McDowell's make-up does emphasize his catlike facial structure, but in doing so reveals his age (near 40), which begs quite a bit of credibility for a supposed 26-year-old. The success of McDowell has always relied on his ability to be both charming and sinister, which is kept intact, though he comes across looking tired.The large, black leopard winds up stealing most of the scenes and makes the cat that Snoopy antagonizes seem like Garfield. As in any horror film, the animal is as frightening a creature as one ever wants to meet, with a subterranean growl that is positively horrid. And as a horror film staple, the film is filled with the obligatory graphic violence as well as the time-lapse transformation from human to beast.The final frame, where the head of a black leopard fills the screen, conveys what all horror films about animals hope to do: leave one feeling about that particular animal in an entirely different manner. In "Cat People," however, it does not quite know how it wants to leave you feeling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tourneur's masterpiece gets a sleazy makeover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it; this remake of Jacques Tourneur's 1942 masterpiece was doomed from the start. This is the sort of film that people will go into with zero expectations because of the brilliance of the original and dislike it because of the huge chasm of quality between this and Tourneur's film. However, in spite of the fact that this remake isn't nearly as good; it still stands alone as a more than decent eighties horror flick. The thick and foreboding atmosphere of the original has been replaced by a more sleazy, erotic tone and the film is much more keen to focus on themes of lust and incest than the folklore behind the affliction of the central character, which the original portrayed so well. This offers a different take on the 'Cat People' theme, and while it never works as well as the tone in the original; it's still rather nice, and on a personal note; I just love sleazy films! Not to mention the fact that a frame for frame remake is never a good idea.The film features a number of corny moments, and the gore and nudity go over the top on several occasions, which won't go down well with many fans of the original, but it isn't a bad thing, as all these things add to the kitschy element of the film and all aid the sleaze, and are, therefore, more than welcome in my opinion. The theme of incest is capitalised upon, and director Paul Schrader doesn't seem all that bothered about making a film that crosses a boundary where taboos are concerned. Malcolm McDowell aids this film massively in this respect, and his performance in this movie is nothing short of fabulous. He's simultaneously malevolent and perverse, and every moment he's on screen is a highlight. The original worked by way of keeping the action simple, and ensuring the audience is always left guessing as to what's going to happen next. Schrader goes the other way with this movie, and he makes sure that we see EVERYTHING, and this is no bad thing in my book. The mystery is retained still, and Schrader manages to leave us on the edge of our seats.When it comes to movies featuring shape shifting, it's nearly always, if not always, werewolves that are the central focus; so another thing I like about this film is that it offers a different animal for the characters to change into. It has no doubt taken influence from 'The Howling', with it's great little change sequence towards the end, and that marks one of the highlights of the movie. The movie is a little overlong, and the ending will leave many (including yours truly) cold, but on the whole, while this is disappointing because it's not as great as the original, it's still a damn fine horror film. And besides, at the end of the day; how many films can you name that have reached the heights of the 1942 version of Cat People?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure trash; ruins the original's legacy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of "Cat People" is a film that spares the viewer nothing--incest, bestiality, nudity, gore. Part of the genius of Jacques Tourneur's original 1942 suspense thriller was how it showed nothing, and relied entirely on implications and psychological fear. When a fanged killer chased a scared woman down a dark street, we heard the footsteps, but we didn't see the killer behind her. We just saw her, scared, running, gasping.And when the woman went for a swim, she took the liberty of keeping on her bathing suit, instead of running into a dark room completely topless and jumping into the pool. Because that's exactly what happens in the remake of "Cat People." Nude people are everywhere: nude men, nude women, nude animals. And anyone who tells you that this film is not exploitative is lying through his or her teeth. This is like a soft-porn version of a classic horror tale. And that's without even mentioning the nonexistent terror of the beast that was present in the original. Imagine "JAWS" being remade with the shark appearing from the onset and you've got yourself a clear picture of "Cat People" (1982).It basically ruins everything that made the first film a classic. We get a cheesy 80s-style prelude to the movie that explains the mythical nature of the human/cat hybrids. In Ancient times, women were mated with panthers--shoved into their dwellings as a sort of sexual sacrifice. Yes, this is actually shown in the beginning of the film. But wait! It gets better!Irena (Natassja Kinski) doesn't know it, but she is one of the rare offspring of this crossed species. After going to live with her brother, Peter (Malcolm McDowell), she falls in love with a local zoo curator named Oliver (John Heard). Irena is still a virgin, and her brother soon tells her that she must lose her virginity with him, since they are cat people and must only mate with their own kind. Otherwise, if they mate with species outside of their circle, they will turn into monstrous beasts and have to murder one person before they transform back again. (This happens to Peter many a couple times in the film, once with a hooker and once with a woman he meets at a graveyard. Did I mention that the camera manages to reveal both of their paired breasts before they are killed?)Having seen and loved the original "Cat People," I must confess that much of the remake's plot has ties to the original film. The characters' names are the same, and they basically do the same things in different situations (one of Oliver's co-workers has a crush on him, for example). But everything is updated, and very corny, and the dialogue is as weak as it is humorous. The violence is comically outlandish and everything is darker. In the original "Cat People," Irena could not kiss a man or she would turn into a beast. Now, Irena cannot have sex with a man or she will turn into a beast. It's a truly pointless remake, nowhere near as good as the first, and just an effort to stain the original's lasting effect. I can guarantee that every time I think of the original from now on, I will also think of the remake, which is a depressing thought.The director, Paul Schrader, seems more intent on getting the characters to shred their clothes rather than letting them actually evolve into bigger pictures. This has some of the most nudity in a mainstream film that I have ever seen. Indeed, Malcolm McDowell must be getting tired of doing nude scenes. He did full frontal in "A Clockwork Orange," and here he does it again. And Natassja Kinski is stripping off her clothes every time the camera gets near her. For a movie from 1982, this is surprisingly exploitative. And the nudity aside, this film's many implications of bestiality and gore disturbed me--and I am not easily disturbed.For a film that had so much going for it, the remake of "Cat People" may very well be one of the most disappointing films of all time--not to mention one of the most disturbing, too. It's stupid and dumb, and it's not very scary at all. I can't imagine how anyone could actually like this film, but evidently there are some who enjoy it. I strongly recommend the superior classic original over this lackluster, dark remake. It's as if Schrader and his team were intent on destroying the original's legacy from the onset of production.And so here is proof that sometimes more is indeed not better, and that showing less can often times be much scarier than showing more. Oh, how I hate this film.1.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike The Original, This Doesn't Leave Much To The Imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is almost the opposite of the original Cat People movie of 1942 which was mostly suggestive violence, sexuality, horror, etc. In that "oldie," everything was implied and gave the film a moody, creepy atmosphere.Of course, by the 1970s, a lot of that sort of movie-making subtlety went out the window. In the last few years, it's even more the case. Few things are implied today. They are just thrown at us, like raw meat to a hungry lion.Here, we have plenty of blood-and guts, nudity and - for extra bonuses - incest and bestiality. Wow, that's a little too much "information" for us discriminating movie viewers, don't you think?It's too bad they wasted a nice cast of Malcom McDowell, Nastassja Kinski, John Heard, Annette O'Toole and more names you know. Kinski, as "Irena Gailier," spends most of the movie with her clothes off and McDowell, as he was in "A Clockwork Orange," isn't shy, either. Well, at least she looked pretty and he looked effectively evil. The growl of the panther was pretty scary, too. However, this a two-hour film that is mostly stupid, filled with unlikable characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reworking of the 1942 cult item has Kinski, some style, little else...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aloof suspense drama has an odd, virginal young woman (Nastassia Kinski, looking like a lascivious pixie) reuniting with her estranged brother (Malcolm McDowell) and slowly realizing they are "cat people"--and, when aroused, can metamorphose into cats. Updating Val Lewton's sleek but slim 1942 Gothic drama was a terrific idea, but this version doesn't give the central idea much of a chance, and since we never intrinsically feel that Kinski and McDowell are siblings, the incestuous subtext doesn't come off. Director Paul Schrader wants to make a controversial blood-and-sex horror movie, but it's not in him to be garish (Schrader harbors a fascination with kinky subject matter, and yet he's always at a distance, keeping the material grounded within a moral undermining). The film is certainly stylish, but in a confounding, silly kind of way; it puts the audience off before the characters can even emerge. The writing is weak throughout, leaving supporting players Annette O'Toole (as the zoo-worker with the friendly laugh) and handsome-but-inert John Heard with little to do. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the F*** Mr. McCallaster!? Dude, you knew she was a cat, so why have hit that? WHY WOULD YOU HAVE HIT IT MR. M!? KEVINNN!!! I rate this movie one out of Ten, because I was actually interested in watching the movie for about one tenth of the total running time, which was way too long. I'll admit, the first thirty or forty seconds in were a bit intriguing, but thats when the title cards ended and the cat people emerged from their secret underground lair. They lived in the ground or tree or something... right? There was a tree, with a ribbon or something. S***, what the F***, it's just so bad. Avoid at all costs.The gratuitous nudity is just the tip of the iceberg. I think that biggest problem I have with the movie is that I can't even say the title, let alone refer to it in the presence of the SawFanatic1, and another friend of mine, who would like to remain anonymous, rather than be associated with this C class, low budget soft core feline erotica. Seriously, now when I'm with SawF. and Anonymous I have to say "C.P." instead of "Cat People." For example, no one wants to see a naked cat. It's just not cool. And Mr. McCallaster, keep it in your pants you h***** freak. You can do better than that. Let's all learn from our mistakes and avoid the remake of Cat People. And inter-species relations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fist off, remaking a classic horror film is a stupid idea. Second: adding blood and gore doesn't help. Third: Neither does nudity. Fourth: WHY???POSSIBLE SPOILERSA pointless remake of a great horror film. In the original Simone Simon can't have sex with a man--if she does she'll kill him. In this remake, the woman (Nastassja Kinski) has a brother (Malcolm McDowell) and she can only have sex with him and not kill him. Unfortunately she's in love with John Heard. Kinski is not a good actress--never was. Having her nude throughout most of the movie doesn't help. McDowell really, really tries but he's given nothing to work with. Heard looks miserable (understandably) and poor Annette O'Toole does the famous pool sequence from the original topless. Why? So we could squeeze some more gratuitous female nudity into this. There is some nice imagery here and there but the story is so muddled and the acting so bad that they don't help. Pointless, boring, not scary. If Schrader is so interested in nude females, why doesn't he just do a porno flick? See the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very 1980s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing to strike me about this remake of the 1942 movie CAT PEOPLE is how 1980s everything is . Everything is image and soundtrack . Unfortunately I mean that literally , there`s little in the way of substance , there`s little in the way of great acting , there`s little in the way of inspired directing , everything is centered around a synth soundtrack and you won`t be shocked to learn that the name Jerry Bruckheimer appears in the creditsI did enjoy Giorgio Moroder`s electronic score for the movie but I should point I was 15 years old when CAT PEOPLE was released therefore I did apreciate synthesiser music in my youth . For those people born before or after the 1960s they will probably detest the artificial and intrusive soundtrack . I also agree with many of the comments here that the acting , directing and editing is all that good but it`s not as bad as other Bruckheimer productions from the 80s and considering that there`s a subtext of incest and beastiality the film does deserve some credit for never being as offensively explict as it could have been</fullReview>
