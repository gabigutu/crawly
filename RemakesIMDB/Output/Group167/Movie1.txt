		<shortDescription>Creepier than having someone stare at you in a bathroom stall!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to The Grudge, there's a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage, then a curse is left behind. It's a "stain" that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred, and it will kill everything it touches. All I can say is if that were true then the movie-going public better hope I never die in a theater. The audience at this movie was probably the most obnoxious crowd I've ever had the displeasure of watching a movie with. Talk about being in a powerful grip of rage. More on that later.Jump scenes rule the day here. That's right, this baby is stocked with jump scenes! If you're having a hard time deciphering my complicated terminology, then let me explain that a "jump scene" is one in which something startling happens to catch you off guard and makes you jump in your seat. Some people think jump scenes are cheap ploys to get a scare from the audience, but they're really well done in this movie. And they're manufactured frequently and shrewdly enough to keep you in a constant state of unease.Unfortunately, when most moviegoers get scared they like to scream and then laugh and talk about it for 2 minutes afterwards. If you're gonna scream then scream. But then SHUT UP and WATCH THE MOVIE! This ain't a comedy and it certainly isn't a coffeehouse, so quit killin' my atmosphere.Some of you might be a little agitated to know that The Grudge does follow some clichéd horror movie conventions, such as a character investigating a creepy noise in a dark attic with only a cigarette lighter to illuminate the way. And of course, one character has to slowly follow a strange figure that shouldn't be there in the first place. But it's forgivable. Keep in mind, characters aren't necessarily supposed to know they're in a horror movie. I'm sure we've all explored strange noises before, except rather than a horrific, disfigured ghost producing the noise, in real life the sound is usually coming from Uncle Larry's bathroom excursion. Never underestimate the horror of a night out at the Taco Bell.Comparisons to The Ring are inevitable, so I'll just say that I personally feel The Grudge is the creepier of the two. This is a movie that's heavy on atmosphere and freaky imagery. The Japanese ghosts creeped me out even more than the time I caught some pervert staring at me in the men's bathroom stall back in my college days. Lucky for him, he took off before I had a chance to demonstrate what happens when a person is caught in a powerful grip of rage.But The Ring has the better story and a much better ending. The Grudge does a great job of keeping you guessing. You never really know where it's going, and since the story isn't linear you really have to pay attention. I know a lot of you have the attention span of a goldfish (about 9 seconds, you just learned something today, thank me later), so this may be problematic. I think it works fairly well, but one of my complaints is that near the end everything is wrapped up and explained rather quickly.As a result, I wish the movie had been longer. A longer running time could've produced more in-depth character development, a more clever way to explain what was going on, and maybe even a better ending. And there's my biggest complaint. Why do so many horror movies feel the need to use the I Know What You Did Last Summer-esque "look, there's gonna be a sequel" ending? Come on, how about some closure? It's similar to if you're waiting for me to close out my review in a witty and funny fashion, but instead, for some reason I just decide to end the review in mid sent...THE GISTIf you're looking for some Halloween entertainment, then The Grudge will give you some good jumps and surround you with creepy imagery. But I strongly recommend that you see it at a time when there won't be a big crowd because I know I would've enjoyed the movie a lot more had I not been surrounded by a lot of stand-up comedians who felt the need to crack jokes at the most tense and inopportune times. Folks, this is a horror movie. Tension and atmosphere are a big part of it, so please keep your laughing and talking to a minimum. I look forward to watching the DVD in peace and quiet one day where the only idiots I'll possibly be surrounded by will be friends and family. Rating: 3.75 (out of 5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie with the proper understanding of the culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of comments floating about complaining about a lack of plot or reason behind characters actions. Jabs at it being a copy of The Ring or just another ghost story. Let me try and help out a bit. Hopefully more people will go and see the movie for what it is and not look for Western film theories in an Asian movie. The plot is very simple, part of the appeal of the series is how effective such a simple story can be. Watch the movie and pay attention. I'm not really sure what people are complaining about. It all seemed very simple to me. Terrible events cause spirits to haunt a house and all those associated with it. Why are they haunting about? Their lives were ended prematurely and under terrible circumstances! What more do you want. I'm a ghost, why do I go and kill jane who came into my house, cause I'm p*ssed about how I died and I'm going to take out on somebody. Simple. Gripe gripe gripe, nothing is being said. Here is what I loved about the movie, ignore everything else I've said and just look for what I saw.In horror fan is going to love the use of music and sound effects in the movie. Take note of the lack of dialogue in the movie, yet how much emotion is conveyed. I'm sorry it wasn't our beautiful American actors carrying the film. It was brilliant music, sound effects and editing. Welcome to Japanese film. Less is more...blah blah blah. Key things to look for in Japanese horror, spirits (not ghosts very different then what we think of as a ghost), indicators of the spirit (eyes and hair not chain rattling or moving furniture). The eyes in this movie were not an indication of who was going to be killed, it is not the ring. Eyes are the portals into the spirit. The significance of her eyes flashing into view isn't to tell you who is going to die but to convey the state of the spirits in the film. The hair is a classic Japanese horror technique. Nothing really behind except its creepy and it continues a tradition in a culture that respects tradition. On to spirits. Not ghosts. We have spirits for everything, good and bad. My dad will tell you that there is a spirit in his coffee mug, a different one then the one in his coffee maker. We all get along provided we pay the proper respect to them by letting them do their thing. Example: My dad makes his coffee and drinks it from his mug respecting the role the spirits had. Don't ask me why but thats what we do. It isn't magic or hokey pokey. We don't pray to any of them save very important ones, say ones that protect your home, they just exist. In the Grudge the significant relationship is the fact that these tortured spirits don't haunt a location as much as they haunt all associated with the place and time of their greatest pain. They aren't ghost of the killed family. They are spirits whose purpose is to cause the pain they have suffered. Back to the coffee. Mug spirit likes to serve coffee and be cleaned and treated well, its his job kind of. Emotional trauma spirit from the movie likes to cause emotional trauma. Get it. They aren't haunting in the western sense of seeking revenge they are spirits created from a traumatic event and are fulfilling their job of continuing what they know best. The prompts at the beginning of the movie explain this. They do a horrible job and say something about being infected with rage but it all is the same. So why was this movie scary. Beyond the classic use of music and lighting, or the quick edit cut shots and nasty faces of the spirits. Its scary because for a culture that has spirits watching over every little thing you could think of, having a few spirits who's purpose is to cause pain is pretty serious. Watch the movie with that in mind. That spirits that you believe you function alongside daily can also turn it all around and f things up for you. Oh yeah, you get killed by a spirit created from a terrible even and guess what, you've now become a spirit haunted by pain as well. Get into the music and sound effects, it is great fun.The skipping about in the timeline is done very well as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was pleasantly shocked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie expecting an artsy scary film. What I got was scare after scare. It's a horror film at it's core. It's not dull like other horror films where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore. This film doesn't even show you the majority of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters. I think one of the best things about the concept where it's not just the house thats haunted its whoever goes into the house. They become haunted no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms... etc. After reading some of the external reviews I am really surprised that critics didn't like this film. I am going to see it again this week and am excited about it.I gave this film 10 stars because it did what a horror film should. It scared the s**t out of me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as good as the Japanese films (but with an ending rant against remakes of foreign films)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an exchange student in Japan who is just beginning to do some social work, is sent to aid an elderly semi-catatonic woman, Emma (Grace Zabriskie), after her previous caretaker, Yoko (Yoko Maki), disappears. Karen soon learns that something is not right in Emma's home, and she attempts to "see how deep the rabbit hole goes".Maybe it's a delayed influence from the success of M. Night Shyamalan's films, but slower-paced, understated horror films are a recent trend. In some cases, such as Hide and Seek (2005), the approach works remarkably well, and in others, such as White Noise (2005), the pacing tends to kill the film. I didn't like The Grudge quite as much as Hide and Seek, but this is still a very good film--it earns a 9 out of 10 from me.The Grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend, however. One, it is well known that this is a remake based on the Japanese film series that began with Ju-On (2000) (in particular, it's extremely close to the first half of Ju-On: The Grudge, aka Ju-On 3, from 2003). Two, as with many Japanese horror films, the slower pacing here isn't so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism. As is also the case with a large percentage of European horror, The Grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmare.Director Takashi Shimizu, also the director of the five Japanese entries in the Ju-On series to date (the fifth is currently in production), and writer Stephen Susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story. The idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes, with dream logic, where the focus is atmosphere, creepiness, the uncanny, and for many viewers--scares. How well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to, or are used to, this different approach to film-making (although admittedly, some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the Ju-On series). Traditionally, American audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning "rules" for the "monster". A more poetic, metaphorical, surreal approach to film isn't yet accepted by the mainstream in the U.S.However, even if you're not used to it, it's worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give The Grudge a shot. This is a well written, well directed, well acted film, filled with unusual properties, such as the story interweaving a large number of "main characters" (which is done better here than the more episodic Ju-On 3), good cinematography, subtle production design touches (check out Gellar's clothes, which match the color and texture of the exterior of Emma's house, when Gellar first approaches), and beautifully effective horror material.Even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past, the pacing usually enhances the eeriness, and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained. The supernatural premise of the film is absorbing, and based on interviews on the DVD with Shimizu, have prodded me to pay more attention to Japanese beliefs and folklore. Although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of Japanese culture, it's interesting to ponder why so many Japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary children.I subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichéd mystery/thriller territory with a "here's what really happened" flashback, but even that was fairly well done, and otherwise, this would have been a 10 out of 10.Now that I've said all of the above, let me finish with a mini-rant: It's not that I'm anti-remake, but it is ridiculous that U.S. distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption. The original versions of these films should just be playing in U.S. theaters in wide release. There is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white American actors for non-white or foreign actors. Yes, The Grudge is a fine film, but ultimately, I'd rather see something original using this talent, and be treated to the latest foreign horror films--not just Japanese, but also Indian, Spanish, Chinese, etc.--at my multiplex. In the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this, it is also more cost-effective to do this, as (1) you can completely avoid production costs, and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit, and (2) you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film DVDs in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was terrified during this great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what I wrote to some friends earlier:HOLY CRAP, The Grudge is, honest to God, one of the scariest films I've ever seen! I am either getting very soft in my old age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures did a KICK A** job! (Can't wait for Boogeyman!)I was very scared sitting in the dark theater and wished I had someone, anyone, sitting next to me (except the protagonist in Grudge. I saw the movie by myself.) I swear, there were many many jump scenes that were NOT expected! I felt foolish but my nerves did not care! I was on edge the entire movie, from the opening credits, and the music was fantastically scary. I keep thinking of that sound, though, and I DO NOT LIKE IT!I actually gasped aloud a few times, and cried, "oh" at one scene!! Oh, yeah, I even half-covered my eyes a few times! Word to the wise, though: I thought some of the scenes were a little psychotic. My DH hated Event Horizon and thought whoever wrote it was sick and psycho, but I don't remember the movie so can't compare.I can't say I "enjoyed" this movie b/c I was terrified, but it was very very good and scary. The ending scene, too...whoa! For being a 32-year-old-mommy, I think I may have nightmares from this movie, especially because of that sound. Please get out of my head ;)In summary, this is not a slasher flick like I grew up with (Jason, Freddy). This is a most-of-the-time spooky movie. Perfect for Halloween.Two great trailers for this movie were Boogeyman and The Ring 2!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Massive multiple chills down the spine! I'm surprised there's people who didn't like it! I saw it at 10 o'clock in the morning and still got scared stiff! And I've seen hundreds of thrillers/horror movies! For crying out loud,I'm 22!!! I mean, OK, voice acting, not particularly good, probably even b-movie-ish. But the genuine look of terror, the sound effects, the flow! From the very start, hitting you again and again with relentless, unforgiving, terrorising scenes! So many clichés yet none fails to surprise/scare! You know it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, BOO! and you still jump off the chair. Grab a pillow and a blanket, call your closest friend over and do not watch it at night! Hats off to the Japanese!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nail in the coffin for Japanese horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to throw out lines like this, but in this case I feel like I have to: the American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst film I have seen in theaters in the last 5 years. There, I said it. And now that I have gotten that out of my system, please let me explain why."When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born. The curse gathers in that place of death. Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury." That is the premise of THE GRUDGE and I will admit it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately, the filmmakers take it no further. Those who encounter the "curse" are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get. You want more? Well too bad. Some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of THE GRUDGE is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no plot to speak of, creepy images and sounds can only go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu, pulling a George Sluizer and remaking his own original film(s), valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour ? by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over. It pretty much unfolds like this:-person walks into house-something flashes by the camera and/or a strange sound is heard -person goes to investigate-sound starts to get loud-person sees a ghost-loud scream and/or cat screech-cut to blackBefore the audience is even given a hint of plot, this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour. The first time was actually somewhat creepy. Each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on. By the time the end of the film rolled around, my friend and I were laughingly wondering if this scene would end "with a loud scream and a cut to black." We were never proved wrong.The film has no liner storyline, instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled. I have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it is done right. The film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason. I haven't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2. And this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had. If you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death, how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone?Obviously greenlit the second the American version of THE RING made $15 million its first weekend, THE GRUDGE is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie. The scariest things about THE GRUDGE are that it made $40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the "scariest movie ever made." I wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see THE GRUDGE?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>misunderstood by too many people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grantes; it's not possible to make a movie anywhere near perfect, but this one has been so misunderstood that I created an account and am writing my first review ever in its defense.If you don't like a movie that doesn't play by your rules (the characters must develop, the scenes must be sequential, ghosts can't leave their haunting grounds, any unresolved ending means a sequel...), then buy tickets to movies you know you'll like instead of getting disappointed and complaining. I don't mean to offend any of the readers or reviewers that thought badly of the movie, but the overwhelming negativity I found to be based more on false assumptions and adherence to non-universal traditions--spoilers ahead-- For those who didn't pay enough attention and got confused, here are some things people missed that are a little essential for keeping up with the plot (in no particular order or completeness): Yoko's jaw, which she is later without, is the bloody chunk in the attic. The gasoline used to burn the house was brought in by the detective. The lighter--also to burn the house--was not the heroine's, it was her boyfriend's (who we did in fact see smoking in the Buddhist mourner scene). The spirits are not ghosts as we think of them; other reviews have gone into depth to explain that. The creepy hair is a Japanese spirit trademark, like doors closing themselves in American horror. Bill Pullman's suicide is explained very thoroughly throughout the movie, if you remember all the parts and link them together.Another thing I would like to point out is the extreme differences between theater traditions around the world. Americans prefer a plot-based, character-driven experience. In Native American storytelling, in contrast, characters routinely change their names and appearances. Japanese kabuki theater purposefully avoided plot entirely. What I'm trying to say is that this movie is very easy to misunderstand when viewed in the American horror paradigm. There are thematic materials and deep traditions all over the place, and it really is a scary movie if you get into it and ignore the schoolchildren around you laughing at it, but if you don't pick up on (or at least accept) the deeper meanings then a lot of the experience is lost. The movie was (re)made for American audiences, so it isn't quite as quirkily Japanese as it could be; so just let the idiosyncrasies draw you in and then scare you ####less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review is really a word of warning, if you've seen any of the earlier Japanese versions of this story you've seen this movie before. If you've seen all four of the earlier films, you've really seen everything (except the frightening opening with Bill Pullman) and you'd best wait for home video.I understand that the film makers wanted to make sure that this film worked and made them money, so they repeated what worked, even casting the same Japanese actors for the kid and other roles; but it would have been nice if they had done more that was new beyond the opening sequence.This isn't to say that the film is bad, its not, rather, its just that unless you're walking in to the film fresh odds are you're going to be like me and know what each five or ten minutes is going to bring because of the set up of the sequence.For me it was a 6 out of 10, for fresh eyes probably higher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie definitely loses something in the translation. Unlike "The Ring" which equaled and even improved on the original story in some ways, this one just meanders along in an uninspired fashion.The original Japanese film, "Ju-on", was pretty incoherent, mostly just a series of set pieces and great chills. The American version, directed by the same filmmaker, has done nothing towards clarifying the muddled story and, aside from the great opening sequences, is just a straight-forward recreation of the same suspenseful sequences that somehow don't play as well. I'd suggest renting the original instead.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disastrous Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It helps seeing both the original, JU ON, and THE GRUDGE back to back to see why remakes just don't work most of the time and what one should never do in a horror film if the first version was already perfect. Rarely have they ever done so: except for Hitchcock's own re-telling of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH in 1956, most of the times they have failed miserably. This one retells the same story, eliminating two major plot arcs from the first (the three missing students who were at the house with the haunted detective's daughter, and Mariko's storyline who served to expand on the curse, here served by Bill Pullman's storyline), and adding a boyfriend to Sarah Michelle Gellar's Karen, as well as creating yet another brief role in the beginning -- the caretaker of the old lady, unseen in the first.THE GRUDGE is no exception to the rule of the unnecessary remake: While it does have one or two minor moments of silent dread as when Clea duVall's character meets her fate in the haunted house, the use of black tendrils and shock moments don't quite help bring the real horror, and Sarah Michelle Gellar conveys absolutely nothing in her scene when she is found crouched in a corner by the dead old lady (Grace Zabriskie), which negates the intense blankness that one could see in Megumi Okina's harrowed face in the original. I have a sneaking suspicion that this was a joint effort to capitalize on the success of JU ON and bring it (quite badly) upon the more complacent and less demanding American public. And while some of the elements of the Sakei family tragedy answers some questions, the essence of horror is to leave these questions partly answered, or unanswered. This always makes the insanity of what happens even more haunting, unsettling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Incredible shrinking audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I live in Switzerland and travel to Austria to see a movie in English language once a week. Its a fun thing to do because the film is always a 'Sneak' not yet on release film in Austria. Its also a surprise movie, so no-one knows what they are going to get till the curtain goes up. This is fine because it forces me to watch films I would never usually see out of choice. As always, the 'Sneak' was well attended with a starting audience of about 150. I was a bit doubt full about the film from the kick off, I mean, a lot of Japanese names on the opening credits and some non Japanese actors I never heard of... but I figured lets hang in and see what happens... Ten minutes into the movie, after a great deal of audience laughter the exodus started... twos and threes to start with then a steady flow with me almost wondering if there might be a fire back there when they found the jawbone in the roof space. As the final credits rolled a glanced over my shoulder (I like to sit in the front) and to my amazement saw that there were just 3 of us left! Thats right.. 3! I mean the move was bad... very bad.. but never in 40 years of regular movie going had I experienced anything like this. I found the effects passable at best, the direction a joke, the acting wooden and the script writer should do the honourable thing and fall on his sword... by the way.. if you saw the movie... don't you think the monster with the long lack hair and white skin looked familiar? Awooooooo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK when I saw the previews for this movie I thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group I was with. Now living in America especially during this election I see some very deceiving things but I have to say these previews were towards the top of list. I don't see how so many people could be scared by this movie. I only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one. The whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me. As for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of I thought they were comical at best. Oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning. How does that scare someone? I can make that noise easily. Now don't get me wrong I have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but I didn't even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a creepy horror movie with little plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie a lot. The plot is that whoever goes into this house dies. That's it. The movie begins with a shocking scene involving Bill Pullman; it pulls the viewer in. Then, it shows the house; and when the caretaker Yoko goes to investigate a noise upstairs, it was scary. And it really makes you jump out of your seat. Karen, played by Gellar, lives in Japan with her boyfriend studying abroad. She is sent to the house when Yoko doesn't show up for work, and the movie goes from there. There are a lot of creepy things that happen as the ghost stalks those that had been in the house. And the film shows flashbacks of what happened to the family that just moved into the house. And toward the end we find out what terrible thing happened that caused the house to be haunted.And I'm glad the movie had the ending it had. Because the curse lived on and it just didn't end with Karen being lead out of the house after it burned.FINAL VERDICT: Not the best ghost story I've seen, but good enough.

		<shortDescription>Lost In Translation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like "The Ring", "The Grudge" comes to us in an Americanized form, this time directed by the original Japanese filmmaker, and starring Sarah Michelle Gellar. The plot is simple: horrible events happen in a house and forever stain the place to the point where anyone and everyone who enters is cursed and will eventually be claimed by the ghosts who inhabit it. They are apparently traveling ghosts, too, because leaving the house doesn't save anybody.I don't know why these Japanese films seem to lose so much in translation. Perhaps it's the culture shock between Japan and America that helps make the movies, in their original forms, bizarre experiences for American viewers. Or maybe they are simply just better films. I haven't seen the original version of "The Grudge", but I'd bet it is a little better than this concoction.Sarah Michelle Gellar is an appealing heroine in the film, and the rest of the acting isn't bad. The special effects are also pretty good too, even for CGI ghosts. The best thing about the movie is that it has some great cinematography. It looks good, and there are a great number of eerie images in the movie. The sets are weird and otherworldly at times. I also liked the disjointed way the scenes fit together. The revelation of the reason for the ghostly activity wasn't exactly original or unexpected, but it was interesting the way it was revealed at the conclusion.My biggest complaint is that "The Grudge" simply wasn't scary. In fact, it was a little bit boring. I didn't feel a single moment of suspense during the entire film, and I generally knew what was going to happen next. There were more than a few glaring references to "The Ring", and the story is definitely similar.I was also confused by early plot outlines for this film which claimed that the curse "locked its victims in a rage before claiming their lives." Only one person flew into a rage in this film as far as I could tell. Well, unless you count the hundred or so people who were in the theater with me and flew into a rage when the credits rolled and they were still waiting for at least one good scare to justify the cost of their admission ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you like intelligently-written suspense and horror films? Then the Grudge is not for you. This film has a paper-thin plot, barely makes sense, shoddy-looking special effects, overused flashbacks, lackluster performances, and ultimately makes The Ring look like a masterpiece. Bill Pullman was grossly underutilized, albeit scanty screen-time was written that way in the script for him. I just can't believe Sam Raimi produced this film, because even the Evil Dead films blow this film away. I was one of three people in the theater viewing this film, and the other two left before the film was over. Stay far, far away from this movie. It is definitely not worth shelling out money for. This film leaves too many unanswered questions, including why this film was made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all this is my first review on any movie. I was so exited after watching The Grudge, I thought I should write a review on this. It is a great horror movie. It has got most of the stuff that needed to make a good horror movie. I agree that it doesn't have a good story, it has a paper thin plot but what it has is a pure horror that doesn't depend on any story at all. If this movie has got a great story to back it up then I think it might be the best horror movie of all time.One thing I really want to say here that this movie is heavily depends on some horror movie clichés, like sudden jump scenes, character following the strange noise that came from the dark corner of the house. But that actually is the plus point of this movie. They have presented in such a good way that it creates such a spooky atmosphere in the movie.If you want to really enjoy this gem of a horror then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation. And don't forget to switch the light off.It will scare the f**k out of you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than I thought it would be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was great. When I saw the Japanese version first, it was probably the scariest movie I had ever seen. It was not blood and guts, it was eerie, atmospheric and terrifying. When the mother ghost lent over the bed in the Japanese version, I nearly had a heart attack... I was concerned that the American version would be watered down, and that Buffy would take away from the dark creepy nuances of the original version. I needn't have been concerned. The makers of this movie wisely kept the same Japanese people who were involved with the original movie on hand, and gave the direction of the movie to the same man. They also set it in Japan in the same location, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original, the only difference was the casting of American actors. That actually turned into a benefit as it added the element of "Strangers in a Strange Land" to the overall horror. Not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost, but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land, having difficulty integrating into society. It just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and I thought it was an excellent touch.Buffy actually does a very good job. She looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well. There are none of the smart aleck remarks that are so common to American horror movies, or one liners that detract from the overall darkness and horror of the characters' situation. In fact, it was easily as good as The Ring which I also thoroughly enjoyed. I hope the future of American horror follows more closely the Japanese New Wave of horror started with the incredible success of Ringu. We are finally getting movies that actually can be categorized as "Horror"!! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Scariest Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have The Grudge on DVD and watched it again this morning with surround sound and a widescreen TV. It scared me just as much as the first time I ever saw. Unrelenting in its content and editing, they show you a quick glimpse of something with musical sounds added for extra scare value. I spoke with a young man who is half Japanese and he tells me that yes, this belief is common and true in Japan. They believe that when a person dies a violent death the essence of the crime remains and builds until anyone who becomes involved in any way, shape or form is affected by it. I've seen many films over the years but none can compare to the horror in this. What made it more terrifying is that it took place in Tokyo, Japan, a most unlikely place for a haunted house movie. There were no silly gimmicks, no laugh breaks to ease the tension, just horror upon horror building to a chilling climax. I suggest if you've never seen this movie, by all means do so. Today. Or preferably, tonight!</fullReview>

Don't get me started with the "dead child". Not even that scary! So what? He has a cat and he can imitate it, big freaking deal!

		<fullReview>I'm not sure I understand where all these enthusiastically anti-grudge people are talking about here, perhaps it's just that some people like to rant about things.The movie was certainly imperfect (uneven acting, some may have had difficulties with the time-changes, actors all too willing to go places I'd really rather not go, etc.) but IMHO there were some things that more than made up for the imperfections.First and foremost, I LOVED the 'breaking of the rules' bit. NORMALLY when you leave the haunted house the baddies leave you alone, giving you time to regroup, get friends, and find the token mysterious paranormal type. NORMALLY (semi-spoiler alert) when you're hiding under the covers they can only get you through that little opening you peek through. NORMALLY at the end the ghosts somehow have become less creepy because you've found out they're just misunderstood, or they've been freed, or whatever.Secondly, the production was exceptional. While the movie was hardly special-effects-laden the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well done.Probably not the best sort of movie for those who think Freddy and Jason are the ultimate sort of horror (nothing against 'em, they've got their place), but great for those who've begun to take the conventions for granted and who don't have trouble with the time distortions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine that you are asked by your date what movie you wanted to see, and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer about "The Grudge." So, in good faith, you recommend seeing that movie. It is the Halloween season, after all. And it did boffo box office this past weekend, so it must be pretty good...so you go.And you're actually in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it does, and you hear yourself audibly saying, "that can't be the end of the movie...." But, alas, it is. And imagine coming out of the movie theater being embarrassed and ashamed for recommending such a dog of a movie. You think that your date thinks you're a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity, and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship. Actually, it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was. I see no future for Miss Gellar in the movies, and suggest that she sticks to television in the future. Actually, it won't be long before she is consigned to flea-market conventions selling Buffy memorabilia, and it can't happen soon enough, if you ask me. Horrible, horrible, horrible. The plot didn't make sense; continuity was terrible. It's apparent that the whole ending was contrived to have a "Grudge II--The Return of 'Cat-Boy'."</fullReview>

There were so many 'surprise'-scenes (what's the English word?) that made you jump in your seat. Though, too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh. I think the most scary scene was... on the bus, when the face flashes by on the window, or when Yoko's walking without her chin. The make-up is also VERY good. Sometimes you could really see it was there, but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene. The boy was very good indeed, so cute without make-up and so terribly scary with it on. The next time I hear a cracking noise I will probably feel pretty scared...</fullReview>

For one thing, you never known all the story - just enough to leave you knowing that you missed something and you can't always figure out what. The movie stays with you longer.And another thing: Japanese ghosts are a heck of a lot scarier than American ghosts - I mean, how many American ghosts can leave the haunted house to kill someone? And you can't get rid of a Japanese ghost no matter how hard you try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The grudge stars Sarah Michelle Gellar as a woman dealing with a house in dire need of therapy. A tragedy happened there a while back and the house just refuses to let the anger go and move on. Basically, it's a slow moving movie, almost exactly like its predecessor, using the same sets and some of the same stars as well. Unfortunately the first movie wasn't that good either, but because it was original I gave it a higher rating than this version. One of my reasons being that the scariest moment in the first movie is about the only scene not duplicated in this remake (that of a woman staring down on the lady in bed while Toshio scratches his legs at the foot of it, as seen in the previews of the original.) Anyway, to sum things up,"The Grudge" has potential to be scary, but it's rather like an excellent set of blueprints drawn in crayon. Something's seriously wrong here.</fullReview>

The storyline made no sense whats so ever, all the events that occurred seemed like a big gigantic mess, that didn't connect with the outcome of the film. I had previously herd that The Grudge was known for its scare factor, but even this was a letdown--all we see and hear is a pair of eyes wildly opened and a sound effect which to me is very similar to Predator (1987.) In conclusion, If you like horror films with a confusing story, no character development or no scare factor there's something wrong with your tastes in movies, however you will love The Grudge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mind's going' a hundred miles a minute. I've got an idea for a double sequel that'll knock the socks off of all them big shots in Hollywood (or is it Tokyo? I just can't tell any more). A guy, we'll call him Sam Michael Gillman, hears from his friend in Japan that he needs a house sitter to watch his place for a week. Well, Sam has never been to Japan so he figures this will be a good opportunity to go there on the cheap. Before he boards the plane he figures he should pick up some English language videos to watch while he's there. He gets to Japan and he has a taxi take him to his friend's house, only he mispronounces the name of the street and the taxi driver takes him to The Grudge death house by mistake. Oh my!!! Sam goes in the house. Fortunately for him, even though there was actually no one LIVING in the house at the time, the electricity and phone still work. So, Sam makes himself comfortable and puts one of his videos into the VCR. It's a strange video with a girl in a well and a spooky glowing ring. When it's over the phone rings and he's told he would normally have 7 days to live but in this case death happens to be on holiday in Japan, so she's coming right over. In the meantime, there is a noise that seems to be coming from the attic. Sam thinks all this is very odd. He looks up on the stairs and there is a black cat, a little Asian boy, a young somber Asian lady, and this really angry fellow. He's trying to make out what they want. He is strangely compelled to pick up the cat, help the little boy, and then go up and join them in the attic. Whatever it is they want, they are alternating from looking like just regular folks to appearing as horribly scary ghost people! Sam is intrigued and is thinking this must all be quite normal in Japan, when there is a knock at the television. Suddenly, and without warning, on this dark and stormy night, the girl that was in the video crawls through the television and walks slowly toward Sam. "Are these friends of yours?", Sam asks the TV ghoul, pointing to the stairs. All the odd dead people look at each other and try in vain to communicate with froggy croaking sounds. What will happen?! Will they duel to the death? (Er, probably not to the death). Whatever happens, it's bound to be really scary! And bound to have an ending that is nonsensical and goes nowhere!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most scariest ghost/horror movie I have seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Grudge" is quite possibly the most scariest ghost/horror movie I have ever seen. Sarah Michelle Gellar takes on the main role as nurse Karen living and working in Tokyo. While working she is exposed to a supernatural curse involving a vengeful spirit which locks a person in a powerful rage before claiming his/her life and spreading its curse to another person.This movie starts out with Karen moving to Tokyo with boyfriend Doug (Jason Behr), where we get a taste of drama as they adjust to their new lives in Japan. The suspense builds when they encounter mysterious events in the house Karen is a caretaker in and, what follows, are one creepy moment one after the other as main ghosts Kayako (Takako Fuji) and Toshiro (Yuya Ozeki) take center stage, wreaking havoc with those unfortunate enough to cross its path.Takashi Shimizu did a great job directing the movie that grabs the audience attention with scenes that send chills down your spine, has moments that make you jump, and has disturbing images that will stick in your mind after the movie is over. The mysterious yet dramatic atmosphere of the movie created an eerie feeling of the ongoing horror and the built-up suspense, which are contributed by the cast members' realistic and dramatic acting. Some of the plot lines dangled and are unexplained, but that is a minor flaw.Overall, this is a movie with the right balance of horror and drama - no over-the-top stuff. If you are a fan of horror movies, "The Grudge" is highly-recommended.Grade B+</fullReview>

It seems that all you need is an eerie visual or two that is slightly unsettling and creepy, an unworldly sound effect or two, jumble the Films chronology (for that most Modern of Style) and Millions of Bucks can be yours.This is an overrated Movie that has spawned sequels and imitators. It is in fact and imitator itself. it is not only an imitator it is a remake, by the same Director. it has just been Americanized. But all that is not the problem. This is just not very cleverly conceived. It is a variety of setups to announce scares and a string of similar looking shots not so strategically placed, to build tension.In the end, it is of course, open ended, almost a prerequisite for Horror Movies, and is so Story shallow and anemic that it is quite disconcerting that a few jumps and a creepy makeup style is what makes a successful franchise. Can Mediocrity really be this rewarding. Financially yes. Artistically no.</fullReview>

So I watched a couple of clips about the movie and I was quite terrified afterwards. I definitely wanted to see the movie cause I really enjoy horror films even though they scare me to death.This on the other hand, didn't. I watched this quite easily and I didn't even have to hide behind our couch and that is saying a lot, trust me. Sure, Kayako is pretty creepy and all but I didn't get the feeling which I usually have when I watch a horror film - the chills and all. My expectations were pretty high, I admit it, but still, it needed something more to be actually scary.I did like watching this film nevertheless - all at least it wasn't wasted time that I used. The plot is quite interesting and Kayako's story is just sad. The idea about that much of rage and grudge is scary but the implementation wasn't.Anyway, I have to say - I am disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland Film... Not Sure Why So Much Money Was Earned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A social worker (Sarah Michelle Gellar) goes to work in a house that has a horrible power inside it. The "grudge" lingers there and tries to kill all who come into its path.I didn't want to see this film when it came out, and I only watched it now almost three years later because it seemed like an obligation. I think it was as bad as I expected, maybe even worse. The best actor in the film (Bill Pullman) was given such a weak part that he couldn't have saved it if he tried.The actor who impressed me most was Ryo Ishibashi, who played the police chief. He has been showing up in more American versions of Japanese films lately, and I can understand why. He "gets it" and can play to either audience with equal fervor.Sarah Michelle Gellar would seemingly be a great one for horror (all those years of Buffy, and a handful of other horror films) but she never really seems to get out of the "teen movie" groove and into a more terrifying frame of mind. Ted Raimi, on the other hand, is better here than ever before. His work in "Skinner" and "The Damned Thing" was disappointing. But he was better here than he's been since "Intruder". And Clea Duvall is always a nice touch. William Mapother (best known as Tom Cruise's cousin) showed up, but he has never been good, not even on "Lost".I wasn't scared by the "comb noise" (the thing that comes out of the ghosts' mouths), but I freely admit I put my head under my blanket during the security camera scene. Ever since "The Ring" (which this obviously rips off) I have been afraid of sinister little girls who meander towards a camera at a jagged pace. Well, that and the fact little girls in general are very scary (and more so when they grow up).I was unclear why some of the victims were attacked (especially the sister/daughter working in the office). Her connection to the house was pretty minor. But maybe I missed something, and I'm not going back to catch it again.If thee was any reason to watch this, it would be for Ted Raimi or to get it out of your system or for the beautiful music of Christopher Young. I don't think many people pay attention to the score of a film, bu they ought to. Young is the genius behind the "Hellraiser" music (a good soundtrack, you should buy it). And he hasn't lost his edge in the past two decades. No one does horror like Young. Unfortunately, even the best music does not make a film good... and this one just plain stinks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As it seems my comment will be at the end of perhaps a few thousand, I doubt it will be read - but I need to vent.I love films which scare me to the core. This was not one of those films. Ordinarily I may have been able to enjoy it anyway, but the thing that drives me creeping up the wall like one of those crazy grey devil people is that this film was billed as being similar to The Ring. Now _that's_ a film that chilled my _soul._ And yes, I'm referring to the American remake of Ringu.For me, scares are about nasty surprises that kick in a fight/flight reflex. I'm comfortable in my assumption that there's no spider sitting next to me on my desk, so when I find that there _is,_ I jump. Just how much I jump seems to depend on how confident I am in my assumption. If I expect a spider to be there I'll be wary, but not as shaken when I see it.The same principle applies to films that I see. I'm always going to jump if a ghostly white face suddenly appears in a bus window. Or little scary grey spirits appear sitting idly in the corner of a room. The Grudge relies almost wholly on these cheap jumps - and after a while, once my nerves were shot, they became almost boring. Once I'm out of the theatre, however, I won't think about it again. There's no lasting feel of _dread._ So we get back to the comparison with The Ring and why that irritates me so much.The Ring was a textbook example on how to scare the pants of someone, and keep scaring them long after they've gone home. Perhaps some of this has to do with the fact that I went in expecting to see a formula Hollywood scary movie, but whatever. That film uses most of it's time slot preparing the audience for one brilliant fright. It winds us up, gets us scared using all the little devices, lets us think it's wound down and that the spirits are happy. Then little Aiden wants to know why his mummy let the ghost out of the well. "You weren't supposed to do that, Rachel." It's one line delivered by a small child in the light of day - and yet no film since has been able to terrify me as much.That said, one scene of The Grudge I really did like was the one with Susan in the elevator. The little kid Toshio appearing in the window on each floor without her noticing was tres creepy.Okay, enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've seen both Ju-on and Grudge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ju-on is wayyyy better. Ju-on is much more disciplined (as disciplined as it can be with the format of the story). Ju-on avoids much of the cheap shock tactics that are used in Grudge (especially the end). The use of light and shadow are also better in Ju-on. The scene with the Raimi and the dead woman who lost her jaw was just silly and served no purpose in the story except to go for the gross out effect. I was agitated that they cut out the detective and his daughter from the original movie. I'm surprised I disliked the Grudge so much. I mean, they had the same director for both movies. But for a variety of reasons, some I mentioned above, others I left out, the movie just didn't work. Grudge is just lame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sentiment You May Hold After Seeing It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the most remarkable thing about "The Grudge" is that this kind of film is still being made at all. In what amounts to a knockoff of a remake of any already too rehashed idea, "The Grudge" offers nothing that's new or refreshing in a genre that for all practical purposes has seen better days--at least in this structure.Karen (Sarah Michelle Geller) is a student living in Tokyo with her boyfriend Doug (Jason Behr), and both give equally limited performances in their roles, though it should be said that there isn't much to work with for either character, and both roles amount to little more than catalysts designed to set the stage for the supernatural events in which they become entangled.In a nutshell (which is more than large enough to contain this overly simplistic plot), Karen, in need of some credits in social service, is sent to the home of Emma, an invalid who suffers from some form of dementia, after the regularly assigned worker fails to show up (we know why, since we're privy to her dispatch during the opening credits.) Karen soon discovers an evil presence in the house, all related to a double murder/suicide which occurred several years earlier. And, as we are also to learn, in Japan, once such evil befalls a house, it never leaves--which I believe also holds true in Transylvania and several other places, too. Anyway, everyone who would ever live in this place would be subjected to the wrath--or more precisely, 'the grudge', held by those who were killed there. Episodically, and through some flashbacks that contribute more to a level of confusion than clarity, details of the murders unfold, and we are increasingly given more visual information of the not-very-dead-but-very-evil-spirits. Suggestions, allusions and intimations abound, but nothing of any real consequence ever actually happens to these characters, nor to any of the other myriad of characters."The Grudge", directed by Takashi Shimizu, a reworking of his original Japanese "Ju On" concept designed to include American actors and English for obvious box office appeal, isn't really a bad film, but it's extremely mediocre and predictable. But if you can look beyond the obvious and clichéd devices, you'll see that it has some notable cinematography by Hideo Yamamoto, and an effective, muted lighting design that are both worthy of a much better and more serious effort. Mostly though, it relies on an overworked, and too often, unimaginative plot, and it fails to incorporate any traits of humanism in the mostly unseen, evil beings. What made characters like Dracula, Quasimodo, Frankenstein, The Invisible Man--even King Kong--so frightful, was their embodiment of human traits and the inner conflict between their humanity and their monstrosity. More than just making viewers afraid of its horror character, a film should also impart to the viewer the fear, however unlikely one may deem it, that becoming such a fearsome monster--whether by accident of nature, science, or psychology--is, perhaps, just a misstep away. That's what's scary. Cutting quickly to close ups of fleeting, ephemeral images, reinforced by loud audio crescendos for punctuation, may provide shocks of involuntary startle responses, but it doesn't really create--or worse--doesn't sustain any real suspense or tension. There is a decided lack of any cumulative effect to all of these sounds and images in "The Grudge", and no subsequent lingering doubts as to whether such evils could really exist in the world. A good horror film should at least raise that remote possibility, even to the most ardent doubters of such phenomena. And if you don't think that can happen, watch "The Exorcist".© 2004</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting a lot more from this movie. Having seen the ring (both Japanese and American versions) I expected something really scary this time. but apart from a couple of sounds and gray faces this flick is just plain. Besides, what's the story? Some things are nice, though. Like the camera movements, and the lights. But again, what's the story? When you see a big name like Sarah Michelle Gellar, you expect a kick-ass movie, but this time what do you get? A very slow movie in which they tell you a story that could be 10 minutes long in about an hour and half. Some scenes seem to have been copied from the ring... I give this movie 2 out of 5 in my preferred list of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pretty stoked about seeing this movie after I was pleasantly creeped out by The Ring.Unfortunately this movie is just so average as far as the plot goes, it just doesn't deliver. The story doesn't go beyond evil spirit that just wants to kill whatever crosses it's path. The origin of the spirits are revealed throughout the movie, but there is no great shock or twist to it. It is just straight forward. The devices used to try and scare the audience are taken straight out of horror movies 101 and offer nothing new.The ending was extremely weak as well using a device that has been seen a thousand times in a thousand other horror movies. It didn't have that moment where something unexpected was revealed that made your skin crawl. That moment was great in the Ring when we thought everything was good and the danger over and found out it wasn't. There was no punch with this movie and it just wasn't scary except for the something jumps out of a closet and makes you jump type scare.The acting was only average and the visuals were good but not great. There is a key scene that seems to borrow heavily from The Ring so even the visuals had a recycled feel to them. I expected so much more from this movie and it just ended up being re-hashed horror basics thrown into the setting of Japan.If you haven't seen The Ring, watch that instead. If you want a romp through the horror basics and don't want to have to think, this is your movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed Feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings about The Grudge. With most movies, I have a pretty strong feelings in terms if I like it, hate it, or just think it's amusing. However, this is a different and I am not too sure why.Let me say that I have never seen the original. Since I have seen the American version, I am tempted to go and rent the original so I can compare and probably have a better view of this movie. But that will be later.This is what I liked. First of all, the direction was good as well as the effects created by the environments of the house, flashbacks, etc. The movie itself, on a whole, was well made and edited. Unlike other thrillers, the feeling of suspense wasn't too much or too little.However, here are the problems. First of all, I think Sarah Michelle Gellar's part should have gone to a Japanese actress. I know this was made for an American audience, but it would have been more powerful if a Japanese character was made central to the story. Not a American exchange student doing her best to fit into the culture. The other Americans could still be included, but a Japanese actress with Gellar's part would have added something.In reading the trivia section provided by IMDb, I read that the movie was edited to a pg-13 rating, cutting out more of the graphic scenes. I think that was another bad decision because more of the violent memories (or flashbacks, I don't know what they actually were of course), would have given the audience a more intimate sense of what happened in that house. What scenes were provided at the end of the movie, when Geller sees what happened to the woman and her son, was well done. I can only speculate that the scenes edited out where more like that.However, despite my misgivings about The Grudge, I have to say that it was better then I thought it would be. It was also better then The Ring which still baffles me in terms of why so many people liked it. More graphic scenes and better casting could have made it much better though. It will be interesting to see how a sequel works. My mixed feelings still stand, thus the reason I give this movie five out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another remake of a Japanese horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Karen (Michelle Gellar)is hired as a nurse for an old American woman in a Japanese house. As she is nursing the woman they are both exposed to a supernatural scary event. It turns out that a crime has been committed in that very house three years ago and there's a Japanese saying that whenever someone dies in a rage this victim will come back with a vengeance and kill everyone who enters the house in the same rage.Though it's easy to see that Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the main character she never gets interesting (besides her looks of course). Moreover, if you have watched "the ring" and "the eye" this movie will certainly disappoint you even though it has its moments. The ending is also very easy to spot after a couple of minutes, but, of course, it shouldn't be revealed here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie. One of the scariest movies I've seen in a while. I would not recommend young children to watch it late at night though. It could give them nightmares. What makes it scary is the way the ghost (Kayako Fuji) is presented. Those eyes. They stand out and certainly grab your attention. I would hate to encounter someone with that look in my house! I'd run right thru the wall. The little boy was kind of spooky too but not like Kayako. Sarah Michelle Gellar's fright is very believable. Who wouldn't be frightened? It was very well done I think, the ghost scenes, the setting. It was just a good movie. I would recommend it to friends or anyone who wants a good scare. The original version I would like to see too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid plot, creepy noises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I saw the Grudge this weekend and I have to say I was rather disappointed. Apparently, these Japanese horror films don't translate well to English, because the entire plot of this one was just stupid. For starters, the whole concept is that 'if a person dies in a fit of great rage, then a curse is born', but the ghosts weren't in rage when they died. The guy who killed them was. Secondly, there was no reason for the great rage. The husband finds out that his wife has the hots for this professor... so what? Happens every day, and 'grudges' aren't born from them. You keep waiting for some kind of payoff, but it never comes. There were some good creepy scenes, like the creaking noise that kept coming from the mother, and the reflection on the bus, but all in all, it was just a disappointing movie and a lame ghost story (coming from a guy who LOVES ghost stories!)..3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suck or Blow?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do yourself a favor - don't waste your time on this movie. The scares are pathetic at best and the plot is not far behind the scares. I heard such great reviews from others regarding this lackluster film that I just had to see it. After renting it and suffering through the slow-moving plot, I find it hard to believe that a movie of this caliber actually made it to the big screen. Seeing SMG play a role in a film should have been warning enough that it wasn't going to be very good. Her role as Bluffy the Vampire Slayer was more interesting than her role in this failed attempt at entertainment. She certainly bluffed her way onto the silver screen. This movie was comparable to "The 6th Sense" and "Unbreakable" in excitement, thrills, chills, action, suspense and any other aspect of theatrical composure that you might look for in a movie. I was severely disappointed in being subjected to such a poor plot. It is a shame that Hollywood thinks so little of their audience as to throw something like this at them and think "They'll love it!" "B"-rate acting at best and so predictable was the plot. No spoilers needed here to tell you what the next move will be in this movie. I can't recall how many times I told my buddies what the next words were going to be, or what the next event was going to be. I would rather go on a date with my ex-wife than be forced to watch this movie again.Ugh! Pathetic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, I have seen Ju-On and "The Grudge" seems to be almost identical to it. I don't think Sarah Michelle Gellar can act her way out of a small box, and she adds to this mess. I think some of the noise effects were good, and if your watching it at home on your surround sound, it may give you a few jumps here and there. The problem is that if you've seen Ju-On you know what is going to happen or not happen and that made me have less interest in the flick. so if you've seen ju-on, don't bother cause you have seen the movie. If you haven't seen ju-on, i guess rent "the grudge", but then go watch ju-on, because that movie is a lot better at providing you with horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once in awhile, you encounter a meal that lacks virtually all of the qualities that make a meal worth eating. The food has no texture, no taste, no nutritional substance and it is visually unappealing. It isn't repugnant, it is just lacking in all the qualities that make food pleasurable. And, although it is not overtly offensive, it is just a chore to eat it .The Grudge is like that.There is no intriguing narrative arc. The characters are not developed to the point where you might start caring about any of them. There is no real emotional involvement. And, well, there is nothing like a pleasing or edifying resolution. There isn't really a hero that you can cheer for. Or anything in the way of grim humor.There aren't even really any intriguing attempts at murky metaphysical explanations of the kind horror fans enjoy, or not much of a one, anyway. Visually, it is plain vanilla. And so on and so forth. Pretty much a waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has a very "convienient" plot that automatically allows everything that happens in it to make no sense whatsoever. Sure, you don't expect a masterpiece story line in a horror movie, but come on, this one sounds like a very bad ghost story you would laugh at by the camp fire. So basically what you have here is a pile of supposedly creepy scenes consisting of worn out images of zombie looking children, cats, something that looks like hair i suppose it was, you have some burping and meowing sound effects to amplify the level of senselessness. I guess the makers assumed it would be scary since people are supposed to be scared what they don't understand and rationally explain. Well, not here. Yes I admit, some moments might creep you out on occasion, but it becomes obvious quite quickly that the extremely poor plot is just a cheap excuse to put a bunch creepy images in the movie. Nope, doesn't work, because what perfectly backs up creepy visuals, is the creepy story. But I guess we couldn't have both.I don't know. Maybe I'm too demanding. Maybe a bit of effort is too much to ask these days. Maybe I've been playing too much Silent Hill (because that, although not a movie, is a perfect combination of extremely creepy story and creepy images, and the 'fear of the unexplained' theory works perfectly there).Not a good movie. I'll give it 3 burping zombie girls up.</fullReview>

Really, there is no character development and no real plot to speak of. There are only the most skeletal of motivations for the characters to do anything while they trudge forward to their unavoidable dooms. It's all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid (who seems to have gotten some of the family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm) and his ghost mom (with long black hair hanging in her face kind of like "The Ring") take down a bunch of cardboard cut-out, two-dimensional excuses for human characters.This English-language version of "The Grudge" is the equivalent of cinematic junk food; satisfying momentarily, but not really what you ought to be living on.Not recommended.</fullReview>

Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury.Peter Kirk (Bill Pullman) kills himself jumping off his apartment balcony in Japan.Yoko visits elderly Emma (Grace Zabriskie) living in a Tokyo house. She is attacked by a spirit. Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a student nurse living in Tokyo with her boyfriend Doug (Jason Behr). Karen takes over Yoko's job with Emma after she disappeared. Karen finds little boy Toshio trapped in a taped up closet.The movie flashes back to when Emma is first shown the house with her kids Susan (KaDee Strickland) and Matthew (William Mapother) and his wife Jennifer (Clea DuVall).The only interesting thing in this movie is Japan. Sadly, it doesn't even take full advantage of that since most of this takes place inside the house. The spirits aren't that creepy and not scary at all. The kills aren't gruesome. It's just very tame. There really isn't anything to this movie. There is also a problem with all these tangentially connected characters. They have no emotional relationship with SMG's Karen. The disconnected nature really lowers the stakes of this movie. The spirit chasing KaDee Strickland in Japan is the most compelling sequence but again she has no real connection with Karen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never a huge fan of Ju-On, but I decided to give The Grudge a chance because I was at least into the atmosphere of the original. The Grudge, while spooky at times and with a few worthwhile jump-out scares, isn't really anything special. It seemed to be a bit too ambitious for its own good. While some films like Fight Club or Memento managed to pull off bizarre timelines without a hitch and gain critical acclaim, The Grudge attempted and failed to tell a non-linear story. The result was a mess of vignettes that were connected only by the same house and central theme.I would have rated this film much higher if it were possible to even try to follow. It defies conventional horror tropes pretty well and does a good job at straddling the border between American and Japanese horror. The fact that it was basically Ju-On but with white people and a lot more confusing was somewhat laughable, though.Overall, it was an incredibly ambitious attempt that didn't do much for me. I'm a huge horror fan but the fact that it was nearly impossible to follow the storyline and I just couldn't relate or bond with any of the characters, so there was very little emotion when someone died.I'd suggest skipping this one and trying something like the similar film The Ring or the Chinese horror film The Eye. This film and the original just don't really go anywhere exciting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE ONLY POTENTIAL SPOILER IS THAT I DESCRIBE THE ESSENCE OF NEARLY ALL Japanese HORROR SCENES)The rule of thumb for watching any Japanese horror film that is remade in Hollywood is to go for the original, subtitles be damned. The one exception is The Ring. The Grudge remake, made by the exact same director of the original, is a series of confusing, disconnected creepy scenes until the end where you kinda-sorta get an explanation. No plot. Just typical stupid horror movie characters doing stupid things. "Oh, let's go check out that really creepy sound all by myself after I found my wife/mother/girlfriend/pet dead/catatonic/(insert-state-of-being-here)." Having seen nearly all the Japanese horror flicks, there is a clear culture of fear of long black hair, water and eyeballs or mouths that are stretched/blacked out via PhotoshopCGI. When you experience it for the first time, it's scary. The second time, it's interesting. For the third, fourth, ...., it's yaaawwwwwnnnn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay i'm not a big fan of Japanese horror, although i have seen the original version of The Ring and thought it was OK, but this really is a bad movie on all levels.First, the characterisation is awful. We learn nothing about each character except a very brief overview before they get killed off. As a way of creating pathos for the victims it's not ideal.Second, it's very annoying. None of the characters put up a fight when they get killed, either cowering in fear or standing stock still as their doom very slowly approaches in the form of s small child or woman screaming at them.Third, it's not very scary. There's the standard 'OMG, it's right behind her' and the mirror reflection shot, but other than that it relies upon the aforementioned sinister child and woman to chill our spines. Whilst their stilted movements might be kinda creepy on the first few occasions, by the time half a dozen hapless individuals have met their demise in this manner, it's become very dull indeed.Fourth, it makes the error of adding that mind-numbingly stupid end sequence in which the villain of the piece appears unscathed at the end of the piece, ready to strike the heroine down, thus rendering the entire last twenty minutes, and indeed the film utterly pointless. This is a modern film-making trend in the horror/thriller genre, and it should not be encourage Worst of all though is the fatalism of it all. So everyone who enters the house dies and there's nothing that can be done to stop it. Why would we want to watch a film like that? One after one characters are killed of for no other reason than that they once entered a house, and there's nothing that can save them. Talk about depressing.As such this renders 'The Grudge' completely unwatchable. Not even the divine Sarah Michelle Gellar can make it anymore enjoyable, truly terrible. Avoid, Avoid, Avoid or read a book instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was the biggest waste of money i have ever spent. The plot was absolutely terrible. I do not think i can even call anyone's performance in this film acting. If you enjoy a good horror movie with good writing/directing/acting this movie is not for you. The movie did what it was supposed to do: make money and give you a few jumps. I came out of theater after seeing this film hearing people say how good of a movie it was. The only positive this movie had was good camera movement and lighting. The negatives could go on forever.If your looking for a good movie DO NOT SEE THIS FILM.If your looking for a waste of time and money, i would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie is NOT Classified 'Horror'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Have seen this movie before. But I had not paid any attention to it whatsoever. Today I decided to watch it. After Hiring it, I turned on my DVD player. I sat there for the first part, that was the "only" part which made me scream. After seeing the grudge face a couple of times, i thought, "My gosh, this is not "horror." I sat there for over an hour thinking this movie is so boring. The ending was even worse. I am so glad I have not seen the Grudge 2, I Reckon it will be worse than the first one. I would not classify this movie as 'horror' I'd classify it as "Crap." There should be more blood &amp; guts for 'horror' movies. And more action that leaves you with a Cliff-hanger most of the time. Not just sitting there waiting for it to end. The best Horror Movie I saw, was "Without Warning."(in the 70's-80's) That alien's face still haunts me everyday. If any of you would like to see the grudge, Just know that it is a waste of time and there is poor horror included.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A muddled mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge is rather a mess of a film. Most obviously, the chronology and perspective constantly changes but the film is written in such a way that most of the flashbacks and perspective shifts primarily exist to give detail to information that has already been conveyed through exposition, or that is obvious through inference. As a result, most of the storytelling falls flat and the film lacks suspense since the viewer already knows what's going to happen most of the time. At the same time, none of the characters are really fleshed out so it's hard to care about them to begin with. Amusingly for an American version of this most of the principal characters just happen to be Americans living in Japan and mostly speaking English. If the film did anything at all with this cultural conflict it might be fun to ponder whether the apparitions just really hate Americans but alas, even this bit of fun is absent, and this is just another missed opportunity for some relatively obvious and easy character development that just doesn't show up. The other major problem with this film is that the actual spirit that is killing people is barely seen for the majority of the film and when it does show up it just comes across as an inferior version of the malevolent entity from The Ring, an obvious influence. Instead, most of the film uses the spirit of a young boy in a muddled way. The boy is somewhat creepy because of his appearance, which provides all the menace that can be summoned from black eye makeup and a generous slathering of corpse paint. At the same time, he still looks like a very young boy and, for me at least, this inspired the usual sympathetic feelings I have towards a young child. The juxtaposition between his appearance and this sympathy almost becomes something interesting but once the film seemed to imply that he might be responsible for the deaths of some adults the situation took a turn for the absurd because there really isn't that much menace to be had from any child unless there's something obvious to the menace beyond appearance. In any case, Shimizu overuses the child character and underuses the actual malevolent entity, not that she's all that threatening except in comparison to the boy. She's just a ghost with a "grudge" because she died in terrible pain and now she just kills people that come to her old house, because...well, the film certainly doesn't do anything to explain why she would want to kill people or why she mostly just haunts the house but sometimes leaves it to go after people that have been there before. Especially in comparison to The Ring, The Grudge fails to establish the power or motivation of its malevolent spirit at any point and in fact it's hard to imagine why she would be so powerful. All in all, this story simply isn't told very well and several aspects of it fail. It's hard to believe that this is actually the third or fourth time the director tried to tell this story given how poorly he tells it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How is this film at 5.7?? When films like Deep Blue Sea are on 5.7 and Quarentine 2 is on 5.3, both of these films have better story lines, a more realistic killer and better special effects.The Grudge is basically a woman without a hairbrush, wearing white face paint and chasing Sarah Michelle Gellar around! The storyline is flimsy, slow and boring and only picks up slightly at the end, i'm gutted they decided to make a second and a third one as the first one was so bad, and they didn't have much to live up to.Im very disappointed with this film as it stars Sarah Michelle Gellar, so i had high expectations when i first watched it as she was amazing in Buffy The Vampire Slayer, but actors can only work with what they are given and they weren't given much .... at all.I would avoid this film all together as it was a waste of time and money, but if you do want a good scary horror film then i would suggest; the woman in black, mirrors, the ring, the sixth sense or devil. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vengeful specter kills everybody go into a haunted house</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Japan when a nurse is assigned to visit a family she's chased by a vengeful and supernatural spirit that possesses its victims. Meanwile a man (Bill Pullman) commits suicide dropping himself from a high apartment. Karen Davis (Sara Michelle Gellar) a volunteer social agrees to cover another assistant. He goes to the ghastly house and find an elderly woman (Grace Zabrinski.) Then happen several flashbacks about the family (Clea Duvall, her husband and his sister KaDee Strickland). A series of terrible and mysterious deaths occur. A Police Inspector (Ryo Ishibashi) attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery. But Karen is also racing to saves her boyfriend (Jason Behr) and must now find to break the horrifying spell.This frightening movie displays terror, shocks, hard-edged drama and creepy images. While the look is suitable atmospheric and eerie, the argument stretches plausibility to the breaking point. This is an acceptable adaptation of the novel and movie that took successfully Japan. Nice cinematography by Yamamoto, Takashi Miike usual cameraman. Well produced in Japan by Robert G. Tapert and Sam Raimi and of course with intervention his brother Ted Raimi, as always. The motion picture is professionally directed by Takashi Shimzu in similar style to Hideo Nakata movies -The ring, Dark Water-. Shimzu is an expert on horror cinema with creepy phantoms of pale complexion and long hair . After that, he made ¨Reincarnation¨ also called ¨Rinne¨ again with palish phantoms and ¨Marebito¨ about a vampire in the Tokyo underground. It's followed by Grudge II again with Sara Michelle Gellar and Amber Tamblyn and similar equipment technical and artistic ; furthermore in production the third part. Rating : Acceptable and passable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let this curse die right here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ten minutes into The Grudge I started to think about another recent movie, which is always cause for alarm bells. Though hardly a memorable movie, The Butterfly Effect ends with Ashton Kutcher beaming himself into his mother's womb and strangling himself with his umbilical cord, in the belief he should never have existed. Oh boy. There's a p*ss-easy metaphor for this pointless remake that should never have seen the light of day. Sitting in the cinema on my left is The Grudge's target audience: the Wide-Eyed Western Pig. A slack-jawed foot soldier for Hollywood's war of cultural imperialism, he trades the art-house for the megaplex as he prefers their fake butter flavor on his popcorn, views "Blockbuster" as a seal of quality, and wants a cute, familiar, WHITE face to focus on. Elsewhere the Horror Fetishist, a sad Pavlovian creature conditioned to lick its own d*ck whenever the name "Sam Raimi" appears on screen, is busy doing a lap of honor during the opening credits. These people have money. These people vote. These bottom-feeders are the mindless consumers the Dream Factory keeps chained to cigarette machines and Gold Lotto slips. Buds: this Grudge is for YOU. The original Ju-on: The Grudge, the story of a self-perpetuating curse centering on a family's tragic murder-suicide, was an effective if empty and ultimately silly variant on the seemingly endless Ring cycle and was itself spawned from two TV movies. At this point producer Sam Raimi, no virgin to the concept of franchise, waved a huge sack o'cash under director Takashi Shimizu's inscrutable gaze, not for him to reinterpret the movie, but to do a carbon copy of it. In Japan, with a Japanese crew. Virtually scene for scene, and in some cases shot for shot, on an almost-identical set, but with wide-eyed western stars Sarah Michelle Gellar and Bill Pullman. The message here? Money will make it better. Dance, monkey. Do a jig to the tune of two thousand megaplex cash registers all chiming at once. Jump through the hoops just a little faster, 'cos Buffy wants a new series. If the original Grudge had anything unique, it was its innate "Japanese-ness". Not so here. There's no sense of mounting horror in Shimizu's tired retread which gives the game away in the first 10 minutes, leaving its shocks all the more absurd. To add insult, its episodic structure has been tampered with by a Hollywood scriptwriter who explains away the inexplicable. Surely producer Raimi, while counting down the paychecks till Evil Dead 4, must have realized the Japanese horror film is like a bonsai tree, in its own culture a thing of symmetry, beauty and perfection. Stick it in a tiled pot in the Mall outside Hoyts Regent and it becomes a stupid looking tree. This isn't just a case of a remake, an updating or yet another pointless sequel. This is unmitigated arrogance - Hollywood saying "do it OUR way, and we can all make a chunk of change". Shimizu should have learned the lessons of history. The original directors of two effective European chillers The Vanishing and Nightwatch were both sent packing to the States to "Americanize" their movies. Does anyone remember George Sluizer or Ole Bornedal? Did anyone give a rat's *ss about the remakes? It's even more proof the Dream Factory has gone bankrupt for ideas, and Scrooge McDuck is at the helm, throwing cloth bags with dollar signs on them even further afield. This is a war, make no mistake, and for the moment the Wide-Eyed Western Pig is winning. What next? Ang Lee's remake of Crouching Tiger... with Casper Van Dien? Have mercy, and let this curse die right here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea was not bad. Everything else was. What was needed was a different director, cast, soundtrack, editor, and just about anyone else connected with it. Anyone who thinks this movie is in the least bit scary had better not go in the haunted mansion at Disneyland because they'd probably die of fright in there. Columbia pictures should be ashamed of itself for producing such a pathetic piece of trash. I watched this "movie" only because someone I was with wanted to watch it. This movie makes "Shark Attack 1, 2, and 3" seem like Oscar contenders. I will point out a possible "spoiler". At one time one of the "brain dead" stars tries to leave a building in town. She's on the 10th floor. As she attempts to leave, she hears a noise and goes into a stairwell. There she sees "the ghost" coming up the stairs. For some reason "the Ghost" is able the materialize all the way from the "haunted house" to the center of the city but somehow misses the 10th floor and appears somewhere down near the lobby. Then it starts slowly and laboriously climbing the stairs. Did its ghostly powers give out due to the trip across town? Anyway, the girl rushes back to an office and gets the night watchman to go look down the stairwell. He does. He finds nothing and continues his nightly rounds leaving the girl to watch the hall through a TV monitor. Suddenly, the stairwell door opens and out pops "the ghost" moving at a snails pace. The zombies in "Night of the Living Dead" seem like Olympic track stars compared to this slug. She then decides to run out into the very same hall that "the ghost" is ambling up, and in the next scene, you see her running out the building on the ground floor. Duh. Boy! That was scary! I guess she just put on her invisibility cloak and beamed herself down. No wonder "the ghost" had a grudge. If I had climbed all those stairs to kill someone and they just vanished I'd be wondering who "the ghost" was, me or them. Anyway, the rest of the movie is worse. But, if your eight years old with nothing to do, then maybe you might enjoy it.</fullReview>

This movie had no real story-line to it. It just sort of ran off and went on step by step. Things just happened just for the sake of happening.

		<fullReview>Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jason Behr William Mapother, Clea DuVall, Bill Pullman. Directed by Takashi Shimizu. Based on Ju-on.I'm sorry was this supposed to be scary. Or was it just another one of those "The scariest movies since the Sixth Sense". Well after watching this the answer for me anyway was no, this was just like the Ring a waste of time and money. The scariest thing about this was Bill Pullman agreed to do this...this travesty of what they call a horror movie. For me it is far from horror perhaps in the "Retarded" genre.The story set in where else but Tokyo where an American nurse (Gellar) finds a scary house with a curse upon it. That is about all I know about the story really I couldn't pay attention to it. It was more like the Ring, the guy and girl look for the truth then the guy dies. JUST LIKE THE RING. Of course saying Japan hasn't had a good horror movie since well maybe Godzilla and that was a guy in a costume! The tag-line It never forgives, It never forgets well my version is You'll never forgive yourself for watching it, You'll never forget the stupidity of it. My final rating 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently got the movie pass at Blockbuster. Thank God I waited until after then to rent this movie. Otherwise I would have felt that I wasted my money on this terrible movie. The original (Ju-on) had a great concept and was well-done. However, it seems as if the makers of this movie simply took the exact original, copied it, and pasted American actors in as the main characters. They seem completely out of place in their Japanese environment. Most of the complaints I make about remakes generally revolve around the fact that the remakes are nothing at all like the original, however there was no imagination or originality in this movie whatsoever. Beyond this fact, the acting was poor. Sarah Michelle Gellar further proved with this film that she cannot possibly make good choices for starring roles.</fullReview>

We were treated to a rehash of several horror movies, including the far superior Ringu. The biggest fault of this film is that it's only means of raising suspense is to build up the music to a crescendo, after which the audience is treated to a quick surprise, like so many weak slasher flicks of the late 90s. The characters lack any sort of depth, with no back stories or motivations what so ever, and the acting is weak at best, especially from leading lady Sarah Michelle Gellar, no surprise there. Bottom line, avoid this stinker at all costs.* star out of *****</fullReview>

It had many plot similarities, included the last but one scene especially, but I enjoyed The Ring and hated this. The plot itself was pretty thoughtless and was probably knocked together on the back of a knapkin in a school canteen. Geller's acting was sufficient, as was everyone else's, but that could not save this dire and predictable dross from falling flat on its face.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone over the age of 12, there's just nothing to it.2/10.</fullReview>

My current policy is to slap them in the face once, and lecture them on how they are leading an ignorant life. This movie really has no saving grace whatsoever, I couldn't even laugh at it. There were a few moments (read 2) that were moderately amusing but the rest was a dull slow burn lasting 2 hours but seeming to last 10. On a technical level I found nothing redeeming in the direction or score, and the editing was really really poor and detracted from any moment that could be considered scary.A side note. I have heard that the original originally went for 4 hours and was produced as a mini series. It was cut to fit an hour and a half which may go along way to explaining the plot holes and pointlessness of this film.I award this film 1 out of 10 (the second I have ever given that mark) and condemn it to the dustbin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you liked "The Ring"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... then you'll love this movie too! Cheap creeps and sound effects do most of the scaring, along with no real denouement help to make this one of the worst movies I've seen. But then again I use "The Exorcist" as the paradigm of horror films by which all else are compared. Do yourself a favor and borrow this one from a friend if you must, otherwise avoid it altogether. SM Gellar doesn't have much of a chance to shine in this one, neither does Bill Pullman (or any of the "main" characters for that matter). The script may well have been decent, but Hollywood effects succeeded in turning this screenplay into a great big nothing. Come to think of it, there isn't even a discernible plot and the characters are nothing but clichés.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very terrible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film two days ago expecting creepy visuals and not really expecting a good story line. This movie was horrible though, it provided neither. About the creepiest visual was the girl with her jaw ripped off, but even that was presented in such a poor way, that it ended up just being cheesy. Everyone I heard leaving the theaters were complaining about the film and wanting their money back(which was only $2.00 because it was at the discount theaters). The only exception was two very young girls who said it was "The scariest movie they'd ever seen", but I don't even know how they got in the film as they only appeared to be ten years old or so. Anyway this was a very disappointing film and I usually love Japanese films and their US remakes as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood can see one thing in these Japanese films, money. They are clearly hell-bent on trying to achieve in America what these films did in Japan and to an even greater extent, Western audiences. 'The Grudge' will do well at the box-office because 'The Ring' did well at the box-office, the same people who saw 'The Ring' will no doubt go and see 'The Grudge'. The good thing about all of this is that it will open mainstream Western audiences to the films of Asia, but what one should always realize is that the Asian films are always going to be far superior to the MPAA-ridden, studio-leeching American films. For instance - American producers, writers and directors won't touch 'Men Behind the Sun' or 'Flowers of Flesh &amp; Blood' because they know that it would be impossible to write a story based on the original concept and still keep it intact for MPAA approval. Can you imagine some two-bit John Carpenter fan attempting to write an MPAA-friendly version of 'Flowers of Flesh &amp; Blood'?If it ain't broke don't fix it, ie. The Japanese films are ten times better, the Japanese films are widely available for retail purchase, and the Japanese films are a hell of a lot more original than the typical rubbish that American studios churn out month after month. There simply is no need to remake the films. The objective argument can be, "but the American version don't have subtitles". What problems will subtitles cause for people? I mean, people can read, can't they? People have large attention spans and can concentrate on what's in front of them for two hours, can't they? Clearly not.But anyway, is THIS film any good? Remakes are never good, no matter how many former vampire slayers with fake noses you put in them.0 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was horrendous, awful, stupid and incredibly boring. The Grudge is a movie of confusion, so the premise is that because people that were killed in a rage would leave a curse on the place they were killed. Fine, good idea, too bad the movie wasn't as good as the trailers and tag lines. If everyone that entered the house subject to the curse why did it take so long for Sarah Gellers character to die and why didn't they show the real estate agent dying. Also if the "grudge" was the one that killed than why did peter kill himself, it didn't explain. and why was the story only explained to the main character. Another thing is find dumb was the fact that the suspense was not maintained thru out the movie. one saw the deaths coming a mile a way, the music always came to early and was trying to hard to be eerie and the parts that were supposed to be scary were actually laughably funny, especially the part when the dead lady climbed in bed with the sister. I think the movie could have been more than what it was, it only did not try hard enough, unlike other movies it didn't try to trick us or offer some other sort of explanation, it didn't tease us with areas that you expected to be scary, it was pretty straightforward with the scare, and thats where i feel that it made its biggest mistake is when they didn't use opportunities to scare us psychologically, it didn't.</fullReview>

It was just bad. The direction was at least decent, but it was way too much like the Ring, it seems like they used the same type of cinematography. They sure used the same type of scares..... the really stupid kind. Why did they have that stupid old ladies' hand hit the ground, and then add a really loud bang which in no way could have been caused by her hand hitting the floor? Thats plain stupid. Its those kind of cheap scare tactics(sorry I know there is a retarded show of that name)that make horror movies bad and not scary, thus not really horror movies. But overall Sara Gellar is hot, I would send it to her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie last night and woke up this morning thinking "there is nothing I can do to get me back those 2 hours of eyesore, but I will feel a bit better if I can warn other potential victims" so decided to post my comment here. Absolutely silly from beginning to end! Being a fan of scary movies, I think I have seen them all, but this is by far the worst. What was the Director thinking about??? And I just saw Sarah Michael [whatever her other name is] come to London to promote that movie! I feel sorry for her. I would be so embarrassed to go into a private viewing of this movie if I had been on it. From the very beginning, this ridiculous figure/silhouette/stain appearing chasing people (some hardly related with the house) was so bizarre! And what's with Sarah M... washing her hair and getting some weird sort of bars coming out of the back of her head??? What on Earth has that to do with a dead person haunting the house. At the end, you can imagine what is supposed to be happening thanks to the [third] restatement of the opening thought (something along the lines of "where some one dies full of rage, they leave some sort of jinx...") Dreadful, dreadful! Acting was so poor. Perhaps the leading lady has done so much vampire hunting that she could not put on a credible face projecting fear or surprise. I can only think that this was created on the basis of some Oriental approach to thrillers unknown in the western hemisphere. I only give it one point as I must admit jumping from my seat a few times at the beginning (the background music was good). What a huge fiasco!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, the previews really pulled one over on me this time. I'm sorry to those who liked this movie, but the sad fact is that it doesn't even follow it's own rules. I can't really say how and avoid spoilers, but I will say this to validate my point: pay close attention to what is said about the actual cause or reasons for the grudge. Now ask yourself, who was it that was killing people? Does this even make sense? Drop any predispositions you may have had about the movie and seriously think about it. It's not that I didn't "get" the movie. The movie didn't even "get" itself. It takes liberties and makes assumptions that don't follow logically, because it is dependent on the American addiction to flashy effects and cheap scares. I will say that the opening credits were unbelievably cool, and there were one or two moments that were passingly frightening, but the Grudge's overall value as a movie is not very high. If you do go to this movie, look at the people around you. Most of them are just acting scared because they are supposed to. It's unfortunate that the movie industry puts so little stock in us, the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could a movie be any less scary? The "horror" scenes were ridiculously predictable long before they occurred on screen, and when they did appear, they were not scary at all. This was a laughable attempt at horror. The Grudge was is no better than a ghost story told at an elementary school sleep-over. What an unintendedly comedic flop. The spirits in the movie were not "caught in the grip of a powerful rage," as the previews suggested. They were simply caught in a failing, floundering film that sank like the Titanic. Funny cat noises and Asian actresses with their faces painted white do not a scary film make. The plot was poorly thought out, the acting was mediocre, and the whole thing was just not believable. Sarah Michelle Gellar should have stayed with Buffy.</fullReview>

So many people paid to see this film, and that was way scarier than anything in the film itself. So many people paying to see this film is the reason why Hollywood puts out as many wasted garbage films as it does. I can't understand how anyone can look at these films and think to themselves, "Wow that was so great and it's gonna be remembered forever in film history!" I hope they all take a second thought and waste their money on something else, instead of supporting these atrocities.</fullReview>

But hey, its a horror film, and as so many people would say, 'fuck plot.' fine, i'll do that. forget about the plot. the entire basis for scaring people in this film is "shock." and apparently, swift moving objects and sudden loud bursts of noise are the most horrifying things on earth. There was maybe one scene of extended suspense, but even then my heart wasn't racing even close to the speed that it beats after a big cup of coffee. I got really annoyed with the 'creapy' spirits too. I'm sorry, but a naked little Japanese boy with a habit of screaming does not make me jump out of my seat. Was he a little unnerving at first? oh yes. Does this sustain throughout the movie? apparently for a lot of the cackling, shrieking, obnoxiously-yelling-at-the-screen audience, it did.and, the ending... i wouldn't want to spoil it, but there's not much to spoil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on satellite. I originally started to watch it because I was curious to see what Buffy the Vampire Slayer was up to now.Thirty minutes...or maybe less...into the movie, I was hooked. For sheer skin-crawling creepiness, this film is near the top of my list. Unfortunately, it was on so late that I had to go to bed right after it was over. I didn't sleep well that night. One of my sons had seen it before, in a theater, and now I could understand his reluctance to go up into the attic of our house. More is implied than is explicitly shown in this movie, which makes the few explicit moments all the more scary. But the implied stuff will work its way into the darker recesses of your imagination and last longer, so that for a while afterward you'll have an aversion to stairwells, elevators, small children, train rides...and dark attics. If you like a good horror film, I can heartily recommend this one. The only complaint I had about it was the ending, which seemed a little too Western for a remake of a Japanese film.</fullReview>

So I do concede that they were skillful in creating a tense atmosphere However, it is just basically the same thing happening over and over again. A lot of "oh no, don't open that door!".

		<fullReview>**Minor Spoilers**My girlfriend loves horror flicks, and lately we've been experimenting with some of the more successful Japanese horror movies. We (well, more she) were quite excited to see "The Grudge" when it first came out several weeks ago.The theater was packed with teeny boppers, and the theater was constantly filled with chatter and repeating pattern of *SCREAM* *giggling and chatter* *SCREAM* *giggling and chatter* *SCREAM* ... rinse, repeat etc. etc.Nevertheless I more or less stayed focused on the film. It certainly had its moments. Shimizu maximizes his BOO!-moments with creative camera angles and shots, and occasional gore. If cheap shots that make you jump are all you want, then The Grudge is definitely for you.Where it fails is in its plain-jane, run-of-the-mill horror plot. There is nothing different, new, clever, or unexpected. There are no twists, turns, or mindbenders. The house is haunted, and that's it.Furthermore, I'm not sure why Shimizu chose to recreate the movie with an almost entirely American/caucasian cast. Since he retains the Japanese settings, an American audience nevertheless run into the occasional cultural oddity. It seems pandering that almost every major character is white while the surrounding area is Japan. If the goal was to sellout to an American audience, why not simply go 100 yards and set the movie in America? Throw in not-so-stellar acting, especially by Gellar, and you end up with a pretty mundane horror flick. I give "The Grudge" a 5 / 10 : fairly average and forgettable. If you want a horror movie with more depth, more creative plot, and a more lasting impression, see The Ring or The Others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks to many of the assurances by the press and a few cast members of this film, I am less likely to attempt to see the original Japanese version.This movie was predictable, and boring, in every aspect.The acting left much to be desired, the fear on actors faces looks like they fear the slum this film might put their acting careers into. The scary noises that the boy ghost makes are about as frightening to me as the same sounds my niece produces to annoy people at dinner time (little more that breathing slowly while holding your throat closed to produce a croaking/popping sound).The film reminded me mostly, of The Ring meets 21 grams, with its jumpy cutting between past and present.The only way this film will frighten you, is if the audience riots demanding its money back.Any suggestion of this film containing anything of the "strange horror" that is found in some of the newer Techno-age Horrors coming out of Japan and many other parts of Asia is a blatant lie. This film was filmed in Japan, and yet aside from some subtitled conversations, and the sceenery, it comes across as almost completely American.If you payed to see this film, you should feel cheated. If you had the opportunity of receiving a free ticket to it like me, you'll want to ask for a refund of your wasted time.To those of you who liked this film and actually got scared by it, i would like to suggest some much better horror films. Such as Sweating to the Oldies 1-4 because Richard Simmons is vastly more frightening, and the scariest part, he's real! And for those of you who want plot line to go with your mind numbing terror.I can suggest anything staring the Olson twins, I know they've scarred me for life.</fullReview>

I was thrilled to see how the reactions were all the same: everyone hated it."The Grudge" is based in the hit (I mean, "hit in it's home country, Japan") movie "Ju-On". I never saw "Ju-On", so I'm not gonna compare them, but I can tell you that "The Grudge" is the creepiest horror movie I watched in years. And it's surely one of the worst too.The movie features average acting and directing, a bad script and terrible villains. With "terrible", I mean they are just the creepiest monsters (can I call them monsters?) in horror movies in a while.Is worth a watch if you like horror movies or to be scared, but it's surely the most disposable movie of 2004.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, some things to keep in mind. One, this is a remake of the Japanese horror film Ju-on. Two, this has nothing to do with The Ring, or Ringu except for the fact that both share similar styles. Third, this was produced by Sam Rami, the guy who did the Spider-man movies and more importantly, the Evil Dead series. Fourth, this is about as true a remake of a Japanese film as you can get. Sam Rami retained the same director and much of the cast from the original.As for the movie itself, it retains much of the Japanese feel, but still should be accessible to western audiences. There's a bit of a feeling of culture-clash in the beginning of the film, but that settles down quickly as the actors and director hit their stride. It's a fairly subtle film, as good horror films should be, but it does maintain a feeling of inevitability and tension throughout. The plot is very non-linear. It moves back and forth between characters but still manages to maintain consistency. It loses a few points there because there really is no one set protagonist and because of that we empathize with these characters without really getting to know them. There's character development, certainly, but not enough to make the audience really care about the players.All in all though, it's a very decent horror flick. Don't go in expecting perfection, but it's a damn sight better than the usual horror tripe that Hollywood's pushing these days. Has some wonderfully tense moments and really manages to convey the desperation of being alone and afraid in a crowd. It's not the best of the recent Japanese Horror Invasion, but still definitely worth seeing. 7/10</fullReview>

To say that i love horror movies would be an understatement, and i have seen heaps (considering the limited availability in New Zealand, that's quite a lot), but never before have i had to sleep with the light on...until i saw The Grudge.Some may say that it is a rip off of The Ring (both based on Japanese horror movies), both similar (yet different) story lines, but the Grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie - seeing at at the cinema, i even screamed at a certain point in the movie.The acting is great, particularly from the supporting characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she is such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real hottie, and William Mapother looks like he is having fun. However, while i am normally a fan of Clea DuVall's, she doesn't really seem into this movie. Of the supporting characters, hers probably got the most depth and back story, but she doesn't seem like she is all there. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, she stays about the same through all her films and roles doesn't she? The ghosts were genuinely scary, the music and sound effects were chilling (particularly the noise being made when KaDee Strickland's character answered the phone in her apartment), the ending was cool too.Super highly recommended. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not even a little bit scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, if you've seen The Ring, you've basically seen The Grudge. It's trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds, but it fails miserably. The plot, if you can call it that, is weak and rather full of holes, for instance, how would the care center have known that Yoko didn't show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there? And it's not really clear what Bill Pullman's character had to do with anything. He just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot. It didn't make a lot of sense what happened to the original family. Who was hanging in the room, the little boy or the dad? And was Yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her? There were too many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think about it more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Haunted House Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Tokyo, when the American student Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is called by a Japanese social support agency to replace her Japanese colleague Yoko (Yoko Maki) in the assistance of the American sick woman Emma (Grace Zabriskie), she realizes that something supernatural lives in the huge house. Inspector Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi) investigates a series of deaths of visitors of the subjected house, and based on a Japanese belief, he convinces himself that the place is cursed."The Grudge" is a different movie of haunted house. I have not had the chance to see the original "Ju-on: The Grudge" yet, but this story is much related to Japanese culture. The beginning of the film makes reference to a Japanese saying about rage, which is unknown in Western cultures. The non-linear screenplay works reasonably, but could be better and better. It gives me the impression that something is missing to be a great movie. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "O Grito" ("The Scream")</fullReview>

Not in my opinion..Just a bunch of flashy imaging. The entire film was a boring, stupid, mess. I guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror film I have seen in years. And that Buffy chick? Well, she's a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and just as talented..No, wait, that would be an insult to the talents of Barbie! I suppose many kiddies helped this film at the box office as it was PG-13, and had it been rated R, it would have bombed IMO! Stupid movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gee, what a crappy movie this was! I cannot understand what people find so scary about "The Grudge". The director plays one trick (I'd have to admit a very good one, that is brought to life very stylized) and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. As a consequence I startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie, but once I knew the drill I practically fell asleep as The Grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute. To conclude, I can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with, that the so-called predecessor "The Ring" was way scarier and that buying a ticket for "The Grudge" is a waste of money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grudge is an unapologetic ghost story that delivers A+ shocks and thrills and a truly eerie sense of foreboding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a lifelong disappointed horror film fan, I was finally sated with the Grudge! I must say that to all those people out there like myself; a long suffering fan of the horror film genre, this is our movie! A true horror film achieves what the Grudge does: scare the s*&amp;$t out of you. How many times over countless decades have we been let down by one numbing slasher, ghost story, cheesy monster flick after another. Filmmakers in this genre seem to have low opinions of their target audience. Predictable plots, boring characters that you HOPE will die in some gory way, and black cats jumping through windows at just the precise moment while all along a soundtrack plays in the background giving away everything and telling you when to be scared and when to take a breather, seem to be the rule. Now we have The Grudge, which shoves its way past those pretenders, re-inventing the genre. I will admit, when I first noticed this film open last Fall and Sarah Michelle Gellar headline the poster, I was skeptical. Here we go again, another dumbed down Horror film targeted at the teenage Saturday night date audience. And it was rated PG-13! Wrong again I was. Think of Gellar as one of those quarterbacks on a great football team: not such a fine athlete or prolific Hall-of-Famer, but a team player who blends in with the others. She doesn't make mistakes that cost the team a victory, throws the ball away when there is no play, and realizes she is not above anyone else on the field. She is adequate and appropriate for the role. In fact, the entire cast in the film is of the same comparison. They are merely vessels that carry the narrative, chess pieces in an ultimate game of fear and dread. I won't say too much about the plot because most of the other reviews have done a fine job in describing its non-linear progression, even though it was a good deal less episodic than the original; a positive in my opinion. It is also a film that will stay with you for a long while afterwords. I just saw it and it is all I can think about, and I have a feeling it will be with me for a few days to come. Perhaps our young American "Horror" filmmakers should travel to Japan and get schooled by this fresh crop of Asian newbies to the genre. We will all be the better for it! I want more!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even on a 27-inch TV screen, THE GRUDGE, an English-language remake of a Japanese horror film, packs a hell of a wallop. Gellar plays a nurse who runs afoul of a cursed house and its vengeful ghosts, a mother and son who have died terrible deaths and are out to kill anyone who crosses their path. One is tempted to say this bears a resemblance to THE RING, but other than an occasional appearance by a stringy-haired female apparition -- apparently a tradition in Japanese ghost flicks -- such is not the case. THE GRUDGE clearly stands on its own, and it is far, far scarier than THE RING. Only the ending is a letdown, veering from the Japanese original, in order to set the thing up for a sequel. Great supporting turns by Clea DuVall and Grace Zabriski as doomed occupants of the haunted house. And we do mean haunted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Movie I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing this after seeing The Grudge on multiple times. I must say I've seen it first in a Sunday morning at 3am, and I must say that, since that fateful morning, like 3 weeks ago, I've remained paranoid of dark corners in my room. The movie is about an American couple that moved in Japan for study. They are confronted with a "slight" problem when Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) fills in for Yoko from the Social Care Center she was working for. She unwittingly steps into a cursed house that holds dark secrets. The movie is a frightfest that reaches in the depths of your mind as sure as a surgeon's blade cuts on the line, leaving you so much as 2 minutes of "breath-catching" time. Very nicely made, the actors have been up to my expectations, and the "badguy" is the scariest thing to be caught on camera... I've had a perverse pleasure after viewing the movie, in the sense that I swore to god I wouldn't watch another movie if they'll come out with a sequel...but I enjoyed the experience it provided; it's not that I'm a scaredy cat... it's just that I'm afraid I won't live through it. My advice is don't watch it just so you know you've watched it, watch it in such a manner so you "feel" everything this little "gem" has to offer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the most part I liked this movie...it was a film with many creepy images and quite a few killings as well. Still though the story just was not up to "The Ring's" story. In this movie there really is no motivation for the killings to occur they say things about rage and despair, but the only one who would have felt that really was not part of the supernatural side of the movie. Still though it was entertaining enough and I love the fact it was set in Japan. It also makes me want to see the Japanese version as I know it will be better as this one was probably Americanized quite a lot. I preferred "Ringu" to "Ring" also. All in all though I enjoyed it, though I wished they would just release the Japanese versions here. Also, there is one part of the movie where one woman is having a hard time finding here way around Japan and I found this a little hard to believe. Many Japanese are rather good at English if not fluent and many things there are written in both English and Japanese (I notice this when watching other movies from there).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge, a horror movie based on the Japanese original but starring Americans. Now usually this genre and these types of films never work. However by keeping the original director of the film this film works. Based on the premise of restless spirits and curses this could have easily turned into a cheesy or over the top horror film. However due to surprises and sounds that are not common for American moviegoers it works. What also helps is that the way the story is laid out in fragment and the audience has to put the pieces together. It is not in a linear fashion. The acting was really good on all accounts with genuine performances by Sarah Michelle Gellar. Plenty of disturbing images and scares thrown in. The DVD contains several extras and previews. This is a good quality movie that I would recommend.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the Asian horror remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of the American remake of THE RING, I guess it was inevitable that Hollywood would start producing more versions of Asian horrors. This is their second effort, a virtual scene-for-scene remake of the previous year's JU-on: THE GRUDGE, itself a remake of an earlier film simply titled JU-ON. Confused yet? You will be ? as far as I make it, no less than six films have been built around this premise so far, with a seventh (and possibly eighth, knowing Hollywood) on the way. Really, if you've seen the original Japanese version, you have absolutely no reason to see this movie. It's inferior in every respect, and the decision to use sub-par CGI effects in some scenes makes them laughable rather than frightening ? the appearance of the ghost hovering above the bed just looks atrocious.The good news is that Sam Raimi produces under his Ghost House banner, which means things are a little less insipid than they would be otherwise. This film is an old-fashioned horror effort that mixes the plots of JU-ON and JU-ON: THE GRUDGE to a sometimes confusing effect. I liked the fact that the focus was on the scares throughout ? no padding or time-wasting here, just straight into the fear factor. The inclusion of scenes from JU-ON (which I hadn't seen) kept me on my toes, although everything else was pretty much reproduced from the original, shot-to-shot. This may be because the Japanese director came across, but even so I'd have liked a little more loosening of the apron strings, a little greater variety. Maybe that's just me.The cast isn't great. Japanese actors have a great way of portraying realistic subtlety, so when you see Sarah Michelle Gellar sweating and acting with wide-eyed fear, it doesn't really have the same impact. She's always just acting. The other cast members are pretty bland, and Clea DuVall is STILL awful, ever since I saw her in THE FACULTY. Bill Pullman was pretty good though, while the inclusion of Japanese actors from the original, playing the cursed family, is a nice touch. Being a Sam Raimi production, Ted Raimi inevitably shows up, here playing the head of a care agency, and it's great to see him in a larger supporting role than usual. One thing I did like a LOT was that the film becomes more serious, and more scary, as it progresses. Scenes such as the 'jaw' scare are spot on, while the full-blooded climax doesn't disappoint ? it may be that the film actually becomes scarier than the original at this point! So, all in all, this isn't a great film, but it is a pretty good one ? better still if you haven't caught the Japanese version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge (2004): Dir: Takashi Shimizu / Cast: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jason Behr, Bill Pullman, Clea Duvall, KaDee Strickland: Misleading title in a graphic horror film where many nameless victims are mutilated to the delight of an audience that desires to see more of this tripe. It is shocking to hear an audience cheer during such crap. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a caregiver who discovers that the mansion she is visiting is haunted. There is an elderly lady who sleeps and then shrieks at ghosts, and Gellar is not long identifying her problem. Starts out well with a suicide but becomes routine after the umpteenth person is killed. The ending is a complete cheat but what really stands out is the film's inability to make any sense. Why not create an interesting thriller about trauma? Instead director Takashi Shimizu Americanizes his Japanese film for no other reason than to allow Hollywood to rape his craft. Gellar holds her own as the caregiver overwhelmed by haunting images and decides to investigate the history behind it all. Other roles are not so lucky and fall into that camera stalk and kill cliché. Jason Behr, Bill Pullman and Clea Du Vall are completely wasted in roles that are subdued by visuals. The special effects are done with appeal but unfortunately the screenplay was not given the same regard. The only grudge held should come from Japan. Score: 2 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grudge (7/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge remake in my opinion transcended the horror genre in the wrong direction, even though The Grudge itself was a quality film. Too often do we seen horror films with weak stories and its purpose is to execute its share of pop scares. The Grudge from what I remembered is the first film in theaters that had multiple pop-up scare scenes that made the viewer tense up. Now this technique in horror films is over-used and movies don't have general creepiness like 70's, 80's, and 90's films used. Unlike many of the horror movies I'm talking about The Grudge had a solid story, even if it lacked originality. The key to this film though was Sarah Michelle Gellar, a terrific looker and actress, who always delivers a great performance. The American Grudge is clichéd, an unnecessary remake, and started those pesky over utilized pop-up scares but it holds a special place in my heart, for being a movie that got me excited about horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little flawed, but acceptable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Working in Japan, an American health-care worker discovers the home of her latest charge is the site of a terrible, ghostly curse and tries to stop it before it consumers her friends and co-workers.There's a lot to really like with this one as it gets a lot of right throughout here. One of the biggest issues, though, is the fact that as a remake it really doesn't do anything to help the story told from the original so that can hold this one down somewhat. By keeping the familiar story and the jump scenes along the way, this can make for a trying time here by being too similar for its own good and not really having a whole lot really changed in terms of fixing the storyline or the different plot points within this. Still, this familiarity does manage to bring about many positives including a far better pace than the original. There's far more life to the non-attack scenes and the burgeoning mystery about the ghosts within the house keep this one moving so it doesn't feel as though it takes a long time to get going or even between scenes. When the attacks really start coming in earnest throughout here, this becomes all the more enjoyable by building off such a solid foundation with those intriguing non-attacks keeping the film going. Likewise, those attack are quite enjoyable on their own merits as incredibly entertaining and chilling encounters, most notably the numerous encounters inside the house from the first encounter with the ghost inside the bedroom, the encounter in the bathtub as well as the flashback to the previous owner and the utterly fun finale that has a lot going for it by mixing action with the chills so well. That the other attacks outside the house are rather well done is another plus, from the office building ambush to the hotel encounter and to the spectacular encounter at the office with the deformed ghost makes for a rather solid series of encounters here to make this quite fun. The only place this stumbles is the final half-hour by detailing an affair that really drags this to a halt instead of charging through into a furious finale, not to mention really lowering the impact of the curse by putting too much background into it. That does manage to lower this one somewhat, but it's still got enough here to really make a big impact.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Karen, a young social carer, is sent to a home for her first assignment to look after a woman who suffers from dementia when Yoko, the woman's regular carer, fails to show up. Not long after she arrives at the house, Karen hears noises coming from inside a bedroom closet that's been taped up, so she opens it and finds a young boy and his cat. After contacting her boss, Alex, for help, she waits at the house, but it's during this time that an unspeakable horror manifests causing the death of the woman and sending Karen to go into a state of shock. After being released from hospital, Karen learns of the murders of Kayako Saeki and her son Toshio, and, along with Detective Nakagawa, she starts to realise that the vengeful spirits of the Saeki family somehow still reside inside the home and anyone who ventures into it may well become the next victim.The Grudge, as we all know, is an American remake of the Japanese hit Ju-on, and is, in my opinion, just as good. This version sticks pretty close to the original and a lot of the scenes are the same, but a few have been added for this version that weren't in the original i.e. you see more of what happens to Kayako &amp; Toshio, and watch out for the exceedingly creepy Yoko.The story is told in the same non-linear style, but for some reason didn't seem as confusing. Also, being a Hollywood film, you'd expect a CGI-fest for the Kayako scenes, but again, like the original, these were kept to a minimum with actress Takako Fuji doing all her own creepy contortions &amp; movements. This may be because it was the same director who done Ju-on, who knows, but it's good that CGI never over-shadowed the story.I enjoyed the original Japanese version, but to be honest I personally thought that this remake was actually the scarier of the two. There will be die-hard Japanese horror fans that will stupidly ridicule this version just because it's an American remake, but if you've not seen it just ignore the trolls and judge it for yourself.</fullReview>

Temporarily assigned to be a carer for a woman with severe sleeping disorder, Karen goes to the patient's house. What she finds is something she would never expect. The house is plagued by the presence of murderous ghosts, the result of a curse. The curse is born from someone dying in a powerful rage. Now, Karen finds herself being tormented by that curse, as it eventually starts claiming it's victims.....In the early noughties, the cinema was rife with remakes of 'J-Horror', and even though some of them were good, it was just an excuse for Hollywood to make money, because some people just couldn't be bothered with subtitles.The Ring, Dark Water, Shutter, and this are prime examples.But at least this was directed by the originals director, so at least some respect has been maintained. Geller is in it, she's okay, but the movie goes to show that she could never carry a film. She more or less put a stake in her movie career with her performance, like rice with no salt, its does the job, but it's very bland.So thank heavens then for the rest of the cast, and the brilliant camera-work used when we see the ghosts.The lift scene, and the photo montage are standouts, in what other wise are jump scenes.Its one of those movies that the more you watch it, the less the horror will scare you, and the story will intrigue you more.Worth seeing, but if you've seen the original, don't bother.</fullReview>

That is, although Yoko's death is the first shown in the movie, it was actually the seventh to occur. The deaths occurred in this order: The Japanese woman Kayako and her son Toshio were murdered by her jealous husband Takeo, who then killed himself. Peter died shortly after (killed by the ghost of Toshio.) Three years later, Jean was killed, followed by her husband. Yoko arrived and was killed. The mother Emma died (and Karen ended up in the hospital. That evening, Susan (Emma's daughter) died, never having gotten word that her whole family was dead. Alex (Karen's boss) was killed by the ghost of Yoko) and the police inspector was killed by the ghost of the Takeo.

		<shortDescription>Fun J-horror remake with great scares!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of "The Ring" every studio was looking to cash in with their own Japanese re-make. Columbia Pictures and Sam Raimi's Ghost House Pictures set out to make an American version of "Ju-on" or "The Grudge". They got the director of the original film Takashi Shimizu to do the re-make and all things look great on paper for and epic film. Unlike "The Ring" which relocated its story to Seattle, "The Grudge" takes place in Tokyo. When "Americanizing" a foreign film something is always lost in the translation. The cultural gaps and customs are just too big to overcome. "The Grudge" does alright in this respect but is still comes up a little short. First let me say that the movie really is scary and has a great atmosphere to it. The fact that it takes place in Tokyo is a big plus and adds to the whole experience.The myth goes: When some dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse a born and consumes everybody who come in contact with it. This is explained in a prologue. Sarah Michelle Geller plays Karen and exchange student who lives with her American med school boyfriend Doug, played by Jason Behr. Both lead roles are miscast with Behr's part being completely useless. Gellar is no stranger to horror and she does a serviceable job, but they could've found someone better. In a bit of good casting famed Japanese actor Ryo Ishibashi plays Detective Nakagawa who investigates the cursed house. Ishibashi, played the male lead in the horror classic "Audition".The story is structured in a way that shows how each character has encountered the house. Starting the family who bought it for there invalid mother Emma. We see what happens to her kids, then her care takers Yoko, then Karen. They all encounter the vengeful ghosts of Kayako and Toshio. The curse is an unstoppable force of pure rage that seems to literally scare people to death. Karen researches the house and the curse and we find out the history of the family that use the live there. She and the Detective aim to somehow stop the curse, but Kayako and Toshio are some pretty bad ass ghosts that are not nearly ready to give it up. The ending gives some decent scares but is pretty uninspired and ambiguous. The movie spawned a few sequels that didn't even stand up to the low standards set by the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest Ghost Ever!!! Do You Dare?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just finished watching the Hollywood adaptation of The Grudge 3, and decided to go back and write my review about this one, the first and best of the trilogy in my opinion.After I saw "The Ring" (another excellent adaptation of a Japanese original) I was certain that Samara was the scariest thing I'd ever seen. Then - I saw Kayoko, the evil ghost of The Grudge, and felt the same chilling terror. I've got to hand it to the Japanese film makers - they sure do know how to make bone chilling horror.It's not that The Grudge has a unique original story, or state of the art footage, or exceptionally impressive acting. It's a ghost story pretty much like any other. What it does have is one of the scariest ghosts ever seen on screen. If The Ring's Samara was simply terrifying to look at, the ghost of The Grudge also makes a terrifying sound I doubt you'd ever be able to forget. I'm a grown man of 27, and after watching this - I wished I wasn't sleeping alone that night. If that doesn't mean a horror movie has done its job, I don't know what does. If the horror loving generation before me had nightmares about the little girl from The Exorcist, I think myself and my peers will forever hold Kayoko as the scariest thing we've seen.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to really be frightened and enjoys an exceptionally well made ghost movie. Not for the feint of heart though!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another unread paradoxical review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny because I saw this film before years ago, but I don't think I cared much for it, nor did I remember most of it. I watched it a few days ago and I liked it a lot more. Was it because I watched the director's cut? It's quite possible. Here we have a Japanese haunted house tale except that the few ghosts (or spirits) are quite belligerent and will haunt (and hunt) you even outside the house. Originally a Japanese film, it was remade for American audiences with some American actors and a bigger budget. It does still take place in Japan, has the same director as the original and several of the same actors. Those are anomalies in themselves, perhaps explaining why it's so different than your usual American horror film. There's not much gore to speak of, and the movie often cuts just before the "kill", but the film is probably better because of it, because it leaves more to your imagination. There's a general feeling of uneasiness and creepiness permeating this film.It relies a lot on smart sound effect work, seeing scenes from different viewpoints and setting up the scares slowly. It can be just a face, but the surprising way it appears is often freaky. Some of the most memorable, most unnerving scenes for me involved a simple bus ride and watching a black and white video footage. Praise should be given to most of the actors who looked genuinely scared (especially Sarah Michelle Gellar) without even screaming. In fact, for them, and perhaps the viewers, it's so horrifying, they can't even scream. There's also an interesting mystery going on about who the spirits are, giving them background and personalization. I prefer that to faceless anonymous spirits. The structure is non-linear but not too tough to understand and will make subsequent watchings more enjoyable. I think the only real not-so-negative criticisms I could give it would be that the flashback sequences were sometimes awkwardly handled and too convenient (as in, why now?). The little boy can also become silly instead of creepy depending on your mood. I think that as far as Japanese horror remakes go, I preferred the Ring, but the Grudge is also quite worthy. The best praise I could give this film is that I keep thinking about it and of what might be lurking in unexpected places, especially at night in the dark.Rating: 7.5 out of 10 (Very good) P.S. The commentary is well worth watching in part because of the good spirits of the Japanese creators doing it (it's subtitled in English, but you hear their Japanese voices and laughs).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything has a different meaning for each person.The Grudge for someone else could be just another horror flick,one of the millions that's been made. But for me it is -or at least was- way different.You see,this movie is a part of my childhood.It has to be one of the few and far between movies that ever scared me.I don't know why or how,but watching this movie as a kid i was very frightened. In fact the first time i saw this movie was when i was like 9 years old,and oh boy it did a number on me!It scared me so much that i still remember not having slept that damn night!Now almost 10 years after,still remembering some of the films' scenes,i said,hell,let's watch it again.Well,watching it now as an older person,as you can imagine it was a completely different experience.. Sadly i didn't find out what scared me so much as a kid,but i enjoyed having a sneak peek on my childhood through this movie.As long as the movie itself is concerned,it is a usual horror flick,with a lot of "boo!" scenes,if you know what i mean,and a messed up plot,but because it is a part of my childhood i'll give it 6/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest Movie That I Have Ever Seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy good horror films and "The Grudge" scared me more than any other. For months after seeing this movie, it instantly came to mind whenever I turned off the last light in the house at night.The ghost of the murdered wife is for me, the scariest movie ghost of all time. Sometimes, the most frightening elements are those that remain unseen, such as a young woman slowly entering a dark bedroom and from a distance we see the door being slowly closed behind her. No screams, no hideous monster, no lunging, etc. Just a victim being lured to her silent, dark doom. There are number of good frights in this movie and a little bit of gore, like the young woman shuffling down the hallway leaving a trail of blood. When she turns around, we see why.I'm getting goosebumps just writing this review. That is the mark of a truly scary movie, one that gives chills years after viewing it.The Grudge is that movie.Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a great horror movie fan. To me THE GRUDGE 2 was the best!!! I think the grudge was spawned from the RING/RING U series!!! The whole movie is confusing and partially bore-some. BUT, it is extremely creepy and dark as well!!! Kayoko herself is very terrifying!!! And the story of how Kayoko died may be disturbing to many people.The plot of the story is simply that there's a mysterious curse that comes upon people who dares enter her house. A woman named Karen finds a job that requires her to take care of a woman. The woman's caretaker arrives at the cursed house. The house is trashed and....... NOT TO GIVE AWAY ANY SPOILERS NEAR THE BEGINNING IF THE MOVIE A WOMAN IS KILLED, LEAVING HER DISABLED MOTHER ON HER OWN. Throughout the house you'll see eerie figures and might experience supernatural encounters!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed all 3 of these films one thing I noticed in particular is that they were all really true to each other. The same opening credits, The same long corridor shots with the grudge walking towards a victim. Another thing I really want to compliment the creative team on is their ability to have made each of the grudge's appearances more horrific then the previous one. I really like the corridor shot in the grudge 2 where it is making it's way towards Sarah who by the way I think is beautiful. I give the entire trilogy a 9 due to the fact that almost every hot girl get's killed in these films. I hated how Sarah falls off the roof in the 2nd film but you gotta put some kind of shock moment there for your audience. All round I really like these films and the stories that they told.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After watching this, you'll never again feel completely safe in your own bed ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a very pleasant surprise! Before the movie started I was thinking that it will be another usual horror movie with almost no plot and poor acting, lots of blood and teenagers dying left and right. Boy was I wrong! After about 5 minutes everyone in the cinema was quiet and during the movie everyone just froze with their popcorn buckets in their laps. No laughs, munching, sipping, mobile phones or anything. I think this truly shows the intensity of a movie. The movie is one of the scariest I have ever seen, and I think a great part of the fright is due to the fact that the movie uses actions and situations from everyday life to scare you. It gives you the feeling you'll never be safe, there is no place and no person that could protect you from this curse. The worst was the scene where this woman jumps in her bed and hides under the cover and then something grabs her from INSIDE the bed, that was right there with her under the cover. I mean, who did never hide under his cover with fear from the darkness or some noise in the house? After watching this scene, I lost for a while that feeling of safety in my own bed. And sometimes I still shiver remembering it. So yeah, it's a truly scary movie, both my husband and myself agree on that. That night when we came out of the cinema and had to walk home because it was past midnight we sure had a good look at every bush and tree. Well done movie, good plot, good acting (for a horror movie), great effects (especially sound effects) and camera. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Takashi Shimizu remakes his own work for American audiences and while many will complain and accuse the film of being dumbed down for a wider audience I have always, personally, (*whisper it*) preferred this version.The story is really quite a simple one - a house that has seen a major, violent incident in it's past is home to a deadly force that haunts and claims the life of anyone who comes into contact with it. Sarah Michelle Gellar is the young care worker trying to figure out how to save her own skin as she begins to piece together the details of the accursed history.Taking the ideas of Ju-on and it's chronological contortion, The Grudge succeeds largely thanks to it's atmosphere and scares. It helps that the jumps back and forth in time are easier to track this time around (though I admit that may just be down to my Western ignorance regarding the Asian actors who appeared in the original).Sarah Michelle Gellar does okay in the main role but is nothing special, her main appeal is the fact that she's just fighting overwhelming odds to try and stay alive and this has viewers rooting for her as the horror unfolds. Other notable faces include Bill Pullman (in a small, but crucial, role), Clea Duvall (always good but not on screen for long enough), Grace Zabriskie and Ted Raimi. Ryo Ishibashi is great as a police officer who begins to suspect the unimaginable is really happening and Yuya Ozeki, Takako Fuji and Takashi Matsuyama are all very good as the main spirits inhabiting the house.The Grudge genuinely scared me the first time I saw it, it made me uneasy the second time and it still has me on edge whenever I watch it. Purists may simply discard it due to the fact that it's a remake but let's not overlook the fact that it's a damn good remake.See this if you like: Ju-on, The Ring, The Grudge 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the crowd of j-horror remakes, for me The Grudge is one that really stands out. In short, it's actually scary. Unlike The Ring it doesn't drag on and just concentrates on actually giving you shivers and scaring you. The Grudge is one film that can genuinely still creep me out and I really don't know why.The theatrical film was cut by around five minutes to achieve a lower rating for the American release, removing several scenes of extreme gore and violence. The Director's Cut version in the UK, however, has the same rating. The new cut vastly improves the viewing quality though.Although the story is a little shaky and sometimes difficult to follow, the scares more than make up for that though. With the cuts, it's a pretty average horror, but without the cuts it's an absolutely brilliant horror movie. It has a perfect balance of suspense, scares and gore. Oh, and Sarah Michelle Gellar.It's pointless explaining the plot of The Grudge because even I'm not sure of it. All I know is that it's about a curse, and a few scary, pasty spirits. The story doesn't follow a chronological time scale which can get puzzling and difficult to follow, but you start to piece together the story as it progresses.It really is no classic, but it's a great movie to watch when you want to be scared silly with a few friends.http://ukmore.tk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't translate well to an American audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main theme of this movie is that a powerful negative force inhabits a place after someone has died a violent death, and that this negative force consumes all who touch the place in which the violent act occurred. This idea is not new, and many conjecture that what people believe are "ghosts" are in fact leftover energy from just such traumatic events. However, most American audiences want the "wronged parties" or "ghosts" to produce a moral outcome- either the punishment of the murderer(s) or the revelation of how the victims died. What most Americans don't really "get" or appreciate is this malevolent force striking out at random victims- the current occupants of the house, whoever they may be, however transient. This just spawns more innocent victims and seems pointless.On the positive side, the technical elements of the film were excellent, the parts of the film that were supposed to be scary were indeed scary, and the roles were well acted. In fact, for you Buffy fans out there, did you notice that Sarah Michele Gellar was reunited with two BTVS alumni? Jason Behr, who played her love interest, was Billy Ford in "Lie to Me" in season two, and the American wife who was caring for her mother-in-law before she was murdered by the "ghosts" was played by the same actress who played Marcie Ross in "Out of Mind Out of Sight" from season one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America + Japan = Confusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so excited to see this film because I had always heard it was very scary.What's interesting about it is that it is a Japanese film they decided to bring to America, but they actually filmed it IN japan with the original crew! I think this made the film... more Japanese (which is probably why it managed to be fairly successful unlike most Japan-to-America horror movie flops) but it also made it a bit inaccessible to American audiences. The difference in what scares the Japanese culture and what scares the American culture felt present throughout the film. This worked well in moments when they meant to capture the nervous fear of the main character: a frightened fish in a big, busy, unfamiliar, Tokyo pond.The storyline was quite confusing as well. In typical Japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the movie is actually the middle of the story and from there we move constantly forwards and backwards until, at the end of the film, we see the ending and beginning of the whole story. This constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me. Also, I didn't think some things were explained so well and I had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she had already seen it, as well as the sequel which apparently reveals more of the story).Overall, there IS plenty for American audiences to love, tons of freaky imagery and macabre details which a healthy splash of jump scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge was basically what a normal remake is: copying the original with nothing new added to it. The Grudge followed Ju-On very well actually and included some scenes from the video version. However, the acting was the first thing that disappointed me, since they were nowhere near the acting of the Japanese people.Even though The Grudge followed the original very well, it later becomes its biggest flaw. It becomes way too predictable. You already know what's going to happen. And on top of that, when the remade scene is finally shown, it's not as good as the original because the atmosphere is all missing. Instead, it's only a scary face scaring the audience. This is the main difference between American horror and foreign horror. American horror focuses on scaring, while foreign focuses of mood. Masterpieces of horror like Ju-On should best be left alone.But then again, the movie was still successful on scaring people. Worth borrowing, not worth buying. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>makes little sense (and not in an interesting way), and laughable "scares"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Takashi Shimizu had a great opportunity with a remake of his original film Ju-On The Grudge. While I haven't seen that film, I would have to wager that there's more imagination and originality (or some rip-off originality, in other words skill with known tropes of the Japanese ghost movie) than in his own directed remake. Maybe the script was written to somehow have some kind of warped appeal, or I would guess accessibility, for an American audience. What starts off with some potential - the hint of something very screwed up going on with Bill Pullman's sudden movement - just goes into a total jumble. And as a horror movie? Gimme a break.Tension could have been built on the situation - a nurse going to take care of a disturbed woman in a house that is haunted - but he undercuts everything he wants to get his audience to feel. Scares? How's about some music timed just so you know when exactly to expect something. A black cat? Yeah, why not just make the ghost-boy thing sound like a cat for creepiness which, in effect, is only creepy if you want cats. Plot? Why not just shuffle between past and present without any semblance of an actual flow of how a story could be told (meaning, while the flashbacks are inserted and are meant to be organic with the story overall, they aren't), or for that matter have us care about ANYONE in the cast.By the time the characters, or those that are there for exposition, get around to telling us what is going on or whatever, there's little point to care. The film-making is shoddy (i.e. the 180 degree rule is broken many times over and not in a forgivable or intriguing way), and the performances are wooden even when looking frightened or shocked (Gellar especially is disappointing, but Pullman, who shows up later after his first scene, is sorely miscast). Even when Shimizu tries for some average old "Boo" scares, like when the woman is in the office building and chased by the Grudge ghost, it's still silly. Just watch when she's going on that elevator and the ghost is in the background of shots. Either you'll go with it, and if so more power to you, or you'll laugh hysterically at the results. Count me in the latter.I'm not totally sure where this project went wrong - was it Shimizu having to retool it for the studios, or him not giving enough leeway with his revamp of his vision? Or maybe Raimi had some say in it and made things more confusing and/or dull than they would be with someone else. The Grudge gives us a lot of information that doesn't make sense or at the least give us some horror-fodder to chew on. It's cineplex trash of a sad order.</fullReview>

This movie has gotten to me so much sometimes I can't even cover up at night because of some of the scenes it had. One of the things I didn't like to much was how it kept switching to new people.

The house is possessed by a violent evil that destroys the lives of everyone who enters. she comes into contact with a supernatural spirit who is vengeful and often possesses its victims. several horrifying and mysterious deaths start to occur, with the spirit passing its curse onto each victim. this curse causes its victims to die in the grip of a powerful rage. After the nurse Yoko fails to show up for work, Karen is asked to check on Emma an American lady, who recently moved to Japan with her son, daughter and daughter in-law Jennifer. Whilst inside the house, Karen is alarmed by Emma's unusual behaviour, She is mute and sleeps through the day. When she enters her home, she finds an elderly American woman, Emma, who is lost in a catatonic state while the rest of the house appears deserted and. As she is seeing to the old woman, Karen hears scratching sounds from upstairs. When she investigates, she is faced with a supernatural horror more frightening than she could ever imagine. I found this to be a good film in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't understand why there's so much hate for The Grudge. The Grudge and The Grudge 2 are my favourite horror movies. When i first watched this nearly 5 years ago, i loved it and nearly 5 years later i still love it. I honestly don't believe people when they say there was nothing scary about it. i mean, who DIDN'T jump at the bus scene where Kayako's face is suddenly there? As for the acting, i thought it was great. The Plot? Don't have a problem with that either. I even think this is better than the original mainly because kayako looks scarier in this, but i still find the original terrifying as well.But it all comes down to what scares you. If you're scared of ghosts, it will, if you're not, maybe not but who knows? 10/10 masterpiece of horror :) But the third film DOES suck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge is the American remake of the Japanese horror film. What's different about The Grudge is it's non-linear story line. At first you think it's three separate stories, then just two, and finally you realize that your seeing interspersed story lines from the past and from the present and they meet at the end of the film -- filling you in on the curse and what's happening. (Think Momento and Identity) The scariest part of the story, and it is pretty creepy, is that because the curse born as a result of the first murder kills indiscriminately anyone who enters the house. Not immediately. Not in the same way. No matter what you do, you can't outwit it. If you were in the house, it's got your number. The scariest thing is most of the people involved were innocent -- they had nothing to do with the original killing, when seeing the ghost while shocked, they tried to help. Yet, still they died. There might have been a way to avoid the curse but unfortunately, it didn't get carried out. There's no CGI/FX -- everything is low key and creepy. I'd almost say this is more psychological horror than monster coming to get you horror but never the less -- you'll probably end up sleeping with the lights on and wondering if you should ever go into a house you don't know anything about again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! I was really surprised by this horror flick it definitely got a place in my top 10 horror film list I love it! It had plenty of horror, mystery and gore to keep me awake the whole time through! The only bad thing I have to say about this is that the performances were a bit boring and dull by some of the cast which sort of made me less frightened. But other than that it still sends shivers down my spine! The grudge was very well done. It was so realistic and creepy that I stayed up half the night awake! See thats the thing with Japenese directors, they just whip up horror masterpieces. Next to "The Ring" this film is truly terrifying...it never forgets! ********/**********(8/10 stars) ~Kalendra</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good horror movie that doesn't really have any horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Grudge' simply isn't scary.Period.But just because a movie isn't scary doesn't mean it's not good.Examples of these include 'The Ring 2' and 'Land of the Dead'. The review written on the cover title says that this movie is even more frightening than 'The Ring'. I disagree on many levels.This movie isn't scary.It isn't even creepy or reasonably suspenseful.But I liked.I enjoyed it for what it was,and it was an entertaining movie with some memorable scenes and a good cast,which consists of Sarah Michielle Gellar,Jason Behr,and Bill Pullman.I have to admit that the original Japenese version was slightly better and had 1 jump scene.Overall,this non-scary flick is worth checking out.Also watch the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woman, cat, boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest this film doesn't have an awful lot going for it. It's Chinese, it has too many women in it, and the order is all jumbled up so you don't know what day it is or if someone is alive or dead or both. At least it bucks the recent trend of hilarious screamers which started with Scream, you know, those films that try to scare you and make you funny at the same time. There is no comedy here (though the wee boy in the cupboard was quite funny) and unfortunately there are no scares here either (though the wee boy in the cupboard was quite scary). It is a remake of the Chinese TV series 'Why Does This Lady With The Hair Have An Angry Against Me, Daddy?' There isn't really a plot or, it's just a pile of things happening involving a haunted house. One girl goes to the house; she thinks it's evil, has a look around, and gets sucked into the attic by a big hairy woman. Another girl replaces the last one, goes to the house and meets a little boy who seems to be made of chalk and speaks like a cat. The big hairy woman comes out and gets her too. The rest of the film involves police, school girls, and others going to the house and getting chased from room to room by the big hairy woman. In one frankly bizarre scene, one girl who escaped the house goes home and goes to the toilet. She sits down and begins doing her business. She knows something is amiss. The scary music starts. Is she alone? Is she safe? The door creaks! Everyone jumps. Her phone rings! Everyone jumps. Plop! Everyone jumps. She looks around the house, but no-one is there so she goes back to the toilet for more. She twitches, thinking something is tickling her bum. Again. And again. She gets up and looks down the toilet (dirty girl) and suddenly- BOO! The hairy woman is in the toilet! She grabs the girl and pulls her down into the darkness. Later, when her boyfriend comes home he goes to the toilet, opens the lid only to find his dead girlfriends head poking round the U bend, one leg bent beside her ear.As enjoyable as that sounds it really isn't. I haven't been able to go to the toilet sitting down since. Yes, I have to stand, facing the toilet at all times. I'm sure you can imagine the shapes I've had to put myself into in order to successfully deposit my mail. The rest of the film had less impact, and raised more questions than answers- why was the woman there? Why had the boy swallowed his cat? Why did everyone start crawling around the house, and why didn't someone just chuck a few grenades down the chimney and be done with it? Interestingly this Buffy spin off doesn't feature Gellar at her toughest. It would have been better if she's called in Giles, Willow, and Xander and they could have talked out the problem and then stake ass. Maybe it was all a nightmare.Best Scene: When the Chinese woman was walking up the stairs and you could almost see her pants.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overrated horror film with too much hype and a predictable outcome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie a long time ago but decided to do a review when my friend kept going on and on about how she is still scared to death by this movie years after she saw it. I feel i need to express my opinion on this much hyped horror movie.The Grudge is proclaimed as one of the *scariest* movies of our generation when really it gets into the mind of the audience that it is scarier than it presents itself to be. When i first saw the trailer for this when the hand came out of Sarah Michelle Gellar's head in the shower i admit i thought this was going to be a scary as hell horror movie. But what i got was a movie with many and i mean MANY moments that leave you on the edge of your seat and exactly what you expected to happen, well happens.My complaints of this movie was that there were too many moments where you hear a noise or think you see something and the character turns her head and nothing is there. Or when a scary moment happens and it cuts straight to the next scene without explanation of what happened to that character. For example, very first scene of the movie where the girl goes into the attic with the candle (Oh yeah like she goes into a dark attic with nothing but a candle, there definitely isn't anything there that is about to pop out) but what do you know...something does!! and its the grudge girl person. Well being the first scene of the movie i thought it was kinda scary and cool as a warm up of things to come. But the repetitiveness was almost boring in a way i couldn't keep my attention to the movie. Sarah Michelle Gellars character walking around Tokyo for 2 hours trying to find the history of the house and everything gave me a headache. The random scenes where the grudge girl were to pop out randomly and give the audience the short *scare* factor was annoying and random scenes where the victims of the house get killed off were never explained and leave you wondering OK? what just happened? The Grudge is an overrated horror movie with some original material but should never by any means be considered one of the greatest horror films of all time. Watch this movie to get a quick scare and then forget about it maybe 2 weeks later. I give it a 6/10 for effort</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is with Japanese people using water, flies, and freaky looking children in their movies.This movie reminds me of The Ring, which was another lousy Japanese horror picture. The Ring would have been great if not for the ending. But we're not talking about The Ring, we're talking about The Grudge. Although the two movies have a similar plot, this movie differs in that instead of a video tape killing people, its a house. A man murdered his wife and child in his house and the emotions stil inhabit the home. Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) works for a nursing home and visits the house frequently. Everyone who enters this house winds up dead. The wife and child who were murdered are the main spooks in this film. The little boy doesn't do much but is quite terrifying. The woman is the one that causes people to die. I'm sure anyone could compare the two movies (The Grudge and The Ring) and make a list of how the two are alike, from the girl messing with the security cameras, to the bathtub scenes and flooding water. I gave this movie 4 stars because there is nothing special about it. I have not seen the original, but I presume since it was done by the same director as Ju-On, that this is just another remake that has been ruined by Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Budge for This "Grudge!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Japanese horror movies were making a killing at the box office after Universal Pictures released "The Ring," their terrifying 2002 remake of the 1998 Nipponese chiller "Ringu." Surprisingly, "The Ring" scared up so much money for Universal that the studio green-lighted a sequel. Not surprisingly, Columbia Pictures hopped onto the bandwagon, too, with their remake of "Ju-On: The Grudge" (2002), another legendary Asian supernatural saga in the "Ringu" tradition. As the second major Americanized rehash of a Japanese nail-biter, "The Grudge" toppled "Shark Tale" from the top box office slot with a shocking $40-million weekend haul.Despite its profitable numbers, "The Grudge" evokes few of the thrills and chills that made "The Ring" so riveting. As far as "The Grudge" goes, you might say that the spirit of this handsomely produced haunted house hokum must have been lost somewhere in translation. While "The Grudge" developed several spooky shutters, the hopelessly incoherent screenplay and the dire shortage of white-knuckled hysterics seriously undercuts its impact. Gorehounds will snooze, and only audiences that have never seen a horror movie may shriek. Although he didn't pen the lukewarm, R-rated, U.S. adaptation, Takashi Shimizu convinced Columbia to let him remake his own fright-mare with American leads on location in the land of the Rising Sun. Nevertheless, not even the same Japanese writer &amp; director who called the shots on the three original "Ju-On: The Grudge" movies can conjure up more than just goose bumps with this atmospheric but anemic American version. Altogether, the result prove far less alarming because "The Grudge" delivers a less than satisfactory ending and the computer-generated, special effects look ridiculous.Sarah Michelle Gellar of TV's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" plays a dull American exchange student in Tokyo. Our heroine fills in fro a social worker at a health-care agency when the latter disappears without explanation. As Karen Davis, Gellar finds herself assigned to care for an elderly catatonic patient, Emma (Grace Zabriskie of "Gone in Sixty Seconds"), who has been abandoned apparently by the Japanese caregiver entrusted with her welfare. Initially, Karen freaks out when she enters Emma's house and finds it trashed. Along the way, Karen hears ominous noises, too. Meanwhile, Emma's son Matthew (William Mapother of "Suspect Zero") and her daughter-in-law Jennifer (Clea DuVall of "Identity") vanish mysteriously not long after they rent the house for her. Eventually, not only does a swirling, airborne poltergeists with a cadaverous face materialize out of thin air while Karen is tending to Emma, but also Karen notices a tight-lipped little Japanese boy prowling the premises with a black cat.Eventually, Karen learns that a murderous Tokyo dad killed his wife Kayako (Takako Fuji) and son Toshio (Yuya Ozeki), and then committed suicide. The domicile where this diabolical crime occurred somehow committed to memory the fury and the malevolence of the murder so that the undead spirits of Kayako and Toshio haunt it. Now, they hold a deadly "grudge" against anybody who ventures into those quarters! Later, Japanese authorities discover the missing corpses of Emma's son and his wife drained of all their blood and hidden in the attic. When Karen launches her own investigation into these evil spirits, she encounters another expatriate American, Dr. Bill Kirk (Bill Pullman of "Independence Day"), who has been conducted his own probe. The only problem is that the Pullman character committed suicide at the outset of this epic, long before the Gellar character confronted the eerie happenings in this creepy but cobweb-free haunted house.Freshman scribe Stephen Susco's murky screenplay shuns the standard narrative flow of start to finish. Instead, this yawner unfolds as a series of flashbacks as it weaves itself chaotically around an array of characters, some dead and other alive, who cross paths but cannot communicate with each other. Shimizu doesn't let the normally charismatic Gellar strut her stuff, so she comes off looking and acting flat by comparison with some of her other film roles. Mind you, Shimizu knows how to set up scary scenes, but the pay-offs to his subtle but spooky shenanigans are less than harrowing. Half of the audience that I sat with Sunday afternoon where I saw this pathetic paranormal potboiler stomped out of the theater griping about how much "The Grudge" sucked.An ambiguous finale, passive performances, sketchy characters and a confusing storyline undermine whatever terror that the American account of this celebrated Japanese movie struggled to deliver. Don't budge for "The Grudge!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Grudge" is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. I have always been a big fan of Sarah Michelle so that's why i went in to see this. I knew from the preview that this movie was gonna scare me, but i had no clue as to how much it would. I was in 5th grade i think and i went to see this with my mom. It took 10 minutes into the movie before she said,"I think i just peed myself!". There's always gonna be those loud obnoxious teenagers that think they're so tough that they can laugh at the movie. They were laughing for about 2 minutes and then they shut up right at the balcony scene. The rest of the movie they were silent. After watching this i was literally scared to go upstairs or even to bed. I was scared for at least 2 weeks. Because of this movie, for about 2 years i had to tuck my covers in under my feet. If you watch, you'll know why. Overall, one of the scariest movies to me. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective Japanese horror dulled by unnecessary remake and unnecessary CGI.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In perusing all the negative comments about The Grudge spread out among the IMDb, I'm amazed at how many people, even professional critics, have gotten the basic premise completely wrong. The curse that the movie is centered around is not created when someone dies in a horrible way, it's created when someone dies "in the grip of anger." The terrible rage that has consumed someone at the time of their death is what creates the curse, and then that rage consumes anyone that it comes into contact with, at which point it also renews itself.Not that it matters, however, for the most part, people have been tending to be right about the rest of the movie. It's a remake of a Japanese film of the same name, which was released barely a year before this one and was directed by the same guy and is, by the way, leaps and bounds better than this one. You know all this stuff. The infamous opening scene of the American version is certainly surprising and promises an interesting movie, but then the movie veers off in a completely different direction and for most of the time it seems like that first scene is completely unrelated.Ultimately, it is little more than your standard haunted house story, which is probably the oldest and weakest story in the horror book. If you make a movie about a haunted house these days, there better be something truly interesting about it, otherwise it is guaranteed to sink unnoticed into obscurity.Sarah Michelle Gellar, a veteran of bad American horror movies, enters the mix adding her unique brand of weak horror acting. She's a college student finally granted her long- standing wish to travel abroad, but unfortunately she gets placed in this house helping to care for an old woman suffering from dementia, which basically means she spends most of the time staring into empty spaces at ghostly things that no one else seems to realize are really there. Gradually, we come to realize that she's not just losing her mind, she's being driven insane by ghostly forces that simply won't leave her alone. Enter another couple, Jennifer and Matthew, who are also living in Japan temporarily, as the husband has business there. Clea DuVall, the most talented actor in the entire movie, plays Jennifer, and the becomes immediately unhappy with the whole situation. She is having major problems adjusting to life in Japan, unable to communicate, unable to read any of the packages on the food at the supermarket, etc. Basically many of the same troubles I had when I moved here to China two years ago. As is to be expected, weird things start happening.You get the idea. I have heard people defend the movie by saying that there is nothing to complain about, the ghosts act perfectly naturally by lashing out at anyone who comes near because of course they're angry about how they died and want to take it out on someone! Yeah, I can understand that, but a movie about that and nothing else? And not only one, but TWO movies? Is it too much to ask for more than exactly the same kind of story that he been being told for hundreds of years?Since I am an American living in an Asian culture myself, I had hoped that they would take the opportunity to use the combination of American actors in a Japanese film to give us some kind of cultural analysis, maybe even something that would compare the Japanese and American horror styles. The opportunities were endless, but they were all ignored in favor of simply Americanizing a Japanese horror film. And having seen more than my share of both styles of horror, I can tell you that Americanizing Japanese horror is not the way to make it better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japanese flavored horror has a timeline problem...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE GRUDGE never quite gets over its disorganized script problems.There's a glaring timeline factor that keeps the picture on the edge of a horror puzzle in which all the pieces don't really come together in a sensible enough way. Still, there are gripping scenes where you know something is about to happen, since there's an air of dread that hangs like a funeral wreath over the whole story.SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR has to handle most of the acting chores, succeeding in looking horrified and frightened the moment she enters the forbidden house where menacing spirits seem to be hiding in every shadow. BILL PULLMAN has an interesting opening moment but then disappears through most of the tale after his quick opening scene. We don't get to see him again until the film is almost over because the whole timeline of the story is so scrambled.Based on a Japanese horror film, it does a neat job of keeping the suspenseful elements as a hook that grabs the viewer, but some in the audience may become a bit impatient with the pace of the film which seems to have a sleepwalking slowness about it.Interesting, creepy, sometimes gory, but only a middling success. Well photographed and technically quite efficient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lights off. Snuggle up to your blanket. Open your mind for this ride! Highly recommended!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People really need to "get" into it to experience the desired effect. They need to learn how to truly become one with the film while viewing, to absorb the tension and allow the film and atmosphere to "take" you there. They need to open up to a film and "allow" themselves to be scared, to allow the movie to show you whats its really got. That means, lights off, talking to a minimum, good sound, preferably late at night, freeing your mind of thought to allow the film to effectively and properly portray its vision, imagery, tension, ambiance, atmosphere, story etc.I cant stand people who seemingly on purpose dismiss these general rules of thumb and put up a shield of armor to stop the film/films from achieving what they set out to do, and yet they think they can justifiably say it wasn't scary. I think many people do this because they believe its cool to not be scared of a film, or are afraid there friends will say something like "Ah your a sissy, that wasn't scary!" Don't get me wrong, i'm sure for some reasons, certain films just don't get to certain people, but all to often, it seems more often than not, people fall into this irritating category. Fear can quite easily be avoided consciously and sub-consciously by closing your mind whether intentional or unintentional and by not setting yourself up with the proper atmosphere. Open up to a film! Let the film show YOU what its got, instead of showing the film what you can avoid.I don't care what anyone says: this film is a work of genius laced with an imagination that goes far and beyond what most could even possibly begin to think up. The directing style was original and the story was told with enough to get you up to date with whats going on but with enough left out to keep the mystery alive and to keep you thinking. The imagery was truly astounding. I could go on but ill just say, yes, to me and most i know, it was scary as hell!! I would not watch it by myself, but i recommend it if you really wanna "fun" ride! :) Overall: Awesome, i loved it! My 2cents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At least The Grudge tried to be scary, and it succeeded to an extent. It was cheesy and it did use the tiresome little-kid-ghosts-who-kill cliché, but there was still something about it that beat out a lot of wannabe horror movies I've seen. Maybe the Asians do understand ghost stories better than the Americans?as can be argued using (the original) Dark Water and The Ring. Maybe the movie was a little more entertaining and scary than I've seen in a while. I don't know.All I know is The Grudge does everything wrong except the core ghost story, which redeems it. I wouldn't call it original or different, but it is unnerving. Also, the content for a PG-13 movie is no different than a lot of R-rated ghost movies like The Orphanage, which this far surpasses.Maybe in the end I liked The Grudge more than I realize. It tried to use the full potential it had, and maybe that's the reason I don't give it the lowest possible score.2/10</fullReview>

It has some genuinely good moments were you find your self jumping or the hairs on your back of your neck stand up. One thing that is very engrossing is the setting, Japan looks beautiful and captivates the audience with the story. The movie is directed by the same director who made the Japanese version which is a first for Hollywood. It has some similarities to 'The Ring' which is a little disappointment because people expected to find something a little different.Its not a film that will have you sleeping with the light on but has some decent scares.</fullReview>

I saw this one with friends who really wanted to see it, and I didn't feel like sitting outside for 2 hours waiting for them to be finished.While I can see why many people didn't like it, or find it scary, I was terrified! The Grudge, she scared me! I had a very hard time sleeping for weeks after watching this, I was so afraid to look under my covers for fear of her being in bed with me! Lets not even go into the stairway at work! Every little noise had me jumping! My friends found it funny that I was afraid of it, so they bought me the DVD just to laugh at me for it! I had to have it covered in a bag at the back of my bookcase! I couldn't even look at it! The only other time I've done that was with the IT DVD! Just this year I finally peeled open the plastic bag and pulled her out. I managed to get through the movie, all alone mind you, and without any nightmares. But it still was creepy! Ultimately what I find so amazing about the Grudge is that she is very minimalist for a ghost, but so very effective. Open eyes wide and make strange noise! Scary, scary, scary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It succeeded in being scary. Lots of good scares and creepy atmosphere.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been about a hundred American remakes of Japanese horror films recently, and the Grudge is the only one that worked for me. I saw this in the theaters and the mood in the film, and the audience was genuinely scared and tense. In fact, this is probably the most scary atmosphere I've seen in a recent horror film. The plot, the actors and everything else comes second to the scares and the atmosphere. Most movies would bother me if that was the case, but this one didn't. It was trying to be a horror film, and that's all it was, and a darn good one I must say.For some reason all the American remakes of Japanese flicks still take place in Japan, with American actors. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Karen Davis, a nurse who begins to take care of an elderly old lady at her house. The old lady is killed by a strange presence in the house, and Karen is plagued with a curse which is killing all the people around her and scaring the audience half to death.Jump scenes are a technique used by almost every "teenager" or "slasher" horror film, and they only cause quick scares that only catch those paying attention at that moment. There are a few jump scenes here, but most of the scares are built from the super creepy environment and the thought that we know something will happen, just when is it coming? The grudge ghosts were also pretty scary. When "The Ring" came out and it was touted as some sort of remake masterpiece for modern horror I felt I must see it. I was very disappointed. "The Grudge" opened to mixed reviews, none really praising it, and for scares and overall artistic direction, "The Grudge" was a triumph. The plot makes no sense, and that's one of the big problems with this movie. With a more logical plot, maybe this would have been a well reviewed movie. But throw the plot away for this one, I still enjoyed it! My rating: *** out of ****. 95 mins. PG-13 for terror and violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last a good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, I have the opinion that remakes are pointless and boring. American industry usually takes original ideas and copies them just to make money. The results are, in most of the cases, absurd. I know many users and critics won't agree with me but this one is an exception. Not only for not being a bad movie but for being even superior to the original. One of the problems with Asian films in general is that they are slow to watch and full of long silences. This "grudge" fills in those "empty" spaces, as a clear Hollywood technique, and yet it respects the original one. Normally, remakes erase the backgrounds of original movies to locate them somewhere in America. But this one still happens in Japan and this time Americans are the foreign people who have to adapt and speak the language. It is so pleasant to see in this movie that every time that two Japanese characters get alone without foreign presence they speak their language instead of English with Japanese accent (why the hell would someone do that) like in Indiana Jones' or James Bond's movies. In this sense, it shows that, though with American production, the director is the same as the original one. And finally, another quality is that this version is less confusing than the Japanese film. Just this time, for making a remake with a total and logical respect of the culture they approach to, I give this grudge an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Takashi Shimizu re-heats a successful recipe to make it accessible to an English-speaking audience unprepared to read a few lines on the bottom of the screen to receive the undiluted creepiness of his original and, somehow, fails to reproduce the same success. That's what happens when you tamper with the ingredients, you inevitably lose the flavour of the original, and the new serving is just a pale reflection of the original.I wonder why Shimizu chose to have the ghoulish boy stand further back from the lift window in this version. In the first, if I recall it correctly, he practically had his blank face pressed to the glass, the pale waxy blueness of his skin contrasting with the rich red carpet. That scene in the original really creeped me out, but in this film ? even allowing for the fact that I knew what was coming ? it's, well, just another scene.Despite this, The Grudge still stands head and shoulders above the majority of Hollywood's horror output these days. For the most part it retains the brooding menace of the original and, as a foreigner in a foreign land, even adds to the piquancy of Sarah Michelle Gellar's dilemma. Shimizu takes us back and forth in time with enough skill to never leave us in doubt as to exactly where we are in the story, and delivers a few effectively scary moments. And, as with the original, this is more than just a haunted house story ? this is a cursed house, and the malevolent ghosts that are the instruments of revenge on all those who cross its barriers are not bound by the four walls within which the curse resides, meaning there is literally no escape.</fullReview>

I'm pleased that I did as it was better than I expected of a remake, I suspect it was helped by the fact that it was remade by the original director.While it isn't the best of stories it is certainly creepy, several scenes gave me goosebumps which is the main thing needed in a horror film.The basic plot is that there is a house in Tokyo that has been haunted since a mother and child where murdered by the man of the family and anybody who visits the house is doomed to die fairly soon afterwards. The ghosts are certainly creepy but unfortunately we didn't have enough time to get to care about the main character, a nurse played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, which made me less concerned about her plight.I was pleased to see that it didn't fall into modern horror cliché of adding excess gore and gratuitous nudity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge is set in Tokyo in Japan where American foreign exchange student Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) works as a volunteer carer, her boss Alex (Ted Raimi) gives her a job to look after an old woman in a house after her usual carer Yoko (Yoko Maki) disappears. Once there Karen finds a mysterious young Japanese boy taped into a cupboard. Later on Alex visits the house &amp; finds the old woman dead &amp; Karen in a state of shock &amp; fear, the police are called &amp; they discover the bodies of the previous American owners in the attic as the house seems to throw up more &amp; more sinister findings. Then Yoko turns up minus her jaw. Karen decides to investigates the past of the house &amp; makes some shocking discoveries...This Japanese, American &amp; German co-production was directed by Takashi Shimizu &amp; is one of a recent spate of classic Asian horror films being remade by Hollywood like the impressive The Ring (2002), the awful Dark Water (2005) &amp; The Eye (2008), I would say that The Grudge comes somewhere between the two as while it's not as good as the remake of The Ring it's nowhere near as bad as Dark Water. Annoyingly like a lot of recent horror films The Grudge is available in both a 'PG-13' theatrical cut &amp; an 'Unrated' version (just to weed more money out of the fans as usual) which changes &amp; adds a lot of things, I will be basing my comments on the standard theatrical cut. The script by Stephen Susco was based on the film Ju-On: The Grudge (2003) which was actually written &amp; directed by Shimizu, it must have been weird for him remaking his own film within a year from a script written by someone else based on his original. Anyway, this remake sticks pretty closely to the original in many ways keeping most if not all of the main character's (although it changes the nationality of some to American), most of the significant events from the Japanese original take place &amp; to be honest there's not a lot of difference between them. The film can be quite confusing at times as it has quite a loose narrative structure, it introduces people &amp; then quickly dumps them, it goes between different sets of character's very suddenly which is quite jarring at times but it does all come together pretty well at the end. The actual ending revelation is a little routine, I was maybe expecting something a bit more dramatic but it works &amp; that's the main thing.Director Shimizu does a great job, The Grudge is one of the few big Hollywood remakes which you can say has a really creepy &amp; eerie atmosphere. There are some terrific jump moments, sure they are older than dirt with the likes of cats suddenly jumping into frame or a telephone ringing at a tense moment but they sure do work &amp; are fun. There is also some pretty creepy imagery of ghost's, I could certainly see anyone who gets scared easily having nightmares after seeing The Grudge. The version I saw didn't have any gore apart from a ripped-off jaw &amp; the owner of said jaw turning up. It's very well made with some nice long sustained scenes of horror, The Grudge is a film which goes for scares &amp; atmosphere rather than CGI which is nice. The sound effect that accompanies the ghost is also quite unsettling &amp; creepy in a odd sort of way.With a supposed budget of about $10,000,000 The Gudge wasn't a mega-budget film &amp; it's near forty million dollar opening weekend actually surprised studio executives who quickly agreed to make a sequel. Actually shot in Japan. The acting is fine, Sarah Michelle Gellar is nice on the eyes, the Saeki family are all played by the same actors who played the roles in the Japanese original.The Grudge is a good solid pretty creepy horror film remake, I liked it although I doubt I would want to watch it again anytime soon. Followed by The Grudge 2 (2006) &amp; The Grudge 3 (2009).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barely mediocre; doesn't do justice to the original version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The makers of this film should be butchers at a grocery store, chopping up meat. They're experts in the field of hacking up a good thing. In short, this is an unnecessary remake. Typical of its ilk, it fails to even approach the movie it imitates. The few moments that are effective are those culled directly from Ju-On, the original Japanese version. The classically creepy security video camera sequence, which ran chills down your spine in Ju-On, becomes in this homogenized remake no more interesting than watching a security camera aimed at a vacant parking lot. That's only one example of many scenes that are made bland.It's good the film is set in Japan; it gives a cultural edge to the story that makes the legend and the curse believable and formidable. But that begs the question: why redo it at all? The scenes inserted with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Bill Pullman, apparently intended to add some back story about the people who had once lived in the house, really add nothing to the actual focus of the story. Not to mention that Gellar's acting is, quite frankly, sadly lacking. She looked like she was doing skits from a Sesame Street episode, rather than a horror flick.If it's on free TV, then it's just watchable. However, for a real horror movie experience, the original version is far better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great. Scared the hell out me. I loved it and the second movie. I am such a huge fan. I wish they would continue with the whole entire series. BTW I found a sweet tribute video to the grudge on the net. You'll laugh your ass off. Here is the link... http://www.(you)tube.com/watch?v=1b82kXlmPFU . Anyways I definitely give it a 10 of 10. If I hear that throat gasping noise or see a little Asian boy now it creeps me out. LOL! Yeah but definitely check this movie out if you want a good scare. I haven't had a movie scare me that much in a long time. I thought the second movie wasn't as good but i'd give that one 9 of 10 but it was still great. I just thought it lack the storyline that the first one had. Do you have a grudge? Oh google "Do the Grudge" if you want to see that video also. Hope you all enjoyed this movie as much as me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult to be frightened if a film just confuses you. Maybe it lost something in translation, but a series of disconnected and apparently unexplained episodes between different characters that don't seem to have much to do with one another didn't have the hairs standing up on the back of my neck. Sure, sure, it has the scary stop-frame animation girl from The Ring, but random pools of water, small children with white-painted faces, and a hairpiece that drags itself across the floor just doesn't it for me.In the end I gave up &amp; read the synopsis (above). I guess it sort-of explains the film, although it just seems like a bit of a lame excuse for filming several short stories without bothering to tie them together properly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an avid lover of horror films. I wait, patiently, to find a good one that will give me nightmares, or cause me to hurry in the dark from room to room. The Grudge did that for me! That sound she makes, stayed with me for days and days! When I first saw the movie, there was a NIKE commercial running on TV with different athletes, one was a Asian man and the picture was dark, I had to change the channel because it reminded me of the movie! I can sit through almost anything, but this one really got under my skin. You have to watch it alone, and in the dark to get the full extent. And just imagine it happening to you. Truly a good horror flick! And a very well done adaptation for American viewing, I saw the original (unbeatable) but this one came pretty close!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not care for horror but my sister convinced me to watch it. I hated it but gave it ten for anyone who likes horror. Altogether, nice job Sam.I just hated that sound Kayako made and probably everyone does. I had nightmares for weeks! The PG-13 rating was not enough. All in all, good film. Not much else to say except do not watch unless you like horror. It was better than the ring because it even said so on the box. Every time I see an Asian person I think they are jaw less. too scary for me. Toshio is really scary to me and so is Kayako. Come on, pulling someone under the bedsheets? That was supposed to be security from monsters! What really was scary about it was when that one woman was on the apartment complex and Kayako was after her. One just knew that guard would suddenly be pulled int a room and not come back out again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I got this movie and watched it, I was pleasantly scared. The cover of the movie shows it's intensity well, and I LOVED it! I watched this months ago and I'm still spooked! The only thing about this movie that I didn't like was that it switched scenes very fast, and very quickly.I also loved the surprise in this movie... how the little boy's mouth suddenly opens unnaturally wide and you know the fate of the person he is after.My favorite part was definitely the last scene in the house towards the end. I heard that sickening sound over and over in my head and it was amazing and disgusting how Kayako ended the movie. I was very excited to see Grudge 2! Another amazing title is the Ring. Not as scary as the Grudge, but a better storyline!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i am not the sort of person who gets scared easily, in fact i can only think of a handful of films that engage me in that way. This film had me looking around the sofa at the end and got the spine tingling.The premise behind the film is a bit clichéd but the Japanese director did a great job keeping and building the suspense and getting a good performance from an actress as wooden as S.M.Gellar.I don't understand why so many people have to compare this movie to the Japanese original, how many people did that for reservoir dogs and the hong kong original or roxanne and cyrano de bergerac to name just a couple of examples. Film -making is all about ripping off from other films anyway and this was catered for an American/English speaking audience. Any comparison is unfair as its apples to oranges and pointless anyway, this film should be judged on its merits and its a great horror flick!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw the grudge I though it was ridicules. Now that i've sean it i can say that it was a fun movie to watch. It had some suspense and was no better or worse than the original Japenese version. It had good imagery, by the way if anyone is wondering how they made the ghosts move like that, it was through the use of fast motion shots which make the ghosts move in a twitchy sort of manner. But anyway it was some-what smart and interesting, acting was good. Though there are some actors i would have replace with others. The sound effects were nice and creepy and the scares were pretty good. I liked the colors too, of the ghosts i mean, the way Kayako had baby blue skin with red blood on her was a nice mix of colors that i enjoyed. All in all i liked this movie even though it needed some improvement, maybe you might too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some feel that Yankees can't say bad things about this movie because it's Japanese. But it's a remake done especially for Yanks, so the cultural argument doesn't hold much water. It doesn't take long to figure out most of what ends up being called the plot. The only scary parts are the cheap tricks to force you into feeling scared... The sudden, strange visual accompanied by a crescendo of music and/or sound effects... In my view there's a wide gulf between the frightening and the startling, and true horror movies focus on the former. Think of The Shining... that's scary in concept and execution. The Grudge just isn't truly frightening, and since it's meant to be a horror film, it therefore just isn't very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Japanese folklore features a wide array of different monsters, or Y&#x14d;kai, but you'd never know from mainstream movies. This remake is another horror about one of those black-eyed, ghostly kids crawling on walls, meowing and killing a score of one-dimensional characters. It has three or four unsettling moments - which worked better in the original Ju-On - but also a paper-thin plot and an utter lack of characterization. These are not people, they are walking props for the next jump scare.One of the few ideas which work well is how the film is not told in a linear fashion, but unravels slowly with strategically-placed flashbacks. This back-story is not particularly compelling, but at least the movie doesn't spoon-feed the audience right from the start.Watch the original, Nakata's Dark Water or Verbinski's The Ring instead.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers of the musing about plot elements and storyline type. * I do not watch this often, but it just popped up in my mind and I felt I had to muse about what I would write for a comment on this. I understand it to be a story giving an explanation for an element of popular culture, but showing a belief in a solution that I experience as 180 degrees out. I interpret it as showing a difficulty that society has by typically being ruled via inspiration that offers fools a forked tongue. The far east, Japan. The boy has been drowned by his dad. His spirit survives, fuelled by a grudge. There is death and mayhem around because his spirit is active. The cure is seen as burning down the house, but chance messes that up again and again. I assume that the drowning is symbolic and likely very unintentional. In my case it could be about parents and authorities practicing what they understand as ways handed down as sensible and to be respected, ways that for me came to over-ride common sense. With me in the UK that was centred on normal Victorian English 1950's rules, such as being obedient and quiet and polite, honouring family, doing things out of duty, must do. Within limits that approach has had a lot of successes, the problem comes when one is outside of the boundaries within which it is capable of giving good results. In electronics, some early types of op amp can stick in an overload condition called latch up. I assume that this story being set in Japan was not just chance. I assume that grudge could often be an outsider's view about the internals of the spirit. What it seems rather than what it actually is. I accept that even the drowned are likely to have trouble in understanding just what their reality is. Jericho springs to mind as a loose parallel. To me, Jericho fits especially well as the example is likely to fuel the escalating mayhem, very Grudge. amendment: A deep Grudge might fit well if it reflected spirit plus a strong external add-on RAGE. I assume that the death and mayhem are unlikely to come from the spirit of the boy, but from such as ricochet effects. I assume that attempts to burn down the house will escalate the problem, add more fuel, more ricochet and equivalents. * Further, I purchased my DVD under the influence of Daveigh's The Ring of 2002, only then discovering that this includes Clea and Sarah Michelle in its cast. I assume that they are there for symbolic reasons, as with Japan. View this as fiction rather than faction, then it feels a worthwhile story. I find key elements of the faction to be an inversion of reality. I understand it to be a parable about one of the ways that society destroys itself, while feeling justified in blaming the damage on pigeon droppings. A powerful parable about a major issue that will continue to be a major issue because of one hundred and eighty. Just one of those things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge (2004, Dir. Takashi Shimizu) Story Karen Davis is an American Nurse move to Tokyo and encounters a supernatural spirit who is vengeful and often possesses its victims. A series of horrifying and mysterious deaths start to occur, with the spirit passing its curse onto each victim. Karen must now find away to break this spell, before she becomes its next victim.Actors OK?where do I start? Sarah Michelle Geller was good I guess. I didn't really see her as being brilliant, but she wasn't terrible. I'm not familiar with Jason Behr, but his performance in this was actually quite good. Bill Pullman was amazing as ever. I'm not familiar at all with any of the Japanese stars, but they had good performances. Also, the two ghosts were portrayed wonderfully.Music The soundtrack wasn't very special. I had heard it all before in horror movies and made no lasting impression on me. Personally, the soundtrack was quite disappointing for me.Special Effects The special effects are actually the highlight of this film, as they use very little computer generated imagery as possible. The movements of the actors playing the ghosts and the makeup make them look more frightening that CGI would achieve in this film.Conclusion I usually enjoy horror and suspense filled films, but I really just couldn't grasp the plot of this film. I just couldn't follow the story easily. I lost track of the characters and what they did. To me, it just felt as if they were just throwing in random English and Japanese characters. I'll be interested to see what I think of it's sequel or even the original, but unfortunately 'The Grudge' did nothing for me."Sorry, did I wake you?"? Doug (Jason Behr) "Bottom drawer." ?

Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert as the main ones! They wanted to let the director decide what he was going to do, where he was going to go with the movie. And he went/stayed in Japan for the story/plot. Which is a brave move, because it could've easily flopped in the USA. People could be alienated and feel detached, because it's not their (western) world, they do know. People might also be confused by the time structure (jumping forward and backwards in time like in the original). If you can get over that, you will be scared! :o)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake is usually made in order to take advantage to today's tools to come out with something new and better. Now, this movie is based on the Japanese movie Ju-On. I have not seen that movie so no comparisons can be made by me between the two. The plot is very typical. A house is the stage for a bizarre incident and since then the house is haunted affecting everyone that steps in it.A routine movie where someone gets affected (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and is now trying to understand the mystery behind the place to try and save herself. In a horror movie, you know for sure that unless it is totally different that when a person is stepping in dark place alone and the camera is slowing down then something is going to happen. And when you expect something to happen and it does you hardly get the goose bumps.However, that is for the experienced movie goer. But for someone not too used to movies maybe this will still produce the thrills it is meant to produce. I recall seeing only one scene where the incident or event was totally unexpected and got on my nerves. Unlike the Ring which I call as an intelligent horror movie it does not get you too involved. But nonetheless a decent horror movie worth one watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressionistic horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the Hollywood remake of THE RING, I wasn't expecting much for this remake but I was pleasantly surprised by the end result. It doesn't add to much, there are no performances worth mentioning, the action is static and there is an element of predictability permeating the entire project but even with all these negative aspects, I still enjoyed the final result and THE GRUDGE works surprisingly well not as an all-out horror story but more as an impressionist styled horror.I'm usually bored with the current crop of PG-13 horror films. They're extremely anemic in quality and offer nothing new for the fading genre that's filled with unnecessary remakes and sequels. And THE GRUDGE would appear to fall into this category but it doesn't because the "deconstructed" direction works beautifully here. THE GRUDGE remake is a fine addition to the genre and I actually wish more horror films would take this impressionist approach, which is all too rare for something from Hollywood, than the SCOOBY DOO level spooks inflicting most horror films, which wouldn't impress a 5 year old.THE GRUDGE remake is well worth seeking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the release of the Grudge 2 in the Uk, I was looking forward to the continuation of the story. Director Takashi Shimizu is back again to continue what was started with the Grudge. In the Grudge, it is said that the rage and fury left in a house will last an eternity, getting stronger and stronger down through the ages....or words to that effect. The first film introduced us to the story and was set and shot in Tokyo and stared Sarah Michelle Geller of Buffy fame. Fans of the original Japanese films would have probably found the Hollywood versions a little watered down, but for the likes of me, who had never seen the Japanese versions, I watched them not expecting anything but a horror film. The second film opened the story up a little further and answered a few questions that remained unanswered in the first. The Director gave us the Hollywood slant but left enough of the Japanese element in it to keep the purists happy. The second film is without a doubt brilliant and horror fans will find enough shocks and jumps to keep the average bed wetter wet for decades.A+ For effort.</fullReview>

Takashi Shimizu directed this remake of his own "Ju-on", yet the thriller has a distinct case of "Ring"-itis (or perhaps "Poltergeist III"). Staccato clips of mutilated faces, and a now-famous bit with Sarah Michelle Gellar taking a shower with a demonic hand in her hair, was apparently enough to put the film over at the box-office, but it is positively grueling, repetitive, and pedestrian. Few genuine scares, a disappointing production design, and surprisingly bad performances manage to sink this one like a stone, yet enough people cared about it to warrant a 2006 sequel (!). * from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS I always love a good and terrifying horror film. I am not a big fan of Japanese horror films, but I was interested in watching this. It is based on a Japanese horror, I know, but it had a solid cast and looked like a really scary horror film. Well, it was not a good movie. Sure, it had some solid scares but it was way too boring. I mean, there was barely any dialog. I did not find this entertaining. It was also just too weird, in my opinion. I also do not think it is a very good idea to make a remake of a Japanese horror film. You will see what I mean when you watch this.Here is the plot of this movie. A nurse named Karen, hey, isn't there a nurse named Karen in Halloween 2? Anyway, a nurse named Karen has to take care of a woman that lives in a house in Tokyo, Japan. When she goes there she finds out that the woman named Emma is basically unresponsive to anyone. She also realizes that there is a creepy little boy with a psychotic moaning noise in the house. Emma dies. Then Karen's boyfriend comes to the house. The ghost kills her boyfriend. Karen sets the house on fire. She escapes alive, but at the hospital her boyfriend's body is making a moaning noise.Overall, this is a boring thriller. There is a lot more characters in the movie but I just was not paying a lot of attention because it was so boring. The moaning noise that little boy makes is scary at times but it gets really annoying really fast. The sequel for this movie was pointless. I mean, was there really need for a sequel? What is even worse is that they are making another sequel. Enough about the sequels, though. This is a pointless and sometimes scary film but it does not succeed as much as it's Japanese counterpart.4/10Recommended Films: The Grudge 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very similar to the ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie shows the pattern that follows some successful films: the imitation; the girl is specially a "ring type" girl, with the blue body and the hair black over her face; in some parts of the movie, it resembles almost exactly the ring: Attention the next part could be a spoiler! (ej: in the part when the police officer put a VHS tape on the recorder and begin to watch the security recording, watch it and you will see a ring scene!!). Scary? yes but 50 times less than the ring, and in the story at the beginning of the film they say that the curse remain in the place, but if this is true, why the girl and the boy are in the whole city?, just something to analyze. If you read this comment, i don't want you to not see the film; go get scared! and grab the arm of your couple or the one nearest to you, scream!, have a good time!, but you can also analyze this "ring patterns" and have some fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, my friend and I had gotten it on Pay-Per-View. We had expected the movie to be absolutely terrifying, the commercials we saw, were scary, so we decided to watch it. So late one Saturday night, we rented it. Now on with my review: First off, when the movie started, my friend and I were on the edge of our seats, and excited to see what was going to happen. As the movie progressed I wasn't too enthusiastic about the movie. The acting, was phenomenal!! I mean Sarah Michelle Gellar did a great job in this movie, and considering, I thought she was amazing in "I Know What You Did Last Summer" I knew she was going to do the same in this movie. Well the plot itself was mediocre. Of course I jumped a few times, considering the way "The Grudge" looked, but for some reason, the way she looked reminded me a little too much of, Samara, from "The Ring". The acting was great, it was just, to me personally, the plot was a little on the "eh" side. The movie overall did have me scared, but it didn't give the same effect as other horrors/thrillers in the past have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Interesting Japanese Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greatly enjoyed the great photography in Japan and the entire story about a young gal who is an exchange student; who is given an assignment to take care of an older woman in a rather strange home that has some very deep dark secrets where murder and horror occurred within its walls. A curse has been placed on anyone who enters this haunted house and takes on the theme that when someone is murdered and killed there soul remains in the home and passes on to the next person it can enter and takes complete control of any human body. This film seemed like it just went on and on and repeated itself will many flashbacks and I quickly became very bored and I could hardly wait until the film ended, which was HORRIBLE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cast rocks totally. Sarah Michelle Gellar has always been a favorite of mine, and I've always liked Ted Raimi. Buffy and Xena sidekick aside this cast is both perfect and impressive. Ryo Ishibashi is excellent as the detective in charge of the investigation. His acting ability, in large degree for me anyway, made this flick. But every player does a wonderful job in bringing their characters to life, and that is one of the better aspects of the film. It flows well, continuity is very good, scripting is good, nice camera technique with good photography, good sound track, subdued special effects that work real well in a movie like this with no "over the top" silliness, and I liked the plot. What might be a down side if you haven't seen this yet: Gellar is given top billing, making it look like its her flick. It isn't. This thing is a GROUP effort, and a VERY good one at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i went to see this movie not knowing anything about it. True it is adapted from the Japanese original. The best way to see any horror movie is not knowing anything about it. And this one did freak me out.The urban settings, large concrete city, people like you and me and a simply macabre presence make this movie identifiable and stays with you much after you have left the cinema house.The treatment is very slick, the performances credible, though Gellar does not look too credible as an American who has gone all the way to japan to live a life on her own.The back and forth story sequences do lend it even more enigma but also force you to concentrate... which means that you get involved with the storyline while the ghost creeps over your back.looking forward to the sequel.... which has incidentally released but not here in India. waiting for the DVD to hit the stores here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it just goes to show that I'm not easily scared, but my company was, so I guess the film did what it intended to do well. On the other hand, it really lacks any sort of meaningful story. It's almost like a short film that got bloated to full length.The aesthetics of the film were pretty good, although the editing was just too jagged to keep me interested in all the stories. It's almost like Takashi Shimizu (the director) decided to be like Quentin Tarentino, except with a case of ADD. It sort of disperses the suspense (and I think it also is a clever way of hiding the lack of story and also getting a chance to put in more suspenseful "yarr ghosties!" scenes).If you're the type that scares and want to be scared, this is a good place to go for that. It looks good, it sounds good, but it's kind of empty in the end. It's not terrible, but just not particularly impressive. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Grudge' is about an ancient Japanese legend that says-If you enter a house of great horror (Meaning a murder or something horrid took place there) that you become infected with the curse. Phony bologna yes, but the film is creepy and scary.The characters are all likable so it is creepier to see people you like to die. Very suspenseful and spooky. Good score too.The acting is A++++ from Sarah Michelle Gellar but some of the other actors need some work. There are some cheesy lines like, "Yoko, are you OK?" when she is covered with blood. Yes its not the best but it is fun and scary.I recommend this film big time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, but poorly plotted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge will make you jump out of your skin, to say the least. It IS scary in the extreme - oppression and death curses every scene in this absolute pant-wetter of a movie. But in favour of letting the audience wet themselves, they have just thrown away any cares about plot, real interest or character - and that is why The Ring was far better. The ending made little sense, serving just one purpose - to make a film that was 100% horror and 0% plot. None of it comes together, and from what people have said, I don't think the sequel will explain a great deal more. It's not a great movie, but there are enough genuine scares and interesting elements of Japanese culture to warrant a purpose. Lots of effort went into making this film as the special features on the DVD point out - the actors and director had to communicate even though the cast were all Americans and the director was Japanese - which made for a lot of complications and everything had to be translated. Which may explain why the acting wasn't hot. But the scares certainly were, and though this film won't make you shiver in bed all night long like The Ring (which was helped by the fact it was plain WEIRD), it will at least make you jump out of your skin every five minutes. The plot doesn't make sense, but the film, on the whole, grips. Recommended. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes figuring out what makes a movie good is like reading the ingredients of a candy bar. If you read "nougat" on the wrapper of a candy bar, then you know you're getting NOUGAT! THE GRUDGE is like a candy bar. It is stylistically solid.There were American-remakes of Ringu and Ringu2, the one that started the buzz over trans-Pacific horror. The first Ringu tasted like brittle seaweed. It broke into a million fragments like the T-1000 and there were seaweed shreds all over the place. Ringu2 didn't taste too bad, although it still left a strange, swampy aftertaste in my mouth.THE GRUDGE is like a HEATH BAR -- with cat hair stuck in it. What would make me say such a thing? Well, if you look at the ingredients on the wrapper, THE GRUDGE was directed by Takashi Shimizu, the guy who did the original Japanese version. He threw in all those door creaks and angry black cats that tap you on the shoulder and say, "Hey, you're on the security camera!" You know how the saying goes, if it isn't broken, don't fix it. A Heath Bar works well as a Heath Bar.On the inside of the Heath Bar is the brick and mortar that the director poured into it, and the milk-chocolate layer represents the Hollywood stars who give the package an enticing allure. I found it very pleasant to watch those actors and actresses. Hey, this movie isn't going to be a huge box office success, so let's have some fun with it. I'll pretend like I'm not who I am. "Yeah, we're famous actors, but we're also professionals who know when we make a good movie. We're going to come together and make this creepy Japanese horror thing work."Watch it twice.Jimboduck-dot-com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very efficient and scary horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't watched "Ju-On" so I can't assess this film in terms of remake, but, having watched many other Japanese movies and their American remakes, I have to say that "The grudge" is among the best of them: it definitely is scary, but it also managed to make me feel genuinely uneasy while and after watching it, which few horror movies succeed at doing. I think one of the best points about "The grudge" is that it is directed by Takashi Shimizu, AND that it was made in Japan: the fact of having American characters in a foreign country in which they still feel strangers to some degree or another makes it all an even more frightening experience, and adds a surreal and insane atmosphere.The weakest point about "The grudge" is that the story is simple to an extreme: it's basically a haunted house story a la Japanese. But the acting is very efficient and the scares are... well, really scary.I recommend this not only to fans of Japanese horror, but also to any horror buff (There's no gore, which is also -to me- a plus).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grudge:The Doc's Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This re-make of the Japanese cult hit is a new and improved version of Takashi Shimizu's JU-ON.The Grudge focuses on scaring you with very effective jump scares and disturbing images,which occur throughout the entire film a lot of the time when you least expect it.The Grudge does what most horrors do not do and that is bend the rules of the classic setting of the haunted house.In everyday American horror usually the main character is tormented by the inhabitants of the house,then they leave the house to be safe,and then find a way to stop it.The Grudge isthe opposite which is a very pleasant surprise,when you leave thishaunted house you are sure as hell not safe.The interesting thingis that generally those who die in horror films either deserve it or have something to do with the conflict but in The Grudge everyday people who even set one foot in the house are doomed to perish.I think that The Grudge is very original,very unique,and very effective at inflicting fear into it's audience.The storyline however is hard to follow at times and can be very confusing but without taking anything away from the movie.The Grudge is also full of typical horror film clichés but for the most part is very original and different.The acting is top notch as far as horror flicks go and the characters are all believable and easy to buy into.The Grudge is a must see horror film.</fullReview>

A lot of people have said to me that it was extremely difficult to understand. I found that out at first, but after watching it a few times, ( 5 or 6 times! ) I finally got the hang of it. I can't wait to see The grudge 2!!! I think that it will be a lot better than the first ( Looking at the trailer ).

The line about a curse from an enraged death is consistent with Japanese cultural sensibilities but the spirits following everybody around I believe is off the mark. I had hoped for a greater confrontation between the spirits and one of the main characters towards the end of the movie leading to the spirits (at least temporary) pacification. Nakagawa should have brought in a Buddhist monk or something.I also find an annoyance with foreigners in Tokyo movies. The gal poking a hole in the ramen at the store and sniffing it.

Definitely more creepy than scary, but anyway, I wanted to start a discussion to see what everyone thought about certain aspects of the story line that I am still pondering (**These questions will contain plot spoilers**) -Why did Toshio talk to Rachel? It was the only time in the whole movie he actually said something, so why did he decide to watch her from the stairs and answer her question about who he was? -Is Toshio protecting Rachel? For several characters, Toshio went right after them, but he didn't with Karen. Then at the end of the movie, Karen gets to see the whole flashback about what happened to the family, and I got the impression that Toshio was the one showing it to her, since he looks right at her during it. Then it's Toshio's mother that comes after Karen, not Toshio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I WILL NOT watch this movie again and I have no desire to see the upcoming Grudge 2. For the reason that The Grudge scared the hell out of me.However there are other reasons that I wont watch it again aside from being scared senseless. I also didn't like it, I think mainly because I couldn't understand it and even though the plot deals with a lot of back story there are no real answers to questions about what happened to get all of this started in the first place or why these evil murderous spirits came into being.Kayako(the female spirit) SHE WAS SCARY, there was nothing about her that wasn't scary from the way she looked and the way she moved to the sound she made....SHE WAS FREAKEN SCARY. I have the understanding that there was no computerized special effects that was used with her and that the actress the played her actually moved and acted that way, she is a talented actress.Toshio(the little boy spirit)If anything I either found him funny or annoying depending on what it was he was doing. First of all I was more than a little confused on what his part in the whole thing actually was and he really didn't seem to do much of anything except be creepy. The thing that I found funny about him is that he yowled like a cat and even as I was watching the movie I had visions of what might happen if someone were to dangle a string in front of him or let a wind up mouse loose.I also found the story itself confusing, one premise of the movie was that if you did whatever it was you did to incur these spirits wrath(not going to say what that was for those that haven't seen The Grudge) they were going to get you and there was no way out of that but then there were people in the movie that got out of it but it was never explained how or what they did to get out of it.Usually in movies(certainly in this genre)there are things that happen during the early scenes that have you asking "What is with that?" and usually somewhere in the course of the movie those questions are answered but The Grudge answers nothing and leaves you with more questions at the end of the film than you had when you started watching it.The Grudge is scary as hell thats for sure but other than that its not a very satisfying movie, its lack of answers, confusing storyline, characters and pace setting leaves more than a little to be desired.</fullReview>

The same person that directed the original Japanese version.Sarah Michelle Gellar stars as Karen, a young lady who is a exchange student studying social work in Japan. But one day when a lady named Yoko doesn't show up at work at the care-center, Karen becomes her replacement. And she has to take of a senile woman in a large scary house. But things ain't what she expected. What she didn't know is that the house is haunted by evil spirits. Now she has to deal with evil spirits that will do anything to kill her.This is very unique horror movie. Not in story but in editing, soundtrack and suspense. The movie features some very frightening scares, that will really shock you. Not in a bad way, but in a good way. The soundtrack is very good. It really helps the scares to kick of. The movie also features some cool editing. Sometimes the movie jump back and front in time. This can be distracting the first time for some. I recommend this movie for everyone that likes modern horror movies. It is really a entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start of, this will be my favorite horror-movie and will probably will stay that way forever. The "problem" with this movie however, is that you need to be able to live into the movie. Either you get scared senseless or you simply won't care at all and be bored. And that's the only two reactions I've seen. I've shown this movie to a load of my friends. The mental horror in these movies scared 75% more than they ever have been by a movie. The rest was bored. But for you who are able to live into the horror of the movie... It's a winner. It's a 10 out of 10. It is a tad slow too start with, but that works well to let you ease into the movie before the real horror begins. Just watch it. Don't hate me if you're bored, it just means you have no fantasy and ability to focus ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sound of the Ju-On attack never sounded creepier!! I saw the original US Grudge a couple of years ago and thought it was solid remake. But I recently returned for another viewing on the Unrated Director's Cut. If you haven't yet seen The Grudge, this is the version you want to see (or at least rent). What's different? SPOILER ALERT Extended scenes: were more graphic scenes: original family murder (poor black cat), jawless Yoko care centre return, and stairway descent.Deleted scenes: quite a few that add more dimension to the film, including a scene of possessed Matt hair-dragging dead Jennifer the same as Takeo/Kayako, Susan's apartment visit.Short Films: Shimizu's early work 4444444444 and In the Corner are decent but looked like audition tests for Ju-On (those ghosts get around).Overall, the original Japanese Ju-On is still the best probably because it was the first time I saw this story and those freaky ghost eyes, but I recommend the Unrated Director's for a viewing. Based on the new version, I upped the overall rating to an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best horror films I have seen. It was remade as an American version simply because, unfortunately, a mass number of people won't see a subtitled film. I've seen both versions and found this one to be scarier. And I guess you would like it more with familiar actors/actresses. Sarah Michelle Gellar performs well and her character Karen is likable. All the rest of the cast are very good. Clea DuVal has been in so many films yet no one seems to know who she is. Interested that three of the cast have been in Buffy, the two above and Jason Behr.

		<fullReview>Most people would disagree with my rating of 8/10 because they say that 'The Grudge' is not a very scary horror film, but even though the movie itself is not very terrifying up-front, but it has much more stored inside...The movie starts with sort of a strange opening that leaves you confused and shocked, but all the more pleased. After the opening to the movie the plot only gets better with the blinding suspense &amp; intertwined stories that keep you wandering until the every end where it all meets together.The acting for this film is not the greatest there could be, but i think Sarah Michelle pulls her role off quite well. Aside from the acting, the plot is very good because it never really just jumps out and says what's going on in the film, and that is why I like it, because it keeps you guessing and surprised but at the same time very entertained. I must admit the movie itself is not very horrifying the way it is presented but the very dark &amp; strange atmosphere is what does it for me, making the story seem far more terrifying than ever.Overall, this film is no "Oscar Contender" but it delivers what is expected of a Hollywood horror film, with an even darker setting which emphasized the scare effect, and is very good for what it is.Final Grade:: 8/10 \ B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw the American version first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this film was very good, very unnerving and I was genuinely freaked out, not by the boy even though his eyes were quite terrifying, but his mother was doing her best to terrify the living crap out of me. I actually preferred this film over the ring, the ring was interesting, I do like the Japanese version, but of the battle of the remakes I would say the grudge was the better film.I've read some reviews and people don't seem to be happy with the remake, so I'm thankful in a way that I didn't see Ju-on and that I got to watch this with out knowing what it was about.I surprisingly enjoyed the segments that the film followed, they all intermingled and explained what was going on in the house, and what happened to the poor victims, who have done nothing wrong except for having the ,isfortune of walking in the house. The opening scene was a classic and a pecurser for what the film is going to be like.I can't say that there were strong acting performances, but they were effective, Gellar did ell in her role, she led the line but didn't have that too many scares, I found the scene where the ghost follows the poor American sister of one of the victims to her flat unbearable, I didn't watch that scene probably, and could feel the hairs on the back of my neck raise.I thought this was a great horror move, I'd recommend this film to people who haven't seen the original, as I've gathered that this film maybe let's the original down, so that must be downright terrifying!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Holding a 'Grudge'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of a Japanese film of the same name by the same director of the previous year, THE GRUDGE focuses on an American nurse (Sarah Michelle Gellar) who visits a mysterious house with a curse brought on by its rather vicious past. In a way, this was like "The Ring", which happens to be another Japanese movie. However, this was a little weird in terms of presentation.Still effective, not to mention imaginative, but seemed to get a little silly at times. When the effective scenes did come, though, they were definitely chilling. The ending was a little disappointing, too. Then again, it's a horror movie and not a fairy tale.In other words, despite being weird, this film is worth a look. The stylish direction adds to the eeriness felt throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's afraid of "The Grudge"? That would be me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of 'scary' or 'horror' movies almost from conception, I can honestly say that there are very few movies that have knocked my socks off, but The Grudge is definitely one movie that has done just that. I recently saw "Hostel" and quite honestly, the appeal was the gore, blood and guts. Nothing is to be feared from a dead body. But in The Grudge, it is understood that everything is to be feared from spirits, particularly if they are angry spirits. The movie was genius simply because of one thing: You can't beat something in 2 1/2 hours and have a nice happy ending. Everybody dies, but that's okay. It truly shows that in Japanese culture, it is known and understood that there are things in the world, and in life, that are much bigger than you, and stronger, and more powerful, and sometimes, you just can't beat them. That's just it. That's why the Scream movies s**cked, why the Ring movies really weren't so frightening when you think about it, and why the Saw movies made everybody cringe, no matter how tough you thought you might have been. The story line is great, the lighting and music are perfect, and even in the end, IF YOU REALLY PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CHARACTERS.....you'll be asking questions when it is over....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another movie that's received a bad reputation, and hell if I know why. This remake was quite good, far as I'm concerned.Sarah Michelle Gellar is an American nurse in Tokyo, blah blah, substitutes for someone who goes missing, blah blah...I'm sure you all know what this movie is about by now What you probably don't know, however, is that unlike what most of the critics will say, this movie is filled with suspense. The noises and sound effects are played up extremely well, fitting in and filling the atmosphere of the movie with fear and horror while at the same time being ambient enough to draw little attention away from the screen. While Sarah makes a better Buffy than she does a victim, she still plays her role well, though if it were me I probably would have reacted a little more...extreme...if there were some weird bloody ghost thing in my grill. But whatever.I don't know a lot about the Grudge series (though I intend to rectify that) but I got a vague idea and, having some familiarity with Japanese culture, understand the lore and superstition this movie was developed around. For those complaining none of it makes sense, make a half-assed attempt to research the background for the movie and within a few minutes you'd understand what is going on. Needless to say, the Japanese are a very spiritual and superstitious people, especially the older generation, and that was likely who this movie would most appeal to despite it's American remake.In any case, my toes were literally curling, waiting for something to happen or materialize, and what makes me happy is that it always did. I hate horror movies that build suspense only to end it with something dumb like...oh, it was just a cat O.o silly me...and go on to something else. God that annoys me. The gore factor is fairly low, with the exception of one particular part that was just plain disturbing (the tongue scene, as it is known as) but that wasn't the purpose of the film. The point was to scare its audience, and I was scared, so the job was done.The reason for the title of this critique, however, is the ending. It was horrible. Right up there with some of the worst endings of all time. If there was a better ending and a little more information about the ghost kid, this would have gotten a 9 from me easily. Oh well, still a good movie. If I paid for a theater ticket, I wouldn't be upset.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why all the negative comments?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Takashi Shimizu has done an excellent job remaking this film for American audiences. While some will argue that this is nothing more than just corporate Hollywood turning the cranks on audiences' wallets, I thought there was quite a bit of originality to this film. The institution of us seeing the demon or spirits before the characters do was something that I wasn't familiar with in other horror films. Normally, there is this big "jumping out of the darkness" scene that frightens everyone because they were not expecting it, but in The Grudge there was this element of "here I am" that frightened me more than most films do.Takashi Shimizu, the mastermind behind this film, also created the original Ju-on series that became extremely popular in Japan. This allowed his vision and purpose (with a larger budget) to continue. I enjoyed the fact that the original director was on board and that our American crew was in Japan. This took me away from the idea that this film was going to be nothing more than just a pro-America horror film. It took me to this unfamiliar place (building the fear) and showcased the talents of some unfamiliar/familiar American film actors working next to a complete Japanese crew. I thought that this kept the entire film grounded. It wasn't set in New York, there wasn't the scene of raw nudity at the beginning ... there wasn't the normal American structure to this film because we were not in America ... we were in Japan. This really helped me build the excitement and utter terror that I felt while watching this film. I was impressed.The acting, well, you don't go to a horror film expecting to see Oscar caliber acting. Gellar and Pullman knew that the horror genre is slowing coming into the limelight as a prominent figure in cinema (it was lacking for a couple of years there) and I think that is why they chose to do this project. Pullman wasn't anything to write home about, thought I was impressed to see him in this film. Gellar was the exact same. She did her part, collected her money, and went home. This wasn't what frightened me about this film. I didn't rent this movie to be blown away by the acting. I expected average acting and that is what I got. What I did go into this film expecting was to shake, shiver, and be frightened to turn off the lights after the film. That is exactly what I found. Takashi Shimizu did an excellent job of building that right amount of suspense, using amazing lighting, perfect sound, and some very freaky visuals. His knowledge and ability to bring us something new was extremely impressive and honest. Here is a director who was handed the money to make the film that he wanted, and while not everything was probably to his liking, it did open the door for more fans to enjoy his work. It also opened the door to more projects from his mind to be released. This could be the new face of cinematic horror, and I cannot wait to see what he has in store for us.Overall, I loved this movie. It was the exact level of fright that I was looking for. There were scenes that I never saw coming, there were elements that were unexpected and vividly raw, and it thankfully did not follow the ever-classic Hollywood horror formula. There was originality and emotion in this film that most horror directors do not give when dabbing in the horror genre. This was a great story, and I cannot wait to gather friends for a late night horror scream-fest featuring this film. From the opening scene, to the bus scene, to the opportunistic final moment, I had my finger on the fast-forward and I was scared. This did what it set out to do for me, and for that I can only praise this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are not many good horror films. But Grudge is one hell of a film without doubt. The whole atmosphere is creepy to the limit. Great Camera and the Sound is scaring you right to the bone - Uhhh that sound. And "Buffy" is pretty cute and helpless in that (hmmmmmm). I will put the film in my top ten with fog, alien, nightmare 3, dellamorte dellamore, ghostship and that stuff.Never seen the original film, but i don't think it can be as good as this one. And forget the ring - Grudge is much better.The story is straight and thats OK only one thing: Here's a curse and he will sneak up from behind and club your ass straight to hell. If thats the curse i hope i ll never met him :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're never involved.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**I know it would probably be nicer if I reviewed this movie after having seeing the original Japanese motion picture. But since the director is the same, the story is practically the same, overall, it's just an adaption, I watched The Grudge, yesterday night. Unfortunately, I wasn't pleased at all...The story is about a girl who goes to Japan for a living, working for some medical institution which gives support to helpless people, such as sick people. The girl is Sarah Michelle Gellar. After one of the other girls goes missing from work, Sarah is requested to take the girl's place by working at the house of a creepy family, who all have the bad luck of having bought the house. Well, it just happens that it's a cursed place.This is based on those Japanese legends where they say that when a person dies with rage or anger as the last feelings of life, the place becomes cursed itself. The main problem, I guess, with this movie, is that it takes a powerful legend such as this one, but doesn't show us almost anything interesting throughout the picture. We're never really involved and when something's about to happen, the scene cuts itself. Over and over and over again. All we have left to do is wonder, but never be frightened.There are many other flaws in The Grudge. The script is not so bad, I sincerely didn't think that way. The way the story is told, sometimes, in the present, flash-backing, and then moving forward again was quite interesting. However, The Grudge feels more like an experimental movie concerning situations where the characters seem completely lost and their actions don't have the impact of attitudes from characters of much better horror movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really, this film seemed to me a typical film for teenagers. I thought that it was going to be a waste of time. But it is not. It is a brilliant film! Of course, it is a little strange, but totally it is entertained, no boredom at all and it's perfect to spend a short while. There are the necessary scares, some unnecessary, but also unexpected ones. That Asian touch gives the somewhat special film, something really spectacular that occurs to the terror films. At the outset, is a bit rare, because also there are things that do not fit, but while the film is passing, it is understood everything. The film is enjoyed more and more time and time again while it is seen. And it has a mystery of which it give account immediately you, a mystery that makes shine to the film. I'm sure this film will like to a lot of young people, if they animate themselves to see it. I hope that you will like this film,if you like also Asian horror films.I believe that you will not lament it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little too mysterious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Grudge" is an OK horror movie. It has a thoroughly unpleasant atmosphere and lots of well directed shocks. Unfortunately, the mysterious paranormal going-ons get more and more mysterious as the movie progresses, eventually canceling the viewer's expectation of an answer to any of the questions raised (much as, without comparison, in David Lynch's "Lost Highway"). Consequently, one's interest is bound to drop. However, if you do not demand a terribly consistent plot line, if you thrive on the nightmarish and unexplained, if you like camp fire story-like scariness (as in e.g. "The Blair Witch Project")... Well, then this is probably a film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SMG doesn't seem to have much luck with movies - apart from Cruel Intentions I can't recall a single memorable performance, and sadly she continues the tradition here. OK, it's a thousand times better than the abysmal Scooby films, and in places almost on a par with her portrayal of Buffy. She has real talent and I don't entirely blame her for this lack of success - it must be down to her choice of projects. Why on earth she signed up for a sequel to this is baffling - she doesn't need the money. Maybe she needs to hire new people, and get some decent advice.Perhaps the story and direction lost something in translation, and perhaps the Japanese have different expectations. The Grudge displays a definite class in some areas, but is let down by a disjointed and confusing construction. There are 3 or 4 genuinely scary moments - but they are just moments, and the overall effect is further diluted by some really dreadful, laughable attempts at horror. In places beautifully framed and lit, it is just not dark enough to be create a scary atmosphere. The effects are appalling, and the whole 'hair &amp; eye' thing is really, sickeningly naff.At times I wondered if the cast actually knew where the scares were meant to be coming from, and when there were some real frights the reactions were confusingly mild. This movie starts well but after about 2 minutes you've seen the best - from there it's all downhill. There are glimpses of something much better close to the surface, and with a bit of tinkering this could be good. But as it stands it is unacceptably poor, and I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it ever again. Sarah I do love you but, come on - get your act together!</fullReview>

Especially when the young helper Yoko has no jaw.Very thought out and well explained and a ending perfect for the setup for a sequel which all of The Grudge fans knows that it is coming soon. And I am very much looking forward to seeing the sequel.At first I was most definitely scared out of my wits especially when Yoko first goes into the attic, i nearly fell out of my seat so did my friend and he's seen it so many times. Thats how scary this movie is! I was even more scared since all of my friends say it is so scary that they had to sleep with 3 lights on in fear of the Grudge coming and sucking them into one's bed.But not me it scared me of course but it did not scare that much so I had trouble sleeping, I slept perfectly fine that night, plus me and my friend like to make fun of movies so thats what helped me get over the fact that it was horribly scary.I laughed at the very beginning when Peter falls and kills himself. To some people that is not funny but my sense of humor is very different then a lot of people.The graphics in this movie are very well done, especially when Yoko had no jaw I thought that looked very real and scary.I also wonder how much make-up they would have to put on the Grudge to make her look that scary, and the noises she makes really creeps me out. Also when the detectives find Yoko's jaw in in the attic, I thought the jaw looked very scary and real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regular ghost revenge flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot behind "The Grudge" is chilling but it takes too long before it gets interesting. The situations are slow moving but that's not necessary bad because it helps to grow interest on the main characters. Sadly, as most of the important events are told in flashbacks you keep forgetting about the lead female. Still, it's not a bad idea. This could be considered as a ghost revenge flick. Here, the supernatural elements are consequences of a tragedy occurred in real life. To be honest, this is the typical Horror movie that relies most of it's suspense moments on CGI. The movie is filled with false scares and CGI effects of ghosts. Don't expect tension or suspense. Think about "The Ring" but with a little more blood and you have basically the same movie. Even the ending (which is beyond ridiculous; almost as bad as in the "Amytiville Horror" remake) was inspired by those kind of movies. The direction and visuals are pretty good actually. The locations were perfectly selected for this kind of movie. The f/x were really good when required. The problem with CGI is that most movies like this one tend to abuse of it. Also, I didn't know Sarah Michelle Gellar was such a bad actress. She delivers a wooden, emotionless performance. The rest of the cast just does what they can. It's not that bad at all...Do yourself a favor and don't watch this over rated ghost movie. For a better movie of the likes of this movie, watch "The Others", or "Supernatural". "The Grudge" is dedicated for a younger audience but still it's a very mediocre effort. Even for a remake...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge/2004/**Main Star: Sarah Michelle GellarIf you think it's scary, it's NOT! Well, at least I don't think so. There were a few jumping scenes, but not many. Obviously, I think the main star (Sarah Michelle Gellar) can direct a better movie than the director, Takashi Shimizu, which did an original one of this movie in Japanese (you can tell by his name). But then he thought Americans wanted to see this, too. So he did the movie over with American stars in it and in English. In my opinion, it was average. It had a cruel story to it and it did not have a happy ending. The movie takes place in a haunted house with a dead kid with a big mouth and a cat scream and a dead lady that sounds like she's burping all the time and a dead man that you don't see. Stupid movie and didn't really have a main point. It was just about haunted house with dead people cursing everyone who crossed the doorstep. It may have good actors in it but it has a mediocre plot. Also it kept going back and forth, I mean you never know when it's a flashback or what? There are just too many movies like this. Movie directed by Takashi Shimizu.</fullReview>

The only draw backs were that it was pretty predictable and that the performances weren't particularly memorable. Gellar's role was down right forgettable. How ever this is one of those rare instances where the story and effects more than compensated any other lack luster qualities of the film.

		<fullReview>This remake is a prime example of what happens when an intriguing story is compromised to accommodate the ego of a 'star' actor and a producer who figures that an American audience is unable to relate to anything that isn't connected to life as it is lived in the USA. I used to admire Sam Raimi and believe that he was gutsy enough to trust the public's intelligence - how times have changed! First of all the original plot lines are shifted to give more focus on the star and even scenes that rely upon a steady and sustained growth of anxiety are paced at a faster rate when compared to the original Ju-on movies. This harms the ambiance, but was presumably deemed necessary to make sure that the camera returned to Gellar all the quicker and to cut down the running time of the picture as a whole.The setting of the story - Japan - could be entirely dispensed with as far as the use made of it in the film goes. We are given western (that is to say American) characters whenever possible. Tokyo apparently even needs an American to run its social services department; Gellar is such an asset to him that she is accepted and pressed rapidly into service despite being without skills and unable to speak more than a few phrases of Japanese.The camera often stays xenophobically chained to the American actors. A Japanese security guard who is killed in the original movie (in a way that eerily advances the plot) just walks down a corridor and is never seen again in the remake. Some of the most memorable characters and sequences in 'Ju-on' were scrapped simply because they weren't good for Gellar or the other Americans. In a nutshell, a tale that worked well when told via an ensemble cast became threadbare and vapid when transformed into a star vehicle. Sarah Michelle Gellar simply did not have the talent, personality or gravitas to carry the story.Like George Raft (who was legendary for demanding script changes whenever he was afraid that his image might suffer), Gellar evidently wished her do-gooding volunteer character to be spotlessly presented. She has to have a boyfriend (to prevent suggestions that her character is abnormal, unattractive or a lesbian?). When she finds the ghostly boy apparently trapped in a cupboard, she reports his presence and makes sure to give the impression that she was caring enough to ask him to come downstairs with her...a statement that makes no sense given the boy's paranormal nature and her terrified reaction to his appearance.The star obviously didn't want an actor of any great depth or skill cast as her love interest. Jason Behr who plays that role is entirely superfluous to the plot; in fact, when his character was supposed to be asleep or unconscious, it was hard to notice any difference.The rewrites of Stephen Susco (aided and abetted by Sam Raimi's ad hoc changes during filming) tried to water down the disorienting shifts in time and continuity that are such an important feature of the Ju-on films. When it became plain that they had written themselves into a corner, spoon-fed explanations were inserted and characters began to make judgements that were worthy of a psychic hotline.Informed that one of the female players has disappeared, the detective in charge of the investigation immediately (without hesitation and to the exclusion of every other option) orders the collection of the security video tapes at her place of work - thus conveniently removing an obstacle erected by shoddy writing. Some scenes were shifted by as much as 57 minutes from the places they first occupied in Susco's treatment - this suggests cobbling a tangled mess together rather than inspired editing.Viewing the DVD with the cast and crew commentary switched on is a cringe-worthy experience. Time and time again, the actors and producer find much amusement in mocking Japanese customs and even the Shinto faith is described in sneering terms. There are also comments which show the extent to which the Director was pushed into artistic and technical changes by both Raimi and Gellar.I recommend that you avoid this lifeless clone and get the original Japanese movies - but opt for subtitles. The English dubbing, when available, is famously disconcerting - the accents (provided by an uninspired cast of British voice actors) are awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a terrible, juvenile piece of work. It is not scary as it relies on one, and only one 'scare trick'. The whole thing falls flat when you compare it to two kids playing scary face games. Someone with a scary face jumps out of the dark at you. Someone with a scary face creeps up behind you etc. That's it. Then you have to deal with a plot free yawnfest and one-dimensional performances. By the end you don't give a toss about any of them and just wish for them all to die quickly. Sarah Michelle Gellar is normally watchable and William Mapother was genuinely creepy in Lost. Here their talents are wasted and if it hadn't been for the success of The Ring this garbage would never have been green-lit. There are loads of excellent Japanese films; the ones we see are usually the best ones as they have normally proved their worth at international festivals or by strong word-of-mouth. This made-in-Hollywood Japanese movie-by-numbers is a pathetic waste of time and money for all concerned, especially the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My younger sister was so excited about this movie, she watched it about 5 times. And forced me to watch it with her on a boring Sunday afternoon.The truth be told the pictures where not that scary but the sound! I suffer of tinnitus and the beeping all the time was not the healthiest thing.And those sounds deep from the throat! I was so scared that I stayed awake for about 48 hours, even my bed was not a shelter anymore for me. You know what happened to the girl hiding under her sheets.It took about a month until I was able again to find some proper sleep. And now we know...there are things much worse than death...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holy....fuji (no pun intended). Advice: don't leave creaky doors in the house untreated after this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Oh...my...effing....god...." That was all I could say after the movie began and the first little chills started the goosebumps going. I've seen this movie four times, and to tell you the truth, it just gets better and better. I'm still paranoid. I am waiting for one of the ghosts to pop up in a really stupid, random place (shower, wardrobe, behind door, in locker, etc.). Paranoia factor: 10. --WARNING!!: Following contains plot spoilers--The film opens with a quickly-quick-quick explanation of the term 'Grudge' (in the movie's sense). What would have made it creepier is it as a dictionary entry. Strike half a point. Next, we see Yoko, a caretaker for Emma, an elderly American woman who appears to be catatonic (did I spell that right?). Well, lah de dah. The house is trashed. By 'trashed' I mean 'rubbish everywhere, newspaper up the stairs' you get the idea. It looks like a bomb hit it. Well, Yoko, being a caretaker, understandably starts the cleanup, whilst chatting away in Japanese to a friend on the phone. Whilst diligently picking up paper, she hears a sort of walking noise above her. What's the room above her? The attic of course! (cliche #1) Well, her being a girl, she heads off to investigate. Finds a room, with a crawlspace all boarded up. Here's the stupidity factor: She climbs up the crawlspace, lights a cigarette lighter and promptly begins exploring. Who does she run into? None other than Kayako, the Grudge-girl (as I have happily dubbed her)!Well, I'll be very sketchy now, I felt like describing the opening scenes well. Now, there were many jumps in here, and many points where I yelled out "YOU IDIOT!" at the television screen. For example, when one character gets into bed and pulls the covers up, it's pretty obvious that it'll attack her in bed (hence the term, 'mattress monster'). Although, the security camera scenes were especially scary, owing to the fact that we now know how Kayako moves around and appears (see Ju-On: The Grudge 2 for a clever example). At another point, where Karen jumps in an elevator, you think 'Now you watch, it'll get her in the elevator coz she's a stupid blonde and didn't think!' WRONG!! Karen actually manages to survive through the movie...presumably past the end. Well, to cut it shorter, there were some scenes which were apparently cut from the American release, particularly a scene that was later reused in Ju-On 2, the scene involving the (presumed) husband of the late Kayako, hanging from Kayako's hair being swung by little Toshio (who you will creepily notice seems to pop up before each Kayako appearance). Also, the scene of Toshio being drowned in the bathtub was meant to be cut, but never was. The creepiest scenes of all would have to be the diary scene and the scene unenthusiastically titled 'Kayako Crawls Down The Stairs', which I would have called 'Goodbye Karen'. But that's me. That scene was especially creepy in the way that Kayako moved. Reminiscent of Samara climbing the well in The Ring (or so people tell me), her movements are jerky and insect-like. Rigor mortis, perhaps?The only major error was in the 'Jawless Kayako' scene. Didn't the director ever do Biology in year 8? Or look at the bottom of his tongue in a mirror? If he had, he would know that the tongue is attached to the jaw. I rest my case.All I will say to cut this review a little shorter, is this: Never watch without lights and a teddy bear. --Aurabesh out--</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen both Ju-On 1 and 2 many times; such amazing movies. When the American remake happened, I was skeptical; Gellar? Clea Duvall? Americans in Japan? Well, take comfort, Shimizu fans; this remake is actually decent and worth watching. It is different than the original in many ways, but take heart that it is tastefully re-done. You will see familiar faces, such as the original Saeki family. The house is different, but only slightly so. More care is taken to explain Japanese culture for those new to it. But the scares are just as scary, the make up and effects just as good!I don't want to spoil anything, so if you are an Asian Horror movie snob like me, don't snub this film.</fullReview>

I gave this movie 5 out 10 mainly because there were a lot of scenes that were simply lame and did not help develop the story at all!!!!!!!!Also, the last scene of the movie was a little weird. Was there a nurse standing right next to Karen (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar.)NOTE: The original Japanese version was not as bloody but definitely much scarier!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death stares Sarah Michelle Gellar in the eyes..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Grudge" is another movie where people watch a videotape and, because of an unforgiving spirit, all die pretty much identical deaths in the film. This time it's a haunted house in Japan. The film begins with a home nurse riding her bike, taking a brake from a sick woman named Emma she's being paid to care of. When she goes back into Emma's home, she's startled by loud noises in the attic, noises that are too large and deliberate to be an animal. She checks it out anyways.Expecting to find a serial killer or burglar hiding in the attic, she finds something much worse. After her boss can't get a hold of her the next day, he talks an exchange student named Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) into substituting for the "missing" nurse. Gellar has a bad feeling about this, but agrees to go.As we first see the outside of the house, there's lots shots of Karen reacting nervously to it as she walks up to the door. But it's not a scary house. Besides the black clouds hovering over it, it looks like a nice place.After Karen goes inside to find Emma on the floor, kicking incoherently, she puts her back to bed and starts cleaning up the dump. Emma isn't responsive to Karen and just stares at her. Even after staring, she stares some more.The attic starts making noises again. Karen goes to check it out. She finds a creepy little boy and his cat in a closet locked with maybe 50 yards of tape.. left or (placed)inside the closet is a mysterious journal that, later on in the film, just might help Karen figure what's going on and what it all means. The boy, like Emma, doesn't really talk, but acts creepy and stares. He stares just like Emma. Karen is no match for their staring.So we go into long flashbacks, where Emma and her family first visit the house to consider buying it. Emma checks out the attic first, while the family talks with the realtor. Emma's daughter comes up and finds her gazing non-responsively at the wall at something we can't see. After the rest of the family tries to snap her out of it, and fails, her son goes down to tell the realtor "we'll take it." Like I said, it's a nice place.A few days later Emma's daughter finds a cat on the staircase, that isn't hers'. Wouldn't that be weird if you found a cat in your house that wasn't yours'? Then a pair of ghostly arms grab that cat and runs into the attic. Emma's daughter, scared, goes to into the attic to check it out. The door shuts behind her.There's a scene where Karen (Gellar) goes to check on Emma and the ghost, for the first time, manifests itself to Karen, hovering above her with what looks like 50 yards of hair floating around the room. Karen is so traumatized by what she's seen she's taken to the hospital where she's later asked by her boyfriend, "What happened?"... Karen sort of looks at the ground and shakes her head, "It's that house. There's just something in there." So I guess now that Karen has figured out there's something strange in the house, she looks up old newspaper articles and discovers something sinister about the houses' history. 3 years ago, there were 3 deaths including a cat. But another man also killed himself the very next morning. A man that lives close by. This man looks familiar, he's in the journal that was placed in the closet. This eventually leads Karen to other places and things that explain why the house is haunted and why people are dying.Is this movie scary? If it is, it's in the scenes that use long silences that build tension, and loud, scary noises that make us jump by abruptly breaking those long silences. It's effective, but it feels like an exercise. I didn't care about what was going to happen, but rather when it was going to happen.One of the reasons Chinese water torture is so effective has to do with gaps of time prisoners endure while suffering the excruciating feeling of wondering when the next drop will come. I don't say this to draw a literal comparison between Chinese water torture and the quality of the Grudge. But here are, after all, a lot of Japanese people in this film that look Chinese... and are often drowned.-nyquil_addict</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of Adaptation for the Non-Japanese to Grasp the Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At a measly 92 minutes, the story lacks, and very little gore and quick cuts to cover it up. Unlike some of the other Japanese to American horror films, the movie stays in the Japan, and the reasoning for the curse relies on knowledge of Japanese culture or catching the one line in a small and somber conversation that when someone is killed in a rage, they will become a curse upon the living. In this case the wife killed by her enraged, jealous husband, and her son drowned by the husband in the same fit of rage, become a curse upon the house they lived in for anyone else that enters that house to never escape. The main character enters the house, sees the boy and the woman, and she finds the diary. You could say she investigates, but the investigation is just one web page, and then her having a small conversation with he police officer that says the previously mentioned Japanese belief. The movie needed to be longer. There needed to be more people cycling through the house, the first that just go unexplained and no one cares and slowly escalate to cases that really get the law enforcement to think about it. I realize that the original family that is now the curse upon the house were the same from the Japanese flick and there needed to be more time spent on the woman's affair. There needed to be a depiction of the wrong done to her and her son. So that for a time in the movie the audience would feel compassion for the woman and son and try to prod the main character on to helping the curse move on, to be free from being a curse. Since this is not a romance picture, there would be that turning point where the main character realizes that the curse cannot be lifted, and then the main character comes up attempts to end it. Which the policeman does, when he goes to burn the house down, and then the attempt has flops in it, and eventually you sense resolution, or not. Cut to a scene feeling all is resolved, and then the quick flick of the horror will never be gone. The last bit of the "should've been" was there, but the beginning part of the "should've been" is very lacking in the film. The lack of story leaves those untaught in Japanese culture not as terrified because of different belief systems. In "The Ring" you felt compassion for Samara, and she tries to save Samara, and then realizes, there is no saving Samara, so just save yourself. "The Ring" took the story out of Japan, and changed the content of the tape. "The Grudge" did not have to leave Japan, but it could have made us feel some more compassion for the woman and son. When the main character takes her "boyfriend" to see the Buddhist ritual, I actually thought she would try some Buddhist ritual to save the woman and son from being a curse. Sam Raimi, I enjoyed every other film of your's I have seen, and I hope that when you do "The Grudge 2" you create much more story, stretch it two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It looks better than it feels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie looks good and is artistically creative. But, unless you're into that kind of thing or need a project for art school, it's style probably won't be enough to keep to interested in it.As far as the plot, it's like most remade Asian movies out there: lost in translation. I think producers believe they have to dumb down movies for American audiences. It certainly seems over the past years that they try to fit everything into a PG-13 so they can get more people stuffed into the theatres. I believe this movie would have definitely found an audience if they would have put it up a notch to an R level and given the movie more backbone. The average 13 year old will get a few scares, but what about the rest of us that want to enjoy the other 84 minutes of the movie? The movie certainly feels like a super-extended version of a preview. By the time it gets down to business, it's not that interesting anymore. You find yourself looking for the remote to fast-forward for the good part that just seems to never come.It may not be as bad as other thriller movies out there, but unless you really, really enjoy the genre, you might want to skip this one.If you're reading this review wondering if you should watch it, I suggest Darkness instead (aka The Dark) with Anna Paquin. Both movies are about the same, but at least Darkness has engaging actors to fill the empty space in the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Linda Blair Meet Your Match</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been about a million years since I've seen The Exorcist but I still can't get that freaky, demonic possessed face of Linda Blair out of my head and to this day it will sometimes visit me in a nightmare. When "The Ring" came along, I though it was great, atmospherically scary and one to remember. I thought "Samara, you are a scary little specter, but I would still rather encounter 10 of you than one Linda Blair".Then, two nights ago, I watched "The Grudge" expecting to be mildly entertained and borderline scared. WRONG! It really is a horror movie and guess what - it comes through on many levels. I can honestly say that Linda Blair has met her match with some of the most horrible visages, I have ever seen in a film. I guess Linda Blair will now have company in my nightmares. Only hope "Tubular Bells" isn't playing in the background because then I will surely have a heart attack.If you really, really like to be scared this is one terrific fright fest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OMG a genuinely scary horror movie at last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes I am male, no I am not a scaredy cat, but could this movie just be a wee bit more scary please? no I don't think it could actually.I sat in bed thinking hoe de hum lets just put this DVD in and get it over and done with, I wasn't expecting much. I used to be a fan of horrors especially 80's horrors the birth of the modern horror film. Though lately it seems that American movie makers have lost the ability to create genuine horrors that scare. This must be why they had to borrow from the original Japanese version of this film and also use the same director/producer also????Even so I have to give Sam Ramai (yet another spelling error) the two thumbs up for improving on the Japanese version and making it even creepier. I don't normally like praising a movie up too much, there's nothing worse than someone saying gee that was a wicked film then you go hire it and think OK that was crap and IMDb reviewers suck. So instead I will just say watch it alone, in bed, at night with the lights out, on a DVD player with a surround sound TV or home theater system. And make sure you have your duvet cover pulled up.If the ultra pale, dead little Japanese kid with the psychotic cat doesn't put the willies up you, then the Japanese woman with the world record for double jointedness surely will.This is the movie that will be known for years to come, as the film that put and end to sales of Duvet covers. I will never think of bed linen the same way ever again!Genuinely scary little number only out done by the Japanese sequel The Grudge 2 (ju-on 2)probably spelt that wrong but you get the idea.I recommend that you watch the U.S version of "The Grudge" first then view the Japanese movie "The Grudge 2".Guaranteed to give you nightmares and put you in therapy for the next ten years. If you like these movies try getting hold of the string of Asian horrors coming out such as Phone, and Dark Water and The EyeI give this movie a 9 for the fact that it not only put the sh^%%%its up me and made me scared of pale Japanese kids for life. But it also didn't rely on CGI too heavily. Many of the scenes I thought were done with CGI weren't. And however that woman learned to move and twist her body like that I will never know, if you think Michael Jacksons moon walk was cool you have'nt seen nothing yet! you have to see this to believe it.I can't wait to see if Sam Ramai can improve on The Grudge 2 Japanese version, I think he find it a tall order to follow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent thrill ride with great visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film to be very, very, very good. It had all the right ingredients i have come to expect from the director. It was unbelievably good.This film was truly scary and when being watched at 4am in Halls of Residence (noisy and clunky) the mood was just right. As for what the film provided it was magnificent. It showed just enough to scare the living bits out of you whilst still not giving any of the ending away.Unfortunately this is where it went wrong. I gave the film 9 because, despite being in my top 3 scariest films ever, the ending lacked the final push that has been the trademark of the director in films like The Ring. The ending was a disappointment but the fear by this point was so great that it was still truly magnificent.With such a great set of visuals and an amazing plot, this film takes you through the scariest ride of your live and leaves you checking your underwear for treadmarks. This film has it all and is one for keeps in my collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked The Grudge about as much as the original, which is to say, I didn't really care for it. Both of them shared the same nonsensical, jumbled plot and lengths of boredom (I had to fight back the yawns!). The jump scares (and ghosts) did work a tiny bit better in the remake but in the end, still didn't do anything for me. The original might have the edge in sound effects though, which in my opinion was the best quality of these two films. The story and settings were quite similar between the two, though I believe the ending was slightly different in Ju-on. Also, I don't recall the jawless ghost (good scene) being in Ju-on. Anyway, I must say I really prefer Ringu and The Ring to Ju-on and The Grudge, though I didn't find those movies all that good either. I'll take The Eye over all of 'em.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those lost opportunities to make a great horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The three main problems with this movie: its presentation is too scattershot, it defies its own logic, and the characters are only marginally interesting.There are some really nice ghost moments. I watched this movie alone, and thus it freaked me out a little (and I eat horror for breakfast). Very nice sound, makeup, clothing, acting, etc. on the part of the dead. This was very well done, except perhaps for the sound the ghost made, which sounded like an everlasting belch. Seriously. It's like she couldn't end the burp and that's what killed her. Maybe if somebody slapped her on the back like she wanted then everything would be fine, I don't know.Surprisingly, Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't as convincing as normal. You just get the sense that she knew the material was weak and couldn't do anything much with it. Ted Raimi is marvelously adorable apparently without even trying. Bill Pullman ironically still has a friendly charm whilst looking as hollow and creepy as I've ever seen him. The girl who plays Yoko is both good and sympathetic. Pretty much all female actresses do a good job of seeming scared or scary. The little boy is quite perfect for his role. It's not the cast or the director that's the problem.Think of it this way: The Ring ended ten minutes after you expected it to, and that was a GOOD thing. The Grudge ends about five minutes after you expect it to, and this is a VERY BAD thing. Because five minutes ago, you had closure, some vague semblance of sense, slightly suspended disbelief, and a decent scene. Then it gets ruined. I really wish I'd stopped watching after that final object is thrown into a pool of liquid.The "this is Japanese kabuki and it just operates differently" defense doesn't work--BECAUSE THIS IS A REMAKE. It would have been so easy to keep the feel of the Japanese ghosts and still make SOME kind of sense within its own universe. That's all I ask, is that a movie make sense within its own universe. For example, I can kinda extrapolate the reason for catboy ghost existing, I can believe that a supernatural house can make someone see its past, but I can not see the reason for the last five minutes of the movie to even exist. It went from creepy-and-insensible-but-strangely-cleansing to utterly stupid.Bottom line, this movie is a lot of polish over a hollow shell. The reason it makes me so annoyed is that if it had presented a decent script and been less scattershot (not even necessarily chronological) so that we could at least sorta follow what the hell was going on, it could have been good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished watching "The Grudge" and unfortunately I didn't find it to be particularly engaging. Perhaps it was the slow pace, or the lack of coherent plot. Unfortunately horror films usually do lose me when people starting pursuing the ghost (or spirit) into dark places alone -- I guess I'm too logical.It was beautifully filmed and the music was a nice addition, but I found myself audibly sighing repeatedly during the movie (luckily I was in my living room). Probably because it seemed like the same scene over and over again.Obviously there are people with a much bigger appreciation for this type of film than I do. If you are somebody who thought the Ring was fabulous then you'll probably like this. If not, you might find this film a little tedious and repetitive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gruesome and Scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basis behind The Grudge is that there's a Japanese myth that when a person dies (typically murder or some type of passionate context), a curse exists in that space that continues to haunt anyone who gets involved. This curse follows the individual until they die.The Grudge is supposedly made shot for shot with the Japense version. To jump to my summary, the film does a terrific job in building suspense and making you feel incredibly uneasy. The sound effects are great! While the plot doesn't make entirely too much sense, it's believable, for the moment.Karen (a very convincing Sarah Michelle Gellar, I'm no Buffy fan) is a transplant to Japan. She lives there with her boyfriend. Karen attends a local university and does community work for experience. Her work is helping housebound elders. Karen helps an elderly woman who is frightened by a mysterious force (the curse). The backstory unfolds, about the house, that involves a Professor (Bill Pullman) who is indirectly involved in a death. The movie does a lot of flashbacks but is effective.Not as good as The Ring but worth a DVD rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge is a great movie with a lot of great moments and a great storyline which is kind of like a mystery. Sarah Michelle Gellar does a great job acting. It does have a lot of scary moments in it and there are two versions of the DVD. A version that was in theaters and an Unrated Extended Director's Cut. Both versions are really good, but if you are into Interviews, then the theater version would be good to buy. The Unrated Extended Director's Cut has a lot of Deleted scenes if you are into that! Please go see it. It is great!!! There is also a great soundtrack (only music) That soundtrack was the only one I have ever listened to so many times! It is a remake so go see the original Ju-On The Grudge. I can't wait for The Grudge 2 (the sequel since The Grudge made so much money)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nearly all the reviews I have read on "The Grudge" have hated it. That combined with the fact that this is one of those dreaded "PG-13 Horror Movies" led me to come into watching this film as a huge skeptic. So I really have to give credit to the filmmakers when I admit that I loved this movie. Is it the greatest horror movie of all time? Of course not. But you know what? It's the scariest darn PG-13 movie I've ever seen. Period.I won't bother with the long plot description. Everyone else does that but you are not here for spoilers; you're here for opinions. My opinion of this film could not be much higher. For me, the standard for PG-13 movies has always been "The Ring". For a movie that showed very little blood and gore, "The Ring" was horrifying. I mostly enjoyed how the entire movie led to a terrifying climax that gets me every time.I was not at all expecting "The Grudge" to surpass "The Ring", but in setting my expectations so low, the movie blew by them and, in the process, even overtook "The Ring". So how is "The Grudge" better? The one thing that struck me was the legitimate almost non-stop scares. This movie rarely ever lets up, as there is a constant sense of dread that hangs over the entire movie like a dark rain cloud. There are no laughs in this movie, very few pauses for our hero to do some research (though, there is indeed a dreaded "research scene", but it is brief), and no "fake scares". Yes, there is an "Only A Cat" moment, but the cat does have an important part in the movie so I don't really count it as a fake scare. But if you want to, fine. One fake scare.Aside from those few minor flaws, "The Grudge" is an unflinching ride. This movie is almost a direct remake of the original Japanese movie "Ju-on". It features the same director, crew and even some of the original actors. The result is a movie that is not your typical American horror film. Even "The Ring" is based on the Japanese "Ringu" and it falls into some of the American horror movie pitfalls, but "The Grudge" does not. It is not afraid to kill off anybody, and I mean ANYBODY. It does not hide itself behind a wall of CGI. And did I mention that is has no problem with killing off the entire cast if it has to? Yep, for a PG-13 Horror Movie, "The Grudge" is pretty brutal. Yes, it is essentially about a haunted house and the ghosts that inhabit it. I know it's been done a thousand times before. But, for me, that isn't the point. The point is, unlike most haunted house movies, "The Grudge" is truly scary. Is the acting top notch? No. Is the plot original? No. Is the writing that good? Uh-uh. But I didn't care. The movie scared me, and when it comes to horror movies -- especially the PG-13 variety -- that's all I ask.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am just writing this because I believe this movie is underrated. I found it to be very scary, with an interesting story and good actors. Maybe some people want to see see body parts flying all over all the time, OK, this film is more subtle. Not much gore, but menace. Of course you will find plot holes if you look for them but which film does not have them? I recommend everybody to give this film a fair chance; I am not easily scared but this film freaked me out.

		<shortDescription>Not Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really had potential. I had two big problems with it. First, it moved just a tad too slow. There is something to be said for not trucking along, but every scene included too much of people moving at snail speed, breathing heavily, waiting for the next scary moment. I did think it was interesting how it did not follow a chronological timeline. The second aspect that I did not like was how everyone kept getting suckered into the same stupid scary movie mistakes. In my opinion a well done scary movie should be one that has people doing realistic things.Spoilers below: 1. In the part where the detective went to burn the house, he should have known better by that point not to investigate any weird noises.2. Susan was stupid to go to her apartment and be alone. She should have gone somewhere where she would not be alone.Anyways, I could list a million of these. I finished that movie completely upset.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary at times but utterly pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ambiance is there, and the movie does offer some good scares, but all in all it is flat and uneven. There are some great performances, Kadee Strickland's Susan stands out, but overall the movie doesn't offer enough backdrop in the characters' lives to actually care about them. Sarah Michelle Gellar is a good scream queen, and poised to take the title away from Jamie Lee Curtis any year now, after all she stole the spotlight in I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream 2. In the end, I felt ripped off of a story, there seems to be no story what-so-ever and the thought of getting a sequel on the way is just stupid, it didn't work for The Ring (which was actually one of the best horror movies to come out of the last decade) why should it work for a knock off?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie: Bad acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie, because, unlike most horror movies, it does not emphasize on gore. One does not see perhaps any act of killing by the ghosts, while it's in progress. Instead the sound effect does that job in this movie.Also, the movie moves back and forth,and leaves things unspoken and aspects unexplained, which is a good thing to me! This movie basically exploits the scare on the face of, and in the heart, of the characters, which successfully affects the viewer.However, the standard of acting by the principal character is, at best, of porn star/movie quality. Actually, I spent the first half an hour (after her appearance) thinking in which adult movie had I seen her earlier! Then I remembered that it was the movie entitled "Nymph Fever", where a "scientist" with apparently, at least, 36DDD pair of silicone, looked, talked and acted almost exactly like our leading lady here. Sadly, our heroine neither seems to have 36DDD, nor any trace of acting capabilities.Also the movie is heavy with major logical flaws. For example, no human being would return alone to a house (in spite of being fully aware that the house is haunted) at night for whatever reason; but this movie has such a scene in it. That is absolutely absurd, and defies all logic!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometime ago when I was reseaching on the grudge, I found a post in a website that said "Want to know if SMG died in The remake?" I clicked on it, and it said that when she was in the morgue, and saw his dead boyfriend, and suddenly Kayako sucks her soul, it was all a DREAM!!!! It was just a nightmare she was dreaming!!!! Since all of you guys know, you better stop yapping and whining if she died or not, I'm sick of IT!!!!!!!!!!!! That's why also there is a Grudge 2, coming out soon.P.S. If you want to see a picture of the director, with Toshio and Kayako as normal go to IMDb.com, and type the grudge and click on the actor either Yuya Ozieki, or Takaki Fuji, and look on the left, there will be facts, and find and click on photographs and VIOLA!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The review contains SPOILERS! I saw this movie on a date. The date didn't go very well because I spent most of my time too scared to look at the screen and actually stared at my date's right shoulder for an hour and twenty minutes. However, I went back and saw the film a second time with a group of my friends, determined not to wuss out again. My date's right shoulder was much more entertaining...The movie tries to create an atmosphere of foreboding evil and suspense by having maybe 20 spoken lines in the movie and music only at the most frightening parts. However, the lack of dialog also leaves anyone watching the film utterly confused. Throughout the film, people will randomly die and you have no idea who they are or why they are dying.Example: there is a woman who works in an office building at least 20 miles away from the 'evil house.' The monster from the evil house randomly shows up at her office building (empty, of course) and follows her home. All the while, I'm telling myself 'Well, its creepy, but what am I watching?' The movie does not even build the horror element, more of the something's gonna pop out and make you wet yourself element. Granted, there are parts of the film that will make you wary of being alone for a while, it utterly has the same effect as someone jumping from behind a wall: a second of shock and a few minutes of anger.When I watched the movie in the theater, the viewers were divided: there was the group genuinely frightened, and the group laughing at this pathetic garbage.Overall: the acting is horrid, the setting confuses me, there is no plot, and the music is nonexistent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Extremely Scary, but Still a Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen both the regular version and the unrated directors cut. First of all, If you are going to watch this movie then do yourself a favor and see the directors' cut version.The Grudge is a remake of the Japanese movie "Ju-On: The Grudge", both versions of the film were directed by the same man, marking the first time that an American remake of a Japanese movie was directed by the same person. The Grude tells the tale of a house in Japan. Everyone who enters this house ends up dead not too long afterward, simple enough. They are killed by the two "ghosts", a mother and her son, who were murdered in the house. Most American movies that involve haunted houses and ghosts have their killings limited to a certain range (such as the haunted house) in The Grudge the two "ghosts" are not retained by any limits they can strike anywhere at anytime. Another difference between most American horror movies is that the person who is killed is usually guilty of something, in The Grudge all that the victims have done is simply enter the wrong house at the wrong time.Sarah Michelle Gellar does a pretty good job as do the rest of the actors, the only standout is by a Japanese actor, who plays the part of the lead detective investigating the house.The story is told a a good pace and the backstory of who the "ghosts" are and why they are is explained pretty well. This is somewhat of a "jump-out-and-say-booo!" movie, but isn't extremely scary, its good story however makes it a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Thriller That Gets It All Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Bill Pullman and Clea DuVall is a great horror movie. Solidly directed by Takashi Shimizu (director of the original 2003 version) he does a great job of remaking his original horror for English audiences who have never heard of the original. Oh, and it's still scary.The plot isn't to hard to follow. Basically there is a house and anyone who enters is cursed to die. Which leaves us with social worker Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) who is called to look after someone in the house. Things get bad when they are both attacked. From here there is a series of flashbacks, giving us an insight to the previous family.Well acted by the cast, this movie manages to deliver some pretty good scares, psychological and jump. The music score also adds to the horror of this movie. Anyone who likes Japanese horror like Ring or Dark Water should definitely watch this.Plus this movie has no CGI so it's a much more authentic watch.4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is really what I think Hollywood should spend all their huge resources on! This is a plot that takes place far away from LA, NYC and Miami, with all the usual stereotypes we usually are fed from there. And that makes all the difference. Not only because of all the Japanese only talk going on, but also because this obviously is a very alien situation, that the movie characters has found themselves in.In this movie we have a Sarah Michelle Gellar, that has distanced herself from her usual Buffy character, and actually demonstrates that she can act also as not being a Vampire Slayer.The scares are, if not all too original, enough to make you choke on your midnight drink, and I don't think you should watch this movie alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i saw this movie on Hallowe'en for a special preview. I must admit and think what you like but the only reason i went to see this was Sarah Michelle Gellar. I hadn't heard of this being a remake as Sam Raimi and SMG were the only names plastered on the posters and i hadn't read one review. So i went to see this and wow, i was caught after the first scene with Bill Pullman, the weirdness and emptiness of him standing on the balcony intrigued me more than the events that followed. Shocked!Up until 3/4 of the way through the movie i was clinching at the arm rests and desperately trying to look away from the screen but not being able to. Whenever there was a jump i jumped and the sequence of events that befall the unfortunate American family that enter the house including the lady who wasn't even living there, just part of the family, absolutely terrified me. When i told people about it the next day, just remembering the scenes sent chills down my spine.My only problem was that there weren't enough Japanese people in this, they were in Japan and there were only about 5 Japanese people in the movie who all spoke very good English. This could have been a great horror version of Lost in Translation had the only American non Japanese speaking people been Sarah and her boyfriend. But it rocked anyway so i don't hold a grudge. This movie just scared the hell out of me and most of my friends who saw it, quite a few had trouble sleeping. This movie rocks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another example of a great Japanese horror movie ruined by changing things, its not a bad movie don't get me wrong I enjoyed it but come on was there really any reason to remake a movie that was only a year old and better than it in every way. The original is so much better that if you have seen it don't waste your time or money seeing this one. it changed large parts just so sarah michille geller could get more screen time. The original Ju-on focused on creeping you out as well as scaring you were as this version while still a little creepy cant measure up to the original. It was changed for American viewers by adding cheap scares that last all of about 10 seconds were as the original one is EXTREMELY creepy. And the final most important reason this is not as good they completely ruined the ending because they want to plan for a sequel, it seems like a small difference but the changed ending wrecks the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a yell, clap and scream horror flick. This is about feeling the fear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's simple. If you want to see pretty people being killed off one by one in new and inventive ways, rent Scream. If you want real suspense, a creepy atmosphere and the feeling of fear in the pit of your stomach, The Grudge is for you.Yanks living in Japan - not quite what the global audience might want to see. And Sarah Michelle Gellar is either wasted or unnecessary in her role, I'm not sure which. Seeing Bill Pullman always makes me wonder if a movie is really going to be any good, but in this case he is perfectly cast and not overused. There's one piece of expendable female eye candy, which American horror films are notorious for (Kadee Strickland), but at least she can act. For me, the various rooms of the house kind of represent the scenes within movie - you're not sure which room is which, and how they fit together , but you are sure the house is one really creepy place. Similarly, the scenes are placed out of sequence and feel disjointed, even blocky, but they all add up to a purpose - to continuously raise the level of fear and uncertainty within the viewer. This is not the kind of movie that tries to be too clever, twisted or trendy. It places fear first. It builds and builds in you, and makes you want to leave your seat, to give yourself a little relief. But if you stick it out, it might just be the horror film you've been waiting for. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The americanized version of this Japanese story is entertaining, scary enough and interesting, but that's about it. The thing that annoyed me the most about "The Grudge" was the lack of background; after you're finished with this movie you're left wondering a whole Lot of "whys" about it. Have this background info been more "hearty" it would have made me feel more pleased about this movie. For starters, I'd say a title like "Grudge" doesn't really apply here; sure, a "ghost" of sorts is p****d off, but usually there's some explanation as to WHY is this "ghost" p****d off. Shades of other superior films like "THE CHANGELING" and yes, even the Americanized version of "THE RING" come to mind right away. The acting is good and the overall mood of the film is actually chilling (my grading goes primarily because of these technical achievements!), but the rendering of this story for American (or should it be, "western" audiences) is a bit contrived and leaves a lot to be desired. THE GRUDGE is surely scary and it IS an enjoyable movie. It's just that some story elements are not fully explained and it makes you feel like you're watching an "alternate" version of THE RING!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance and story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I eagerly anticipated this one, after all, The Ring was good and this had gotten similar notice. But it was a letdown. Not that there weren't scary moments and good shocks, but there really wasn't any more substance to this than a nice Wm Castle effort, and a lot less story. In fact, I wish Castle had been around to produce it, because then it would have had some semblance of a narrative. I get the whole idea that it's a meandering thread of a haunted house/ghost tale without a real end, and that it's stylistically Japanese, and how we have to overcome our western sense of linear thought patterns. To that I would say that I've seen many great Japanese films with wonderful linear narratives, and many of them were well done horror flicks. So the nice style does help overcome the boredom factor but not the "Where is this going and why?" query. In that, it's ultimately not completely satisfying, and I'll take Phantasm over this one for a loosely knit string of nightmarish images.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the second best horror movie ever made (to see the first you can look for my comments). It's a movie about an old saying that says when someone is killed in anger a curse is born in that place. And anyone who approaches the place will be killed by the anger of the murderer. The movie is fantastic. It doesn't have any monsters but it has a little kid, a half cut mother and a strong father. Picture the boy in a blueish tan and black make-up eyes staring at you with those big eyes; the mother getting down the stairs on her hands because she doesn't have a lower body, covered in blood; the father jumping at you to drown you into a black water bath tub. And add to that the horrified faces of the people getting into that house. The scene with the death of the two new residents of the house is horrifying. That's horror for you!I really can't say anything about the actors, but they scared me and that's a mission completed.A special + in this movie is the sound the mother does. That Crrrrr...or Arrrrr...is unbelievable freaky. A big +. Ohh...what is that blue and wet ghost doing in this movie. It seems that Japanesse directors like to have something very outta-here (Earth) in their movies. See The Ring 2.Excellent finally! Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday and actually was a bit bored with it. Sure, i got scared by the countless scenes of another scary looking pale boy/woman popping up in an unexpected place (properly triggered by a typical gloomy low pitched sound), but that can't quite cover up for the lack of tension and consistency and the one dimensional characters.Maybe it's the American version that does it. I saw the original Japanese versions of "The Ring" and "Dark Water" and they scared the living daylights out of me. "The Ring" is a movie that still scares med today, several years after watching it.Back to "The Grudge": The cast, in my opinion, feels way to big for a minimalistic thriller like this. What are all these people doing there? Bill Pullman is absolutely wasted in that little part that he plays. It feels like the director tried to squeeze the cast of three movies into one.The ending: It seems that they are all going to die anyways, so what's the point in getting emotionally involved? And of course the body of Karens boyfriend has to suddenly move under the sheet. How surprising. Spend your money on a more original thriller/horror movie than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GRUDGE:Type: Slick Hollywood remake of a (better) foreign horror film (see also THE RING).Ingredients: A cast featuring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Grace Zabriskie, Bill Pullman, Ted Raimi, Yoko Maki, William Mapother, Ryo Ishibashi who seem out of place in a Tokyo setting, most of whom converse in English. Confused characters who basically stare at the camera and continue to walk into a house where horrible things happen on a constant basis. A disjointed adapted screenplay by Steven Susco. Aloof direction by Takashi Shimizu who made the original foreign language film called JU-ON: THE GRUDGE (see also THE VANISHING for similar poor results of a director translating his own interesting thriller to the American screen). A decent, though derivative, musical score by Christopher Young. Flat lifeless cinematography by Lukas Ettlin and Hideo Yamamoto. A whole lot of cheap thrills, unpleasant images, musical stings, loud sound effects, poorly integrated special effects, implausible situations and an ending that seems to have been added after multiple test screenings. Side Effects: May cause drowsiness, fatigue, rolling of eyes, nausea, regret at having paid to see the film. Do not operate VCR or DVD equipment in the event that THE GRUDGE is present in home. Viewers may experience a certain feeling of "sameness" if they have seen any horror films prior to THE GRUDGE. Confusion pertaining to what this film is about would not be an uncommon reaction either. A complete lack of interest in the characters (performed by a cast that has very little to do) may cause boredom, or a sense of detachment from the on-screen events. Avoid if relentless gore and violence (in place of any real plot) has a negative effect on you....In fact, my recommendation would be to simply avoid THE GRUDGE altogether.Refills: No thanks.2/10</fullReview>

Now, I think the most impressive parts of this movie were the camera angles and the sound effects. It just gives you a shiver down your spine. You knew someone was going to die but it would torture you horribly until they did. Again, I kind of missed the point of Sarah Michelle Gellar (wt hell?) but luckily she isn't in a lot of the movie. Just sit back, watch the movie (SILENTLY PEOPLE, it ticks the rest of the watchers off when you laugh and comment about the freak'n movie when you are watching it!), and enjoy the scare scene after scare scene. I was one of the lucky ones. I saw the movie and there were only four other people in the theater. And we were all scared senseless.

		<fullReview>Finally gotten around to seeing this movie and I was quite disappointed. The concept was wrong as well as the execution. This film is not at least bit scary. In fact, I think they are reaching the bottom of the reasoning barrow when they try to explain why, what was happening was happening. I thought the sound effects blew big monkey chunks, the makeup was horrible and ineffective of bringing any type of chills to the screen and the story was unfocused. Perhaps something got lost in the translation or that Japanese horror yawns are just not that scary in the USA (although The Ring was excellent). I don't know what this movie was trying to do and I don't think the director did either. The way he treated his victim did not make any sense. Sarah Michelle Geller was just OK. She didn't get to do much in the way of interacting with the story (in my humble opinion only) and she IS the main character. I think this film try to be a bit slicker than it needed to be. It's OK to try something different, just make it coherent. Actually I found the film quite laughable in parts and boring in others. When the film ended, I just didn't care about any of the characters nor about the film as a whole. It totally missed the mark in what it was trying to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japanese Horror meets Memento.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge is a story about how a house holds on to the murders of it's past and manifests them in the murdered soul of a cat, a little boy, and a young girl. The acting was pretty good. The script is where the problems are. There are numerous flashbacks to explain scenes that we've just witnessed. You have to pay close attention to the flashbacks or you'll get lost in things in quite a hurry because a lot is going on. The Grudge has a feel about it that suggests that it's really nothing but an attempt, albeit a pretty decent attempt, to cash in on the fame of The Ring, ie cash in on the idea of remaking Japanese horror films. At the end there's some allusion to a sequel that to me seemed ludicrous and clichéd. The jolt scares in the film were average as well. The monster jumps up suddenly and there's a loud echoing crash heard on the soundtrack. Pretty standard stuff. Nothing to write home about. The CGI and the cinematography were great.6/10 I'd recommend it if you're just a die hard horror fan. I'm a fan of horror but I prefer the psychological stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Japan has a long, ghostly tradition with beings from beyond the grave. Nemerous stories and legends in Japan of these otherworldly visitors abound. Ghosts often play key roles in Kabuki theater and were a favorite though perhaps somewhat overly-used character by Kabuki playwrights. Many of the ghosts that appear in plays and stories are females seeking revenge for wrongs done to them during their lifetime typically by cruel, heartless husbands.In the old ghost stories, vengeful Japanese ghosts would continue haunt their victims until they went insane, died, or at least made some form of restitution to appease the angry spirits. Some Japanese ghosts were born out of tragedy or sorrow and would haunt any person who came near. These spirits were particularly feared because they represented a danger to all unless they were somehow put to rest.Although I knew about the horrific nature of old Japanese ghosts, I had thought modern Japanese ghosts would be more polite and demur. I had imagined a modern Japanese ghost timidly coming up to someone and saying "Suimasen - Excuse me! BOO! Gomen naisai -I'm sorry!" before whisking away. "The Grudge" showed me how wrong I was about modern Japanese phantoms."The Grudge," starring Sarah Michelle Gellar of TV's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" fame, depicts a haunting by very impolite spirits. Gellar plays an American student nurse in Tokyo who accidentally gets involved with a haunted house that has the nasty habit of killing visitors. The ghosts of the house were victims of a tragedy and now they rudely kill anyone who comes in contact with them.The spirits' motivation for killing is explained at the beginning of the film in a brief written prologue which states: "when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is left behind." For Western audiences it may seem unusual that the two main ghostly antagonists who having been innocent victims of a violent death themselves would seek to cause the death of another innocent person. This flies in the face of a Western audience's sense of justice and fairness.In many Western ghost stories, ghosts despite their spookiness are often motivated by the same things as living people namely the pursuit of justice for wrongdoings. The ghost of a murdered person will seek vengeance on the person or persons responsible for their death.If a ghost is malevolent, it often turns out they were a bad person in life - as in the back-story to the main ghost character in the "Poltergeist" movies.To understand the nature of the supernatural entity of "The Grudge," one has to understand Japanese belief in spirits and the supernatural.In the book "Ghosts and the Japanese: Cultural Experience in Japanese Death Legends" by Michiko Iwasaka, there is a passage which is a direct echo of the opening lines of the movie: "Anyone who dies under great emotional stress creates an energy which is not easily dissipated; these yurei - ghosts, thus, have an impact on the local environment..." This type of spirit is called a "goryo" - vengeful ghost. A goryo, however, is less like a consciously aware ghost that plots revenge like those featured in Kabuki plays and which would be more familiar to Western audiences. A goryo is more like the energy of the emotion created at the time of death. And to some degree it represents the unconscious mind free of the limitations and morals of the conscious analytic side.Formal belief of goryo can be traced to the Heien Period (794-1185) when goryo were believed to be the angry spirits of political enemies that had died in exile or had been executed. The noted scholar Sugawara-no-Michizane became one such goryo. Through guileful manipulations, his enemies at the Imperial Court engineered his banishment from Kyoto. Sugawara died in extreme sorrow while in exile. Shortly after his death, a number of natural disasters occurred from droughts and epidemics to lightening strikes. It was believed to be caused by the angry spirit of Sugawara. To appease his goryo, Sugawara was given ceremonial promotion at the Imperial Court and eventually he was made into a god-spirit whom modern-day students pray to for success on their exams.Director Takashi Shimizu has built on this old concept to create a deadly goryo of a very frightening ghostly Mother and Son duo. "The Grudge" is an American remake of the original Japanese thriller "Ju-on" (2003). "Ju-on" is Shimizu's horror franchise. "Ju-on" grew out of a short TV story to become a successful and scary theater-release movie which was followed by a sequel. Famed Spiderman director, Sam Ramie, who helped produce the American remake thought "Ju-on" to be one of the scariest movies he had ever seen."The Grudge" opened in America during the Halloween season last fall but it has only recently opened in Japan. One notable difference is the inclusion of a few extra violent moments that were left out in the American version in order for the movie to keep a PG-13 rating in the States.Overall there's not much of story. Some people die, then some other people die. Most of the film is just one scare after another with little character development or plot. "The Grudge" is more like a series of creepy vignettes strung together to make a film. However, these vignettes are quite scary. Its the cultural nuance of the goryo-type spirit that "The Grudge" represents and the genuinely frightening moments that makes the film an interesting experience for Japan-o-philes and horror fans alike.On the Scare-O-Meter, "The Grudge" rates about 4 out 5 Screams.On Plot, it rates about 2 stars out of 5; however the concept behind the movie rates about a 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good spookiness. Acting wasn't too bad. Interestingly, they made Geller look fairly plain to almost unattractive, too many closeups, soften up the tight shots boys...The movie? I didn't get it.Here is what I didn't get... So the woman who was killed by her husband for having a crush on a teacher gets killed and then, due to the FURY in her death, she comes back to kill the teacher and anyone else who goes into the house? That was the first showing since the murders? Japan real estate that slow in turning houses? First time the agent walked in? Did every person die that walked in? What about the other cop? What about the twenty lab techs that went in the house, they will die? Why did the mother get spared a few more days than did, Yoko? Was Yoko really running about town jaw-less? Why would Sarah MG dump out the gas when she knew she couldn't move her boyfriend? What caused the ghost to scare ya or just bite off your jaw and leave you running about town? Where did the sister who was taken down the sheets go? I just didn't get it... If you die no matter what, then why am I watching?Good spookiness though... 4 0utta 10 -Chip</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say right off... ...this film has some style in the technical portion of the "film style" category. That is why you're watching. And it has some kind of a story, one of which you want to find out about, which is why you continue to watch. Where this fails is that the story which seemingly wants to go somewhere, gets chopped up and mashed up and jumbled up and all you're left with is some style - which the average movie watcher cares little about anyway. I do notice style and that is why I gave this movie a very high rating. Yes, a 5 is a high rating for such a boring and non-entertaining film. And the 5 is for how much better a film about Americans in Japan this was than "Lost in Tranlation". Why this wasn't nominated for Oscars - who knows?And..it was probably because I picked up an interesting idea of why it was "The Grudge" -- but where it failed was I didn't get WHO the grudge was on. Everybody? Why would that be? That's why the film was a let down for me.I rented this film ... and the first time I ran it...I have to admit...I fell asleep. I finally gave it my full attention and found my mind wondering off. I was thinking questions like: "When was Godzilla going to show up?" and "Okay..so what does that have to do with anything?" The Godzilla thing was because I am so conditioned to see the big green guy in Tokyo to make it interesting - and the other was because I wanted so much for the film to go somewhere and it ended up -- somewhere.But that "somewhere" was a place I did not want to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie overall is quite good, but most of the frightening scenes are quite expected (if you watch a lot of horror films). Sarah Michelle Gellar does an okay job, but i think her representation of fear is not realistic enough.To be honest, I didn't find this movie really scary. The noise that the ghost makes is quite disturbing, but apart from that it hardly gave me a scare. I thought the Ring was better at the crucial moments.SPOILERS: The first bit where Yoko encounters the woman in the attic- i thought that was a pretty crap moment- the makeup on the woman was really bad. Some of the scenes weren't subtle enough- it was too 'in your face'. i like it better when there's more suspense and less confrontation, as in monster lurking around... blah blah. I hate actually seeing the 'evilness' because it no longer has an element of suspense, and the grudge is like that. Just my opinion.So, for people who are hardcore and REALLY liked being scared, don't watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't tel how much this Ju on and the remake Grudge has taught me. I believe that many people who saw this hated it because it's nothing like the old American horror flicks where there's tank size gore and some sick minded scenes involved. But then again, i don't see what many people see in American horrors.I vote for Japanese horrors because they are much scarier. It's not just about Japanese women hiding their faces or some scary music, i think it was really more to how you view it and how realistic it is.1) You don't ever need gore to make good horror flicks, no matter how badly people loves that. 2) Little or no CGI is very good to make horror flicks. It fleshes out realistic images. Too much CGI is very noticeable and hardly scary. 3) You don't need to explain much in the horror film because if you did, it would remove the scare factor. nothing has to be spelled out for you, unless you're a kind of person who has to be explained millions of time. 4) Short episode sequence like in Ju On is very effective and the grudge is bit like that but more blended. I must say for each character to go through such thing we feel their feelings and we see what they see. 5) I believe that it's the viewers you wanted to scare, not the characters. However scaring the characters is good, but better if the viewers feels it. I also think that if we viewers sees something that no character has spotted or could see is very effective. Plus gives more mystery to why this is. 6) For Asian ghost horrors, there is no victory, there is no defeating these ghosts. The point was to scare the viewers, much less just to find a haunted place and solve it, which was done in American horror films or ghostly films that ain't horrors like Ghost or "Haunted mansion". 7) Less is more. Less blood is good. You can put it on someone's corner of the eye, give bloodshot eyes, or make it a bloody face. But if it's like raining blood, that's not good. If you want to put gore, make it less gory for it to be effective. otherwise, you're just pleasing the hard core gore fans and grossing the anti gore fans like me.So that is what i've learned from the grudge and it's original film. Shimizu-san is a brilliant man, regardless of the grudge haters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie last night, and despite all the people saying this movie sucks, I really liked it. Sure you guess what happened and how the cursed began and all, but still it gives you a lot of good scares and stuff.It's about this girl, Karen (Sarah Michelle Geller, not great but she wasn't bad either), who is assigned to go and take care of an old lady, replacing a Japanese girl who was missing. Anyways all kinds of weird stuff starts happening in that house to everybody who gets involved with it.Like I said, Sarah Michelle Geller is pretty acceptable in this role as Karen, she does manage to get scared and all, but we still see "Buffy" when she's facing scary stuff, that's not very cool. Bill Pullman is there for like 10 minutes, but anyways I thought he did OK, and everybody else in the cast, special mention to the Japanese actors/actresses.Anyhow, if you feel like watching a movie that I'm sure it'll give you a good scare at least once, please rent this movie :) ***1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First movie to scare me in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is brilliant, but I have to warn It is not for those soft in the brain area. This is a thinking persons horror movie. It leaves behind the usually gore that todays movies seem to rely on, and has a much more aesthetic approach.You will be scared by movement, music and noise, not by chainsaw, blood and gore. The idea of the movie will scare you at first, then when you think about it you will become terrified.There is some beautiful play with the time line and perspective, not to mention some good effects, but it is the sound that does all the work. Sudden noises, creepy guttural groans, the music.....it all builds an atmosphere of horror like I haven't experienced in a long time.Concept wise, it is simple and great. If you die experiencing extreme rage or sorrow, you leave the emotions behind in the place you die. These emotions then act as a curse for everyone who comes in contact with the house. The spirits hunt you down and kill you, no matter where you are or what you do. That is the truly scary part for me, that you just can't get away from it, not even going into your own home.A family dies in the house in question, The father finds out his wife is in love with another man, drowns their son, kills her and the cat then hangs himself. 3 years later a family buys the house. The older mother becomes mentally damaged, her son and his wife disappear and end up dead, the sister vanishes off the face of the earth and the original minder of the mother has her jaw removed. This movie has everything - go and see it, if your a smart human you shouldn't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay movie. That's all I have to say. I've seen many scary movies and I have to say this is a little scary. The story is very confusing. They keep going back to flashbacks on what happened to who and I even get confused on who that person is. I didn't like it that much. It was spooky, and it gives you the chills sometimes. I have to say it gave me goosebumps, but to me there really wasn't a good story. If you want to watch a scary movie, I'd recommend The Ring.Summary: I watched this movie twice and I'm still a bit confused on the story. It's something about if someone in Japan dies horribly, their spirit stays in that house killing anyone that interferes. People interfere and thats pretty much the storyline. Go watch for yourself if this interests you.Overall: This is a movie worth renting if you just want to get scared a little. I don't think it's worth buying. But I'll give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made and creepy ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haunted house movies are an interesting sub-genre. I love horror films and I love ghost stories, but as a movie they tend to leave something to be desired. Usually they are over-produced disappointments (like the remake of "The Haunting") or they tend to leave too much to the imagination and are a little slow (like "The Amityville Horror"). This film manages to succeed as entertaining, a little chilling and fast-paced.In Japan, Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a nurse who is given the assignment of looking after another American (Grace Zabriskie). The previous caretaker did not report to work; after the opening we know why. We soon discover the house is haunted by an extremely nasty ghost. Even worse, it is cursed: those who enter will be haunted to their deaths by the ghosts who met a grisly end inside.I think what helps the movie along the most is the way the story is told. After an opening that is shocking only because of the name actor involved (we don't yet know enough about the character to have any emotional connection), the movie cuts to another person at the house, then backwards to someone else, forward to someone we have met before, sideways to another person, backwards again and then forward some more. It would be very confusing if you were not to pay attention to what is happening. Those who are not entertained by this and let their minds wander will wind up disliking this tremendously.The acting is good for a horror feature. Gellar is right in her element here, showing a more vulnerable side to herself than she did as Buffy. Bill Pullman acts haunted even before he actually is; I liked his character and wished they had done more with him. I especially like Clea DuVall. An unconventional looking actress, she is very good in every feature I have seen her in.There are scares to be found, most notably from the spirit who likes to noisily crawl up and down staircases, slapping her hands on the steps and making a creepy clicking sound. A little too much is left unexplained (like what happened to all the police who show up at the house at one point; how does the curse effect them and when), but it is not enough to ruin a good fright flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has the horror genre been exhausted?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When reading this review, please do not judge me as a horror cynic.I must admit, that horror films, which rely on guts and gore rather than suspense, do tend to bore me to the point that I want to pull my own arm off to to join in with the blood filled 'fun', but this film is not one of these such films, on paper.The film revolves around a house in Japan, which is cursed by a horrible secret and when anybody comes in contact with the said house, their imminent death is inevitably on the cards.I wont tell you what the terrible secret is. Not because it will spoil the film, no this is not the sixth sense I'm afraid, because it really doesn't matter.The plot to this film is so wafer thin, once the initial adrenaline rush of seeing a creepy kid and an equally creepy woman with long black hair has worn off, I started to think, what's the point.I can't say that I engaged with any of the characters, and rather than rooting for them to stay alive, I'm afraid I cheered their predictable deaths as it meant that the film was one scene closer to the end.The bottom line is that this film has been done a million and one times by Hollywood, most notably with the recent The Ring. Having never seen the Japenese versions of these films, I can only assume that they were one hundred percent better than these glossed over offerings.Perhaps I'm from a generation who are so jaded that nothing much can shock them anymore, or perhaps we just expect a little more. Whichever it is, as the movie watchers of the present and future, if this genre is to stay alive, it is going to take more than Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the inevitable cliff hanger priming for the sequel, because we might not attend this time for second helpings.</fullReview>

And it is not my fault, because I was scared to almost death while I was watching The Sings (Mel Gibson), which of course is another type of film.So, the problem with this film for me is that it was over explained ,I mean when the detective tells Saraha M. Geller on the roof of the police building what the deal is.The director should have applied the names as titles for the different chapters, just like in the original version, as i could hardly manage to find out who was who.But in the end i got the photo again (just like when i was watching Ju-On.)On the whole i liked the film but i don't want to see it again for more than half a year, and it is not for its being spooky:))</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awful. I just watched it today on DVD and was so disappointed. I should have read the reviews before wasting 4 bucks on this garbage..I really like Sarah Michelle Gellar as an actress but this movie was totally screwy. I admit a possible jump scene is when the "dead chick" flies into the scenes at times, but overall the plot was a total disaster I mean what is it that kills them exactly? Being scared to death by seeing the dead kid and his mom. I have to admit this is a lame excuse for a film. I think Sarah made the mistake of making this film thinking it was a good opportunity to come back into the picture after her exit from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer." The movie is short and the cutting away so frequently to the past events it makes my head hurt..I realize its necessary though, for such a poorly crafted film. This maybe a good movie for the preteen, but past this it is a rotten tomato.</fullReview>

I think this movie it's OK, the goal of it was to make viewer be scared, and it carried out it. Sometime you realize the film doesn't take you anywhere, it has nothing to say, it is all about a ghost's apparition, which truly scares you and makes you jump from your seat. If you ask me, you may want to see this movie because it will give you one and half hour of pure horror. If you want that from one movie, you'd better watch it.

The sets are well thought out, something that seemed most unsettling was the actual Japanese house that it occurred in, the mise en scene was very well planned out, and was indeed a little scary.I liked the little 'glimmers' of face you see throughout the movie, which created a general sense of mystery, which was obviously revealed later on in the film. The only thing that irritated me was near the end when The cursed one approaches the girl after her little observation, she had ample time to escape but no typical horror movie with the desperation, and inability to move oneself or partner, and to end up being caught...

		<fullReview>Following the recent and continuing trend of Japanese horror movies getting the Hollywood treatment, Takashi Shimizu's The Grudge is easily the best of the lot. Once again the director remakes his own film, but the difference here is that the story now involves an American couple who live in Japan. With many more shocks, and the constant threatening aura, The Grudge is vastly superior to The Ring and The Ring 2, and is equally as good as the original Ju-On movie.Sarah Michell Gellar once again appears on the big screen in a role different from the characters she has played in the past. She stars as a foreign social working student along with her boyfriend played by Jason Behr. When she covers for a friend who has not turned up for work, she visits a house in Tokyo. There she meets an old woman who is nearly comatose, and on further investigation she sees that the house is haunted and cursed, and she is attacked. We are then shown small episodes involving the past occupants of the house and see that anyone who lives there inevitably is killed by the terrifying plague inside the house. As the story goes on the reason for the curse is explained, and Karen (Gellar) tries to save herself.Ju-On already ranks as one of the scariest movies ever made, and The Grudge is a worthy attempt which has some pluses and minuses over the original. The story is certainly easier to follow and more is explained, although it refuses to be told in a linear fashion. This adds to the uneasiness we feel while watching it, but is less confusing than the previous version. The scene here involving the ghost chasing one victim around an office building is better than the original, though the subsequent 'bed' moment is not as good. The section involving the school girls was one of the best scenes in the original, but it has been removed, (the time skipping in that part is confusing the first time round) but Ted Raimi's final scene makes up for this. The soundtrack is as good as the original, that gargling noise is especially effective in the cinema. Every shock, even while some are predictable, is good and it is relentless in its search for another scare.Although most of the actors have small parts and there is not really a lead part for most of the film, everyone performs well. Gellar proves she can perform on the big screen, and can be the weak, scared girl rather than Buffy. Pullman is also good, and although his part in the first few minutes got laughter from the audience, he redeems himself. The actors from the original movie do well, and Raimi is very good too, providing some comedy moments, putting us into a false sense of security. Forget about this being a remake- this is how all horror movies should be done; we are always aware that something is going to happen, waiting for the next fright, the atmosphere is relentless, and the scares are real scares, not cheap imitations.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the ending kind of being a ripoff, everything between and before is gold! Once you start the movie, you don't have to wait very long for it to scare you, it NEVER leaves you hanging waiting for something scary to happen. If you have insomnia, stay away from this movie. If you have narcalepsy, be sure to watch this. It kept me awake for a week. The acting talents, effects, makeup and realistic factor(as far as keeping in mind that the movie is shot in Japan) is award-worthy. The gore and violence level around the end of the movie is set high enough to make you gag, but low enough to satisfy. (And scary enough to make you cement your eyes shut.) Aside from The Ring, this would have to be the most creative horror movie ever. That's Japanese horror for you! :) If you have a strong enough gut, go see this right away. (This is just an opinion, but you should pay no mind to people who call this overrated, because that isn't true.) 5.5 stars out of 5!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not much wrong with what they did include in this remake other than they made it a little bit too chronological and simplistic, perhaps they don't credit Westerners with as much intelligence. The big let down is that they cut the best segment of the original movie and just elongated what was left to fill the 90 mins. The original film relied more upon building a tension of fear and a feeling that you can't escape the curse no matter what. This remake tried to make too much of a story out of it and as is often the case scares were second to the plot having to fit together exactly.I have to say this is not a bad movie, so if you haven't seen the original and can't be doing with subtitles then you'll enjoy this. For those that have seen the original, there isn't any reason I can think of for you to see this one.</fullReview>

You can tell children are evil, you never know what they're thinking. Scenes in the Grudge creeped me out no matter how many times I watched them and I pride myself on being immune to scares nowadays. Many have complained the already slim plot meanders all over the place to the extent the film becomes too disjointed and hard to follow. I didn't find that myself. It was a simple story and was told very well and very effectively.The story being that a house in which a double murder and a suicide took place now carries a curse which is fatal to all who come across it. It stars Sarah Michelle Gellar who has been weaned of the stakes and has taken up nursing when she moves to Japan to be with her boyfriend. Her first assignment is to take care of an old lady living in the cursed house. The rest is film history.Because there is very little plot and back story the film relies on its set pieces to deliver. And thankfully they do. Shiver as you hear the choked gargling sound of the mother ghost, squirm at the high pitched cat meowing of the little boy, laugh as a stupid blonde American woman tries to hide from the ghost IN HER BED. That bit was brilliant.One for scary movie fans who just want to be scared plain and simple. Just don't watch while in bed. You'll know what I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen Sarah Geller in the Buffy series and never thought much of her until I saw her in this movie - I never watched any of those series shows completely - but in this movie, she portrayed her character very well and believably - I am now a fan of hers (only in the movies though) there were several brief chills that I felt during the movie, thanks to the sounds, plot and visuals - I am beginning to think these effects are trademark Japanese horror qualities - good for watching in summertime anyway, the only problem with the movie is the lack of clear explanation for such a vicious "grudge" despite the horrible history of the house - it seems that the viewer needs to be familiar with Japanese culture to understand this concept - maybe compares to Amityville horror to some extent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Karen Davis (Sarah Michell Gellar), an American nurse working in Tokyo, is hired to cover for a caretaker who had not shown up to work. When Karen arrives she finds the house in total disarray and her patient in mute shock. Unwittingly, Karen discovers the presence of murderous, vengeful ghosts, bent on destroying anyone who enters the house - and then passing along their plague to their loved ones.There's a legend in Japan, you see, that says that when a person dies in a state of sorrow or rage, that emotion remains behind to haunt others. Can Karen escape the curse and prevent it from ensnaring her boyfriend Doug? Whoa, not so fast, there. This is Buffy the Vampire Slayer, here, true, but she's not Superman. Surely Karen can't topple an ancient curse, right? Horror movies are all the rage now, which is good. Even better, the emphasis seems to be on suspense as much as it's on gore and whatnot. The Grudge trucks with the former much more than with the latter, which is also a good thing. It's an amusing, entertaining little film, and there's no slight intended. Rather than overwhelm the viewer's senses with loud noises and blood, director Takashi Shimizu opts instead for what lurks around the corner and under the bed. Yes, you do see some gross things (including an undead being that looks like it walked off the set of The Ring), but watching the movie isn't like stepping into a house of horrors in which what you see is what's scary. As with the scariest movies, what you don't see can kill you.Gellar is pretty good, considering she's been in movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer. The Grudge is leagues ahead of crappy teenyboppers-in-peril movies like that one (and Scream 2, in which Gellar also appeared), in terms of both style and story. Really, it's like the difference between Scooby Doo and Columbo. Sure, it's a fairly easy gig, playing a victim in a horror movie. And, of course, if you're pretty much the only "name" actor in the movie, chances are pretty good that your character is going to survive it, in one form or another. Even so, I was pleasantly surprised at how well Gellar essayed her character's abject terror, so kudos to her.Really, if I hadn't already seen The Ring, I might have thought this was even better than it turned out to be - although I did think it turned out better than I had anticipated. It might seem a little derivative of The Ring to folks out there, but it seems to have derived only the good stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the success of movies like "The Ring" and video games like the "Fatal Frame" and "Silent Hill" series, the Japanese have established their own unique style of presenting the horror genre. However, nobody is perfect... not even the Japanese. "The Grudge" steps up to try and take its place as the newest spooky hit that features a battered female ghost with long black hair, but it fails to live up to any standards that "The Ring" may or may not have set for horror movies. What sparked my curiosity to actually give this movie a shot was both it's lead female role (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and the fact that the film was rated PG13. I wanted to know how exactly a film that rated on par with any typical Adam Sandler movie and starred Buffy could possibly be "scary". It didn't take long into the watching before I got my answer: it's not. Relying entirely on jump scaring the audience, the film's ghost only needed to execute her first two kills within the first twenty minutes of the film before I could pinpoint each and every instance when I knew she'd show up again. And during the rest of the film between the parts where she was waiting in the shadows just off screen for her next chance to flash her evil eye at the audience, there is a dry and downright boring plot which follows Gellar's character Karen through the rigors of trying to piece together all the clues as to why this is all happening to her. While I found myself groaning through most of the scenes of this film, there were a few well used visual effects here and there. The use of sound effects was probably the films highlight, and although by the end of the movie it had become a flashing red warning signal that the long haired evil staring contest champion was about to strike, the creepy gurgling noise that she made as she moved around was very well used. BOTTOM LINE: Take your girlfriend to see it if you want to see her yelp and jump and can't convince her to go see any other spooky movie. Beyond that, I honestly can't think of another reason why you would bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a really intelligent film about the most horrific and TRUE stories we hear and read about in actual hauntings. If scary movies cause you to have trouble sleeping, then this just may or may not be the movie for you. The way the story unfolds was rather clever too. We get an opening scene that achieves exactly the mood the director/writer wanted just making the story pattern brilliant. While I'm not the type of person to get frightened, it shocked and startled me numerous times while keeping me on the edge of my seat. I also had quite an eerie feeling once the credits rolled...10 out of 10 for the intelligent horror fan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this by mistake thinking it was the Japanese version so was not expecting a lot. FWIW I love good horror movies and have found the wave of J-horror movies to actually deliver the frights I look for.Within minutes I was covered in goose-bumps that barely left through the movie. Hiding behind my hands and the cushions and the wife.... Now you'll know (or think you know) what really goes bump in the night and know that hiding under the covers isn't as safe as you would like to think......Many great jump scenes to be sure (what's making that noise in the attic-I'll go by myself and have a look) but also scenes that just build and build to a shuddering conclusion, the security camera being unforgettably creepy. Images that just burn into your mind and hang around in the dark for weeks. Sure it probably has flaws but the end result is much much more than I expected.Almost a week later and this movie still springs to mind whenever the lights go out and I try to sleep.

		<fullReview>I saw The Grudge in theaters and I was surprised at how much I did not like it. One would think that it would be extremely scary due to the commercials. Honestly, the commercials made me nervous. I thought it would be a good movie but about 10 minutes into it I noticed it was basically the same kind of movie that The Ring was. It didn't have anything to do with The Ring. It was just the same general idea of the new age horror movies that poltergeists, ghosts, or other types of supernatural forces could effect some people. I can't honestly say the movie was a total waste of time (some of the scenes did bother me). If you liked The Ring, you would probably enjoy The Grudge.

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie somewhat, but I didn't find it horrific at all. You would really need to be easy to scare in order to be tensed up about it. Some scenes made the movie look cheap, as half of the stuff could be easily reproduced in your own home. Only two scenes off the top of my head were really clever and got me startled. The story itself was pretty well thought out. I enjoy the time frame jump around. Seeing different time periods throughout the movie, piecing together what happened and what is going on. However, the ending was terrible! If you really thought about it as deeply as I did, the ending made no sense. You start to feel as though the main character is learning what happened, and everything will be okay, and then after other events, you're left with thinking "What was the point?".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but watchable at the very least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In light of the success of the recent remake of the Japanese horror 'Ring', 'The Grudge' obviously had a ready-made audience. This coupled with the inclusion of popular young actress Sarah Michelle Gellar of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' fame in the lead role, it would seem that director Takashi Shimizu was onto a winning formula. Prior to opening in the UK, it was publicised that The Grudge was pretty well-received in the US, and this, juxtaposed with the genuinely creepy trailers made me actually look forward to seeing it. However, when the entire cinema erupted into fits of hysterics at the end of the very first scene, it became evident the rest of the movie was not going to have the same effect as the American remake of 'The Ring'. Perhaps the greatest flaw in the movie is that it tries too hard to create too many scares in too short a space of time, and while this works to an extent, towards the middle of the film, I found myself bored of the constant scare tactics. Also added to this that some moments deemed to be scary by the director, seemed amusing to myself, as well as others watching in the cinema. I also personally find the storyline itself pretty unconvincing; although this is a horror movie, and realism isn't exactly on the agenda, with The Ring, I felt like I believed what was going on, and actually cared about the lead actors. Whereas here, the whole premise of a husband murdering his wife because she seemingly had a crush on a college lecturer is a bit far-fetched and frankly quite stupid. As for the choice of Gellar as the lead, it was hard to see her as the quivering victim of a vengeful curse, after years of starring as a vampire slayer; nevertheless, she is perfectly watchable and tries her best to work with the weak storyline presented to her. Overall, 'The Grudge' is an attempt to exploit the market for the horror genre at the moment. Do yourself a favour and watch 'The Ring' instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but why all the remakes?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge is a spooky film, and mostly free of those cliché 'turn around, he's behind you!' shots. In short, its scary and moody and is a good horror film. Its just not exceptional. And its not helped my a few points...Sarah Michelle Gellar is, I'm afraid, pretty wooden. I wouldn't make a big point of this, but she is the main character, and you are supposed to empathise with her. She does cry, look worried and look afraid, but (in my honest opinion) she always appears to be 'acting' and never really 'being'. There seem to be many people who disagree with me on this, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say I think its because most of these people are Buffy fans, and so, SMG can do no wrong. She's always appears likable, but never believable. (Personally, I find this really annoying now, because she is the same in everything, yet still gets picked to star in film/TV shows, despite being very lacking in the acting department.) I fear she was picked for her fan base (her looks don't hurt either), and certainly not her ability.There is, however, some good acting to compensate. Bill Pullman is good, even though he doesn't have much screen time to work with. And the actor playing the Japanese detective (I don't remember his name) was especially good in the scene watching the security camera tapes. He looks truly uncomfortable/petrified. His eyes do all the talking, and he doesn't succumb to (*cough* Sarah Michelle Gellar *cough*) being forced to cry, quiver his lips, or go all goo-goo eyed.Another slight bug with this film: it looks like the American version of Japan. All the main characters (with only 3 exceptions) are American! What? There were over a dozen Americans leads, yet only 3 Japanese characters! IN THE MIDDLE OF TOKYO!!! Every other job shown in the film was occupied by an American! In the film's defence, there was a reason given for all of these, but still... Again, I don't want to write a sociological essay on this point, but it did strike me as beyond suspension of disbelief and more than a little patronising to the targeted American audience.I haven't seen the original yet, but I would like to now, just to see if this was an improvement (although I doubt it). If you're usually put off by American remakes, this is actually quite good.5 out of 10</fullReview>

The very first scene had me laughing instead of wondering what happened (as I presume must've been the point) The movie was very predictable and superficial, with no character depth. I admit, there were moments that made you jumpy, but the whole movie was more about startling you instead of really frightening.Like trying to create a boo effect,sort of the jumping out from behind a corner scenes. The movie was short and left you wondering where the real action was. Bottom line it's a slow paced movie that gets really boring at times and doesn't quite manage to bring you into the story. It also reminded me of The Ring waaay to often, although The ring was much, much better?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy enough...and mediocre scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Grudge a little while after its debut in 2004. It was the perfect setting to be scared - a 9 'o clock showing and a nearly-empty theater. The entire day before I went to see it I felt excited, I had this butterfly sensation in my stomach. I was glad a friend was coming with me, so I'm not alone and even more afraid. Even though she spent most of the movie with her jacket wrapped around her with her head buried in it. Too bad for her, she missed most of the good scenes. But to be truthful, by the time I came out of the theater I was left with a feeling that I'd been cheated.It's said a curse will be bestowed upon a certain place if someone dies there in the "grip of a powerful rage." And boy does someone die in a pretty powerful rage. Some really minor spoilers coming up. That's basically the plot of the movie. Sarah Michelle Gellar is in Tokyo, Japan and has to tend to a sickly old woman living in a creepy old house. Soon after does she start experiencing supernatural encounters. Now, I was a bit confused by this, but I'll try to sort it out: a young woman is killed by her husband for being infatuated with another man. Years later, another young lady named Yoko hears old noises coming from the attic, and goes to investigate. And is brutally murdered. Hmmm. I hope I got it right.I won't dig deeper into the plot, since I most likely got a few facts wrong as it is, since I saw the film the summer of last year and I tend to forget these things quickly. Anyways, this flick certainly had its fair share of creepy - and sometimes scream worthy - scenes. Be prepared for some spoilers that might ruin the movie for you if you haven't seen it yet. I found the following scenes pretty scary: in the beginning, when Yoko is investigating the attic, and suddenly we see...a thing, a woman I believe. Cut to a scene where all we can see is Yoko's legs flailing as she's being attacked. Whoo. Well, one thing this movie does well is take our common views on everyday life and reverse them. Like the scene when the woman is in her apartment, hiding in fear in her bed with the covers pulled up to her neck, and suddenly something starts traveling up the length of the bed. When the covers are lifted we see a pleasant shot of Yoko's gray and dead-like face, with large empty eyes. It plays well on our view that we're safe in our room, in the safety of our warm covers on our bed.As for the ending, I'd say it was pretty mediocre. S.M.G. realizes her boyfriend has went to the cursed house and is in serious risk of dying, and needs to get him the hell outta there. I think the way the woman makes her way down the stairs is a bit too repetitive with The Ring. Isn't that the way Samara crawled out of the TV? Well I thought the ending was a bit too fast paced and in your face. Too in your face to the point where we aren't scared. I'd give this movie 7/10 stars, because I got some good chills from it but in the long run there are many other horror movies worth watching.</fullReview>

That's will make the movie more scary than it will ever be.Just keep your eye's in the atmosphere, it's little sad, make you feel the madness and the sadness. just like the Japanese movie called ((The Eye)) Who was one of the best and still the best movie for all this kind of movie .Sara ((KAREN))) , all of us know her as ((Buffy)) The vampire slayer, She adds more scare entertainment to the movie.Finally.

		<shortDescription>Some creepy moments but it doesn't make a lot of sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge has some scary moments but most of the time its just to silly to take seriously. Takashi Shimizu directs an English language remake of his hit Japanese horror film Ju-On about a vengeful spirit that spreads like a virus through the victims murdered in a house. When a social worker (Sarah Michelle Gellar) accidentally lets the spirit out, it begins to haunt and kill all those who encounter it. The plot sounds scary and even with a good cast it didn't work out so well and its a mess of a movie. There's no real plot as there's just a scary scene follow by another and so on. The scary scenes are hit or miss with some actually giving you the chills while other making you laugh or fall asleep. Also most of the real scares are used in the preview so there's really nothing new. Sarah Michelle Gellar is pretty much the movies only saving grace and she does a good job though nothing special. Other cast members worth mentioning are Bill Pullman and this is his first feature film that I have seen him in awhile. Clea DuVall is in the film for about twenty minutes so she's not very memorable. KaDee Strickland and Jason Behr are also in the film but aren't worth mentioning. Director Takashi Shimizu does a decent job, but hopefully the sequel will make more sense and they will spend more time on writing it. Japan itself looks beautiful in the film and I'm glad that they kept the story in Japan. After watching this movie I don't know if its worth checking out the original though since the IMDb rating on this site for it isn't very impressive. Rating 5/10, now that its out on video its worth a look just don't expect too much from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While good looking and with some familiar faces, the story ultimately falls flat. We are left to sift through what starts out as a fairly simple plot to try and explain the many holes and seemingly unanswered questions that pop up when all is done...The Japanese homicide detective explains to our heroine something to the effect of: "There are those who believe when a person departs this world under terrible circumstances, an evil spirit remains which can wreak death and despair on those who disturb it" (That doesn't sound like a belief that is exclusive only to Japanese culture does it?) - In this case, a home in which a murder/suicide claims a small family due to the wife's desire for another man provides the platform for the evil spirit and the unknowing folks who come in contact with the abandoned home are its sympathetic victims. Our heroine (Gellar) comes into contact with the situation accidentally, but based on what she experiences, should rapidly meet the same fate as the other victims. It seems that since she is the lead, however, she somehow manages to escape the inevitable, at least until the clichéd ending. Other questions about the spirit's manifestations arose and we wondered "Which family member is doing the killing or are all of them at one time or another?...How did the Pullman character really die? Why does Gellar seemingly escape death (at least until the end?)?...Why do the evil spirits follow victims around the city and not just at the primary house?" These questions could be simply explained but are not...Even though the film is just over 90 minutes, it's attempts to build tension bog down and it seems to drag on... When the payoffs come and our victims meet their fates, things speed up and we are given quick-cut glimpses of the action; Due to the film's PG-13 rating though, these sequences leave more than a little to be desired...Sure, the evil spirit manifests itself through scary, zombie-like creatures and springs viciously and quickly, but the payoffs leave us more curious than scared ("What did we just see there?" instead of "OHHHMYGAAWWD!!!"). The best horror films have R-ratings and leave a tad less to the imagination.The performances in the film are understated and not too bad considering what is there to work with. Gellar is believable as the Student-nurse who stumbles into the nightmare and tries to find some type of explanation for what is happening...One exception: The little boy who played the ghost of the murdered son REALLY got on my wife's and my nerves...every time he popped into a scene, we both snickered and made Mystery Science Theater 3000-type comments. I'm sure the producers of the film were not trying for that effect...To sum up, the story is simple, yet irritating questions remain. Rather than try to answer them, I simply lost interest and moved on...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few misconceptions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading through comments about "The Grudge" and a lot seem to say that the plot was not built enough and they didn't understand it. I thought it was very easy to understand, as long as you pay attention. Like any movie where you need to piece a puzzle together, this one especially needs close attention because the scenes jump from the present to the past.The plot is very simple: A woman, Kayako I believe, was in love with her professor, Peter. This woman was married with a son, Toshio, but no one knew of her secret, which was contained in her journal. One day, her husband came upon her journal, filled with drawings of herself with Peter and confessions of her love for him. In a rage, the husband cuts her out of every picture he can find and kills her, their son, and finally hangs himself. Thus, going by what the opening statements are about dieing in a state of extreme rage or sorrow, the house is cursed. As the detective later explains, a stain is left in the house because of this event, and anyone who touches the house becomes a victim of the curse and will inevitably die.As many people before have stated, it's because the American culture is so used to a plot that is laid out in front of it and filled with knives and guns and chainsaws that some dislike the movie. I think it is a great movie because it uses that haunting noise or a single eye to make the movie-watcher jump. It is not a slasher film, it is a mental film, where the images are more haunting than just the masked murderer from Scream, because a person you can hide from, but a spirit you cannot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was all the fuss about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American remake of the Japanise horror film JU-ON, further proves the point of the old saying, "If it ain't broke don't fix it" SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR stars as a transfer student who discovers weird going on's at a house, where, when people enter it, usually wind up killing themselves or wind up dying under mysterious circumstances. The film has some creepy images, but mostly it moves at a deadly slow place &amp; certain scenes that show some of the houses previous owners &amp; visitors who later became victims is scattered about in certain spots, which makes some of the film confusing at times. The acting was good &amp; the direction was okay, but you would be better off renting something else (Of course that's just my opinion). Followed by the much better GRUDGE 2 (released theatrically) &amp; a direct to DVD sequel, THE GRUDGE 3.*1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grudge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was going to be a lot scarier than it was. I'm a big fan of The Ring, and found that movie much more unsettling. I haven't seen the original of either but hear they're both great. Pullman's intro was great, second only to the "Dick Laurent is dead" in Lost Highway. the first scare was great in the attic and I wished there were more scenes like that in the film. also a question to everyone out there... I understand the curse and the house, but why did the ghost go into the apartment building? I'm sure'll there will be a sequel, hopefully a little more suspense and if not, a little more gore. But again, this is just an opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i don't scare very easily watching movies anymore but this movie really got to me.it made me feel uneasy for days after watching it.there aren't very many really scary movies out there that make you feel that way anymore but this one sure did.my son watched half of it and was also scared for days after watching it.the only other movie that has made me feel like that is the exorcist.it seemed even spookier with the Japanese lady in it.the little boy in the movie wasn't scary at all but the parts with the lady are the ones that got to me.especially the part with her coming down the stairs scene.when i rented it i really wasn't expecting to be scared but i was wrong.i recommend this movie to people who really like horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only film to ever make me scream out loud!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this on the recommendation of a friend with, my daughter and boy were we glad we took her advice. The Grudge does need concentrating on as it skips back and forth through time but I knew from near the start when Yoko goes up into the attic that we were on to a winner. A stylish, engrossing and thoroughly enjoyable film if you like being scared to death! The gradual unfolding of how the events unfolded through time through to the final explanation near the end of the film had us completely enthralled and sat on the edge of our seats waiting for the next scare which still managed to take both of us by surprise.It was also interesting to view the 'Special Features', particularly the director's explanation of why they had avoided effects and computer aided enhancements in favour of creating as much as possible with the actors. Excellent performances from all the cast. Not a film to be watched on your own unless you have nerves of steel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I just think too much...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I saw this movie last night... and it could be I'm just not a major scary movie freak but I wasn't particularly impressed... The only thing that I'll say about it that was bad was that it seemed a bit slow to me... maybe that's just my "want everything now" attitude... but there were parts of the movie that just seemed to drag.I admit I found it odd that "spirits" left their "haunt" but I could get around that... except... (and here come the spoilers...)Since when would a spirit need to call to find out what your room number was...? And why isn't there a lot more history to this house? I mean, how many people must have gone into the house to get the original bodies out and check the crime scene...? Certainly more than the three that were mentioned as having died or disappeared... And what about real estate agents? Are we to believe that this was the first time a real estate agent went in here...? That there aren't many others who must have had bad things happen to them...? And... that family that moved in... sometimes it seemed like they must have been there for quite a while and others it seemed like the impression is that they just moved in a couple days ago... And... (I do go on, don't I?) how likely is it that a stalker (even if it's only one in love, not a psycho killer) would be just at that spot in EVERY picture that's almost in focus...?Like I said... maybe I just think too much... =]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Karen is a home-care worker that calls on the house of an old lady. Instead she encounters the evil that consumes the house and that if anyone who decides to enter their domain will feel their pain. So now she is racing the clock to figure out the past of the house and in doing so hopefully rid the curse she is now apart of.What I got was basically a rehash of what happen in the original, though there were some subtle changes in the story by Shimizu- but it basically stuck to the main idea, with the time-line of the story going back and forth with different characters that are caught up in the curse, while the home-care worker was the centre piece in the story. Like the original the story at times was uneven- but the atmosphere and images were persistent and simply stood out. To me the story was far less thought provoking, as the remake had less ambiguity, by tying up most of the loose ends and a detail background of the ghosts is explained- but because of that it lacks any kind of mystique that the original had. While the original needs multiple viewings to truly grasp the story, the remake isn't the case.Just like the original also you could say the director over-killed the use of the ghosts, though I would say the scenes in the original were more creative and memorable? the scenes of the ghouls were spooky at first with small and subtle glimpses- but after a while it just became repetitious. Though there is some nicely built up tension and fast paced thrills in certain scenes by Shimizu. The music score was too transparent to make it alarming and less effective to be freaky- but the eerie sound effects were definitely perfect in setting the mood.The acting takes a back seat, not awful-but nothing that good. Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen is alright- but really there is nothing fascinating about her presence, Bill Pullman is wasted in a small cameo role, Jason Behr as Karen's boyfriend seems fairly uninterested and deadpan, while Ted Rami lacks any sort of detail as Karen's boss. Some of the original cast of Ju:on make appearances- but overall there is no real character development, as they come and go with little to do.The settings are quite good, with a very gloomy Tokyo, the haunted house itself is truly menacing and hollow? you can just feel the coldness and evil lurking. The violence is nothing graphic, while the chills and scares are either pretty subtle (e.g. striking images or sounds) or the usual BOO! With something popping out? though that type of scare was pretty predictable .The ending for me was a bit of a cop out, with the usual let's leave the door open for a possible sequel- but overall I didn't mind this slickly done remake... though I didn't find it as creepy as I did the original.The reason for the constant comparisons with the original in the review is that I watched it the night before seeing this. Anyway it's worth checking out.3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice and Easy....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie when it first came out over here..... It was exactly as I thought (and feared) it would be; Ju-On 1, 2 (and even small parts of the less successful-straight-to-video-prequels) were used to make this nice and easy to digest for the western viewer. I do not blame the director though, the most common used comment on "Ju-On" by the western viewers wás that they never understood a d*mn thing of the movie because there were too many flash-backs. And so, they make it chronological and easy to watch, throw in some "scary" moments, cut out the things that made the movie really SCARY in the first place and PRESTO, more raving reviews than the originals ever got. Mr. Shimizu probably wanted to re-do this movie on a bigger budget, but it would have been appreciated by me (and a lot of people I know) if some of the edginess would have been saved in this remake instead of fancy rendering/ animation. Sometimes less ís more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Japanese version of this movie, i've heard there is an American version which i haven't seen and well right now i don't dare to watch that version yet... I get scared easily with many movies while i'm watching them, but let me tell you that this one made my chest hurt, and i couldn't sleep in like 2 or 3 days, and if my husband tries to make the noise one of the ghosts made in the movie i get those terrible images in my mind. So if you like scary movies i recommend this one, but the Japanese version of course since i haven't seen the American one, and I personally like the original stuff better so try it. The movie i watched was spoken in Spanish so the sounds were awful bad, but still got scared. Anyways it is a good movie, i never saw an Asian movie before and this one is a really good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't sleep at night no more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge- well what can i say, i can't sleep at nights no more. it's jumpy right from the beginning, who would have predicted a "was happily married man" would jump off a 50ft building to his wife's utter horror, the film contains many jumpy parts from where Yoko (the original minder) gets strangled by the grudge, to Alex seeing the dead Yoko walking into the office, with her jaw ripped off. But the most jumpy bit for me, was when Sarah Michelle Gellar and her boyfriend was on the bus and she suddenly starts talking about the Grudge, she looks out the window and the Grudge is staring at her in the reflection, the music doesn't even start, which is a good move by the director for the ultimate jump. My favourite bit was when Matthew's sister was on her "own" in the office, she shuts down her computer grabs her things and leaves the office, then the Grudge noise starts, at first she doesn't think nothing of it, then it starts again and gets louder, she picks up pace and runs to the tenth floor stairs her phone rings and hr dead brothers name comes up on the phone screen, she answers it and the Grudge noise begins, it gets louder and louder till it hangs up and she looks down and the Grudge is climbing up the stairs, then the lights blow up starting from the top floor, she runs to the door and something is grabbing on her phone strap, it snaps and she looks and the Grudge is looking at her, she makes a runner to the security office. The security officer tells her to calm down and take a seat, he goes to investigate, but finds nothing, the whole time she is looking at the CCTV camera, the security guard leaves and then the lights in the corridor start to flicker the a black fog comes out from under the door, and it takes the form of a girl, it starts walking to the camera, she runs out of the office into a nearby cab, the cab takes her home and she jumps into the elevator, she shuts her eyes but though the small windows of the elevator, the grudge boy is staring at her, she doesn't see this because her eyes are closed, she gets to her stop, and opens her apartment door, she's sitting on the sofa, and suddenly the phone rings, she answers it and her dead brothers voice (she doesn't know he's dead) comes on the phone, he says he's "downstairs" and forgot what number apartment she is, she gives him the number and buzzes him in, the doorbell suddenly rings, she looks out the door peeper and sees Matthew she undoes the locks and opens the door, but no-one is there, the Grudge then suddenly comes on the phone, she slams the phone on the floor, and runs into her apartment into her bedroom, she's lying in bed and she sees something at the bottom of her blanket, it's climbing up and she then screams, she lifts up the cover and the Grudge is there, it drags her and kills her.I won't tell you much about the ending but it's really shocking. I dare you to watch it on your own, if you like it you'll love the Ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another horror movie adapted to the silver screen for the American masses from the Asian masters! First, I must say, I have not seen the original of this movie..and even then it's easy to say "something went wrong in the translation", but hell, it's not easy NOT to...The Grudge have most of the elements of the "haunted house" story.. Scary attic, a bathtub full of water, noises all over..and scared-to-hell paralyzed people. The Grudge provides some good scares and has a few elements of brilliance, e.g. when it comes to the sound-design. Though, it lacks the last bit..where your spine twists and your palms get all sweaty... Sam Raimi, one of the executive producers of this flick, has, surprisingly, not set any stamps on this movie, except that his brother, Ted, has a small role...</fullReview>

If you have seen the Japanese version the American grudge wont be scary because its all almost reshot scene for scene but if you haven't your in for a fun ride just like my friend.the scares are similare to the ring but is a different type of movie. And it isn't really a phsycological thriller like the ring but more of a silence then BOO! type movie. Good fun movie worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rent or buy 'Ju-on' instead...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film did to Ju-on what 'The Ring' did to 'Ringu'-- i.e., took a good Japanese film and gave it the American brainless eye-candy treatment. The (other) bad news is, this time around they re-made it right after the original... and failed to mention the fact on the back of the Blockbuster DVD case (so I ended up renting the bloody thing thinking it was something new). Granted, Ju-on is not a *great* film, and makes the viewer maintain a certain cerebral focus-- but it is unlike the typical horror film in enough areas to make the extra effort worthwhile. In any event, those who are serious about what they watch should check out the original (Those who thought Turner's colorization of b/w films, the re-edit of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy, and the Dixie Chicks cover of 'Landslide' were all great ideas?- well, those types will likely enjoy this film. After all, as long as we here in America get something re-hashed that is prettier and requiring less thought, we will be happy-? regardless of how the integrity of the original is compromised).</fullReview>

I found that it was just as exciting to see how they changed things for the English version release...Sarah Michelle Gellar is terrific as the American Student who is the central Character to the story and Jason Behr plays her Boyfriend much the same way as he play Max in Roswell the series. Bill Purman is the surprise guest star - token "used to be famous guy" and he shines in the role that determine's the movie high point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i watched this movie expecting (and hoping?) to see something like The Ring. I was greatly mistaken. This movie's plot makes absolutely no sense and relies completely on their special effects to make it qualify as a "horror." It is not in the least scary and every single slightly scary scene is exactly what you see on the trailer. Actually, this whole movie is like a long trailer because the scary scenes all have NO CONTEXT. they just appear out of nowhere and then they're gone. you don't even understand why they really happened.why is it so hard to make a good horror movie? i was hoping for much better things with this movie. if you're a horror movie junkie, you'll find this movie a big flop. if you hate horror and are easily rattled, this might be a good movie to start with, you probably won't get too scared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, I've got a great idea. Let's make a combination Amityville Horror/Lost in Translation/The Ring flick. Let's get a trendy American actress with a cult following to be the nominal star of this concoction. She can represent the American abroad point of view. Let's get Gellar. After Scooby Doo, she's got to be desperate to do something to reclaim her artistic credibility. She's still got the Buffy cult members who will show up to anything. We can even throw in a Janet Leigh type early offing of a seeming minor star only this time let's make it a male. I got it Bill Pullman. He's perfect. Either that or we could move a bunch of Japanese folks into the Amityville house and have them go through the culture shock. Think how great that would go over in Japan. If it becomes a hit in Japan we could hire the same director and remake it over here. No, forget that concept, let's go with the first one, the one with Gellar and Pullman. We'll make it incoherent but we'll have a lot of pop up scares one of which we'll make a real jaw dropper. Yeah, that's the ticket. The critics will hate it. So what, it'll make money. Let's call it i dunno how bout' yeah, The Grudge. Yeah.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the cinema, feeling quite sceptical about it. I thought it was going to be just another wannabe scary film that lacked every criteria that a scary film needs in order to shock and freak out the audience. How wrong I was. I have seen this film more than once, and it scares me more and more each time I see it! I'm not sure about the plot, it wasn't that good. Though the suspense was enough to make up for the poor plot. I think the fact that they dragged any moment that was obviously going to lead to a death of some sort, out so much that made it all the more hard to watch, what with the eerie music being played in the background. I watched the majority of the movie with my hands over my face! A truly terrifying movie and the acting was just right, making it even more effective as a scary movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a friend who laughed through the whole of the remake of the ring which I loved to death having seen the original about two years before. Then I hear that she found the grudge to be extremely scary. I had already wanted to see the movie before I heard this, but this enforced my wanting to see the movie. Please don't think I don't know anything about Japanese horror movies because I am a massive fan of them. I have seen a lot more foreign movies than just the original three ring movies. The biggest problem with the grudge that it is made for fans of American horror movies. i really don't enjoy horror movies which rely completely on shocks. i like my horror movies to disturb me to the point of not getting to sleep at nights. this is what Japanese and Korean horror movies do. if you enjoy 'chill' movies then i would strongly recommend foreign movies like 'the eye' and 'a tale of two sisters' which will send chills down your spine. getting on to the grudge however, i was laughing through the whole movie because the female doll spirit which appears in the movie a lot looks like a famous pop singer which i would not want to mention in risk of insulting anybody. to make these spirit bits worse, it is way to obvious that this spirit is completely fake because it does not even have any facial expressions. the other spirit in the movie which appears quite often sounds like a cat (on purpose) but i don't find cats scary or creepy in any way or form so these bits became boring. i did not hat the movie completely however. i have been finding it hard to find movies that actually give me shocks lately and it was a relief to be able to get a few shocks out of this movie. if you are not expecting a Japanese horror movie ( which it should of been) you might be able to get a lot of enjoyment out of this movie. some people might get a lot of enjoyment out of this movie and if it wasn't for the ring remake being so Japanese are might of been able to forgive this movie so i am giving it2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There is something evil there."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found The Grudge, the American remake of the Japanese film "Ju-on" which takes place in Tokyo, more annoying than scary. Sarah Michelle Gellar of Buffy fame plays Karen, an American woman who lives in a house in Tokyo that is possessed by evil demons who sound like they have had too much soda, they open their mouths wide and belching sounds come out. They are meant to be scary sounds, but I found them annoying. I was never really scared, the formula for movies like this is pretty well known, a character seen walking down a dark hallway is doomed, and often is. There are flashbacks, well at least I think they are flashbacks, detailing the previous inhabitants of the house and why the ghosts are so upset and why they continue to pick on unsuspecting Americans. Based on the Japanese movie, The Grudge is the usual American-slasher film that offers very little in groundbreaking material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pure horror - works quite well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am interested in different type of cinema experiences, and my curiosity has been paid back lately with several Japanese-American productions, trying to play on the exoticism of the Japan setting, while bringing in more Hollywood cinema language and well-known actors. 'The Grudge' is no 'Lost in Translation', but it is still an interesting experience because the same director re-made his original all Japanese film for the American and European audiences. I will not comment on the differences or play 'who is better' game, as I did not see the original. I will just say that 'The Grudge' played quite well for me. There is not to much action in this film, but the horror theme is made credible by the cultural differences. Yes, we as individuals are intimidated by foreign cultures, we feel strange in a different landscape and not understanding the language, so horror is one step closer. Some of the plot line are expedited in a too simple manner, some characters are disappearing without too much explanation and before having created any emotional bound with the user, but still the scary experience is consistent, does not make any sentimental concessions and worked well for me. Acting is average plus, so was directing, and this simple piece of horror gets a 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean, if you went into the movie theater thinking, "this movie will be terrible, predictably not scary, poorly acted, and ridiculous, you could find plenty of examples. But only because you created a self fulfilling reality in which you were determined to not care about this movie.I don't think The Grudge is spectacularly original. Most movies, especially horror movies, aren't. The test is to find something special and unique within the well-worn genre.The unique thing about The Grudge is that it defies the typical American horror relationship of "if you can understand what is haunting this place, you can beat it", or "you only die if you've sinned". The idea of using the Japanese notion of the curse, basically throws all that nonsense away and decides, hey, if you come near this place you will die. The Place Is Cursed, OK? Thats it. There is no taming it. Too bad for you. This movie has the best jump effects I've ever seen.</fullReview>

I tried to watch some Nickelodeon (so that the last thing I saw before going to sleep was not The Grudge) but I still could not get some of those horrible images and sounds out of my head. I sat there swearing that I could hear things in my walls and in my ceiling. I knew that I would have HORRIBLE nightmares but lucking me, I did not even fall asleep that night. I laid there in bed that night praying that Creepy little kid with the black eyes and the cat noise coming from him would not find his way to my house. I used to love cats, NOT ANY MORE!!! Every time I closed my eyes, I would see that kid. The movie really was pretty scary but freakin' little boy really frightened the H*LL me. The way his mouth would come open and meow like a cat!! Makes me shiver when I think about it!!My husband LOVED the movie. He THINKS he is going to buy it and bring it into the house!! I DON'T THINK SO!! I made him take it back to the rental place first thing that morning! I WANTED IT OUT OF THE HOUSE!! I saw The Ring also with my husband (actually we were just friends then) and I had a hard time falling asleep after wards but at least I SLEPT! So, now you know how I feel about the movie. See it yourself but take some friendly advise...TURN ON EVERY LIGHT IN YOUR HOUSE, WATCH IT WITH FRIENDS AND START DRINKING, that away, you will not remember it in the morning!!!Oh and for all of those who thinks this movie is not scary or is stupid, has NO imagination!!!

		<fullReview>There is a very good style that operates in this movie, one that sets up the anticipation of event and then delivers, often by raising the goose flesh up for a few moments. But, alas, it is only style. The story itself lets the movie down. Comparing this to "The Ring" it falls below expectation and promise. Whereas the "The Ring" actually generated some type of emotion about the characters involved, and you wanted know what happened poor little girl, in this movie you hardly care about anyone, let alone the boy or the group of people that come into contact with the house and the spirits therein.It's disappointing because it should have been better. It had a good cast and the story could have been developed move, but in the end the director shot for creating a mood and style and ignored his primary objective of telling a story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it the first time...when it was called RINGU!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This "film" has nothing to offer, especially if you've seen RINGU. They basically took everything scary from that film: i.e. the freaky paleJapanese zombie woman with an excessive amount of hair, who moves as though she is overcoming rigor mortis.and added some higher-budget cast members. The plot is not compelling in any way. The fact that anyone who enters the house is destined to die and that there is no glimpse of a fighting chance for any of the victims makes for a very boring film. The viewer watches until..oh he's gonna get...oh she's gonna get it...zzzzz. At least in RINGU it felt that the movie was building to something, maybe even an escape from the curse. But grudge had nothing...not even a plot twist! Crrrap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Throws out all that made the original work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never liked people who proclaim "the original is always best". I also tend to dislike people who view all things Japanese as being automatically superior to all things western. So it's with great trepidation that I find myself saying that the original is the best, and Hollywood massacred this movie.2003's Ju-On: The Grudge succeeded because of it's low-key nature. There were no extravagant effects, no musical build-ups (in fact almost no music at all, save a sombre piano piece that's used sparingly), no "jump" scares, no cliché'd "haunted house" setting with creaking floorboards in the dead of night, the whole feel made it almost seem more like a documentary. And when you can almost believe a horror movie is actually happening, that's when it'll scare the pants off you.The Grudge (2004 remake) seems to have completely ignored all of this. It's unfair to blame Hollywood specifically, since Takashi Shimizu was responsible for this movie as much as the original, but it's obvious this movie is aimed at an entirely different audience, apparently one that's many IQ points lower, or so they seem to think. Give us Westerners at least a little credit, please.Gone is the subtlety of seeing a figure move past a window that the main character doesn't see. Gone is the subtlety of seeing stark horror happen in a mundane home in the middle of a bright, sunny day. In it's place is a buildup of generic "creepy" music thirty seconds before every attack, plenty of belief-defying CGI effects, "spooky" dark houses with creaking floorboards, and a pointless loud jump-scare every few minutes. This is a movie for American teenagers with ADD, with nothing to recommend it over any of a dozen other low-grade Hollywood horror movies of the past half-decade.It's not all bad though. On the plus side, it didn't carry over the needless complexity of the original's chronological disorder. There's still a few scenes showing what happened at different times in the past, but nothing like the confusion that a couple of scenes in the original caused. And thankfully, despite the complete (and in my opinion, terrible) overhaul to the style of the movie, the actual subject matter is treated respectfully. Gellar doesn't "pull a Buffy" and start kicking butt, or anything so trite as that, the story follows the original remarkably well, with quite a few scene-for-scene remakes in there.It's just a shame that all the impact of the scares are lost by the bland, uninteresting setups. See it if you've got nothing better to do, but don't expect miracles. Fans of the original, just stay well clear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zero Plot + Clichéd Scares = Lack of Creativity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't think my review is too harsh because there were 5 things that I appreciated very much from this film.1. Gellar is still attractive2. The movie is only about 90 minutes long3. Bill Pullman does a swan dive suicide from the balcony of a building in the first 3 minutes of the movie4. The actor who played "Joxer" from those old Herc and Xena shows is in it, not surprisingly as a geeky guy with goofy glasses5. The Grudge's trademark sound effect resembles a long burpIf those points are enough to make you watch Grudge, then make a bee-line to your nearby Blockbuster and rent it asap. The rest of the movie is a concoction of yawns, laughs, and various "me-too" horror flick tricks that you've seen a million times.But before I dissect this unintended comedy flick, let me first summarize the lengthy plot.1. According to Japanese myth, a curse will happen when people get unjustly killed.2. Consequently, anyone who comes into contact with the house where the murder happened gets cursed, so they eventually get killed by the supernatural ghosts of the murdered victims.That's it folks. Two points is all there is. No need to comment on the plot, because the depth is on par with a script written by drama students in high school.But let me guess? Many of you who watch horror movies care more about scares right? Who cares about plot? Fair enough. Let's sum up the scary scenes.1. Monster appears out of nowhere - people using a cigarette lighter to sift through shadowy rooms (Grudge pops up), looking into a window reflection (Grudge pops up again), something slithering under a blanket (Grudge yet again), victim's attempt to outrun or even take a taxi ride to escape the Grudge is useless, nor does isolating themselves by locking themselves in a room work (Grudge defies all physics by possessing Friday the 13th's Jason's abilities).2. Animals flash by - "old staple" black cat meowing and running across the screen in about 0.5 seconds.3. Clichéd and tired scenes - includes usual character dunking hand into murky water in a bathtub, and Gellar looking under the sheets of a corpse on a hospital gurney.That just about sums up this "scarefest".But looking back, there were a few diamonds of creativity in this movie after all. I have never seen a movie where I saw a small child meow like a cat for 5 seconds straight, a supernatural ghost having the ability to tease its next victim by calling their cell phone to "burp" its groan her, and a character (Joxer) seeing a missing co-worker bleed all over the ground, wear tattered bloody clothes, and limp like a zombie, only to have Joxer dunk his whole hand in the trails of blood muttering.........."Yoko, are you okay?"Some oddball things in this movie include why the senile old lady didn't get killed by the Grudge like the others did almost right away even though she lived and slept there. Also, throughout the whole movie, the Grudge doesn't go after and kill Gellar until presumably the scene at the end. On the other hand, all other characters in the movie seem to get knocked off right away after they come into contact with the house. The Grudge even tracks down the sister of a character in her own condo on the other side of town!Similar to slashers in other horror movies, the Grudge varies the tempo of its killing spree.Sometimes the Grudge likes to crawl its way at 2 mph to kill its victims who often scream, freeze in one spot, and die from a heart attack.Other times, it will speed up and do a "Jason" by always catching up no matter how quickly its victims runs.The Grudge does have an IQ on par with Arnie from Raw Deal. The ghosts knew where the security cameras were at the office and knocked them out, preventing ongoing security guard voyeurism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To tell you the truth I wasn't really expecting much from this movie because of the PG13 rating &amp; because of the number of stars your website gave it. But this movie was a pleasant surprise as one of your reviewers said. This movie really scared me! I normally watch horror movies because of their ability to make me laugh. This one didn't get a chuckle. (expcept from my boyfriend laughing at me.) I wouldn't let him leave for 30 minutes afterward &amp; then stayed up to watch sitcoms (which I hate), to get my mind off of the movie.If anyone is hesitating seeing this movie because of the rating that it got on IMDb - Don't! This movie was very creepy &amp; really entertaining. It did what it set out to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is awful. It had no plot, made no sense and was just dumb. Now I admit there were a few scary seasons and some cool special effects, but overall it stunk. The worst part was how you would be in the middle of one scene,and then BAM you are going back to when the dead person was alive...without any warning. At least The Ring keep you interested and informed, this movie just bounced all over the place with no set path. I still have no clue where this movie was going, and wherever it was, I don't want to go there.This was not as bad as Brokedown Palace or Open Water, but it is up there in my top 10 worst of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Belching ghost and mutant cat-child run amuck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 5/10 because I didn't need to see another horror movie like the Exorcist, but it's interesting to see what the horror genre has become. This borrows a lot of quick-shots from the Ring, and it takes a lot of scenes from the Ring and includes them here, but with less interesting things added (like the video scene where the spirit comes out of no where and attacks the video camera).Basically, Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a caretaker for sick older people and is assigned to substitute for a caretaker than has been missing. The other caretaker, "Yoko," has been missing because an evil spirit has taken over her body. Why? Apparently because the spirit moves on when it becomes bored and wants to give a good scare...that's what my understanding is. So everything culminates around what body the spirit will inhabit next, and Gellar's is on the list because now she knows too much (after sneaking around the house and finding a cat-boy...yes, a cat-boy...hiding in the closet of her client.) The movie was haunting, and seeing Bill Pullman as the love-interest of the spirit was an interesting choice. I can see why the American-made version was created because it shows you the ending first, and then tries to invite you to understand why things are the way they are in the movie. I sort of think that this was actually Ju-on's director's second chance at making the movie perfect. I see that Sam Raimi had his hand in this, but I wonder if that was the intention by the original director to fix certain things about Ju-on that were not as pleasing to American audiences.Alas, this film gets a 5/10 from me because it is average and stays there because there's nothing truly original about the film. I would've scored it a 6 (for it's modern day spooks and newer direction on how the "villains" act and move, to give it a creepier feel), but again, the Ring beat them to the punch on this one. All of that new-style direction was made popular by the Ring, and the Grudge feels like it borrowed a lot from that film and tried to make another movie just like it. I liked the music and the sound effects (even if the ghost was belching throughout the film...ha ha), and every time that thing came on the screen it had a certain appeal, but there was nothing new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have a chance to see it in theaters so I had to wait for the DVD. I thought that it was a decent horror movie. There were some truly terrifying scenes that had me cringing. As a rule, I do not take Sarah Michelle Gellar seriously as an actress, though I thought she did a passable job. Bill Pullman did not have much of a role. I thought he should have had more screen time considering he is a rather good actor. The one thing that brings this movie down is the weak plot. Good Lord. I can understand when people say that this is SCARIER than the Ring, but no way can it even touch the Ring's story. Don't expect a mind bending plot filled with great twists and turns. Expect a rather basic story with a bunch of scary scenes. Some aspects of the film were either not explained or simply left open to interpretation. The ending was sorely lacking. It ended on a cliffhanger. Overall I would not recommend spending too much on it. Borrow it from a friend if you can. Renting is up to you. Five bucks seems about right if you want to see it just once. Sequel coming in 06. Maybe it will be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...not as scary as the Japanese movie, which wasn't as scary as the Japanese TV movie, but scary enough. The ghosts are very scary. The big thing missing is the thing that was missing also from the American remake of "Ring": an overriding sense of doom. Everything looks too bright and pretty, everyone seems too wholesome and healthy-minded, and the film as a result ends up seeming not very serious--more like a scary anime than a live-action film; and the impression is strengthened by the American leads, who rather resemble anime characters. Still, I liked it much better than the American "Ring," which mashed out all the disturbing qualities of the original in a prosaic, literalized retelling. This film keeps to the same structure as its predecessors, almost the same blackout technique, and enough of a sense of the uncanny encroaching on the everyday to make it the first good American horror film of the century (if it can be called American); the ghosts are the best ghosts in an American film maybe ever. And it was panned by Ebert and Roeper--for a horror film, an almost sure sign of worth. At the same time, it misses many opportunities. For instance, the climax, the one really terrifying scene in the original, stops just when it should be getting started. The lead character isn't given any mundane worries to reinforce the supernatural ones, as was done for example in "Dark Water"; the main element in her personal life, her relationship with her boyfriend, isn't detailed at all. The dislocation of Westerners living in the East, at those moments, where it arises, adds overtones of strangeness and vulnerability which should have been made much more of. As the female lead, Sarah Michelle Gellar was the wrong choice; she performs satisfactorily, and succeeds more or less in not suggesting Buffy--a feat in the circumstances--but the TV association is no help in suspending disbelief, especially when a scene recalls a similar situation from the series; and there must be many actresses without that disadvantage who in addition would have been better for the part. Yet despite these and other weaknesses, the film still manages to do the job, or enough of it to get by; and for a horror film in the era of shopping-mall cinemas, that's worthy of note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts out well then goes flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge is another one of those films based on a Japanese that somehow makes millions and millions of dollars at the box office and makes little sense. I like Sarah Michelle Gellar in this movie, but the film hits the same beat over and over again. Someone is introduced, they go into the haunted house, and something bad happens to them. It is scary the first couple of time, but then it gets tiresome. The last half hour of the movie is particularly a letdown as the climax falls flat. Trying to tell the story out of chronological order (a process I generally do not like) just makes the movie more convoluted. This movie has delusions of grandeur in my opinion when the plot is basically an 80s slasher flick with less blood and gore. Slightly better than The Ring (which I found completely incoherent) but I think we can put a stop to importing Japanese horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Respecting "Grudge"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Populating a remake of a foreign film with well-known American actors helps to attract an American audience who otherwise might not watch the original. The makers of "The Grudge" have brought in Sarah Michelle Gellar for Takashi Shimizu's American reworking of his own "Ju-on." While "The Grudge" succeeds in being a masterful film in its own right, placed alongside the original it still cannot weather some drop-off in the chill factor.In "Ju-on" a curse envelopes and dispatches ordinary people for no apparent rhyme or reason besides bad luck. The film's success has its basis in its ability to sustain throughout its running time, a permeating mood of unease. The obscurity of its actors (especially for a foreign audience) coupled with the banality of the film's minimalist, documentary look creates a sense for the audience that they are watching something real. Once this perception of ordinariness is established, whenever something surreal and out of place appears in frame, the effect is truly unsettling.Unfortunately, the introduction of Gellar (as well as Bill Pullman and others) in the remake thwarts the attempt to cast the same spell. While there is nothing technically wrong with Gellar's performance, her very identifiability is a liability. Her presence signals too loudly that the person on screen is an actress and calls too much attention to the film as "film." Similarly, the Hollywood gloss of the film's look also takes some of the polish off the original's simulated realism.Since most of "The Grudge" is shot-for-shot identical to the original, the remake still is expert in generating its fair amount of shocks. (Furthermore, "The Grudge" also reveals the origins of the curse for those for whom explanations are a plus.) As with "Ringu" and its remake, the recommendation to the viewer who desires maximum queasiness would be in favor of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked so much about this movie, but it has major flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call me picky or hard-to-satisfy, but this movie is irritating because it comes so close to being very, very good and then fails some crucial tests.The special effects are excellent and the performances are quite good for the genre. I'm not a fan of "The Vampire Slayer", so I was not drooling as I watched her every move. The performances of the other characters and the great mood of the film carried it quite well.The theme of the movie, as written and spoken several times, is that someone who dies in great anger or sorrow can leave a residue, or a "curse." This is all fine and dandy, but I absolutely could not get the following thoughts out of my mind as I watched...*****SPOILER ALERT***** First, why is the death of the wife and child so much more horrible, painful, or sorrowful than the various ways in which millions die on a global scale. I mean, is being drowned in a bathtub over the space of a few minutes any more dreadful than the children who starve to death over many months? The sufferers of so many debilitating and ultimately terminal diseases? The brutal murder of whole ethnic groups by ignorant and fearful? If such residues are left after these types of deaths, you would not be able to go anywhere without succumbing to one "curse" or another. Just think about it..."Mom, can I go to Tommy's house to play?""I don't think that it's a very good idea. Remember, Tommy's house is cursed!""Yeah, but it's less cursed than Billy's or Joey's house." Second, how is it all beneficial or rewarding to the ghost(s) to basically kill everyone who even peripherally comes into contact with the place of death? This makes no sense. There's obviously an element of volition in the ghost(s)'s actions...she has a purpose or objective. So, what's the point in killing the man on whom she had a crush? (Who, by the way, appears to have acted with at least some ethics after discovering he was basically a victim of a stalker.) Or why kill the sister of of the people who rent your former residence? I mean, why go to the effort to materialize clear across town and rub-out someone who barely has a speaking part? At least the girl in "Ringu" wanted people to see her and know what happened to her and how she suffered.*****END OF SPOILER*****With that in mind, I have to give this a medium score. A few good scares and some creepy special effects, but a very unsatisfying story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this on DVD and watched it at home on my widescreen for the first time, today. I found it a little difficult to know just what was going on at the start, with someone doing a header off a balcony. The story then seemed to center on a spooky house; although it certainly did not confine itself there.I think this film screams for having a longer running time. Its 91 minute running time is far too short and people appear here and there that are difficult to place as to her they are. Unfortunately I found that I had to detract from the film sometimes in order to attempt the placement of the various characters. This sister for instance entered and all I could say for a bit was who is she? The movie keeps on a rather fast pace which is good but some time could have been put to establishing who was who a bit more. I am going to watch it again before long, but didn't the person doing the header at the beginning reappear in the film later, as if in a different place and time.The plot of the film, as stated, didn't seem to be there. You always were seeing the two Japanese characters who appeared as children when something was going down. I have to say that I found the film to be a bit too muddled and afterwards I could only think "what did it all mean, and what actually happened." The film could have been a lot better. More running time would certainly have helped. I can only rate the film as being about average due to the above complaints. The Ring I though was a lot better, but it seemed to have enough running time to make it work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it's PG-13, and no it's not excessively bloody and gory. This is exactly what a real horror movie should be. Relying on messy gore and violent men with a lot of makeup and a cheesy story is rather weak in my book. This movie is not a slasher, and that's why I liked it. It's a movie that provides atmosphere and story, the two most important aspects of a movie that's meant to invoke the type of reactions one should expect from a horror flick. It doesn't follow the regular rules, so if you're out looking for the next big horror flick, or if it's the blood and violence you go to a movie for, then yes, you should probably look elsewhere. If you enjoy the types of movies that play on your mind and emotions, then I recommend giving The Grudge a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Review: ** out of ****.When I first saw previews for The Grudge, I thought it was going to be a Ring wannabe or at least along the lines of the Ring. I guess that is a reasonable thought since both were inspired by Japanese films and now being remade for the American audience. Unfortunately, when you compare the two films, The Ring clearly comes out on top.Thats not to say there is not anything good about The Grudge but I have a feeling this was just put together to score off The Ring's success. The Grudge offers some creepy moments but nothing else beyond them. You can say what you want about how open-ended The Ring was and how much the plot did not make sense, but it had a much more solid plot than what is found in The Grudge. By the end of The Ring, I was intrigued by what was left unanswered but at the end of The Grudge, I was just confused.Part of the reason, I was confused was because I just did not care what happened. The writer seemed to have no intention of creating characters for us to identify with. We have no sort of connection with them, they just seem to be here because you need people to kill off in a horror film.The other reason is because of the quality of the acting. Sarah Michelle Gellar is as uninspired as an actress can get. Throughout the film she just seems to be going through the motions. The rest of the cast, which is made up of American and Asian actors, fails to make an impression.Nevertheless, The Grudge does have some good points. The director of the film, Takashi Shimizu, was the director of the original and there is no doubt he gives the film a very stylish look. The eerie atmosphere fills every frame and there are quite a few moments where I jumped out of my seat. Nevertheless, some of those moments reminded me too closely of The Ring. There is one moment where a detective is watching the spirit on a surveillance tape and is walking towards the television. No doubt its creepy but I almost expected it to walk out of the TV. Also, even at those moments, it fails to measure up to The Ring's most memorable moments.The Grudge is only worth a watch if you want a few good scare. At its very best, it is competent as a horror film. However, like I said before The Grudge seems to have only one purpose for being made. If the filmmakers had spent more time with story and characters, then The Grudge could have been a good horror film but as it stands, its just not worth your time.</fullReview>

I sat down to watch the movie and the first 10 minutes were good. The opening scenes quickly got my interest and I thought "woohoo! This one has potential." Unfortunately that was the high point of the movie. The rest of the movie was a very slow, dry, downhill ride. No build up, no suspense, just a very poorly told story. In the end it turned out that only about 15 minutes of the film are actually worth watching. The rest is meaningless filler so that they could actually call it a movie and charge admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie has chills, but incoherent plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now before I have my say on this film, let me just clarify that I have not seen the original Japanese version of this film, so I can not compare the two. This is my two cents about the American version of this film. Now, the Japanese really take their horror seriously, and the last few remakes have not done the originals justice, and once again this American remake fails.The story revolves around Karen (Gellar) who moves to Japan with her boyfriend to study. Karen in the meantime, becomes a nurse for the elderly. She is sent to a home to care for an elderly American woman. Little does she know the horrors of the home. Everyone that has stepped foot into the home has ended up either dead, or missing.The film does definitely have a few scares and chills, but nothing terrifying. The muddled story does not give the viewer much background on what actually happened in the home, and the ending leaves the viewer asking many unanswered questions.Definitely a rental for fans of the genre, but I would recommend to anyone to see "The Ring" before this one. At least there, we have a coherent storyline and an explanation to the strange occurrences. I will, however, still give the original Japanese version of "The Grudge" a try, hopefully it is more chilling and scary than this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>well i first saw the grudge in the theater and i jumped at least 10 or more times. i like horror movies but i have to say with all the horror movies out there now and all the ones that i'v seen, i have to say that the grudge tops them all. i love that movie so much, its what i have always been looking for in a movie. I'm tired of seeing the gory killing type movies, the grudge is perfect and i hope there's plans for grudge 2 because i would love to play the grudge. next Halloween i plan on dressing like the grudge. its the best movie ever. i already bought the movie and its still freaky from when i first watched it. i have Juon also and they are both beyond freaky and i love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good at all... *contains spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically put, this movie is all about shock value &amp; no real plot.Sarah Michelle Gellar's character wasn't even focused on very much in this movie, &amp; hers was the main character.Horror movie or not, it's just impractical stuff.A prime example is the Japanese woman that climbed up her LAUNDRY SHUTE. That's the dumbest thing I ever saw &amp; I laughed so hard at this.The worse part of this movie is when Sarah Gellar's character is found traumatized on the floor of the traditional Japanese style house but she'd only been in the American-style house. She was attacked there &amp; wound up in hospital. Random? You bet.Avoid this movie unless you want something to laugh at while stoned. Otherwise you'll be laughing but your brain will be in pain. It truly is that bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the heck IS this!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as remakes of Japanese horror movies go, this one is not very good. The source material is questionable to begin with, since the Japanese are completely insane when it comes to horror movies, but I liked "The Ring," and this one looked like a good companion piece. However, it is far worse in comparison. "The Ring" was a scary movie, and it had an interesting story. "The Grudge" is a scary movie, but it has NO story. "The Ring" had an explanation for the events, logic, coherence, and sense. "The Grudge" is a series of grotesque images that have nothing to do with anything. The basic idea is that the house is jinxed somehow, and the ghosts are really p!ssed off at everybody and take turns killing people who cross the property lines... not much to build a whole movie off of.Almost all of the scares are made up of weird noises and things jumping out of the shadows... but there is no suspense whatsoever, since the musical score only kicks in right before the scary things happen. It's hard to be scared when the movie conveniently lets you know exactly when something is going to happen, so all you can do is just sit back and wait to see what pops out of the closet this time. The one scene that had some real creepiness to it was the one where Gellar notices a strange woman in the background of every picture of Peter. That is the kind of subtlety I like in a horror movie... not all these peekaboo scares.And for goodness sakes, what boring ghosts! There are 4 of them in total: a woman, a kid, a cat, and a guy. The woman spends most of her time crawling around on the floor and making a bizarre croaking noise that sounds like a dying turtle. The kid squats in the corner and meows like a cat. The cat... meows. The guy ghost is the only one who actually causes physical harm to the victims... in other words, the only one to be scared of. Even the setting isn't scary... instead of an ancient, mysterious home, we get some modern building straight out of "Better Homes and Gardens," complete with a delightful little porch and wind chimes. But for some reason the human victims are terrified of this place, and cower in the corner when stuff starts happening, allowing the ghosts to grab onto them and... do whatever it is they do after the camera immediately cuts away. I hate it when people don't do anything to defend themselves in horror movies. If I saw some bloody figure crawling toward me, I'd kick it in the head and leave the room. I was hoping Ms. Gellar would do the same thing, being Buffy and all, but sadly, her defense method was to sit on the floor and sweat. Damn it.Other than a few good jolts and a decent soundtrack, this is an incoherent mess of a movie. Some actual logic would have helped it, but as it is, I'll stick with "The Ring."4/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ju-On was much scarier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge was just an average horror movie. The movie that it was a remake of Ju-On was much creepier than this. I had high hopes because the director of the original worked on this one also but alas I was disappointed. Maybe it didn't have the same effect on me because I saw Ju-On first. For days after I saw Ju-On I felt that same creepy feeling but not for The Grudge. I think American horror movie makers need to be more inventive rather than trying to copy Asian horror movies which are classics. Movies like Ju-On, Ringu, the Eye, etc cannot be copied. I felt the same way about The Ring, although better than the Grudge, was not a match for the Japanese version, Ringu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really eerie new 'Japan' school horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know it's nice right now to know Hollywood is moving some of its usual horror genres into a new direction.To be honest, I grew tired of horror flicks which seemed hell bent on dispatching young hormonal teenagers in a myriad of brutal ways...Usually in a bath of blood and gore...Having spent a LOT of money at the movie theatre and on DVD rentals, watching movies like 'Final Destination', 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', 'My Little Eye', 'Jeepers Creepers' etc etc... I grew really bored with it all...Sure... A lot of the ladies in those films were nice eye candy... You got the odd fright here and there... But ultimately, there was no sense of spookiness or eeriness to those films... Just lots of cheap, blood fuelled frights...And when it comes to horror, I'd rather be scared outta my mind than be shocked in a maelstrom of blood, guts and body parts...'The Grudge', and films like it, like 'The Ring', is a breath of fresh air for the horror film industry.The fact that they have a foreign feel to them... I.e. a Japanese one, makes them feel more authentic than your usually Hollywood manufactured crap.I can only hope that this trend continues... 'Cos this film was one of the scariest I've ever seen.In fact, I really didn't even watch it properly... My shaking and highly stressed hands kept getting in the way!!! Very Spooky film!!!Rating: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The OriginalJapanese Version Far Superior In Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sure these filmmakers did a great job in creating their story based upon the film "Ju On" from Japan. Same director. BUT,looking at the comments and tag line for U S version and after buying, viewing several times the Japanese import "Ju On",the original (based somehow on a TV series in Japan, as I understand it) is well worth the purchase price of the original! The documentation on the import DVD puts the production in perspective and of course holds well that original incomparable Japanese flavor and nuance the U S version cannot possibly hold a curse to.If you have seen the U. S. version and were less than thrilled (a Jewish what??) you MUST view the original and, trust me, you will experience a film by a young director that will make you a fan of this Japanese genre. Yes, there are plot holes and scenes that will leave you with...HUH? Just look at it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want all these negative comments. Movies getting good critiscism even though they're horrible is bad. Good movies getting bad critiscism is just painful. I won't compare this to the previous films, there has clearly been enough of that. I can however, tell you this. My body tickled. My muscles did not want to relax, and I had to use a minute or two to recover. Yes, indeed, I liked it. It is a personal film, in the manner that there is emotion for every character. You know them, and if not you want to know them. You feel for them. I will admit I had a childish kind of crush on Sarah Michelle even before this film, and I still do, probably a bit more now even. Watch it, and don't judge or question too much. Just consume whatever the movie actually gives you and enjoy. 8+/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is awful. Do not waste your time to go see it. Honeslty. There is no real plot. You cannot tell flash backs from the present and nothing makes sense. The monster is always something different. And i found it hard to keep track of who was who. In my opinion the story had no plot other than who ever goes into this house must die, maybe not instantly be brutally murdered but you will die.The idea of the movie is that after a horrible death the murder victim is left there to kill and destroy anyone who enters the house. From what i saw though the 'ghost' went after someone who didn't even go near the house and was just a mere relation to someone who was living there. It would of made more sense that the creature had to be confined to the house but no. None of it made sense. In one scene it has to slowly crawl on its arms but in another it can just appear where it wants.The music is terrible. The creature makes an awful cat like noise which is more annoying then terrifying, not to mention dumbfoundly loud. The only scary parts in the move where the actually death scenes which were pretty awful. I don't think you actually saw anyone dying. It just gave a few jumps. Thats it. Don't go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge was a complete disappointment!. I don't even think that it should be called a scary movie. In fact, I was laughing in the theater. The Grudge is proof that you can't see a movie just because the adds look good. It seemed really awesome, but there was really no plot line and the small plot line that there was was extremely confusing! I walked out of the theater thinking: huh? If you're looking for a really scary movie that you can understand then I recommend that you ditch seeing The Grudge and rent The Ring instead...totally awesome movie. But if you like it, then that's great! It could just be you're kind of movie. So go ahead and rent it and you can create you own opinion of the movie,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Japanese Version's Not Good Enough?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one wishes to compare the believability of the existence of vengeful spirits from beyond the grave to the believability of that many Americans somehow existing in such a purely Japanese environment, I'll take the ghosts any day.Hollywood has always felt that an American face in a Japanese crowd would assure financial success in the American box office. In this case, the producers of _The Grudge_ apparently decided that many American faces would make the product many times more successful. I just didn't work. If they were that insistent on a large American cast, I think the producers would have had a far better product had they remade the film in America. After all, it worked for _The Ring_.If you can get past that major credibility issue, _The Grudge_ is a pretty good tale. It weaves together the better segments of the tele-play and theatrical versions of _Juon_, a spooky Japanese tale about a murder in the past and all the subsequent people who were connected with the place where it happened. I gave this film a six out of ten rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like this movie. It scared me a few times, which is something that's pretty hard. Sometimes it's a little predictable, but in a way all scary horror movies are predictable in some ways. It's the way that the director handles the predictability, which Takashi Shimizu did pretty well. I had a great time watching.A lot of elements from The Ring can be seen, and since I really liked that movie I don't mind seeing elements from it in The Grudge. It wasn't as scary as The Ring, though.I really want to go and see the Japanese original now. I can imagine that it'll be a little less scary, but a lot weirder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I am not easily scared, but this movie made me jump out of my seat, not once or twice, but mostly the whole time. I must say that I've never seen the Japanese version, so I can't compare it to the original. The plot is very straight forward and simple: "Everybody who sets foot in a haunting house is going to get killed." And that's about it. Don't go looking for a deeper meaning or strange plot twists, because there are none. This movie is meant to scare the living daylights out of people, and according to me in that way it's very, yes very affective. If you like movie's that are just creepy as hell, then this is your thing. Go and watch it (but not alone)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings the word bad to new levels of badness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the film last night and I kept yawning from beginning to end. No plot at all. It was 2 hours of the same scene repeating with little, if any, variation. I was astonished while reading comments about how scary it was. It was so bad that probably is not even worth a Scary Movie 4 parody. By the way it borrows heavily from The Ring but while the latter was somehow original the only idea behind The Grudge is letting the monster (more or less the same girl with long dark hair, eyes wide open, zombie look, seen in Japanese Ringu saga) wander around the film without a script. Nobody really cares about it but at certain point the director explains how the whole thing began: a man killed his family 'cause her wife was in love with another man. The thing was so ridiculous that I could not take the film seriously anymore. Save your money: don't see it today, don't rent it tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** A house of horrors movie that goes beyond it's four walls to end up killing something like a dozen people by the time the movie is over. Set in Tokyo Japan " The Grudge" can't seem to get going as the story wonders for almost an hour until we get some insight to whats happening in the film and why. Even before the opening credits we see Peter Kirk(Bill Pullman), an American working in Japan, calmly wake up and step out on his high-rise apartment balcony and then jump to his death to the surprise and shock of his terrified wife Maria, Rosa Blasi. We have no idea what Peter in killing himself has to do with the story were seeing until almost the last twenty or so minutes of the movie. It's then that we realize he's the cause of the double murder and suicide that cursed and haunted the house that the movie's about. About three years ago a man went berserk and killed his wife son and even his pet cat then killed himself after he found out that his wife was having an affair with another man. Since then everyone involved with the house that these killings were committed ended up either dead or missing by being effected by the rage thats still within the four walls of the house. Even though were told in the movie's prologue that this rage would effect everyone that comes in contact with it with the same rage that the man who murdered his family and killed himself had. Only one person Matthew Williams, William Mapother, was involved in a murder. Killing himself after he murdered his wife Jennifer, Clea DuVall. The other deaths, because of the person being in the house, were caused by either the ghost of the wife and son of those originally being murdered and by another possible murder victim Yoko, Yoko Maki, a nurse in the killing of her boss Alex, Ted Raimi. None of the murders of the people who were effected by the rage were caused by, as far as I could tell, the ghost of the actual killer, the father. Even the pet black cat had something to do with the later killings. Unlike in almost all"House of Horrors" films the terror in "The Grudge" continues after those involved long left the house. It seems to follow them where ever they go, like Jennifer's sister Susan, KaDee Strickland, and the star of the movie Karen, Sarah Michelle Gellar. The movie has a number of jolting scenes in it, mostly very predictable. One that really shook me up while watching it involved Karen and her boyfriend Doug, Jason Behr, while they were riding on a Tokyo bus.Even though the father of the household who caused all this rage to engulf the house is not involved in any of the killings we do see him in a black and white flashback brutally murdering his entire family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest trend in Hollywood seems to be remaking Japanese horror movies. I haven't seen the original "Ju-On: The Grudge", so I can't comment whether the American "The Grudge" movie does justice to the original. I'm sure however that it doesn't do justice to anything else.Bluntly put, this is not a very good movie. Just about every aspect of it feels fairly uninspired, boring, and uninteresting. Horror movies don't necessarily need a strong plot or characters, but this movies sets an all time low for both categories. It's basically about a number of rather dull characters that enter a haunted house and die one by one. Neither the reason behind all the deaths nor the ways in which they occur are very interesting: the plot is very obvious and devoid of any really interesting revelations of twists, and moves at a very slow pace to boot.This might still be OK if the movie at least manages to be scary. In my opinion, it doesn't, although I can imagine that many other will find it scary (it's a matter of taste). There are lots of "surprise scares" but most of the times, they're predictable (a single character enters a dark attic...yeez, I wonder what's going to happen now), and while "The Grudge" certainly manages to create a dark atmosphere, there's no real feeling of suspense since you likely won't care much about which character lives and which character dies, and since it's painfully clear that they're going to die anyway.Truth be told, the movie does some things right. Sarah Michelle Gellar does a good job, and the rest of the cast is OK as well. The camera work is also very good. Buth no amount of good acting and technical expertise can make up for what is essentially a nearly plot less and rather pointless movie that relies solely on a number of supposedly scary moments.** out of ***** (add one * if you scare easily)</fullReview>

Although I thought the remake flowed better, and it wasn't nearly as confusing, I still thought it wasn't scary and was practically the same exact story as the original. I thought the remake would be a different story and more exciting, but I was sorely disappointed. I don't even know why they bothered to even do a remake. They used a couple of the same actors from the original, and they may even have used the same house. No creativity at all. It was like when they did the remake of Psycho. All the same. No new twists. Why was it even done.They might as well have just dubbed the original into English. And Sarah Michelle really served no purpose except to lure people into the theatres.

		<fullReview>For the genre, I thought this was pretty good. And with good I mean it had its scary moments, when you jump out of your seat. It's not the best acting around, or the best of anything really, but if you're looking to get scared for an hour and a half, this is a good choice. I think Gellar did a pretty good job in the lead, perhaps her Buffy experience made it easier for her. The plot needs some more explanations I think to be believable, but it works OK.Small spoiler.... that little boy that starts appearing on the house when Gellar gets there is a scary little bugger :-)Overall, pretty straight-forward scary-movie stuff, but effective and different enough to scare you, so it's worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I liked the movie, it was freaky and all. I saw it last night and honestly, it kept me thinking and being freaked out all night just about. One thing that I didn't get though and I understand this Japanese theory of people dying in such horrible circumstances leaving such memories in the home and all, but I don't get why the woman who was killed kept killing others. I thought (as it describes this movie) that these people killed would have gone mad and then killed someone else, continuing the curse and so on. I only saw this perhaps when Yoko killed her boss. So why then didn't it stay more to the story as it says it was to be about? Why didn't the mother just kill once and then the curse go on and why did she keep killing anyway? I mean SHE was murdered, you'd think her psycho husband would be the killer if anyone. I don't know, maybe I missed something important and will have to watch it again. Anyway, any enlightenment may help. ~CC</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why should there be a remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to understand why 'Ju-On' should be remade... especially when you are appointing the same director. "The Grudge", if considered as a single unrelated venture, not awful. There are some scare moments, if one calls them scary. The story is straightforward, though not clear enough grasp or interesting enough to impress. I haven't seen the original. But I assume if a director is given chance to make basically one film twice, the second one should be better. In that case I'm not going to look for the original one in DVD parlors.The cast are not bad. Sarah Gellar is fine, and that guy who played the Japanese detective is also impressing. I liked the director's idea of showing enough flashbacks in the middle whenever necessary. But Pullman's action in the beginning or how Gellar saw the actual thing in that time-travel kind of way remained unexplained. But one gotta respect the fact that these horror films always remain unexplained, perhaps.One more thing I couldn't understand. I don't know if it's a co-incidence or not. I saw two Japanese horror remakes -- 'The Ring' being the other. The basic facts are more or less the same. And some features of showing horror too. I suspect there are more Japanese horror Hollywood remakes on the way, and this is not a good sign. Why is there such lack of subject matter?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Scary Stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the scariest movie I have ever watched. There's something just not 'right' about it. I have seen the Japanese version of it too and think that the Hollywood production is the better film. The Japanese seem to make the best horror movies.Gellar is taste - natch and the rest of the cast are good actors. The little boy in it is just wrong. It made me jump a lot and kept me right on the edge of my seat all the way through the film. I have no idea how long the film was because I was so engrossed in it. You probably already know the plot by now so I won't go into the details of it. Suffice to say that I really hope they do an American version of The Grudge 2 (which is also excellent).I don't scare easily and have seen hundreds of horror films but this film really scared me and played on my mind after I'd returned home from the cinema. Do not watch this film if you don't like horror movies because it will screw your heard up.The one thing I liked about it the most is that it's not a gore fest. Most of the time you don't actually see anything happen to anyone its all left up to your imagination.This is the best horror movie I have ever seen - and yes that includes both U.S and Japanese versions of The Ring. Go see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big on scares....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But low on plot. That's how I would describe "The Grudge". Like "The Ring" before it, "The Grudge" is an Americanized version of a highly successful Japanese Horror flick. (Has Hollywood no original horror script-writers left?) Anyway, "The Grudge" is okay. Not great, but certainly not terrible. The characterisation is weak, with little or no explanation as to the whys and wherefores of the plot. A house "replays" events?? Please. Tell us something we don't know. Where the film scores is the score, (see what I did there?) the soundtrack is integral to the plot, in fact it could be called a secondary character. The acting is above average with TV's Buffy and "Roswell's" Jason Behr putting in good performances. (with what little material they have to work with) The Japanese contingent are universally good and Bill Pullmann is surprisingly heavy in a smallish role. While "The Grudge" won't be winning any awards any time soon, it is a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes the plot is thin enough to pass your hand through, but it's still a great film. It's quite scary in a few places I suppose watching it at 2 in the morning didn't help the situation. However even if I hadn't watched it then it still would've scared me. The way that the suspense is built up is chilling, especially with that strange little boy Toshio. When Susan is going home and is travelling up to her apartment in the lift and Toshio is there on every floor, I had my fists up to my face cringing, it really freaked me out. But not as much as the next section did, again involving Susan and the main ghost Kayako. Sad as it may seem I actually had to look under my bed covers when I got home. I know the acting wasn't perfect and in an odd way I was half expecting a vampire to leap out at Karen, but I still got sucked into the whole story of why Kayako was haunting the house in the first place. It had me jumping all over the place a few times and that noise gave me the chills I decided to give it 8/10 because on the whole it is a good film with an interesting premise to a story. It's well directed &amp; still manages to do a better job than other Japanese to American remakes of recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>okay...this movie was very scary. i loved it! the whole thing was eerie and terrifying and full of tension. i will admit, it does have little to no plot depth, and it is far from original, but it is the first movie ever to have successfully scared me. I am not easily scared, but this movie stuck with me..i even had nightmares. ............spoilers......... the beginning started off horribly..when Bill Pullman's character jumped off the balcony. the whole theater burst into laughter. but right after that a big shocker that caused the whole theater to scream. ..............end of spoilers............. the rest was overall very creepy. the ending (which i won't give away) was a bit confusing but satisfying.in conclusion, if you like horror movies and are looking for a few cheap thrills.. go see The Grudge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a feeling I was going to be creep-ed since I was turning off the previews when they came on TV! I am a horror movie buff and I have been watching them FOREVER. I know whats gonna happen and I don't usually jump too much, a few times when a loud noise happens but I am even used to those. You know when you were little and you would cover your eyes and ears and peek through to watch a movie, that's what I was doing! And my friends were fine. Not all but most. And I was like, what is wrong with me. The sudden shocks and stuff didn't scare my. It was that crazy Asian lady. She creep-ed the hell out of me. Her eyes were all sunken in and her mouth open and she made that damn belching sound. I don't what the hell it was but she scared the crap out of me. And you know when you see a gimmick movie. Like Freddy comes in your dreams, or Jason is at camps, Michael is on Halloween. Well this Asian lady is everywhere, the shower, the tub, the bedroom,the attic which was an interesting change from the basement,the city bus, the staircase, YOUR BED! I mean they cover everywhere making it impossible to feel comfortable anywhere, if you are the type of person that gets freaked out by those gimmick places, which I did. I am a 20 year old guy who does not scare too easily. I was up till 8am, making my friends stay up with me until the Sun came up. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't close my eyes, I couldn't be alone. I feel very traumatized even today and sometimes wish I had not seen it. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SEEING THIS MOVIE! Bring a friend who will sleep over with you, preferably two or three, and be prepared to fear Asian girls for about a week. This is not a racial comment, but I was freaked out by Asian females, the next morning, after seeing the movie, we went to IHOP. Our server was Asian, of course. And I swear, all of us heard her say it when she dropped the bill: "Have a nice death". Creepo! So, this info seems irrelevant, but I am basically showing you how scared out of my mind I was. My friends that weren't scared, said they jumped once, the bus scene. The one scene that I didn't really care about! I don't get it. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to see Ella Enchanted. I wanted princesses and happy endings but no. I reluctantly went to see this film with a pregnant, bored friend (to appease her) and was pleasantly surprised...and scared. The film is based around an ancient Japanese folklore of a curse, or grudge if you will. This curse kills innocent people, leaving them in a state of terror in their final moments.The film is told from the point of view of Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an American student-cum-home help on exchange in Japan. Through a twist in fate, she comes across a house with a dangerous, terrifying past. This house, and the families who inhabit it, reveal the horrific and gruesome nature of the grudge. There's enough blood and gore to keep you on the edge of your seat, as well as a deep psychological aspect that will intrigue.With the dearth of "horror" films that have been realized recently, this one actually fulfills the criteria. It is scary, the plot is well structured and the acting is mostly believable. This is a remake of a Japanese film, but it does not lose anything in its conversion for the western audience.The cinematography is excellent, the use of tilted frames really appealed to a true-blue horror fan like myself. The special effects added to the intricate plot, rather than becoming the selling point of the film (I, Robot and The Matrix spring to mind here). The vignette structure really adds to the film, I didn't grasp the timing sequence until about halfway through. That makes a real difference from the sick-making American "pap" horrors we see: Signs, The Ring etc.The only disappointment was Sarah Michelle Gellar's acting. She didn't seem as frightened as one would imagine someone to be when they are faced with a curse that kills all in its path. I found her painful to watch and believed that those facial expressions would have been better suited to someone who had lost a shoe, or a dog, or some other insignificant object, not her sense of reason and belief in the world around her.Despite this, the captivating storyline and excellent direction, both the work of Takashi Shimizu, save this film from the doldrums of re-created foreign films. The film will have you reaching for your neighbor's knee more than once during it's 91 minutes and checking your caller ID more carefully.8/10 ? a worthwhile film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My new scariest film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seems to me there's a clear split of opinion here. There are those that are fans of films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, Dawn of the Dead etc, which are all in-your-face, blood and guts all over the camera. And then those that are more into the psychological movies that try and scare by suggestion and surprise moments. Personally I'm a fan of movies from both genre, I love Dawn of the Dead, and prior to the Grudge I thought the Shining was the scariest movie (just my personal opinion). Ultimately horror movies of either genre are like anything in life, we all have different tastes and react differently to things. I acknowledge there was no deep story in the Grudge but if you just put your analytical brain on hold for a couple of hours, and put yourself in the shoes of the people in the film, then it is a truly scary film. There were a couple of moments that annoyed me, like when the cop goes back to the house to burn it down, hears a noise in the bathroom and decides to check it out - a classic "don't go into the house" scooby-doo moment. Personally I would have drenched the outside of the house with gas, why go inside at all? But overall, I have to say that the Grudge has knocked the Shining off my personal most-scary-movie spot. And as for the audience reaction. I watched this movie at Universal Studios Los Angeles on its opening weekend, with an audience that appeared to be of mixed ages. Everyone appeared to enjoy it, and there was plenty of positive feedback afterwards. The only time the audience laughed was in the scenes involving the senile old woman, and they appeared to be laughing at her, which I did find a little insensitive, are senile old people comedy fodder in the USA? not where i come from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real scream?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror films today have largely become lampoons of what was once a respected genre. Films like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer turned the familiar traits of a horror film to comic effect, but in the long run made too much light of a dark genre. Director Takashi Shimizu made "The Grudge" in 2003 but like an artist, has stripped the canvas bare and remade his masterpiece with incredible results. The Grudge quite simply is a deeply unsettling journey into a world of evil spirits which seeps into your subconscious long after the film has finished. Ever since Nosferatu in 1922 (a film that had it's prints and negatives burned on release, although some copies survived), cinema audiences have enjoyed being scared, an adrenalin rush being as much a part of a cinematic event as the popcorn on your lap. Now The Grudge can count itself amongst the true horror classics, stripped of any light relief and making fun of nothing, least of all itself. The plot of The Grudge takes place in Japan where American couple Karen and her boyfriend are living. Karen is a nurse and visits a house where a woman resides, almost in a comatose condition. Karen then hears a noise upstairs. When she goes up to investigate she comes face to face with a horror that soon terrorises anybody who comes into contact with the house. Passing like a virus, a curse stems from a violent act of horror that occurred in the house many years before. Karen must now try and stop the curse once and for all, but can she? Played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Karen is a well written character never over played or lost in fiction. The fact that she is a stranger in a foreign land gives her a fish out of water mentality helping the western audience identify with her. The horror is placed with expert precision and sounds such as a monstrous noise from a mobile phone is enough to make Robert Shaw's scrapping of his fingernails down the blackboard in Jaws seem like a walk in the park. The act of having a famous actor die early on in the film (played by Bill Pullman) is a trick that Hitchcock used to great effect, when Janet Leigh took a shower at the Bates Motel, the result being a death that sent the audience's emotions into a tailspin in which their heart rates never recovered. Indeed Hitchcock would have been very proud of the Grudge which manages to play on its audience's nerves without ever getting on them. A film that will haunt you for as long as you remember it, The Grudge is a film that makes you realise that although there most likely isn't a monster under your bed, it's probably best to check?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice story with poor resolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I appreciate the most about the movie is that it's traditional Japanese concept of "taints" and "curses" is well done - when something is so foul and dark that it leaves a permanent stain on the world we live in, and is inescapable by those who are unlucky enough to encounter it. Beyond that, this movie does a nice job of using the basic elements of what the human psyche fears: The dark, things that go "bump" in the night, and a relentless, inescapable terror. The movie has a brand of terror both intimate and seldom used in American cinema, which propels some of the more intense parts. These moments are further enhanced by the use of natural vocal sounds that, in the context of the movie, are very intimidating. However, this picture left enough unanswered questions to leave you disappointed. Open-ended movies do not bother me, in fact I enjoy them, but there are some incongruities in the story that simply do not add up. They are more plot-device oriented as opposed simply to my personal preferrences. I am convinced that such things were simply lost in translation or cut from the movie, as the rest of the movie is done well enough, that I have a hard time believing they were not taken into consideration. A decent movie overall, but I was hoping for just a little more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a house in Japan that is cursed and anyone who enters or associated with anyone who enters dies or vanishes. And guess, what, Sarah Michelle Gellar enters...Basically its haunted by a woman with long black hair, and a boy who makes scary cat sounds (much freakier than it sounds).I think The Grudge remake is better than the original. Period. The sound, the editing, its all done well to make The Grudge a good, taut selection of scares.I found the original a bit dull in places, but I think the American remake moves at a faster pace, and the new choice of time shifts placed much better. I am surprised that it has only got lukewarm reviews as its a great film and does what it should which is make you jump. I enjoyed the remake more, because there are differences between the two so things don't happen exactly how they do in the Japanese original.This is a slick, stylish good old fashioned haunted house kind of film. The fact that it is still set in Japan is great, and how there is that language barrier straight away. There is a shot early on in the film which shows people crossing a huge road which is such a simple and perfect shot.Go and watch it in a cinema with a full audience. Its very cathartic.It doesn't have anything that stays with you after you leave the cinema like the Ring, but it does provide excellent shocks. It really makes you jump and squirm. Not since the original Scream have I jumped and laughed at myself for doing so.4 out of 5I do hope that they get rid of scary women with long black hair crawling along the floor though as that is gonna get boring soon.SPOILERS BELOW X X XNow the whole scene with the sister in the stairwell to the elevator to the bed. This is what did it for me. This was just so well done and very scary. She does exactly what anybody would do. Goes for help. And the policeman (get this) actually helps her, which never usually happens in these films. And the way the ghost pulled her into the bed is the perfect payoff to that scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see The Grudge this weekend with 5 other friends who were all screaming the whole time. I watched everything so I wouldn't miss a thing (unlike my friends who shut their eyes at scary parts).I found the plot a bit confusing in some places, but started realising what was happening half way through. It was definitely SCARY, and I loved how it made you jump. But I was really disappointed at the end, as I didn't feel like it was concluded or anything. Then my friends pointed out there must be a sequel, but I was still unsatisfied at the blunt ending. Overall - if you love the thrill and shock of scary movies it's good for you. But if you want a great mystery movie with an enthralling plot that is great, it 'aint that good. I'd give it about a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taking the original and remaking it for a western audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first comment on a film on IMDb as I saw this last night and thought it was that dreadful that I had to comment.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** This film was directed by the same director as all the original Ju-on films, Takashi Shimizu also wrote the first Ju-ons as well as the remake, so why could he not come up with an original idea? This film takes every single 'shes behind you' scare tactic of the original films and adds some SFX which makes the film lose the atmosphere, the slow build up to the jumpy bits and also the make up and movement of the characters which is what makes that genre of Japanese films, it seems to just rush through the film in order to squeeze all the scares in. There was nothing that belonged to this film alone, it even used the same house, same plot, same scares, it was shot in Japan, the only difference to the Ju-ons was this film had westerners in it and no subs all the way through and a bit of CG. If they had completely changed it and Americanised it as they did with The Ring, remake of Ringu, they could have made a great film, maybe by just taking some elements relocating the country, the style and changing the story a bit. I have heard that producer Sam Raimi has confessed that the only reason for making the film was to lose the subtitles and take it to a wider audience. This film was definitely made for a western audience. So to sum this up then, if you have seen the original Ju-ons and liked them you will be terribly disappointed in this sold out effort, but if you like horror and couldn't care less about the originals then its a fairly decent horror film. I would definitely recommend seeing the originals though but if you have not seen much or any Japanese horror then you may find this quite scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find myself disagreeing with all of the comments I've read on this site about "The Grudge". Some people are saying its a great film and some are saying it's not worth there time, I think your all going too far in both direction as far as how good the film is or isn't. You want my opinion here it is.##POSSIBLE SPOILERS##In all honesty I think this film is a bit of a disappointment considering it came from the same mind as "The Ring" which I think is one of the best horror films ever made. I found it impossible not to be reminded of "The Ring" while watching this film. The concept was far to similar, in "The Ring" it was a cursed tape which killed people, in "The Grudge" it was a house, obscuring the face of the doomed seems to be another recurring theme.On the subject of it being hard to follow, i think you'll find that all films are hard to follow if you sit in the cinema for two hours and chat to your mate about how bad your ex-boyfriend was in the bedroom (adressed at the two girls who sat behind me).I don't know if this film was a result of a bad day at the office for the writer (whose name I can't say let alone spell) or if he just had a bit of luck with "The Ring", however you look at it I don't think this film even comes near to "The Ring".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reviews of this film which involve some element of comparison with The Ring are inevitable, and this is no different (Comparisons with The Grinch are less usual, and again, this is no different). There are certainly stylistic similarities to The Ring and its Japanese predecessor (The appearance of the films primary béte noire, for one). Whereas that film is concise however, wrapping a simple idea fairly neatly, The Grudge, like any unwelcome guest, leaves a bit of a mess. Criticism of this film may also revolve around its undeniable usage of horror genre clichés (See title). On the other hand, I think the fascinatingly mind-jolting ever-so-slightly-alien style of this movie more than compensates for this. The haunting images, (Don't even pardon that pun, shoot, shoot me now) combined with the plethora of strangely teasing loose ends leave parts of the film replaying through the mind over and over again. And ultimately, it is tense, and it is scary, which is why you're going. If you're after character development, or uniformly high-quality acting, (Back to acting school with you, Ms Gellar) see Finding Neverland, perhaps. If you wish to be heebeed and then roundly jeebeed, I do urge you to have a go at The Grudge, if you think you're hard enough..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WATCH THIS FILM!! I saw this 2 nights ago and have been telling all at work to go see it, if anything for the fright factor. True, there is not a particularly strong plot, but this film was made for one reason....to scare you! If you like, this film is more of a psychlogical thriller/horror not a gross out blood fest, you really do have to pay attention but it's worth it. I guarantee that if you watch this you will have a fear of 2 of the following - Screeching cat noise, CCTV, Lofts/Attics, Strange clicking noise or lifting your bed covers! If you've watched this I'm sure you know where I'm coming from! I have to admit that whilst watching this I did let out an audible scream a few times! Something I haven't done since I was about 10! Mind you, I wasn't the only one in the cinema. My wife also ended up with nail marks in her hand! I would advise watching this on the big screen as I feel it will lose it's oooomph on DVD/VCR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there a trend forming for the western adaptations of Japanese horror flicks? The Ring was indeed an extraordinarily successful, highly effective and well made film, delivering on all levels, but "The Grudge" did not meet expectations - the bar had been set high! In "The Grudge", there was a distinct lack of atmosphere, very little music/soundtrack (except to warn you that a "scary" bit was upon you - bad, bad move - totally ruined any so-called suspense) and a disjointed plot which served only to confuse you. Very little explanation was given for the events that unfold - this worked to good effect in "the Ring", but seeing as this was entirely different premise it really would have helped this one along. Seems the audience is split in two for this one. It just didn't cut it for me - more laughs than scares - 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this movie was the funniest movie ever. Well the beginning was, we were the only people in the theater laughing when the guy fell off the ledge. I mean then he came back to life! I'm sorry but this is a hard movie to follow if you don't watch closely, and it's scary so you don't want to watch some parts. How did the creepy girl get out of the house to chase the sister? That confused me. I think too many people died in the same way: walking down a empty hallway where a strange noise was coming from. How thick are these people? Following a strange noise alone? It's really funny to see the people at the theater scraming i was laughing so hard when my friend was screaming. But if you like to get scared you should watch this movie, or if you like to see other people get scared. I don't think I'll go to see the sequel. This movie wouldn't be scary in the daytime though. The plot wasn't that good, but not many scary movies have good plots. I give this movie 5 out of 10, because it's scary but doesn't have a plot or reason they all die. It would get more if it wasn't so confusing.Me : Yeah, that's my neighbors review.... enjoy.</fullReview>

And actually the movie wasn't even all the hard to understand if you watch the movie and don't talk through the whole thing which my friend allison did. Anyway I loved this movie!! It was an awesome horror movie, and if you thought the RIng was scary I have no clue whats your problem that movie wasn't scary at all! well anyway I loved the Grudge and I can't wait until the second part comes out! It will probably be better! Or at least I hope! Hollywood needs to make real scary movies that people in real life are scared about! like when your home alone and the dog starts barking or someone smiling like a lunatic then you shine a flash light in their face and they start walking toward you! (lol thats kind of funny though!) well yeah ...... 9/1o!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally! A horror movie for people with brains!This is one of the best horror movies I have seen. It blends the best of all the recent horror flicks and delivers action, suspense and real terror. It has many twists and will have you thinking about it for days to come.WARNING: If you are the type of person who prefers a movie that is completely cliché, then this is NOT the movie for you!In other words, if you like Tarantino classics, you will appreciate this gem. If, on the other hand, your tastes in horror lean toward the Seed of Chucky, you will probably come out of the movie scratching your head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GRUDGE - After reading several of my diary friends' reviews of this movie, I wasn't expecting much, so I went in not expecting a great movie. Boy, was I ever surprised to see how scary this movie was! I don't know what everyone else was thinking, but this movie was a superb horror movie. It was very scary and freaked me out majorly. It's one of the scariest and most disturbing movies I have seen in ages! I found myself shivering and trembling from being nervously afraid. It's not gory or anything, which is wonderful. There was nothing nasty about the movie at all. Nothing so gory that I had to turn my head or grip my stomach in nausea. No stabbing people or biting people's necks. No needles (thank God) and no sharp objects going into flesh (thank you sooooo much!). Just pure fright and scary things that didn't make you want to puke. I really, really appreciated this movie. It was wonderful. It was terrifying simply because of the presence of the ghosts and the way they appeared and looked. I am so glad to finally see a movie where people are not getting cut by glass or sliced up by a knife or a chainsaw. I absolutely despise seeing people's flesh get cut with sharp objects. I hate seeing flesh torn. I hate seeing people cut themselves or jab glass into their hand. To me, that isn't scary at all. That is torture for a viewer to stomach and sickening to watch. I want a horror film to be SCARY to watch, not painful to watch. And this met my every expectation of a good horror film. The language was clean, the gore level was way down, and the fright factor was really high. It kept me up half the night because I was scared that I would turn around and be faced with those horrifying images. It made me shake and it made me cringe, but it didn't make me sick because they never showed anything nasty. There was hardly any blood at all in the movie. It was awesome how they put so much fear into a movie with so little blood. I think this movie was scarier than The Ring, Blair Witch, Freddy vs Jason, or any other horror movie that I have seen. It was much scarier than The Village or Signs. I was majorly impressed with this movie. It gave me a huge scare without anything gory. I love movies like that. There aren't enough movies like that. So far, The Others and The Grudge are the best scary movies I have ever seen. As far as horror goes, I give this movie 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No offence to anyone who saw it and thought it was scary, but that was one of the worse movies i've seen to date. The acting was bland and the story was so lame it made me wonder why anyone would watch it. In my opinion it wasn't ever worth going to the cinema to watch it, like I, Robot it is all hype and nothing to back it. It should be burnt so that it doesn't offend anyone eyes. and the cast should be locked in a bunker for the rest of there natural lives for committing such a horrible movie to screen. If anyone found this scary i wouldn't be surprised if they were scared of there teddy bears, and sleep with the light on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's so many things that I want to just scream right now, scream at the top of my lungs. Unfortunately, most of these things would be inappropriate for this forum and must be watered-down for the sake of social values. GRR!Anyway, let's get right to it.This is a good movie. Don't be fooled and don't let anyone else tell you any different. In fact, I'll even go so far as to say this is EASILY one of THE best horror movies I've ever seen. Now I absolutely understand that this isn't exactly the popular view right now so for all of you that are cringing and trying not to kick things or hunt me down to "teach me a thing or two" - don't get'cher panties in a bunch. I'm gonna explain myself.I've heard and read a lot of things, bad things, about this movie. "Remaking Japanese horror movies is as big, and over-rated, as reality TV", "The plot is thin, or not there at all", oh and the WORST of all is "Where does the opening scene with Bill Pullman fit in?". Oi...First things first - I've gotta be honest with you. I've never seen 'Ringu' ('The Ring') OR 'Ju On' ('The Grudge'). I've heard great things about them and I'm sure they deserve it too but I have no interest in reading a movie. That's why I watch movies in the first place - so I don't have to read. ESPECIALLY when it comes to movies like this! Horror movies are, by nature, visually driven. If I'm busy reading subtitles to tell me what's going' on I'm not gonna get to fully enjoy the VISUAL experience intended to be had. Thus, let's take this really great movie and redo it in such a way that it will appeal to, and can be enjoyed by, more audiences (i.e. those of us that don't speak Japanese).And yes the plot IS thin. It's no different than any other horror movie out there. So what? It's a horror movie! It's not meant to win Academy Awards or make you ponder some of life's greatest mysteries. There's a whole separate genre for plot-driven movies. They're called dramas. Horror movies are meant to scare you and make you jump. And even if it doesn't make you jump there's something addictive about that rush of adrenaline you get when you know SOMETHING'S about to happen. It's fun! And who doesn't think that little boy is pretty creepy? Or the jerky movement that ghosts have taken on in horror movies of late? Gives me the willies just thinking' of it!And finally, if you don't understand the significance of the opening scene with Bill Pullman, I don't know what to tell ya. I mean I COULD tell you but, you should be able to figure it out for yourself.So to sum it all up, The Grudge IS a good movie. It's a GREAT horror experience that has plenty of creepy images to settle in your head for quite some time. You'll jump all up out your seat once or twice (or more if you're like my girlfriend). Just enjoy it. Don't try to make an epic out of it. Just...let it be, and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, an good horror remake. It's full of scary scenes and Sarah Michelle Gellar puts in a really good performance. I suppose the only bad thing about it is that it doesn't create much suspense to build up the horror and some of the stuff used has been done before, (But most of it is original).At the end it's left at a cliffhanger. Bring on Grudge 2, See this if you liked 'The Ring'.My movie rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say that this movie was 'confusing' is a little strange, given the intended simplicity of the plot. Annoying character development and redundant story elaboration were stripped away from this film, leaving a raw, visceral and uniquely terrifying horror experience.Simple storyline really, Professor Peter Kirk mysteriously commits suicide after discovering the mutilated body of a student he was having an affair with, Kayako Saeki, in her attic. Her husband had found out about her infatuation with Prof. Kirk, and in a rage murdered anything he could get his hands on before topping himself - including the family cat! Due to the brutality of the murder/suicide the entire house is cursed, and *anybody* who comes in contact with it faces a hideous supernatural demise from the hate-filled spirits of the deceased. It's just a matter of when and where. If you find cynical pleasure in pulling a film to pieces, arm-chair director style, then this film is not for you. The flaws are there, yes, but only if you choose to notice them. Personally I wouldn't visit a house that I knew was haunted at night when the power was out - but it doesn't really matter. These demons can strike anywhere. However, if pure entertainment is your poison then certainly give 'The Grudge' a late night sitting. Though try not to be alone in the theater. By the end of the film my breathing was ragged, my heart was racing and adrenaline was giving me tunnel vision - i couldn't tear my eyes or ears away!I'll never look beneath the covers again... 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just went to see it at 1:30 this afternoon. It is now 2:12AM, and I'm scared to go to sleep. Just reading these reviews makes me more afraid. But I do scare easily.Personally, I think the movie stole a lot of scenes from other movies. Near the end with the cut out pictures of 'her' face, I saw a fly. Reminded me of "The Ring". A bit before that, when the black spirit came out of the room in the hallway after the guard left, and the investigator was checking it, she was walking towards the screen... I expected her to come out, like "The Ring". A lot of scenes were taken from "The Ring"!It is indeed a scary movie, but you know when the scary parts are coming. The 'scary music' is a bit over-dramatic, and even a scaredy-cat like me was able to keep her eyes open through the thing because I was prepared for each scary part.The plot-line is SO confusing though. I didn't even understand it until a few hours ago. Maybe it just wasn't meant for a group of 14 year old girls.All in all, it is a good movie to watch, especially if you want to prove to yourself and others that you really CAN make it through a scary movie.I went with 4 other people, and I was still freaked out.I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been an avid fan of horror movies for the past 24 years of my life and when I read the negative reviews on IMDb about The Grudge, I was quiet shocked. I don't really know what these people consider creepy or scary. Not every "scary movie" needs to have a lunatic with a hooked hand running around "slashing" teenagers on a dark stormy night. Haven't we seen enough of those already? I saw The Grudge on DVD last night and It actually made me a bit uneasy, which normally does not happen. If you are looking for a lot of unnecessary blood and stupid teenagers running around, then this movie is definitely not for you. Its quiet a creepy movie and I'm glad that Hollywood is now actually exploring the actual theme of the word "horror" around the world for better ideas. I would highly recommend this movie to people who liked the likes of "the changelling". All in all, in my opinion, The Grudge is a very good horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This would have been a good movie if it answered more questions. Why did "Peter" throw himself in the beginning, why would the ghost go after the sister, at her job, at her apt? Why didn't Sarah Michelle Geller die when the old lady died. And many more unanswered questions went through my mind as the credits rolled by. I found myself yawning through some of the movie, and thinking of how many parts should have stayed out of the movie-because they just slowed it down and made no sense. Special effects were OK, but after watching them (ghosts) for too long, I started thinking to myself, "that looks too fake". I was very disappointed in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HEY!! This movie is a real hit! I mean MAN! They don't call this "The Grudge" for nothing. Since it was based on the same Japanese title: JUN-ON:THE GRUDGE! It was dark, sinister, and very twisted. First, Bill Pullman's character plunging off the balcony. The Result: A mangled-up mess.Sarah Michelle Gellar was outstanding in this movie. The creepiest part in the movie was the shower scene, where the hand appears at the back of her head. That was totally creepy in my opinion. Knowing for sure this movie is kind of equal to the 2002 horror hit, "The Ring". Unlike "The Ring", "The Grudge" was a little more intense throughout the whole entire movie. At the end, I would smell a sequel. Just wait and see...Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars. 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every few years, a new trend in Hollywood Horror comes out and everybody jumps on the bandwagon. In the mid-90s, it was Scream that started the trend of horror movies starring the hottest teen hunks of the day with plots that seemed to be self-satirical or one of the least important aspects of the film. Now, in the mid-00s, a new trend has emerged. In my mind it started with The Ring, but the true starting point is probably up for grabs.Horror directors these days seem to think that by throwing a bunch of weird, off-the-wall images and concepts on the screen, that somehow this will translate into a scary picture. Unfortunately, it does not accomplish this goal. While the shock factor may be high in movies such as The Grudge, as soon as the lights come back on in the theater, the fright is gone and I, as an audience member, am left unfufilled. That being said, The Grudge was not the worst of these type of films, and I thought it did have a few interesting plot points. I thought that the cop who was obsessed with the house was the most intriguing character, and Bill Pullman's character was also unique. Overall, though, it wasn't scary or fufilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies I've ever seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS BELOW**What's really sad is that Sam Raimi and Co. were REALLY trying to make a horror film, to scare us. I was anything BUT scared at this clichéd 'horror' film. You'd think that by now people would know the formula to a horror film: when the music intensifies something's about to happen. Some idiot is busy snooping around where they're not supposed to and ends up in a dark, secluded area...guess what?? Something's about to happen. You think seeing scenarios like these time and time again will instantly let on that someone's about to die, but no, I had to be in a theater with a bunch of silly teens who scream at every little thing. This movie could've easily went by another name: 'Follow The Trail'. What was the deal with having garbage on the floor and everyone just following the paper trail to their death? Yoko dying was one of the funniest moments in movie history, along with Bill Pullman falling from his balcony without hesitation LMAO. 'Honey, you're up early'...he slides off the railing head first to the ground LMAO! Too too funny. The only semi-smart person in this film was the cop, when he finally went to the house with 2 cartons of gasoline ready to burn the cursed house down. Too bad he was stupid to fall for the curse's trick. I don't know why he, or anyone else, didn't do that 3 years ago when the case first opened. And what was with the boyfriend? He saw what Gellar was researching, about people getting killed in that house and whatnot, but a light-bulb goes off in his head which tells him to go there by himself, hands swinging with NO weapon/protection of any kind to 'look for her'. Are you serious? Another favorite of mine is the sister who was haunted by the curse at her job LMAO! That was surprising; as I thought the curse was confined to the house only. She had her cowering like a little girl in her covers LMAO! Very funny stuff. What was even funnier, and led the movie more and more into utter comedy was the 'cry' of the curse. They couldn't come up with a better sound for it? That's some kid stuff that we used to do back in the day, trying to see who could do it the longest. How ridiculous!If you wanna have a good laugh, this is the movie for you. But don't expect a good horror film at all; it's laughable how the makers really thought they would scare people with this nonsense.** out of **** stars, because it's so bad its funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge is REALLY scary. I was petrified the whole way through. I actually watched it with my hand over my face (looking through my fingers) and would close my fingers at the scary bits which was LOTS. At one stage I took my hand down as things had gotten not as scary and THEN I got the fright of my life. However I still enjoyed it, it was way scarier than The Ring. Sarah Michelle Geller was quite good, but the actors who played the ghosts were the best. The lady who played the catatonic mother was really good can't think of her name though. So to conclude I was really terrified when I watched this movie. I don't know if I could watch it again when Its out on DVD or video not because it was bad but because it was so good i.e it was meant to be scary and it certainly was</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although S.M.Gellar only manages to produce two facial expressions in The Grudge - one being confusion, the other being surprise/fear - she doesn't really ruin the film, because it is not about her. The focus is on her supernatural buddies and they are scary as hell. By the end of the film, you're afraid to move and you realize that this one was actually much scarier than Ringu/The Ring. The other actors, like Gellar, do a horrible job (esp. her boyfriend - 'Karen, are you ok??y?!'), but that's a good thing, because it's the only way to divert yourself from the terror and giggle every once in a while. What it comes down to is this: if you want to see a good movie, rent Magnolia. If you want to have a good scare, go see this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wrote this review for English class, but I thought it would be appropriate here. I have never been scared by a movie in my life. I would be the ultimate test of a 'horror' movie's scariness. Ghosts, aliens, flying monkeys, and people who know what I did last summer never seem to faze me. I've sat through countless hours of supposedly 'frightening' death scenes and chase sequences without moving a muscle. It took me five years to find a thrilling exception to this. It was a remake of an award-winning 2003 Japanese movie called 'The Grudge'. This movie will make you concentrate on something seemingly important, then a character's world is turned upside-down and you find yourself tumbling with them. A great script draws you into the story so that the fear is always present, even when the setting is outside with sunshine and chirping birds. 'The Grudge' pairs an amazing cast with an interesting storyline, and gives you the scare of your life.It's not the best movie ever, but with Sarah Michelle Gellar, it's not quite as bad as it could've been. Definitely scary! (except after the third time...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the beginning of this movie ? the dark eerie sense haunted this film. It was creepy and would give quite the thrilling sensation.Sarah Michelle Gellar undoubtedly makes it BIG in this movie. Many people consider this movie to be a clone of 'The Ring'. Well that can be taken into consideration considering the fact that both are Japanese remakes, and both have Zombie like girls haunting people ? but this manages to make it quite independent form 'The Ring.' Though this was not exactly the scariest horror movie ? it is certainly acceptable ? however we would have seen a better audience reaction, if this came before 'The Ring'. All in all ? this would be a great recommendation for all horror movie fans. It sure to be one of the best movies this year.</fullReview>

Resembling parts of "The Ring" and "Sixth Sense", although not as good as those, it has it's moments. In fact, it had some very creepy moments in it. But I do have to admit that in some parts it was really hard to follow, and all the flashback scenes got old. Not your typical haunted house movie, although it takes a while to start to understand exactly what the hell is going on. One thing that I had trouble with was parts where the young girl(s) hear something upstairs, where it is dark and creepy, and they have to go investigate instead of getting the hell out of there.

		<fullReview>Ju-On, The Grudge. A remake with the same director. The movie is based upon a legend that if you die in a great rage, you will haunt the place you died in. People start disappearing in from this house in Tokyo and the police are investigating. That is the premise of this movie. I saw this with my Girlfriend and she was terrified. All throughout the movie She was holding on to me. I was sitting bored, watching a movie with plot holes, not so good acting, and a premise that was sub par. Then I was confused, the credits rolled, and the lights turned on. Could the movie be over? It couldn't be. I looked around for other confused souls, and sure enough, a man behind me said "That was retarded" I turned to him and said thank you.I want my 2 hours back Takashi Shimizu!!!! Frankly, this movie had no redeeming qualities. If it was scary, then where was my suspense. If it was good acting then why do I want to shoot myself to end my boredom? Bill Pullman had a screen time for all of 5 mins. SMG, while I do love her, could not save this movie. My advice: avoid this sub par movie at all costs.Oh, BTW if you liked the ring you will love this movie.HORROR/SUSPENSE 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for some chills and thrills, you'll get that from this movie. If you are looking for a story with depth and a compelling plot, keep looking -- this ain't it.---**********SPOILERS**********---The term that comes to mind to describe this one is "half-baked". It has a really good premise, but the writers, director, whoever let it fade into oblivion, which seems to be where all of these ghosts hang out until you get too close to their house. Then they follow you around.So, there is an evil stain on this house in Tokyo due to the violent deaths of previous occupants. At least we get to learn what the supposed cause of the violence was, but it lacks too much information to make you care. It certainly does not explain the death of the child. Furthermore, why does the evil venture beyond the premises??? The ghosts are indeed creepy and their portrayal will give you a hair-raising jolt or three. But what this movie lacks is a true counterforce to confront the evil a la the Exorcist. The police detective and Sarah Michelle Geller could have teamed up to find out what the root cause and weakness of "the Grudge" was. But in true Freddy Krueger, Jason and Michael Myers fashion, the unsuspecting are fodder and the strongly suspecting are too stupid to stay away.What is truly intriguing and yet annoying about these types of movies is that there is no clear limit to what the evil can do and no attempt to present a limitation. Hey, the ghosts can come and go when and where they want. They can fade to mist or present physical manifestations that overpower those of the living world. Well, perhaps I'm looking for order where none exists, but this omnipresence is overplayed in these horror movies. And I suppose that in the "spirit" of the poltergeist, these apparitions like to try out different forms of locomotion when stalking their prey just for the mind-prank.The chronologically disjoint threads in the storyline were a nice touch in trying to fill us in on the events leading to the current state of affairs, but we still have no real understanding of how "the Grudge" truly took hold.Unfortunately, if the plan was to bring that out in sequels like the unfolding of the alien creature in Alien and Aliens, forgetaboutit. My money will stay in the pocket for such an event.</fullReview>

But then people were talking about how scary it was so I said what the hell I got $8.50 and saw it with a few friends. After seeing that Sam Raimi had something to do with this I thought this would be a great horror flick. I was tricked it was a horrible movie. I sat through this wasteland for about 40 minutes and then me and my friends snuck into SEED OF CHUCKY. If this makes people sneak into seed of chucky then its a pretty bad movie. And I was right it was just like The Ring instead of a tape you saw the girls eyes and you die. Don't see it in the movies don't buy it just rent it if you want too. Don't get me wrong some parts were pretty cool. But overall it was a bad movie.2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring without the story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It must be said that there are two types of horror film. You can prefer the likes of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre with gore and guts or you can prefer the likes of The Ring with strange nightmarish moments. The Grudge walks down the line of The Ring and almost of the edge. I know this film will be criticised by those traditional horror fans who want some people cut up etc but in all honesty horror has evolved. It is much more original and effective these days to have complex camera work that actual scares people rather than grosses them out. The Grudge follows The Ring in so many ways it is untrue, however it does not enjoy the same success. The film does have scares which beat The Ring but lacks the storyline. Perhaps this is a film which just scraps the complex narrative in favour of a catalogue of scares. The intensely horrifying scenes seem to all derive from that final infamous scene from Ring where the entity exits the television set. Originating like The Ring from Japan the similarities are impossible to ignore. The jerky ghosts, the grainy images all are now typical of such Japan style horror. However this does appear to be a welcomed breath of life into a almost dead genre. Traditional slasher horror has truly ran itself out and now seems to just be replicating previous success's with films such as Wrong Turn becoming embarrassingly awful. So The Grudge may have a simply flawed storyline but at least it does what it is intended to do which is scare the audience deeply. In all the movie itself lacks some fundamental elements which firmly placed The Ring as not only a accomplished horror movie but a interesting story. Sarah M Gellar is weak in the story and is not complimented by the other actors and the audience never really emphasises with her due to jerky flashbacks and a split narrative. However this film does have very very scary moments and a strange noise (if you've watched the film you'll know what I'm talking about) that may become infamous among horror fans. In all I give two ratings for this film. General 2/5 Horror 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film just went off on one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what it is about this film, but just plain sucks seems to sum this film up in one. For something that was suppose to be scary it just really wasn't. Admittedly it made me jump in places, but that doesn't mean the film was scary. I know that most scary films are not going to be that realistic, but this film just went off on one. In every scary film there needs to be at least the essence of realism in it, however this film wasn't even close.I personally don't think this film is good at all, however, to some people I'm sure it is scary, I think that this film needs to be played by ear, if like me you are not easily frightened, by things that are just blatantly not real, then I would give it a miss. If on the other hand you are susceptible to this sort of film, its definitely one to watch.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More aptly, The Vengeful Victims Won't Move Out: Sketchy premise, scary execution.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prepare to be genuinely frightened, startled, perhaps terrified. AND that's accomplished with an absolute minimum of blood, guts, and gore. Instead, it is crafted with masterful technique, direction, camera work, and yes, even acting, that is truly nerve-wracking, from the expected moving shadows, reflections in mirrors, a glimpse of a hand or a leg, or a pair of eyes in the darkness. Brrrrrr. The great irony is that the gimmicks you anticipate, you get. BUT it STILL scares the beejeebers out of you.For the horror highbrows, this may be beneath them because there are so many instances of formula fear factors, but for those of us who do NOT go to many movies of this type, it was quite an effective creep-out. A 6'4" 250-pound man to my right was a basket case. The plot? Well, it's a disappointment, and no matter how hard I tried to form some logic out of the jumbled storyline, nothing really adds up to an overall, cohesive plot. I forgive the movie for this because it may be a cultural gap in movie-making technique between American sensibilities and Japanese, where they don't care whether the plot makes sense as long as it looks great and moves like a snake and makes you react. It certainly does do all of those things. Or, perhaps the "plot" problem is mine, as it is a Japanese story written by a Japanese author, and it is just too inscrutable for me rather than inherently incoherent...Sarah Michelle Gellar stars as a college student working for class credit by providing part time care for the infirm. When a fellow worker doesn't report in, Sarah is sent in her place. We the audience already know what's happened to her friend, but not until later do we get to see the grisly details.In a particular house where murder has occurred, evil continues. Who is doing it and why is where the plot goes south. A couple moves their mother into the house and badda-bing, she's practically catatonic. The couple, some police, caregivers, even a cat, fall victim to the convoluted evil that dwells in the house. In fact, on occasion the evil goes lurking elsewhere and rings doorbells, haunts stairwells, sneaks into bed linens, and apparently does so because the target of that traveling malice was in the cursed house at one time or another. As I said, the plot is not the strength of this movie. The execution is, no pun intended.There are flashbacks, an unrequited love psychosis heavy with stalking, noises in the attic and more than enough things that go bump in the night (and day), including some that cling to the ceiling and linger in closets and attics. Talk about the bogeyman under the bed.There are bits and pieces that are certainly lifted from other films, from The Shining (think bathtub), to The Ring (think people compelled against their will to do themselves in). But it's all still SCARY, SCARY, SCARY. If you like goosebumps, don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary. Last bastion of safety is vanquished.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I'm a man in my late thirties that watches a lot of horror films and do not scare easily. The last film to freak me out totally was Ringu, until watching the Grudge last night. This is the first time in about 20 years when I physically couldn't force myself to watch the screen because I just didn't want to see what was there. I can't believe people have seen this and thought it was 1) not scary and 2) funny. Its scary as hell, and "SPOILER" it removes the last place of safety for anyone scared and on their own: under the duvet. I bought the original Japanese version on DVD just before going to see this - at the moment I'm still building up courage to watch it. When I do, it will be during the day and I won't be on my own.

		<shortDescription>The only movie that has ever succeeded in frightening me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like to think of myself as a steeled, seasoned horror movie buff. From the tameness of most of the mainstream films (Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, etc.) of the 1980s, to the exploding-zombies/eating-brains Italian fare of the 1970s, to the best/worst of what Japan had to offer since they adopted the horror movie into their cultural identity, I thought I'd seen it all, until I saw The Grudge.It's really no different than many other horror movies, in that it's really just a ghost story. However, it's told from a vastly different perspective, making a very significant departure from the tired ghost story genre. Though the score kind of spoils some of the scares in advance by getting too caught up in itself, every appearance of Toshio and Kayako made me practically jump out of my skin. No movie has ever actually scared me before, until this one did. Just the way Kayako moves, like a cross between a shambling zombie, a dying fish, and a river of hair, she continually appears to devour her victims (or at least scare them witless) in the most unsettling way imaginable. And the scary part is that there's really nothing unique about it; it just works.I have seen the "Ju-On" movies, and they were scary enough, but not enough to make me jump, probably due to their relatively modest budgets. However, the American remake of those movies, with an ample SFX budget, really does it justice. Kayako has gone from tight close-up/lots of makeup to fluid CGI movements, though director Shimizu does stick with the traditional approach at times, which is perhaps what drives the Kayako character, making her into a kind of ultimate movie villain, even though she has no lines and appears for the visual fright aspect only.If you haven't seen the Japanese "Ju-On" movies, you might want to do so before seeing The Grudge, if only to provide a bit more backstory than The Grudge can come up with. All in all, The Grudge is an excellent movie, far from a clumsy American remake of a well-done Japanese original. It's a good movie to see on a date, especially if you or your date scares easily. If you're like me, you'll be half-expecting Kayako to slither out from a closet, or Toshio to be peering up at you from underneath your desk, for weeks afterwards. I give it 4/5 stars, if only for the non-linear storytelling employed by director/writer Shimizu and cinematographers Ettlin and Yamamoto.</fullReview>

There were some parts that you had to grab on to your seat and maybe jump once, but overall that doesn't make it scary and I don't believe I ever jumped in the movie.

		<fullReview>Quite simply, this movie wasn't scary at all. Maybe to teenage girls and little kids. The characters seemed really stupid and a lot of the stuff they did made no sense. I know that's to be expected in this type of movie , but this was ridiculous! The ending was kind of predictable as well. A lot of the "scares" in this were just silly. You could see most of them coming a mile away. I jumped once in the whole entire movie and that was at a part where they just threw one in at a very random time. The FX were OK, but they weren't anything outstanding. The acting was about what you would expect from this kind of movie. Overall I think it was a pretty poor excuse for a thriller. All seasoned horror fans should avoid this one at all costs. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under-rated genuinely scary film ***Minor Spoilers***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, lets get one thing straight, anyone who tells you they weren't at least mildly unnerved by this film is cheating you and themselves. I've been an avid horror fan for over 10 years and this is the closest I've ever been to scared. I'll openly admit that my experience of Japanese horror is somewhat limited. I've seen the US versions of 'The Grudge' and 'The Ring' and The Jap version of 'The Eye' and admit that so far the US versions are winning - quite easily, and this is thanks mostly to this film.From the first 10 minutes of the film, you realize that the story will be basic and I see no problem with this, after all its a horror film not a murder mystery! Man kills wife and child in his home, wife and child haunt the house and, anyone who enters it, until the point of death. So, if the story is nothing unusual, how does this film stand out? Well, it's in the way that the director 'bends' the rules of conventional horror films.For starters, if Jane Doe escapes Haunted House, she's safe, right? Not in this flick. The ghosts have just as much power outside the house and are instantly scarier for this. Also the fact that there is a part of the film, as scary as most others, which occurs in broad daylight! Daytime is virtually always perceived as the time when the suspense builds towards a moonlight fright and this simple twist of the 'rules' ensures that you won't relax at any point of the film. But for me, one simple aspect of the film proves the most frightening. I have always judged the fear factor of a film, not by the amount of times I jumped, but by the psychological fear it instills. Any film which features loud bangs or stillness interrupted by a quick movement could claim to be 'scary', but a film that has you looking over your shoulder is a rare thing. I wasn't bothered as much by the ghost of the young boy, who appeared, to be honest as a young Japanese boy wearing grey make-up, as I was of his mother. Although she appears as a middle-aged Japanese woman, her expressions at times appear to be not those of a human being. I suppose this is testament to her acting ability and the skill of the make-up department. This along with a haunting musical score and a throat-scratching noise which accompanies her appearance, make her scenes the highlight of the film.The scene where the detective is watching the security camera, is one of the most brilliantly terrifying moments in cinema history that I can think of, even now bringing goose bumps to my neck as I write this. The movement of the girl is strange on its own, but as she appears only as a shadow with no features, and as she walks past the camera out of view, both the actor and the viewer release a tightly held breath. ******SPOILER***************** Then the screen turns black and the two most piercingly focused eyes appear on the screen, and I swear they look right at you. This has as much affect on you as it does on the character in the story. This movie does share a lot in common with 'The Ring'. The impending sense of doom, the fact that there is no escape and even the appearance and movements of the wife seem almost identical to those of the girl in this other film, but The Grudge does have enough originality to be considered on its own merits. Whereas 'The Ring' builds steadily to one genuinely scary moment, The Grudge begins by scaring the hell out of you and never lets go. (Which is worse? The ghost behind the Japanese lady in the attic or the fact that you see her a split second before she does?) If I was to point out one criticism, it would be the ending. It feels almost as if the director got bored and decided to stick one last scare in, rather than give us a truly deserving finish to this surprisingly refreshing fright fest. 'The Grudge' does leave a few questions unanswered, but this strangely adds to the eerie feel of the film and should in no way detract from your enjoyment of it. I have yet to speak to a single person who didn't find this at least slightly scary or indeed enjoyable and I am still puzzled, even now, as to how such a tired genre and so many borrowed ideas could produce such a unique film.</fullReview>

To me it seemed neither, just a hybrid which didn't quite gel properly. It was based in Japan with mainly American actors, but I think it would have worked better had the original been left as Japanese and the remake been completely westernised. Sarah Michelle Geller's performance was unremarkable, but there were a couple of good creepy moments to take away with you, particularly the return of Yoko, and the scene in the office stairwell.</fullReview>

The direction and feel of the film is similar to "The Ring" but its not in the same league! Although its a Japanese story and its based on Japanese traditions its still your Hollywood thriller thing. It sticks dreadfully to conventions and if you want a mind twister this is not it. But to give the film its due, its a good film, and in places may actually make you throw your drink over you, ahem! There's a good use of shot on several occasions, apparently of SMG in shower, along with other more artistic shots and ring type shots.Its a good film, but if your not overly enamored with the genre, I'd wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

Sarah Michelle Gellar is an excellent actress and she plays a very convincing role. The scary characters{dead people} in the movie have brilliant detail to their horrifying looks. On the negative side their is no blood or gore in the movie. Some movie critics will think that the movie is not scary because it is bloodless. but do not listen to them the is a very suspenseful movie and it will send chills up your spine the the first twenty minutes of the film.

(I'm not joking!)Sarah Michelle G. IS a great actress, but put her screen time together and shes only in it for about half an hour - just as much as any other character, for example, Jennifer. She plays Karen, the Health visitor in Tokyo who's sent out to a spooky house. But, trapped inside is a curse which 'never forgives or never forgets!'

		<fullReview>This film is very clever. The Story is intelligently written, and the actors really perform to their full extent. The film is intense. The plot is very hard to work out at first, if you go to the film for a good murder mystery. If you go there simply to be scared, well you have gone to the right screen, trust me. The storyline is very basic: Father kills his wife, child and cat. They die in confusion, pain and in sadness. The three spirits haunt the house where they died, and everyone who enters their house dies, in the end. But they die the way the mother or the child or the cat died. Each victim is forced to die the same horrible death as one of these three poor spirits. The reason the mother/wife makes a horrible croaking, breathy noise is because her husband ripped out her jaw bone, so that she couldn't close her mouth when he was drowning her. Sarah Michelle Gellar, playing the substitute care worker, goes to the house to look after the old woman who lives there. Little does she know that there is three spirits living in that house who are out to avenge their deaths... My advice is to see this film. It's clever, interesting and deep. Plus it gives you an excuse to jump on your bf if u get scared :P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, and so many people who saw the movie were probably prejudiced against it from the very beginning, and so not able to enjoy it for what it's really worth. You've got to allow yourself to be scared, and be drawn into the Japanese city and the small, cursed house. This movie is actually quite scary while you're watching it, though the problem is that it doesn't have enough substance to leave a strong after-effect, like the kind that makes you keep your lights on at night. The acting isn't superb, and the characters are rather stereotypical, but that is all suitable for this kind of film. On the other hand the directing and cinematography are both very good. The suspense never lets up, though the movie's main flaw is that it reveals the ghost too soon and too often, and the ghost actually looks pretty comical. We fear what is unknown, and as long as the ghost is hidden from the screen we fear it.Overall an enjoyable and frightening movie, though there is nothing in it to ingrain itself in your memory and haunt your dreams (and maybe sometimes that's a good thing).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge starts off quite promising. It lays down little tid-bits of plot, teases the audience with a few false 'jumps' and then throws in a few shock moments to keep us on our toes. All standard Horror movie procedure stemming from the work done by the masters like Hitchcock back in the day. Unfortunetely the Grudge soon runs out of steam. Instead of building upto a finale and the bombarding the audience with terror and suspense, it just keeps giving little bits away until the end, when it abruptly finishes with little explanation. The plot (here be spoilers, sort of) is basically, people die in house while angry/scared, everyone else who goes in house from that point on dies too. That's all the explanation/plot development you really get.Some of the 'shock' set pieces are well executed, but its the same formula again and again and by the end of the film you know what to expect and it looses its impact. The character development is dire. Sarah Michelle Gellar is the 'star' but all we find out about her character is she is a nurse, she goes to a 'haunted' house. That's it. Most of the character development is devoted to the back story, leaving the main characters so underdeveloped that you don't care what happens to them.IMHO the first 45 mins were quite good, if the director had built on this and led to a big finale with a shocking/exciting/action/un-expected/gory (any would do) for the last 25 mins or so, I would have enjoyed this film. Instead we get a drawn out tale, constantly re-iterating the simple premise of the plot but never explaining how or why things are happening in enough detail to make the audience think. The result is by the time you reach the middle of the film you are bored to tears. This film is dull and not scary.I think this film had a lot of potential but fell short on the homestretch. 2/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost the perfect horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge is a film that starts as it means to go on - a man jumps to his death from the balcony of his apartment. As you might expect, it turns out that this man is, in fact, the key to everything. I'm not going to say exactly how, because spoiling the movie is never a good thing. I'm just saying, he's important. The Grudge is almost the perfect horror movie. It's scary, chilling, without being blindingly obvious (there's exactly one moment of obvious visceral gore in the entire film); most of the scares are subtle, based around a noise, a shadow, a brief vision of something lurking. Perhaps some parts are obvious in the sense of holding up a big neon sign that says 'LOOK! SCARY THINGS HAPPENING!' but somehow, I don't know how, but somehow it doesn't matter. In fact, it adds to the atmosphere. If you're dead and p*ssed, you're not going to be subtle once you've found your target. These aren't some wimpy chain-rattlers. They're dead as hell and they're not going to take it anymore. The Grudge is a truly creepy movie that makes the two films it's been compared to - Amityville Horror and The Haunting Of Hill House - look like Daffy Duck cartoons. Onto the actors. Sarah Michelle Gellar has, in my opinion, been pretty useless in everything she's done that's not Buffy, and she was often outdone by her costars in that. Until now. Her portrayal of care worker Karen shows cinema audiences for the first time the range that SMG is truly capable of. But it is the largely wordless Yuya Ozeki and Takako Fuji - as the ghosts - that steal the movie. They inject chills into the movie just by... opening their eyes a certain way, or opening their mouths. If you'll pardon the pun, the two Japanese actors are the spirit of the movie. Honourable mention to Bill Pullman as Peter Kirk, aka Guy Who's Fault Everything Is, Really.Of course, it's difficult to watch this movie - a Hollywood remake of a Japanese horror - without comparing it to The Ring. But apart from it being based around a p*ssed off dead person, there's not much to compare - there's an obvious rip-off homage to The Ring at one point, though - you'll see what I mean - but this is actually, as far as I'm aware, truer to the original movie's atmosphere than the remake of The Ring was. Oh, and by the way, if you still haven't "got" The Ring - she was evil before she died. Anyway, The Grudge is scarier than The Ring. The film's real weak point is it's backstory - I won't go into it, for obvious reasons, but basically it's about a jealous husband killing his wife. Standard Hollywood fare, except that usually the wife doesn't return from the grave and start - literally - scaring people to death. And perhaps we could have done with some more exposition to explain this, but, oh well.It's a very interesting film. And it doesn't end all happily, with everything tied up in a neat little package, which to my mind is a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing movie *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HeyI have some questions: SPOILERSWho found the throaty noises scary? Here when we were watching it every one was just laughing because it sounds like burping lol Seriously, out of 60 people about 57 were laughing. Unless someone with medical knowledge can correct me, that did not sound like a broken neck talking to me lol It was just amusingThe theory of the Grudge is that a "place is stained" then can someone PLEASE TELL ME why on earth the sister at the office was being pursued? Is it because she visited the place too? I thought the PLACE was stained and NOT the actual future victim.Also, how did the Japanese family members actually die? The flashback scene towards the end where SMG sees what happened wasn't very clear. It shows the father drowning the cat, if so how could the cat have been alive three years later making those annoying miaowing sounds??Either this movie was vague, or maybe some of us on here can't understand the little parts that actually mean something. I have seen other people posting views of confusion on here so I'd appreciate your views.RegardsNabsPS. I'm not a fan of subtitled movies, is the original any good?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>intensely scary - not for most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very frightening film - intensely so. It's like being on the fastest roller coaster. It will send you shivering in fear, and have anxiety go up and down your body.This is not a horror film for entertainment. And is thus, disappointing. The story is weird, as expected, but not very clear. Maybe you have to watch it for a second time to fully appreciate.However, the is a film not for the masses and it is a bit irresponsible to produce such a film. There are references to mental illness and watching it may feel like a psychotic episode of schizophrenia. It's not pleasant and you have to be a little insane to watch this film.On the positives, it is a very well made film, with good use of sound and special effects, and good acting. The film makers reach boundaries of human senses.But, this film will have audiences running and screaming out of theaters. It will be uncomfortable for the vast majority of people.If you want to watch an entertaining horror film, go see Dracula, or alien instead.As a film one may give it an 8 out of 10. But as an entertainment or experience, possibly 3 or 4 ot of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of the Grudge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the plot of the film, and you have what turns out to be one of the most visually frightening films I've seen in a long while. Reminiscent of David Lynch (lack of dialogue; long, dark shots to seemingly nowhere) and--naturally--the original "Ju-On: The Grudge", this was a movie that was provided no easy answers to any questions that it asked. What happens to the police investigator? Was there funny bidness going on with Bill Pullman and his student? I left wanting more, and instead of faulting the movie for it, I was excited to actually HAVE questions that I wanted answers to.One other compliment to the film was the lack of "jump-out-and-scare-you" tricks it used. Of course, they were there, but what was scarier: When Yoko actually sees the girl in the attic, or when she's turning around, lighter in hand, and YOU see her first?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read what all most of you Western patrons of the movie have said, I have to say as an Asian that they have been quite fair on the movie. Okay, at the time that the original Ju-On was being shown in theaters, I was still into Western and Korean horror(Tale Of Two Sisters, White Room, etc.) I was so not into Japanese horror. Well, Ju-On got such good ratings here, that I regretted not ever having given it the chance in the theaters. However the Grudge came on here, giving me a second chance to see it,and of course since it was gonna have foreign cast in it, I was more eager. Boy was I glad I sat down in the studios two days ago. That movie just made me wish I had chosen a weekend to watch it. The thing about Asians is that we got such imaginations, that we always are ready to for the scare when comes to these sort of movies. A lot of supposedly lame horror movies that have got received lame theater feedbacks in the West have received quite the opposite this side of the world. Overall the movie was really scary. Of course that has to do with the fact I was the only one sitting in the front section(5th row) of the movie-hall, while rest of them scaredy cats were all huddled in the back(even though when I checked the computer screen during ticket purchasing, a lot of the front rows had been taken). With no one but myself to brace for during the creepy scenes,I had my eyes closed almost half the time. Boy I think I missed a lot of the scenes, especially the scene where that Ju-On chick was giving us a view of her face on the security camera. Was it her or something else there? I never found out. The scene where the little boy opens his mouth and starts yowling like a cat when Peter was looking out the window was also creepy. As a result of this movie I've been sleeping with the lights on till 6:30p.m. for the past two days. That just shows how much realism this movie has. Just a few questions. Whatever happened to the Japanese husband? How come we don't see his ghost? How come Sarah Michelle Gellar is the only one that keeps getting those psychic premonitions of the past occurrences in that house? Are the Ju-On mother and child aware of each other's presence? They seem quite independent of each other in handling the scaring. Will there be a part2? I'm certainly keeping my fingers crossed on that one. Anyone who hasn't seen the film, got see it. It'll change your views of your ethereal surroundings completely. Believe me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Undeterred by the less than favourable reviews, I decided to go and see The Grudge. As I haven't seen the Japanese version I had no pre-conceptions and, save for the reviews and TV ads, not much idea about the story - was I going to be disappointed? This is one of those movies that critics hate (I'll never understand why that is), but the public at large give the thumbs up to. The Grudge is not your average shocker and not so obvious as to make it tedious despite a relatively simple script. Geller does a fine job of looking scared witless and the monster justifies all the tension the director builds. This is a very creepy movie ... completely undeserving of the slating that it has been given in the press - I give it 8/10 . Well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not really one for scary movies(had to have my ex-girlfriend with me to see this one) but I must say, this film was extremely scary! It scared the living daylights out of me and I know it scared her. I was a little confused about the plot though, however once the story progressed, it got a little easier. Overall, it was a great film for any horror buff(I'm not!) and they did open it up for a sequel and I'll be interested to see it. Out of 10 stars, based on fear factor alone, I'd certainly give it 10. So if you want to get scared, please go and see this movie. However, if you are a 15-17 year old girl, you probably won't be able to get in without an adult and you shouldn't, because you'll probably end up screaming your head off and annoying the rest of the people in the theater(there were several teenage girls who had to be escorted out of the theater for screaming). Have fun and enjoy! You'll jump out of your seat.Josh</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good, But Predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the movie overall was pretty good. Creepy and had some great visuals, but for horror buffs, it is very predictable with the usual jumps and scary music. Actually, it was the scary music that ruined some things for me because then you knew something bad was going to happen.As usual there were a lot of actions that didn't make much sense. Like why would Matt's sister run into a long, empty staircase after being scared by a noise. Why does everyone venture around the haunted house after hearing sounds? What would possess Yoko to climb up into someone else's closet with a lighter to investigate a weird scratching sound. Who does that? People looking to get killed?Then there are the plot holes, which I'm guessing maybe filled in the sequel (yeah, it's coming). Here's few:* What happened to Matt's sister, they never found anything in her apartment?* The police detective entered the house, what happened to him?*What about the real estate guy? He was touched by the entity.*Why was the Professor's wife dressed up and madeup like a hooker when Karen went by? You can tell by the photos of her that she's usually very conservative. Some deleted sequences perhaps?*Who pulls tape off a closet at someone else's house after hearing a noise? Who in reality does these crazy things?This movie was decent, not as good as The Ring (look out for the sequel). The whole Japanese atmosphere was unsettling and there are some great scenes and imagery that will make you jump (not me, but I saw others). Decent, but flawed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to keep this simple, because it's somewhat of a simple movie. If you enjoyed The Ring, you will enjoy this one. It's good for some suspense and screams in the theater, and it had my wife (and a friend's date) hiding under their coats for most of the movie.Nothing here that has not been done already, but it is a clean fun horror movie that probably works better in the theaters. Don't expect a great ending, and don't expect deep character development and you will have a good time.Sound and image quality were good, and some of the suspense scenes are right up there. This movie peaks a few times and gets you into it. Gellar was mediocre at best so don't go see this if you are expecting an Academy Award winning performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Didn't Care</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to a screening of Takashi Shimizu's "The Grudge" at the USC Film School. The screening also included a question and answer session with the Screen Writer, Steven Susco, which was very cool. I met Steven-- he is a great guy and talented. As context, Susco really adapted the story of Shimizu's "two" "Grudge" movies that were produced in Japan. In this American version of "The Grudge", Susco attempted to fill in some of the narrative or contextual gaps that plagued the original films-- which were otherwise very popular and successful in Japan. Susco worked with Shimizu on the screenplay, and Shimizu also directs this remake of his original work. As part of the post-screening discussion, Susco related a story involving the reason for a certain character making a particular sound. We then all realized that reason was not revealed in the movie-- which was very annoying. Realize this is taken contextually. The other rather interesting insight, was the point of view that in Japanese horror movies as opposed to American, the protagonist does not necessarily find a resolution in Act III. That maybe an oversimplification of Japanese culture, but it is an interesting point. Even with it's shocking opening sequence with Bill Pullman as Professor Peter Kirk, and his wife played by Rosa Blasi, "The Grudge" does it's very best to scare from abrupt sounds and sights, and creepy imagery. The production values are solid. I suppose it is all scary, but the fact that you never have an emotional investment or affinity for the lead character is truly scary. In this the movie ultimately fails, because you never really care about Sarah Michelle Gellar's Karen Davis. Her Karen Davis is a university student in Tokyo who is caught up in perpetuating curse or "grudge". She is thrust upon this fate when she substitutes as caretaker of an ailing and aged woman, whose family are also Americans living in Tokyo. Shimizu and Susco interleave flashback and visions to explain some of what happened. In all of it, Gellar's Karen comes off as the complete "victim", and there is nothing really heroic in her actions. This is where "The Grudge" really didn't work for me. Granted this not really Gellar's doing, and more a pitfall of the story-- there is nothing courageous in the fight. And if hopeless was the intended message of this movie, then that is disappointing and not at all inspiring.</fullReview>

The story seemed very similar and the actions and movements from the central theme characters just seemed too much the same. I suggest anyone who hasn't seen The Ring, should! It's better, plus you'll see the closeness.Horrific images etc etc to me were taken from the Exorcist. Who else was just waiting for the characters' head to turn around anti-clockwise??Final Destination speaks for itself. See that film, and The Grudge becomes just about predictable.

		<fullReview>After reading some of the reviews posted here before going to see this movie, I felt I was about to go see a bad-to-mediocre ghost story that, while creepy, had no genuine scares.I was pleasantly surprised.Whether you find this movie "scary" or not depends on what types of situations tend to get under your skin; with me, it was the idea that the movie played out almost like a nightmare at times that got me rattled. The movie did not disappoint in the visuals department either, and is one of the more atmospheric movies I have seen recently. For me, it was money well spent.Note: Pay attention in this movie. A situation will develop in the movie, and then the movie cuts to another set of scenes that explain how that situation came about. There is NO indication when this cut happens, so you will get confused if you aren't prepared for this. Some of the people that didn't "get" the movie probably fell victim to this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not scary, but funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is one of those movies that are so bad that they just start getting funny after awhile, the greatest moment of the movie was when the mommy ghost pulled a classic loony toons move (she was in front of Gellar's character, then Gellar backed up opened a closet, and the ghost popped out behind her) some of the effects were pretty good, like Yoko's ghost/zombie looked good and creepy, but the movie failed to give enough plot for the visuals to be able to be scary beyond the initial shock factor. I also liked how they did the one ghosts hair, but yet again, it's just good visuals. I like a movie that can give you a reason to be scared after it's over (i.e. The Exorcist) The Grudge was totally dependent on cheap shock horror, and left you with nothing after the credits started. It was mostly horror eye candy, there wasn't much to it. I'd give it a 4/10 just because I liked it visually.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Standard haunted house shocker with a few neat shocks."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An American exchange student (Sarah Michelle Gellar) who is studying social work in Tokyo is asked to substitute for a nurse who failed to show up for work. Her task is to go and look after an elderly American woman (Grace Zabriskie) who is in a permanent state of shock. Inside the house, the young student hears strange noises from upstairs. Her curiosity leads her to the discovery of a young boy taped inside a closet. The boy is in fact a spirit who is responsible for a terrifying supernatural force that possesses the house and frightens and destroys anyone who goes near it. Several lives are lost before she can discover the truth behind the evil goings-on.Japanese director Takashi Schimizu remakes his own horror film, "Ju-On: The Grudge" with the financial backing of American producers. The emerging picture is your standard haunted house shocker and by today's standards it is pretty tame when one considers the level of gore our eyes have been assaulted with in recent times. Unfortunately, Sarah Michelle Gellar is lacking the dramatic range in order to make us fully sympathise with her plight, but I'm sure that her acting talent will increase when she gains more experience. However, the picture does manage to deliver a few neat shocks that will have audiences shuddering in their seats and once the complicated script gets going, it delivers it's plot twists with a fair amount of skill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel this film was fantastic. Although this was based on another film Ju-Un. I didn't feel Clea DuVall and Sarah Michelle Gellar were in the film long enough. I mean Clea is a fantastic actress and should have been given more time to develop!! I feel that this film was a great example of Americian and Japanese Horror Genre mixing together which I thought went very well together. Of course it was amazing how it developed and a lot of JUMPS. This film is a definite everyone who loves horrors and jumpy films go and see this. They definitely couldn't have picked better People to be in the film.Sarah Michelle Gellar's character was good but not great I think it didn't involve her enough. Jason Behr's character didn't really have many lines which was a shame as he didn't get to show off his amazing acting talent. Clea DuVall was amazing for the whole 10 minutes she was in the film!!!! She wasn't allowed to show her full potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was hard to expect anything more than horrible movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is technically a lame version of "The Ring". The movie seems to consist of one scene repeating itself. We see a girl coming into the house, she gets killed. We see a couple coming into the house, they get killed... We see another guy coming into the house... he gets killed. And then we see some other people coming into the house, guess what happens to them...Actually this movie has a couple of jump scenes, and i'm glad the makers didn't try to do any plot twists, or twist endings here... they just made this movie to get a quick buck. I respect them for telling us ahead of time that this movie is gonna completely suck, by putting PG-13 rating on it and giving Sarrah Michell Gellar lead role.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horro film for stupid people with no imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing 'Saw' i was expecting another brilliantly clever film which required me to think. However i could drift in and out of this movie without feeling I've missed anything. This film isn't very subtle to say the least and is very predictable. I find the way that the camera holds on a particular shot just to show that if anyone still hadn't understood what is about to happen can be told by their friends and still have time to see (or actually not see) someone being killed or attacked by kid with an annoying face. Every scary moment is repetitive and they haven't done anything i haven't seen before. I also find the inclusion of big Hollywood actor to create the illusion that this film is good rather funny. I can't say i have seen buffy the vampire slayer, i probably wont after that performance.This film lacks any charisma, and if i had a ten year old son then i would be saying that he could do a better jobdon't watch this film, go see 'saw' if its still around.0/10</fullReview>

Lots of JUMPY parts, the atmosphere is flawless. Sarah Michelle Gellar is very good in her role as a American nurse working in a "crused" house in japan. She finds her self at the mercy of forces beyond her control when she discovers the the secrets and the chilling past of the family who lived there, and who ever enters...will do so to their on peril! When "odd" and yet "terrifying" little boy is found in a closet.....then thats when everything goes wrong....People call this THE RING knockoff, but this is far from the truth THE GRUDGE is much better and made before the ring was ever made.9 outa 10 It really is worth seeing, i bet you, you will jump more than 3 times watching this film. If you want a great horror, go see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Financially astute ! Also..Not nearly as bad as "The" Ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not bad at all, in fact. Like a great many people, I'm always suspicious of the artistic motivation behind re-makes, but Shimizu's been hacking away at this little gem for a few years, so the guy should certainly be allowed his big US cash-in on the very finest horror movie of all time. This is essentially a greatest hits compilation from the 2 TV movies and Japanese theatrical releases with the bland (but financially astute) addition of Buffy to pull the mainstream punters. The plot will possibly (?) confuse first timers a little bit as,despite being more conventionally linear than Ju:on , the story is shifted around so that there is only a limited exposition of what actually happened in Kayako's family near the end. Still, nice to see one wonderful scene re-instated from the earliest incarnation of the series (I'll just say the word "jaw" here), and the other bits done reasonably well, although the climatic moments and the shower scene just don't quite seem to have the oomph of the real Ju:on. Kayako is as frightening and compulsive as ever (has her voice got deeper in this one though ????) and the American characters are just as silly as the ones they replaced in the original with the famously daft "hiding in bed" scene re-done here for example....Hopefully this classy "summary" film will encourage more people to seek out the originals (ideally to demand them back in theaters), although I suspect that, as with "The" Ring, some will prefer the mildly processed cheese cover version.Grudge 04 is a worth addition to the series (though buy no means the best) and should provide a great deal of well deserved coinage for all involved to continue scaring the Kayako out of us for a good while to come. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I understand that this is a remake of a Japanese film, but either that story sucked or they remade it so bad that they should be fired. There are so many things that never got explained and it was so slow that I was about to go crazy. Other than the occasionally points in the movie that make you jump, there is really nothing that is scary at all. My other problem is how did Sarah Michelle Gellar get this role, she is horrible. KaDee Strickland who played Susan was awesome and they gave her crap to work with as a role. Due to this film I have now decided I will NEVER go see a Sarah Michelle Gellar film again. I know she is a name and can bring the studios money, but come on so can any pretty blond girl in Hollywood. PLEASE do not waste your money and see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love it how most people here claim to be big time horror fans but never venture out any further than some retarded sequel to Jeepers Creepers or something like that. I think if your going to rank on a film but down at least 3 points of references of films that you actually thought were good before you act like you have a valid point. I myself, am obsessed with horror films. I watch them all and 95% aren't worth it. For anyone to say they are bigtime horror fans you would have to venture out to foreign cinema since right now there really isn't anything good coming out of the US lately.Anyone that goes to "the ring" references really doesn't know Asian horror. Even in the movie Kwaidan long black hair has its place which was made ages ago. Its always been associated with decay and death and is pretty creepy in itself. Any movie that uses it is not automatically a rip off. Most people associate The Ring with this film since its probably the only two Japanese born films they have seen and the fact that unlike most horror they use technology as tool. Most Asian horrors have that formula some can be called rehash but others have their own places. I don't think these two films are alike as much as the movie "Phone" or "One Missed Call"( both OK films btw) have ring similarities. I don't think The Ring was as good as Ringu even after seeing The Ring first. I think with horror you have to weigh the pros and cons and see if your happy with it after the fact.The original theatrical release of Ju-on was nothing special in the lines of plot and pissed me off at the end but I still liked it. My girlfriend wouldn't go anywhere upstairs without me and the second film I think she screamed for a minute straight from Ju-on 2: The Grude. Just like "The Blair Witch" it effects people differently. For people who have seen any version of this film before your going to be jaded since any version you see first is going to be the scariest or what have you. I don't think you can compare it when you have a remake which half@ssly combines the TV and Theatrical Japanese versions yet still manages to be confusing. I don't think it had the umph but I do think it has its own niche with people who haven't seen it since it is better that most of the crap out there. I would take the US remake over Saw anyday.horror seen lately:Hypnosis :great ending nice pacing and plot Saw :only for amateur horror fans The Grudge : good if you haven't seen the Japanese versions but only one scene done as well as the original theatre version(the sister) Tale of Two Sisters : Now that is a story told well try and pick that one apart you anal peepsrecommendations:Kairo Ravenous inner senses the eye the shining the thing the others audition</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effectively scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Possible Spoilers*A lot of people are going to argue with me on this one, but I thought 'The Grudge' was pretty damn scary. Granted, I'm kind of a fraidy cat, but I'm generally a wuss when it comes to scary imagery and general creepiness; and 'The Grudge' was full of that. Directed by Takashi Shimizu (who also directed the original Japanese version 'Ju-On: The Grudge'), 'The Grudge' is about a bunch of Americans living in Japan who all come across a house that is cursed, thereby cursing themselves. It starts with an American couple who move in with the husband's mother. After the caregiver for the invalid mother goes missing one day, Kare, (the horribly vapid Sarah Michelle Gellar) a nursing student, takes over for the day and the fun begins.'The Grudge' is told in a non-linear style, which is somewhat confusing. It is hard to tell how much time has passed between events. Also, there are a couple of things that are either left unexplained or inconclusive (the fate of the meowing child three years ago comes to mind). However, when you take 'The Grudge' for what it was meant to be, a spooky/scary film, it is certainly effective. Combining surprise scares with creepy imagery, Shimizu not only threatens to scare the pants off of the viewer, but threatens to have you wet them first. Unfortunately there were a couple of shots that were ruined by being featured in the trailer, such as the meowing kid and the now famous 'shower scene', but there were some things that surprised the hell out of me and caused me to take issue with going to sleep that night, especially in my bed. And that is probably the best thing about the film; as Hitchcock did forty years ago with 'Psycho' (and no, I am not remotely comparing 'Psycho' or Hitchcock to 'The Grudge' or Shimizu), ordinary or 'safe' places were no longer safe in 'The Grudge'. If the house is cursed, why should anything happen outside of the house? Right? Wrong.No, 'The Grudge' is not a bastion of superb film-making or even a great horror film, but it is effective and did what it set out to do ? either scared some people (like me) or made a lot of people have a hell of a lot of fun at the movies (everyone else who saw the film with me). I feel that the mission was adequately accomplished, and therefore, I give it a 5/10.Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with a couple of my friends and they were terrified. They clung to each other throughout the film. I also heard screaming about ten times in the movie theater, which is a first for me. This is a very scary movie, and in the number and intensity of creepy moments, I think this beats the Ring. However, the Grudge doesn't develop characters much and it's not very mysterious. They hop around with the characters, connecting them all with the evil cursed house. So there isn't much on what they're like, and you don't really care about them personally. They also do some stupid things. If you're going to an evil house that plays tricks on you, and you know it, you probably shouldn't investigate any sounds. Especially if you're there to burn the house down. By the end, the people just seemed incredibly dumb. But, not many horror flicks have intelligent characters, so what did I expect? There isn't really much mystery in the movie, either. You can tell what's going to happen because everyone just dies. But, you get to see most of them die, or about to die. There is some blood, but it's not focused on that. It's just the totally helpless feeling that you get when you come face to face with an all-consuming evil. Ooh. Anyway, there isn't much to the story. The commercial says most of it. And if curses really worked like that, I think that the human race would have been wiped out by now. If you want scary, you should see this. If you want a movie that makes you think, this isn't it.</fullReview>

By the end of the movie (which I almost left), most people were talking and completely bored.The films biggest problem was its shock, or lack thereof. NOTHING was scary. NOTHING was frightening. For the most part, the attempts at scaring the audience, which included popping the same face from some inane direction, caused irritation, rather than fear.Bah, just trying to write a summary about it makes me relive it and be bored again. Enough is enough. Gellar, go back to Buffy if you want to make something scary...this was not a good movie.</fullReview>

There are some decent jump scares throughout, but other than that it's pretty much your standard haunted house story. Except this one's set in Japan, a choice which I cannot understand at all. It made all those gaijins stick out like sore thumbs and I kept wondering what Ted Raimi was doing in Japan. The writing was sophomoric, the acting was uninspired and the direction felt like a Japanese director doing an American version of his original Japanese story. It ended being the cinematic equivalent of Yoshinoya Beef Bowl. Not Japanese or American enough to be any good, it takes the worst elements of both and combines them into a $2.99 Teriyaki Chicken Meal. Five stars out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring, only without water...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But it is a little better. The Americanized 'The Ring' was tempered down enough to make it more palatable for US audiences. 'The Grudge', I can only assume is the same way, yet by staying more true to its original roots (including keeping the director of the original), it packs a few genuine shocks into what is basically a weak and hole filled plot.Plot line is fairly simple haunted house type stuff. A family lives in this house, father one night kills wife and child in a rage and according to Japanese legend, when a person dies in a sorrowful or rage filled condition, their energy stays behind. Flash forward three years, a young American couple, his mother and sister all move to Japan, and all step foot in the house. All three are subjected to the ravages of the curse. Enter a young Japanese health care worker, and she too falls victim to the evil within. Then enters Sarah Michelle Gellar's character, a young transplanted American who fills in for the mysteriously missing Japanese worker (of course, we all know what happened to her) and becomes aware that something is wrong. During the course of the rest of the film we're treated to basically a flashback sequence that explains the story of the curse, how it ties in and how SMG's character fits in. Director Takashi Shimizu has created a beautiful and wonderfully atmospheric film, the cold creepy look and feel offer much in its favor, but the weak story doesn't hold up to the many questions it leaves unanswered. Acting here is decent enough, not outstanding, but I can't really complain about anything either. Bill Pullman in particular is good as an American professor who figures quite prominently in the story. Far too many unanswered questions dot this film, yet when you're sitting in a dark theater in the heat of the moment, 'The Grudge' packs enough creeps and shocks to make it worthwhile enough.2 out of 5</fullReview>

You finally understand it. If you don't really get the movie.. then you don't really like the movie. I laughed throughout the movie while other people said it was scary. The eyes just didn't look real enough to be afraid. And the kid's mouth is sooo round.. it just doesn't look natural. If it looked more real, I would've been scared. Some of the things that happened, like the hand, and the bed thing. I just don't believe Ghosts or anything can do that. But I like how the general idea. I do believe that if people die in any kind of strong emotions. it would make them want to stay. But the thing I also didn't like was all the dying. Sheesh!!

		<fullReview>Now, lets review scary... Texas Chainsaw Massacre was scary in 2003, but that was then, right before the Ring came out. That was the first Japanese movie to come out in full charge. Not many before succeeded as well. The Ring started a whole line of extreme horror films, such as: When Darkness Falls, The Village, and now The Grudge.The Grudge wasn't anything you haven't seen before, to be honest. It's not just scary, it's Japanese scary. Most American made films don't compete against Japanese films, they just don't, sorry to say. They think everything through, knowing that we won't understand. Then when we watch it, and see that half of it is in Japanese, we become confused and don't believe it's a good movie. The Grudge was a cry for attention really, to compete with the Ring.5 out of 10, nothing good, nothing bad. Very scary, but is becoming redundant. There will be a new horror film out soon trying to take this movie over. It won't be too hard, seeing as the ending for The Grudge made all the faces of the audience scrunch up in a "what the hell" sort of look. Go find out why, but do not expect your money back after sitting through the whole thing.Worth seeing when bored, or wanting to scare a friend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a horrible waste of my time and money. This is not a movie. It's a scare fest. I will admit that it did make me jump. in that aspect the filmmakers succeeded. If that's all you're looking for, great. Go see this movie. However, Do not expect a story or a plot. This film tells you what it is right from the start and then nothing happens for an hour and a half. Excuse me, People die, that's all that happens. The editors try as best they can to disguise the lack of a plot by playing with chronological structure. They failed. There is no twist, no turn of events, no revelations, no conclusion, no surprises and no character development. This film could be cut down to 1 scene and make as much sense as it does. The beginning pullman scene is never explained. the film just uses jump scares and suspense sequences. I might as well have paid a guy to sit in a dark room with me and scream "boo" for an hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly flawed, but still a very creepy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Dreamworks came out with The Ring, and I saw the trailers for it (my favorite teaser trailer was when they showed only the scene with the mom standing on the edge of the cliff and then throwing herself off..chilling, especially when it ends there and then goes to another commercial), I knew right away I wanted to see it. I own the DVD and I LOVE that movie. The same goes for The Grudge...I knew right away from the previews that I wanted to see this movie...BAD! I'm sure you're familiar with Grudge's storyline: an American girl living in Japan goes to a house as caretaker of a woman who is so driven out of her mind, she barely ever talks. The house, once the scene of a violent crime, is haunted by a dead woman and her dead son. Now, here's where the flaws come in: while there are no hard and fast rules that can be applied to ghosts, it does kill the effect when the ghost repeatedly appears in a physical form and looking relatively normal (this refers to the little boy). It's even more dissuading when the ghost is shown coloring in a coloring book. At one point in the movie, he moves around and is touched and spoken to as if he were alive. It kinda hurts the whole "ghost" effect.However, the other ghost more than makes up for it, and the first half hour or so of the movie scared the living hell out of me. I think I jumped harder than I ever have before, and if you've seen it, you may be able to figure out which scene it is that gives viewers such a delightfully good scare. All in all, The Grudge is just what we need: a VERY good, VERY creepy ghost story that aims more for the psychological instead of trying to go for the gross-out. If you want the latter, rent a Freddy flick. (Although, it IS pretty creepy what happens to the original houseaid, a young Japanese girl). With that said, I gave The Grudge a rating of 8. It was very good, but I have to admit that The Ring was slightly better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AHHHHHH!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The audience, though at times a bit outlandish, made this movie the scream-fest that i knew it to be. It is not, under any circumstances, a date movie. If you think that getting close during this flick will earn you a night in the sack you are dreadfully mistaken. In truth, you may never get into your own bed ever again. The film work is gritty and dark, reminiscent (as many have noted) of The Ring or more properly Ringu (Japanese Original) due to its location, cast, etc. But back to the audience. I went with a number of friends (girlfriend included) and was instantly aware that in the crowded theater there were no more than six or seven audience members who were taking the flick seriously. Bill Pullman's surprising (albiet short) role leapt from the screen, however the seriousness of the his actions seemed lost on the loud, obnoxious and generally stoned audience as surprise gave way to laughter and jolly George Costanza-esque roars of "Thats gotta hurt!" and "You know he's dead." But this was just the first five minutes. As the reels flipped on laughter and jokes gave way to terror as people literally leapt out of their seats, shrieked at the top of their lungs and (as far as the poor little girl next to us) burst into tears. Needless to say I left the theater in high spirits as the ending left little to the imagination but made my lighthearted attempts at manly bravery far easier to pull off. (A bit on the ending: Is it possible, i mean at ALL possible, for any horror movie to end without ripping Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins' famous "I wouldn't hurt a fly" final scene?) Unfortunately, I went home alone that night but brought with me the remembrance that even if I die in some horrible act of violence...I can still come back and dish out a few gut-wrenching screams to anyone unlucky enough to meet my wandering spirit. Good flick, catch it in theaters for sure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Horrified</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate horror films. And this movie is a classic reason why. Throughout the film I was forced to peek at the screen through my hands over my eyes. This movie may also be why my husband loves horror, as I was clung to his arm and practically sitting in his lap the entire length of the film. As as writer I give it about a 6 out of 10, an actress about a 7, and as a critic of direction a 10. There was nothing in this film that I can say I didn't like, except the nightmares it (literally) gave me for a week after. I cant say for sure, but I don't see myself visiting Tokyo any time soon, as I am sure that Asian ghosts are much more terrifying than our regular old spirits in the US.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad horror movie at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy a good horror film now and then and this one was certainly not the worst I've seen. Although predictable (and I haven't seen the original Japanese version so that's not why!) it does deliver some shocks and the evil Japanese kid or whatever it is, was quite disturbing at times. The weird cat-like noise was pretty annoying though and nothing was ever really explained. I left the theatre thinking, 'okay, but why?' Why did the kid thing want to kill everyone who entered the house? Why didn't all the police officers who entered the house get killed? Why would anyone buy that house after hearing something moving in the attic? I know I wouldn't! For that matter, in horror movies in general, why do people always go into dark places on their own with only a lighter to investigate strange noises?! Anyway, all in all, this film made me think twice about emigrating but that's about it. If you don't watch many horror movies but want a good scare then this is for you - as long as you don't spend too long thinking about all of the plot holes it's a good film. And as always, Sarah Michelle Gellar puts in a stellar performance as the heroine. Although you can't help but think "Go on, kick the big bad's a**!" Sorry been watching too much Buffy....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sarah Michelle Gellar stars in this, the fifth time the Ju-On tale has been told, with the original writer/director crafting his spooky tale for a western audience. The film introduces us to a house where something happened, causing spirits to haunt it. Anyone who enters the house will soon die, as the curse gets to them. SMG plays a student social care worker who is assigned to look after an old lady in the house. Creepy, atmospheric, chilling, and excellent use of camera-work and sound....that was the Japanese version which was out earlier this year. This remake unfortunately lets itself down by using the Hollywood conventions of building music to let us know something is going to happen, blaring noise to make us jump (why, I don't know), and tricky/jumpy camera-work to add a disturbing edge to the film...thus dampening the overall effect.The camera-work is the biggest problem. One brilliant scene in the original, of the female spirit crawling down the stairs showed the full journey step by step. Here, we see her at the top, a quick glimpse at the middle, then she is at the bottom (whilst rising music tells us we should be scared). The scene loses the whole effect in making it so quick. It isn't a total failure. Like The Ring, it is better than most of the usual garbage Hollywood churns out these days, and is a reasonable translation of the story. It's just that once again the essence of what makes Ju-On so chilling has gone. This is even more distressing when you remember the original creator was in charge. WHy did he change his vision so much? Why did he decide to go conventional Hollywood? Above average, but a letdown at the same time. Go watch the original instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems Like a Ring to Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First please allow me to preface this whole commentary with a bit of information: The Grudge = the Japanese "Ju-on" = The Ring = the Japanese "Ringu". Now what that equation excellently illustrates is how some good Japanese horror can always be remade to make millions on the American market. Not that I'm complaining though. I thought "The Ring" was one of the best horrors in the last few years. But unfortunately for "The Grudge", it couldn't leave well enough alone and decided instead to "borrow" elements from "The Ring" and introduce it as its own. Specifically, the film has the whole Samara-from-the- Ring-bit down to a fine science, complete with the hair over the face, super-white flesh, and that strange jerky fast-forward walk (scares the hell out of me!). It then uses some good gore, a scary cat, and your classic demonic child for accompaniment. So you see, The Grudge is far from original. Even the story, about a possessed home where its owners died a horrible death isn't original. Despite this, "The Grudge" does manage to deliver some pretty powerful scares. Classic mounting suspense is delivered well and creepiness overall is excellent. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) does good on the big screen as a victim of the supernatural. She still seems just a little too cupcake to me though. You know what I mean? I couldn't rate this movie poorly despite its robberies simply because it does have some good jump-out-of-your-seat material. I wouldn't want to watch this film alone. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally I'm getting tired of the whole suspense fad going on. The Sixth Sense, Signs, and the Ring were all pretty crappy in my book. But the Grudge was actually really good. Though casting was a dud, ( Gellar is a blonde waste of skin), the suspense caused many outburst in the theater. I saw this with a group of girls and they all freaked out throughout the movie. With most suspense films you see when the scare is coming. In the Grudge, it comes out of no where. Random face shots of the ghost freaked me out at some points. This movie is what the Ring shoulda been. THis ups the level of suspense needed in films now. All and all, id recommend this to any scary movie junkie. 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Grudge" is a film about a house with a curse. Someone died in that house in the grip of a powerful rage. Now, their spirit is confined to that house, making it it's goal to kill anyone who enters that house. This is very ironic. It seems that "The Grudge" has fallen to a the curse of entering Hollywood. It could have been way better than it was had the director played his cards right. (He also directed the Japanese version. I don't understand what happened.)This is one of the better horror films I've seen in a while. It was somewhat original. Its SFX were alright, but it could have been better. The acting, mainly from Sarah Michelle Gellar, was far better than I expected. It's just right for the season. I love Halloween! 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge, from its preview of course, seemed like more than a waste of money. Another one of those movies made to scare teenage girls into the flesh of their boyfriend's arm, but luckily The Grudge is not this. It is, however, not a new concept; it is fresh, though. There are more ghost/revenge/curse movies than any of us care about. We should care about this film and its ability to take a genre and without adding anything new present a tired cliché that can still provide quality fright. The Grudge does this indeed. Should this say something for Japanese cinema? I believe so. It seems these days horror films in general ask for more and more gore to makes us cringe...we are after all a desensitized society now. Before I get off on a tangent no one cares to hear--The Grudge is well worth seeing in theaters. It is well worth a library slot too. Praise, 8 of 10 (it's hard to have such a short movie be worth more than that.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An original and a Flawed Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oddly enough, I've just found myself having seen both the original Japanese and American remake versions of 'The Grudge' and the experience is a very strange one. Watching both within days of one another is like seeing what happens when you look into a kaleidoscope after you find out how one works: you know that it's only mirrors reflecting off of one another that make the patterns that form the image even as you are aware that there is a simplicity at the heart of the thing that may tell you that there is less here than meets the eye.In it's original incarnation, Takashi Shimizu's, Ju-on: the Grudge, like his earlier movie, 'Ringu (in the U.S. remake, 'the Ring)' is a bold and effective shocker that demonstrates his deep understanding of genre, image, audience and technique. His talent is very great in the Japanese original--it shines through in the Hollywood remake--but what springs from it may be an acquired taste.Ju-on, is an anthology of terror tales that stem from various people entering a house in which a passionate multiple murder had been committed. No spoilers are necessary and none are possible. That is all there is to the movie;. there is no sex, no love interests, no conflict and almost no character development (long before the action and subtitles allow you to figure out someone's job description, they're toast). In fact there is no meaningful conflict to speak of at all. In this sense, Ju-on's tales of terror aren't really tales at all--at least not 'tales' in any sense that a class in fiction writing would impress on you, because in order for you to have a tale, you have to have a character with known qualities struggle against something (here: death in a state of absolute terror) and either fail or succeed--win or lose. Ju-on's writing skips over the sense that the victims--who, by the way, pile up like chord wood--ever had a chance, or that they had the presence of mind to look for one.On the other hand, Ju-on doesn't require a plot to be effective. Shimizu's sense of image and his smooth injection of Japanese Ghost Story imagery into a modern setting is genuine, fresh and original. Japan has a longstanding love affair and a very well-explored style of the supernatural, with literal centuries of artwork devoted to nightmarish imagery. Japanese ghosts and spirits are otherworldly in senses that are alien to western traditions and the Japanese notion of haunting in fiction and traditional tales is often more intense than its western counterpart in that it is more open.Better still for shocker junkies, Shimizu redefines and modernizes his traditional ghost images for a twenty-first century setting in subtle and exciting ways: in Ju-on: the Grudge, Shimizu's ghosts are spirits of terror and malice and nothing is more appropriate to this than murderous spirits that are aware of security cameras or that make otherworldly sounds through their victim's cell-phones. It's touches like this that show that Shimizu's depth of imagery goes far beyond mere recitation of what for him are well-understood themes, and this goes far to make up for his terrific lack of plotting--both in his original Japanese work and in the U.S. remake.The American remake in theaters at the time of this writing, 'The Grudge,' is an attempt to capitalize on the cult following that Ju-on: the Grudge has found in the west while at the same time adding and subtracting those parts of the original that a Hollywood audience finds least comfortable.To this end, the U.S. version, which, like the original is set entirely in Japan, tries to make up for what a Western audience would see as lacunae by adding five things:1. A focus in the story on an instantly recognizable U.S. movie/television star ('The TV series, 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer's, Sarah Michelle Geller) as Karen.2. A romantic interest in SMG's boyfriend, a student3. A set of scenes meant to give an understandable and palatable reason for the gigantic malice of the spirits in question.4. A much bigger special-effects budget.5. A plot.The results are mixed. Instead of playing on the original's strengths, by keeping and perhaps even broadening the original's anthology format, the U.S. version tries to fill up time with extended character development (in people who've got less than ten minutes of screen-time to live) and by focusing on SMG running around Tokyo trying to learn about the house and its mysteries.By rewriting the original to play to a Western style of writing movies, the writers and producers take a big chance. By eliminating the point of the original movie's writing--an episodic exercise in generating a body-count--the powers that be behind the remake drop the main attraction of Shimizu's original which can be expressed in by the words 'sheer volume.'All in all, I find the original a lot easier to watch than I found the remake. I like Sarah Michelle Geller, but after years of watching 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' it's hard to accept her in the role the movie gives her.4.5/10</fullReview>

And the supporting cast was great, too- good move putting in Jason Behr as Karen's sweet, oh-so-attractive boyfriend. And it was great to see the always-talented, often-underrated Bill Pullman. As for the movie? I'm never scared when I see horror films. But I screamed out loud several times during the film (something I've never done). The cinematography and special effects were great- not your average gory/bloody horror film. I give it a nine out of ten. If I hadn't shown up late to the theater, I probably would've given this film a higher rating. But I wasn't that late, so I still understood what was going on.</fullReview>

Or, better yet, go out and see a DRAMA if you want "pristine storytelling".I will make an incredibly long story short--THIS MOVIE CREEPED THE UTTER HELL OUT OF ME. And no, I am NOT one who "scares" easily by horror films. Usually, I find them intriguing and humorous (hence, I decided to go check this one out for some Halloween fun)--and boy, was THAT a mistake (in a good way, mind you ;)).I was not only shaken, I was downright DISTURBED by the images the director presented to us. Freaky and bizarre, it seemed he never, EVER gave you "a rest" where shocking moments are concerned. Once the spooky stuff in the film strikes, there is NO turning back.And these are images that literally haunt you LONG after you leave the theater. Plaguing your mind with paranoia and uneasy thoughts as you lie in bed at night. I am in my mid twenties, and let me tell you, the "night-light" made it's first appearance again, in years.'Lo and behold, THAT, my friends, is why this is SUCH an effective horror film. Genuine eerieness and threats of turning your "places of safety and sanctuary" into your worst nightmares--the stuff bad dreams are made of.I will end by once again saying that GOOD *horror* films are ones that SCARE you--not impress you by their intricate story lines. Because we all know, if those "stupid people" never "went back into the house"....there would be no story at all, would there?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Semi-Satisfying Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So here we have a new trend in Hollywood: remaking Japanese horror films with American actors. The only problem in doing this with The Grudge, is that they couldn't really just redo it word-for-word like The Ring because the story is so open-ended that it wouldn't have been 'well-accepted' by American audiences. I have seen the original Grudge, titled Ju-On, and was a fan of it, mainly because it incites so much discussion because it's confusing and erratic. These are actually good things about that movie though because you really 'choose-your-own-ending' in your mind.Now in the American version, we have a very neat, pat, and, somewhat disappointing, ending. The scary images of the original are still the same and I really enjoyed the directors' cool horror shots. The lightening and sound effects are just horror movie perfection! Still, the story was just lacking something for me and there isn't much to discuss when the movie is over. Out theater was full of teens though who actually SCREAMED during the film. It's been awhile since I've heard actual screaming, so it does provide some good terror. I know I jumped as well. If you're a fan of horror, I'd say it's worth the price of a matinée.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being one who doesn't scare easily, The Grudge did a decent enough job.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't watch a lot of Horror. The little bit of "Horror" that I've seen hasn't really scared me.I did see The Ring and I thought it was pretty well done, freaky, twisted, and spooky. But it didn't scare me or fill me with terror.The Grudge didn't either, but I can easily see how it would.As opposed to The Ring, which was built more around terror and a storyline, The Grudge is largely a series of jump sequences and shock-factor shots. Some are extremely cliché, others will catch you totally by surprise. If you like a movie that scares through these tatics than you should enjoy The Grudge.If you like the way The Ring scares you, you'll be disappointed. This isn't a slow-paced terror flick. This is a Halloween fright-fest.And it definitely has it's share of haunting images...The story is crap and the characters are crap. The setting isn't very good and it feels very familiar to other movies and shows. It has its similarities to The Ring but the average watcher won't notice them.If none of the above bothers you, go for it. It's a fun little film that might get you the spooks. If you are a big horror buff, I would say it's worth a matinée (sp?) just to see a few of the cooler and more unique parts.I would give it a 5/10, and that is being generous, but that's because I'm not a big horror fan. It felt just too familiar and predictable.</fullReview>

And SMG was great, breaking away from Buffy and showing utter terror on her face without having to scream (anyone can scream). I highly recommend it, although, try and go either real late or real early,I had way too many teenagers in the theater acting like asses, and screwing up the scary parts. I will certainly go see it again before it leaves the theaters! I am a Buffy fanatic, but it was nice to SMG do something else.

The acting could have been much better, but wasn't totally horrible. It really seems to me to be one of the usual, bland, fad-horror movies that don't really deserve to be called horror.

		<fullReview>* No Spoilers for The Grudge * * Spoilers for The Ring *I have read a lot of the reviews here on IMDb stating that this movie really lacks story in compared to The Ring. This isn't true. I didn't actually see The Ring until after I saw The Grudge. Some friends and I watch The Ring over Halloween weekend and I was surprised at how "not scary" it was. A friend there who had never seen it described it as "extremely intriguing" but not scary. Other than the creepy video (which really isn't that creepy compared to the one in Ringu) and dead girl's body in the closet at the beginning (which really sent chills up my spin), the movie didn't give you much of a fright until the very end. What it did give you though is spoonfuls of story -- just handed to you -- one little piece of investigation evidence at a time, until the characters and the audience understood exactly what happened. In the Grudge, it's the opposite. The Grudge scares you constantly and doesn't spoon-feed you the answer. Its there -- I thought it was obvious. Apparently a lot of people on IMDb didn't though. This movie is exceptionally well done with the Raimi brothers probably loving every minute of it. Did I mention that the movie is scary?Long-short of it:The Ring = Very good, Very Intriguing, Creepy The Grudge = Very good, Intriguing, Very Creepy* Personal Experience - No Spoilers *I saw The Grudge with a friend. We went in with the sun not quite set. There were some really good previews for some upcoming movies. I think 2005 may be a very good year for film. The Grudge started and the audience was nearly screaming in terror for the next two hours. I think I had a big smile on my face the entire time for some reason. I remember thinking to myself that I refuse to close my eyes at any point. I really wanted to experience the entire film as it was meant to be. My friend had her head in my shoulder for most of the movie. Did I mention the movie was scary? So, here's the really funny part. When the movie ended, that theater cleared out so freaking fast. I don't know if there was anything during or after the credits but no one in the theater saw it. We bolted out of there, my heart was pumping very fast. I felt like I just spent two hours on a roller-coaster (literally). We drove across the street to McDonalds because it was open and really well lit. The place was nearly empty and we were standing around waiting for our food, looking over our shoulders and at the windows to see the reflections, just all sorts of stuff like that. Anytime a door opened we both bolted an eye in that direction. I'm sure the workers thought we were going to rob the place or something. It took me many days to get the images out of my eyes. Still today, sometimes I get a little nervous to open the closet or something. More friends and I are going to go watch it again this week. It won't be as good the second time around, but I will keep an eye on my friends because that can be just as entertaining.* Fin *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this last night. I went in prepared to be scared, or at least chilled. Instead I was totally disappointed and ended up laughing more than gripping the armrest. I'm really surprised by all the positive comments people are leaving. To each his own, but the movie I saw sucked so bad I have hickeys all over me. I guess I'm one of those wacky folks that wants a story to go along with the creepy music and spooky tar-mouthed baby ghosts. Otherwise it's just not scary or interesting. First of all I had a really hard time caring about the deaths (or lives) of any of the cardboard characters in the movie. I know that's not generally the point in a horror movie, but this is no slasher flick - it's in that "art/horror" genre where there's usually a little bit of character development. None to be had here. Didn't give a crap about the idiot sister hiding under the covers or anyone in her family or Sarah Michelle Gellar's wet-noodle boyfriend. (SMG did a great job with what she was given, but I would really love to see her use her talent in a good movie next time).And I'm all for suspension of disbelief, but if you're going to spend the time to come up with plot developments, then I really think you should resolve them somehow. Case in point: (Spoiler) The jaw of the caretaker Yoko was removed by the dead woman. Why? Oh, no reason. It just was. Oooh scary...And I wonder if the story line about Bill Pullman could have been any more vague and one dimensional. And why was his wife dressed like a drag queen when SMG goes to visit her? But the worst problem with the plot is the heart of it.(Spoiler) Any person who dies in a fit of rage causes others to die in that same place. Now, let's think about this for a second. Wasn't the HUSBAND the one in the fit of rage? Not the wife, not the creepy little boy. The wife was the cheater and the one who betrayed her spouse. She was probably terrified and not thrilled about getting murdered, but it doesn't make sense to say she was in a fit of rage. She was the victim. So why is she the one coming back to kill? It doesn't make any sense. Also, the plot was just boring. We're told that anyone who goes in the house dies. Then they all do in fact die. No contrast, no challenge. Just a bland carte blanche death sentence to all who enter the house. Blah.The movie a had a few good points. Some suspenseful moments, etc. But all in all, I and my friends (who are easily frightened) were pretty annoyed by the movie. I think the girl in the back of the theater last night pretty much summed it up when after the last scene she yelled, "Oh HAYL no!"It was that bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has a terrible habit at the moment. They take great Japanese horror films, relocate them, put 'stars' in them, and obviously strip away all the subtitles. 'The Grudge' has the edge over recent US remakes here as it only stumbles into one of those 'dumbing down' pitfalls, placing Sarah 'Buffy' Michelle Gellar into the heroines role.The story goes that the Japanese say when a person dies in terrible circumstances they hold a grudge and take revenge on anyone who comes into contact with the place they died. A young mother and her child were murdered by the mothers jealous husband in a house in the Tokyo suburbs. Three years later the house is rented out to an American couple and the husbands invalid mother who have come to Tokyo for work. They hire help to look after the mother, but the first girl that arrives disappears after her first visit. Her replacement is Karen Davis, a foreign exchange student (played by Gellar) in need of a Social Work credit.The film still takes place in Japan, and it still has a lot of subtitles. The story is almost exactly the same as the original 'Ju-On : The Grudge', and the set is exactly the same, using exactly the same house as the original. The Japanese actors have been re-employed. This all begs the question... why? I assume Hollywood still has a misconception that the Western cinema-going public won't go to see a film unless it stars someone they "know". The suits should look at the success of films such as 'Hero', 'City of God' and 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' to realize that this is not the case. If a foreign film is good enough the suits should give the public some credit by giving the original film a full scale mainstream cinema release. I am hoping other studios take note of Miramax doing just that with 'Hero' and in future follow their lead with foreign language films.Back to the film itself. The story is reasonably good if you haven't seen the original, and the director (Takashi Shimizu, the director of the original) manages to steer well clear of the usual US horror clichés and cheese and delivers a solid genre film that relies on creeping tension rather than gore to deliver its shocks. Hollywood take note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This move is perfect for the halloween spirit. If you are going to the movies and want to watch a scary movie this is the one. You have to watch the movie under one condition....DON'T EXPECT A PLOT. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat. It was full of those startling moments that make you jump. Of course there is no plot and of course you are going to say that the ending was less than perfect but at least you will get a good scare. Most horror movies lack plots, but are good for a scare. Horror movies are meant to scare you and this one will. It is nice having a horror movie that doesn't involve some physchopath trying to kill everyone for revenge. If you are looking for a scare and not a masterpiece watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Scary Movie In Awhile!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read bad reviews of this movie, and I don't understand it. This was probably one of the scariest movies I have seen in awhile! It is probably the best horror movie released in awhile, in my opinion. My problem is that most horror movies add to much humor to ease the tension..........but most, recently, add way to much and the movie becomes more of a comedy. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;For Example&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; "Saw" ,which I just saw yesterday, was a waste of money and time. Very humorous movie, which it wasn't meant to be."The Grudge" was suspenseful (although I will admit.....predictable). Almost every person in the theater jumped several times throughout the movie. Lots of screams were heard from the audience. And my hand held on to the arm rest a few times.And as far as the ending goes.......... (although I have read complaints about it) ............ I loved it! It was an eerie ending. It wasn't a happy, the day has been saved, BS endings!!! It was a realistic ending, well as realistic as can be for this type of movie.I will admit that this film wasn't flawless. And there were a few things that didn't really make sense. BUT, all in all, this was a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I enjoyed this movie. Throughout most of it I was peering at the screen through my hands afraid to look.The plot of the movie took me a while to get and i still was confused by the time i left the movies. It started out with no explanation and kept on flashing back and forth between the present and the past and i found that overall complicating.The suspenseful music and expressions on the Actors/actresses faces really added to the movie. The way the movie was mostly done in dark/ depressing colors was excellent.I will admit though that the characters acted kind of stupidly. If you hear a "scary" noise most people would not go investigate it and most people would not stick their heads in the top of a dark closet with only a lighter as light.Overall it was good and I give it a 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I have to say that I didn't see the original TV movie, so I didn't know what to expect. This also means I had nothing to compare it to, so my opinion is not tainted by comparison.What did this film do well? It's scary. Let's face it. There were some very chilling scenes that got you right to the bone, and even though you may see them coming, when your fears become realized on screen you can still feel your heart rate will certainly jump.What did this film not do well? For this viewer, there was no character, no attachment to the people we see on screen and the backstory was (again, in my opinion) rather thin and somewhat generic when you step back and look at the bigger picture. Plus the ending simply wasn't satisfying enough.All in all, a good chilling scare-fest that often makes you jump, albeit a bit thin at it's core. Scarier than most Western attempts, anyway. I'm sure the original Japanese rendition is better (as usual?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grudge; ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The GrudgeAn American nurse living and working in Tokyo is exposed to a mysterious supernatural curse, one that locks a person in a powerful rage before claiming their life and spreading to another victim. Sarah Michelle Gellar portrays Karen. A remake of a Japanese movie with the same name, I thought this movie was pretty good. It wasn't as creepy as the trailer made it look but it still had a few good scares. Sarah Michelle Gellar is always good and the rest of the cast includes Kadee Strictland, Bill Pullman, and others. There were a few cheap scares but the realistic scares made up for it. Kadee Strictland has a good scene in which she is terrorized by the grudge.I, unlike most of the nations critics, liked her in "Anacondas". Bill Pullman is a waste in an unnedded role. A lot of scenes include flashbacks with not much purpose.The one major thing that made me give this less that ***1/2 was the ending, if you could even call it an ending. It doesn't even end. It has no explanation and tells nothing about its after events. It's almost like the writers fell asleep while writing it and then forgot to add an ending.Overall: Despite confusing flashbacks and some cheap scares, "The Grudge" does make you jump plenty of times and has an interesting plot, a good cast, and some good scenery.The Grudge; ***PG-13; disturbing images of violence and some sensuality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see The Grudge with 2 of my friends. I never heard of the movie until they took me to see it. Personally I've never been a big fan of horror movies, but this one was wonderful. True enough the plot wasn't to good, or as good as it could have been, but come on. Who's paying attention to the plot? I was trying to catch my breath and get some feeling back in my hand that had fallen asleep gripping my friends arm. From my standpoint, (which during the movie was a terrified one), there didn't seem to be a whole lot of non scary parts. I'd have just screamed, and then low and behold the music starts up again. It was a movie that left me on the edge of my seat and my eyes closed. (I'm guessing that was the point.)I recommend this movie to everyone and give it an 8/10!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power of Sarah Michelle Gellar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, The Grudge was well done. It was different yet extremely frightening. Yet the reactions to this movie are varied. The terror comes from an intense psychological assault. As this movie comes from a different culture, this has caused confusion for even a great reviewer like Roger Ebert. There is, however, one thing that we can agree on. Without the great Sarah Michelle Gellar, this movie could not have succeeded. Throughout the Buffy years, her movies, and her appearance on the 2002 MTV Movie Awards, she has shown that she can do it all. She can project the entire range of human emotions through her acting, she can dance and sing, she is an accomplished comedienne, and she is willing to take risks.The amazing attendance during the first two weeks of The Grudge show the power that Sarah Michelle has at the box office. Recent Oscar winners like Julia Roberts, Halle Berry, and Gwyneth Paltrow could not begin the take on the range of projects that Ms Gellar has taken on. When will Hollywood begin to offer Sarah Michelle the scripts that she has earned and deserves?She is exquisite as well as talented. All hail Sarah Michelle!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically an American remake of the recent Japanese film JU-ON, this works best on reduced expectations.JU-ON made points with its atmospheric backdrop and retreating narrative line; THE GRUDGE contains more outright scares, but also makes less sense as a plot. When a young housewife (Sarah Michele Geller) reluctantly goes to Japan with her architect husband, they land in a house that hasn't been inhabited for several years. Needless to say, it's haunted by spirits who seem particularly malignant, carrying the "grudge" of their awful fate to anyone who lives there.Various people associated with the house meet grim fates, mostly frightened to death. There's a sinister black cat, a winding staircase that's a ringer for the one in THE EXORCIST, and other devices that might lead you to think you've seen this film before. However, this doesn't detract from the simple fact that THE GRUDGE is creepy and great fun to watch. The locations give this a special flavor as well. If you just want to enjoy yourself at the movies with a box of popcorn, this unpretentious scare-fest just may be your ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary and disturbing... a bit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie left me in a mess. On one hand, I was relieved it is finally over. On the other hand, I found myself enjoying it - more than that this low-budget-no-special-effect-what-so-ever pop-up scared the hell out of me. And I watched it during the day in my living room hearing all them strange noises coming from everywhere around the house. But, seriously, we have a traditional movie, where a mean spirit takes lives of humans and turns them into tortured souls. And we get a rather original way to see this guy in action through his minions hunting down and kidnapping their unfortunate victims.This movie has as little talk as a Landscape channel, lots of eerie music, scared people walking around and creepy shadowy spirits lurking nearby. Certainly not a 90 min run.The Grudge is a mix of Ringu (original) and They (about closet people), but no blood, no violence - just plain fear of something supernatural and menacing.In short, I'd suggest watching this movie at home around midnight with all lights off. That's what I am gonna do after watching Darkness. But for some really powerful Asian horror I'd pick - Battle Royale, Ringu, Parasite Eve and my most favourite Old Boy.Oh, the rating - just go and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost in translation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always wary of remakes.More often than not, they're never as good as the original. I'm even more skeptical of foreign filmmakers who agree to remake their movies for an American studio. It sounds like a good idea to keep the original director, but just as Hong Kong filmmakers John Woo, Ringo Lam and Tsui Hark were forced to water down their action film-making when they came to Hollywood, foreign directors seem to lose their artistic integrity when remaking their films for Hollywood. Remember what happened when George Sluizer remade his 1988 film, "The Vanishing," for American audiences five years later? He turned a brilliant psychological thriller into a pedestrian Hollywood film and tacked on a happy ending, to boot.Nevertheless, I was eager to see what Japanese director Takashi Shimuzu would do with his remake of "The Grudge." There are two things initially going for this film. One, despite starring American actors, the story remains in Japan, thereby creating potential to tap into differences in horror mythology. Two, "The Grudge" remake opens with a doozy of a scene involving Bill Pullman.Alas, after that, there's really nothing much more to this film. Part of the problem could be that while Shimuzu's original was rated R, the remake is PG-13. Japanese horror films depend much more on creating an eerie atmosphere than loading up the gore. It's a great device, since they often prey on our fear of the unknown.But this film does not tap into the cultural differences between America and Japan and does not delve into the psychological traps that each culture's folklore creates. True, there are some genuine shocks in this American remake. But none of the characters is very interesting and, despite its origins, "The Grudge" turns into just a typical Hollywood horror with characters doing dumb things like sticking their heads into dark crevices to find out if there's anything in there. You want to hazard a guess as to what happens? There's also a character who winds up in an office stairwell, hears strange noises and promptly yells, "Is anyone there?" In the history of horror films, has there ever been a reply to that question?The biggest disappointment with "The Grudge" is that Shimuzu and screenwriter Stephen Susco reveal the story's terrifying monster early. Once we've seen it, there's no more reason to fear it. So while the characters all seem scared of it, for us, the terror's more laughable than scary.The nonlinear structure isn't distracting, but it seems more gimmicky than anything else. And the horror scenes appear to work outside the story - you could easily shift the frightening scenes around in any order and it wouldn't make any difference to the plot or film. The movie's most terrifying moment belongs not to Sarah Michelle Gellar's Karen, but to KaDee Strickland's Susan Williams as she's tracked from her high-rise office to her apartment."The Grudge" spends so much time pretending to be scary that it loses much of its edge. The monsters aren't all that frightening once we see them and, after a while, I just wanted Gellar to turn into Buffy Summers. She wouldn't have put up with all this nonsense. She'd have just kicked the crap out of them. And that would have made the film a lot more entertaining and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly I have to say that I am pretty surprised and saddened to see the negative response that this movie has received from viewers on this site. Not that ANY other of the thirty or forty films reviewed by viewers here has had anything nicer said about it.The Grudge packs a serious punch in the supernatural thriller department, and has enough shock effect to put a little white in the knuckles of even the most brazened horror critic. Those who liked 'The Ring' will most likely love this film.I can personally attest to the fact that it scared me a hell of a lot more than 'Poltergeist' or perhaps any old horror film besides 'The Exorcist'. Bottom line? You should just go spendthe money and make up your own mind.</fullReview>

I had psyched myself into being scared way before we even got to the theater. But as the movie started, all I could do was laugh. The whole movie is full of corny effects, and a very confusing, twisting story line. The usage of scaring methods was scarce and it was incredibly obvious what was going to happen. It all played into the "staying home alone/going down dark halls/being so curious that I must investigate EVERYTHING instead of saving myself" category of things. I was shocked at how amazingly stupid the movie was. Not only was the horror so unbelievable, but the story line and use of flashbacks was ALL over the place! Don't waste your money on the movie, I PROMISE you that you'd be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My daughter and I were excited about going to see this movie. However after the first 10 minutes of the movie we were ready to go home. The movie had a very dull and slow outcome. If there was supposed to be a story plot, we didn't see it. It seemed like the content of the movie was edited for T.V. The best/scariest parts of the movie were shown on the t.v. previews. We thought that Ghostbusters was scarier and had a better plot. At the end when one of the inverstigators was in the hospital and said that they were able to save the house, that made us think that there was possibly going to be a second part to this movie, if that is so we highly recommend that you don't let that happen because it would be a waste of time and money. The second movie would be nothing but the same boring things happening to different people. So in conclusion we thought the movie was a waste of our time and money. IT SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had potential. I did not expect it to live up to 'The Ring' but I did expect it to be scary. It started off strong but then died. The ending not only left room for a sequel which I hope would be a lot better (more elaborate) but it seemed too intentional as if it was only setting up for a sequel if you catch my drift. I think had another hour been given to the film to elaborate upon the story and the characters it would have been a lot scarier. The film also left a lot to be desired and too many questions left unanswered with those all too unfamiliar with the non-pop part of Japanese culture, such as the spiritual importance to the film, along with the concept of collectivism in the culture.I do plan on seeing Ju-on: The Grudge (the original Japanese version) and I hope it is better than this American version. As for the story behind it, it was wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Supernatural Chills...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly I have to say that I am pretty surprised and saddened to see the negative response that this movie has received from viewers on this site. Not that ANY other of the thirty or forty films reviewed by viewers here has had anything nicer said about it.The Grudge packs a serious punch in the supernatural thriller department, and has enough shock effect to put a little white in the knuckles of even the most brazened horror critic. Those who liked 'The Ring' will most likely love this film.I can personally attest to the fact that it scared me a hell of a lot more than 'Poltergeist' or perhaps any old horror film besides 'The Exorcist'. Bottom line? You should just go spendthe money and make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It makes me giggle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was...WOW. I am HORRIBLE with horror movies but agreed to go see this movie with my friends, just so I could spend time with them. I had psyched myself into being scared way before we even got to the theater. But as the movie started, all I could do was laugh. The whole movie is full of corny effects, and a very confusing, twisting story line. The usage of scaring methods was scarce and it was incredibly obvious what was going to happen. It all played into the "staying home alone/going down dark halls/being so curious that I must investigate EVERYTHING instead of saving myself" category of things. I was shocked at how amazingly stupid the movie was. Not only was the horror so unbelievable, but the story line and use of flashbacks was ALL over the place! Don't waste your money on the movie, I PROMISE you that you'd be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My thoughts about the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My daughter and I were excited about going to see this movie. However after the first 10 minutes of the movie we were ready to go home. The movie had a very dull and slow outcome. If there was supposed to be a story plot, we didn't see it. It seemed like the content of the movie was edited for T.V. The best/scariest parts of the movie were shown on the t.v. previews. We thought that Ghostbusters was scarier and had a better plot. At the end when one of the inverstigators was in the hospital and said that they were able to save the house, that made us think that there was possibly going to be a second part to this movie, if that is so we highly recommend that you don't let that happen because it would be a waste of time and money. The second movie would be nothing but the same boring things happening to different people. So in conclusion we thought the movie was a waste of our time and money. IT SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Given another hour it could have been better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had potential. I did not expect it to live up to 'The Ring' but I did expect it to be scary. It started off strong but then died. The ending not only left room for a sequel which I hope would be a lot better (more elaborate) but it seemed too intentional as if it was only setting up for a sequel if you catch my drift. I think had another hour been given to the film to elaborate upon the story and the characters it would have been a lot scarier. The film also left a lot to be desired and too many questions left unanswered with those all too unfamiliar with the non-pop part of Japanese culture, such as the spiritual importance to the film, along with the concept of collectivism in the culture.I do plan on seeing Ju-on: The Grudge (the original Japanese version) and I hope it is better than this American version. As for the story behind it, it was wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few shocks...thats about all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie with two female friends and must say that I was disappointed with it. The other reviews have given a detailed response as to why the movie was lacking. (i.e. the plot was poorly explained) But...I will say that the movie contained a few points at which you had no choice but to jump from shock.While the movie was far from scary I would recommend seeing it due to the shocks and unintended humor. (The "scary" scenes often ended up having the theater in laughter)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge , Not bad the only problems were a few holes in the character and plot development. Overall if you liked the ring you'll love the grudge. but if you want something more you should go see "SAW". The grudge has tried to americanize itself and for that i applaud. The next one just needs to work slightly better on the character backstories. The world loves when we start to get to know a character and feel like they are a friend of the family and bam a dark mysterious stranger rips their heads off. We as a audience need to feel like we know the victim to get sucked in the movie and feel like were part of it. That is the best way to scare the living hell out of people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge was creepy, sure, but as far as any really gripping characters or story? Forget it. Somewhat like The Ring with its weird supernaturals that kind of jump and shake and pop out of nowhere, but the difference between the 2 films was that, in The Ring, you CARED whether or not the main characters died or not. In The Grudge, you have no clue what or why anything is going on and it's truly hard to care. It was more just a good "BOO!" than a good movie. Not worth the $8. Too much creepy, not enough story.Out of 10, I would give it a 2... Because the creepy stuff was all right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A creepy experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie made my skin crawl! I think it scared me as much by what it didn't show on the screen as by what it did. This film is proof that what is scary isn't necessarily gore and guts and boogymen per se, but rather one can be scared by reaching into the mind's repository of fears. It was nice to see Sara Michelle Gellar break out of the Buffy persona and take on a different character for a change. Jason Behr is sexier than ever as Doug. I sincerely hope that a sequel is being considered, since this move was part of a series in Japan. Oh-- and that creepy sound scares the hell out of me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The viewing experience in "The Grudge" is almost identical to "The Ring." In neither movie is there really much of a payoff for the viewer at the end in terms of actually bothering to take care of any of the loose ends. I thought both films were "jumpers" that had me in goosebumps at times ... for the first few instances that called for it. At least in "The Ring," there is some plot development and search into a complex history to explain what is going on before they disappoint the viewer. In "The Grudge," the back story isn't complicated at all, and explanations are still in short supply. First, why are the original innocent victims suddenly murderous ghosts? I imagine they're not thrilled by the way they left the mortal coil, but that doesn't really explain why they just keep killing ... and killing. Besides, logic following, wouldn't the new victims also become murderous? There wouldn't be anyone left on the planet after a week, which might explain why ...... apparently there are only around 2,000 people living in Tokyo, which I believe this was set in. Every time anyone's pursued, every street, hallway, parking lot and corridor is completely devoid of people. In a huge office building at night, the only two people there are a security guard and a transplanted American? And has anyone heard of light switches? Most of the time, characters don't even attempt to turn on lights when they investigate strange noises. They just walk, scared, into dimly-lit rooms or crawl spaces. 'Also, for a haunted house flick, the murderous apparitions are able to do a surprising amount of traveling about town to claim their victims.Ultimately, like "The Ring," "The Grudge" starts out promising, but leaves many viewers feeling cheated at the end. I hesitate to call the latter a clone of the former, though. I'm not an expert on Japanese culture or cinema, but it's entirely possible that their view of what makes for suspense is simply different than our own. Maybe, as Americans, we want too much bundled neatly in a package by the end of a movie.But I believe this movie fell short in that it failed to explain the simplest thing in a horror movie, which is why, logically, the slayers are killing people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, the movie is predictable and there is no ending. The beginning is mysterious. *Spoilers*. I'm going to focus on two aspects of the movie. The first is, there is a house in tokyo that's haunted. A violent murder by a husband on his wife and child had been committed in the house. Innocent people that enter the house (as you'll notice as the movie progresses) will obviously die no matter where they are by the child and woman.I guess this happens only in Japan (kinda like the big monster movies). OK, here's the problem. Why do the woman and the child want to kill innocent people when they enter the house? This house sits in the middle of Tokyo as far as I can tell and if this was occurring, there would obviously be a lynch mob there to destroy the house. Later, My next line will explain the lynch mob approach.Somewhere later in the movie the detective explains to Sarah Michelle Geller that there is a curse in Japan where if a violent murder happens in a house, the house is basically haunted.My question is, if that is so, could there be millions of other houses where this has happened? If there were, there would be a tradition in Japan to burn all houses that had violent deaths. The line about that problem should never have been in the script.The problem should have been unique. Another change in the script should have been maybe the woman and child only haunted evil people to their deaths. That's just an opinion if a sequel is ever written.Now back to the discussion that took place on the rooftop between Sarah's character and the detective. When the detective explained what was happening with this house, Sarah's Character should have just said "then we're screwed". By that time we all knew they were. There was no unpredictability in the movie from that time on. I mean at that point couldn't there be some scripting in there where they put everybody's minds together and discussed about finding some unique solution to the haunting problem?That's where the movie fails! It fails bad after that point. Just have godzilla step on the damn house or something! That would have been a much better ending than the way it ended.The only saving grace is that it could be opened to much improved sequels or even a prequel to solve the holes in this movie!rating: terrible, unless you are a kid or something</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story Factor 5. Creep Factor 10! (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***No Spoilers Here***Story Factor 5. Creep Factor 10! And that's not a bad thing in this case. In fact, it was rather refreshing.I have a theory why some critics rated 'The Grudge' low, while others have hailed it as the scariest movie of 2004 (of which I am inclined to agree): they were expecting or wanting something more than raw terror, comparing it most likely to the more intricate, thoroughly fleshed-out back-story-driven 'The Ring'. Or, my more promising theory about those who slam it is that they did so to help their ego deal with the urine stains on their pants when they walked out of the theater.Except for the very last scene comprising the last 60 seconds of the movie (which falls a little flat because it's too obvious) and the scene with the thing on the back of her head that was depicted in the previews (which made no sense whatsoever and was unnecessary), this is by far the most intensely eerie movie I've seen, possibly in my lifetime (and I don't state that in an exorbitant, over-exaggerated manner - I really mean it!). Unlike 'The Ring', 'The Grudge' never lets up. There is no downtime. You're in creepsville from beginning to end.'The Ring' was still a better movie with a much more developed plot and fleshed out characters, but it's creep factor pales in comparison to 'The Grudge', which was very well paced (albeit chronologically choppy, which I actually liked), presenting it's menace in a fashion just tangible enough to solidify its supernatural threat into a fear that builds from the very first moments and takes hold without letting up until the very last scene. There is a lot left unexplained, but in this film explanations are irrelevant, and I think that's what some viewers may be missing. They crave to understand, rather than to just trust the filmmaker's vision and feel, severely dampening the overall intended effect.***Spoilers Here***Again, during that last scene the fear factor disperses a bit. It should have either been altered, with just the cops talking about what they'd found, or it should have been removed completely. Either way, having her survive only to have the ghost immediately reappear again was unnecessary and predictable, at which time the fear factor plummets. On the other hand, having the intensity reduced a bit before the credits roll may actually be a blessing.'The Grudge' is also fraught with clichés, primarily using the common horror staple of the lone victim investigating an odd sound only to meet their doom. However, most occurrences of this aren't nearly as far fetched or unbelievable as they usually are in horror films, mainly because at the time the victims are doing the "investigating" they aren't aware that they're being stalked by a supernatural killer until it's too late. In fact, one character, once she realizes the nature of her dilemma and survives, goes through great pains to flee the pursuing menace, running all the way back to her apartment from her office building, even finally cowering in her bed and pulling the cover over her head when finally cornered with no where else to go, essentially giving up and resigning herself to her inevitable fate, also very plausible in my opinion (and leading to yet another very effectively chilling encounter under the bed sheets).***End Spoilers***I recommend this movie only if you're prepared to be looking behind you in mirrors, checking closets, and examining shadows for weeks afterwards. And this is from someone who very rarely finds movies scary. I liked 'The Ring' a lot, but only found it moderately frightening, so if you thought it was scary you might want to avoid this one. Or, wear a Depends undergarment going into it. Bottom line: don't expect sophisticated commentary. This movie was intended to creep you out, and it delivers in spades. It does exactly what its creator wanted it to do, and to rate it by any other measure is folly. Don't go in with preconceived notions trying to think it to death. Just enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grudge delivers extra scares for Halloween</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited about seeing The Grudge. The previews scared me enough and with anticipation I took my dad one Saturday to our local theater, joining a large group in the theater. My dad and I never scare. We laughed at Dawn of the Dead and snickered during the Exorist, however there was utter silence through the entire 96 minutes.If the beginning doesn't make you jump you may be dead yourself and while some claim there is no plot I say: What do you want from a horror movie? This isn't Troy or Gladiator, this is a downright scary movie made to keep you on the edge of your seat or place your hands over your eyes.The normal rules of typical haunted house movies don't apply and the usual hack and slash is non-existent, leading way for a creepy, dark atmosphere. I urge you all to see this film, and take a friend, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here are just some of the reasons why I will never have to worry about the ghost in The Grudge actually causing me some harm or in anyway scaring me to an institutional type state. One: Whenever I hear a noise in a darkened creepy place, I never go to investigate. No way. No how. Hear something banging in the attic? someone else can go look. Hear rumblings in the cellar? you go. I have seen too many movies, read too many books and heard too many stories to put on a brave face and investigate just for the sake of securing my curiosity.Two: My cat never jumps in front of me making a very loud noise while a booming musical score peaks for dramatic effect. My cat is tame and hides from me unless it is hungry. It is not an evil cat. It doesn't snarl and I am sure that if there were evil in the house, the cat would be the first thing to hightail it outta there. My cat pulls a stunt like that one time, and it is off to the shelter where it can terrify another sorry assed stranger.Three: If I ever see something boarded up, it stays boarded up. Who am I to start tearing down something that someone obviously felt necessary to either stop something from getting in or worse, getting out. Hell, if I went home and my bedroom was boarded up, I am sleeping in the kitchen until such time as I can move. End of story.Four: If I ever see police tape around a house, I ain't going' in. Who do you think I am, Agent Mulder? Yellow tapes means something bad has happened and bad begat badder. It means stay out, and I tend to follow instructions rather well.Five: If I ever felt a hand coming out the back of my head in a shower, it is see ya' later bathroom! I wouldn't stop to pack a bag or call a friend. One experience like that and I am out the door never to return again. Whether I ever shower again or not is another story, but you can be assured that I want nothing to do with that particular room again. If I am in a strangers house, it's a 'don't call me, I'll call you' hasty exit. If I am in a foreign country, it is a direct route to the departures lounge and if (and God I hope not) it is in my own home, you are welcome to a viewing as there would be a FOR SALE sign in the front lawn within hours of the incident.With these five simple plans of action listed above, I can't imagine that I would be in the minority, and yet, these situations and character actions occur at random intensity in the off-putting new film The Grudge starring Buffy star Sarah Michelle Gellar. Based on the Japanese film Ju-On The Grudge, the Hollywood edition at least made us stand up and take notice when they announced that director Takashi Shimizu would remake his own film in English. Also interesting was the casting of Gellar not-so-fresh off her long television run as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and in need of a character stretch after playing Daphne in the two gawd-awful Scooby-Doo pics. With Ju-On being a slightly better than average ghost story, the recipe for success was there for the taking.That just makes it all that more unfortunate that the film would fail so miserably. Instead of scaring us or bringing anything new to the table, the movie falls on the laurels of past horror films and gives us a story shot out of sequence (for no reason that I can ascertain) that is more frustrating than thrilling. Gellar looks absolutely lost as the main character, Kare Davis and Bill Pullman has a useless role that was probably offered to him just so they could add another name to the marquee. On the terror meter, The Grudge also has very little to offer. The noises that the ghosts make are almost laughable and the blood and gore content was carefully plotted so that the PG-13 rating could apply.Being October and so close to Halloween, we can expect these types of films to show up in our local playhouses in the next few weeks in hopes of a box office bonanza. Too bad they didn't try to capitalize on a good story as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frightening...if you have ANY intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*sigh* the only part of this movie that was laughable was all the awful comments from people trying to prove their intelligence by ripping the movie apart with big words they must have just learned. This movie was GOOD. I'm sorry that because the scenes jumped around many of you were confused, but it wasn't THAT hard to follow. There WAS a plot, and I think people misunderstood many parts. It is when someone dies in a fit of great rage or EXTREME SORROW (just like the officer said to SMG) that it leaves a stain on the place of the event. It curses the place where it happened. I loved the way the movie jumped around, because it leaves you wanting to know more, but also learning what has happened before. It is a technique that Stephan King uses in many of his books. It drives me nuts, but I love it at the same time.Now maybe I'm a wuss, but i was squeezing my boyfriends arm the whole time. I don't like long drawn out gore sessions, but I do enjoy all the waiting for them to happen. The sound the girl made was CREEPY because its a sound that isn't manufactured like that of the video in "The Ring". This movie dealt with average people, and people that died simply because they entered the wrong house. That's what made it so scary. They didn't go looking for the curse, and they weren't bad people. It was innocents dying for no reason.The ending was fitting for this movie. Everybody who has pointed out that they left it open for a sequel.....DUH. You think? This movie is a remake of a movie that ALREADY HAS A SEQUEL. Oi, people...come on.In closing.....this movie was good if you have the intelligence to follow it. It's good if you're going to sit back and enjoy it. It will haunt you afterwards if you have ANY type of imagination. This movie's plot isn't just handed to you, but if you think about it, it will come. It's a great movie for guys to take their girlfriends to ;)!</fullReview>

Just a little here and there unlike in your classic horror films like scream and I know what you did last summer, Halloween etc. The movie doesn't make to much sense until the end... the whole time your just like "wtf", but at the end, everything comes together and it all makes since. Not to mention at the end, you finally realize what the movie is about. It will definitely give you the chills. Every time I lie in the bed, I look under my covers praying I want see a face... ;-).

		<shortDescription>Didn't have extreme expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the film was good, yes it did have many typical cliché's.Especially when the detective went back to the house to light it up.He should have had him and some of his friends throw a Molotov Cocktail from the street, instead of giving in to hear the cries of a boy he already knew was dead. I didn't like the end either.But overall just to keep me entertained along with the teen audience who couldn't stop screaming and laughing at those parts in the movie. I didn't mind paying the matinée price to see this film.It tickles me in this day and age of movie remakes, that anyone is surprised or offended and even has hatred towards a film. Most movies aren't really created for the audience in mind. Film makers all ready think that most audience members are idiots and will fall for the same lousy jokes and cliché's. But at the same time we go to the movies to get away from reality, and at least they give us that.Whether the movie is a Oscar winner or the worst thing ever created we still have a reaction after the film.So with that, I thought THE GRUDGE was entertaining overall. I didn't expect it to be a block buster it was just another film, to help keep actors employed. So until some of us future writers and film makers out there can come up with something better, new and fresh, we can be assured that there will be many more typical cliché's to come.Just enjoy the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It scared the s**t out of me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not aware of the other films, and even confused on them... The Ring (U.S) Ringu (Japanese) Ju-On (Japanese) Are the Japanese subtitled (I would assume so) Does that take anything away from the movies?I will for sure check them out. I was bored, looking for a movie. Sarah Michell Gellar... Buffy (I've never seen it) Scooby Doo (Sorry, I saw that one-I've have a 5 year old son) But, oh well I need a movie to see.This was bar none the scariest, creepiest, best put together horror movies I've ever seen.I liked the jumbled up time line-like Pulp Fiction. The ending, not to keen on. Overall-really, really, really scary!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent Japanese ghost story told for the American audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**CONTAINS SPOILERS** The Grudge is an excellent Japanese story told in American format. I loved the simplicity of the story and the out-of-order sequence in which the story unfolds.Although the plot was thin, which is what some of the reviewers have said, I don't think it needed to be to be spooky. Its simple - vengeful ghosts haunt and torment those that visit their place of death. Its your common "haunted house" story, yet in a way it isn't because it is another culture's interpretation of what it means to step into a haunted house. Despite all the hype of Japanese horror movies, the culture alone has many spooky supernatural tales. The freakiest ghost in the Japanese culture that I ever heard of is the "faceless ghost," who is portrayed as a woman with no face and only has long shiny black hair that disguises the fact that she is faceless. The faceless ghost scares anyone coming upon her into shock. But, I digress from my review of the Grudge.Even though I agree with everyone saying how the thrills and scares were common effects also found in many other horror movies, I thought this movie used it very well in terms of storytelling. I think the most eeriest supernatural stories are the short, mysterious ghost stories like the Vanishing Hitchhiker. The Grudge is like this. The freakiest part of the movie was when the ghost followed the sister Susan to her work building and tormented her there and then followed her home. Anyone who grew up in Hawaii listening to "obake" (ghost) stories will understand why this scene was so "chicken skin"(goosebumps) - its because it reminded me of Hawaii's supernatural tales where the ghosts follow you. I think if you're already a highly superstitious person (like I am) then this movie will genuinely freak and creep you out. I am still left with spooky images of this movie. This is one movie not to miss! I give it 5/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, decent, but mostly forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose with this film being a remake of a Japanese horror film by Takashi Shimizu, who also did this remake, there will be the inevitable comparisons to "The Ring." Say what you will but The Ring was horrifying, and although the original Ju-On: The Grudge was hailed as the scariest film of all time The Ring (the remake not the Japanese version) was the scariest film I have ever seen hands down and I've seen a lot. The Grudge was excellent. It is the story of a family, a wife and husband and a young boy, who lived in a house in Tokyo. The wife falls completely obsessively in love with an American Professor played briefly by Bill Pullman. The husband discovers his wife's obsession by reading her diary and in an unnatural fit of rage he murders his wife, his son, and their cat before killing himself. According to Japanese folklore when a person dies in a state of rage or deep emotion they leave a curse on the area where they died and it effects everyone who comes into that area. A new family moves into the home, an American businessman, his wife, and his mother. His mother is suffering from old age but the house pushes her into dementia as she barely clings to life being haunted by the dead Japanese wife, and son. The wife begins to torture and eliminate anyone and everyone who sets foot in the house where she was murdered. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Karen a volunteer caretaker who comes in to look after the elderly woman who has moved into the home. The story is much more complicated than it needs to be and yet at the same time doesn't really ever fully explain clearly what is happening. The scenes of horror creepiness are great and definitely send chills down your spine but they are far apart and are filled with rather slow paced middle story. The movie is almost more of a drama that has moments of scariness. In saying that the scenes of the dead mother and boy are deliciously filmed and are definitely worth a good jump. Sadly Shimizu does at times resort to the "cheap scare" tactics by making you jump in your seat rather than really going for the kind of psychological horror that I had hoped The Grudge would bring. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the best role I have ever seen her in. She really brings out the acting jibe in this one and granted she hasn't had a lot of opportunity to flex her acting ability but this one did it for her. She played her role perfectly. The Japanese cast including the little boy Toshio played by Yuya Ozeki were brilliant and creepy. Ozeki should have plenty of practise playing this role as this is his third reprisal in the role of Toshio having played him in the original version as well as it's sequel. Point of interest for some the entire Japanese family that plays the evil cursed ghosts are reprising their roles for the third time.I don't think anyone who enjoys a good scary film will be disappointed by The Grudge. It certainly didn't leave me scared to death and I actually felt after leaving the theatre that the film was mostly forgettable which is unfortunate but I hope to see it again as I do believe it will be around a long time as a horror classic.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, it's the best horror movie since "The Exorcist (unedited version)". This movie was the only horror movie in ten years that actually made me jump not because someone else was squeezing the heck out of me, jumping around to scare me or making scary noises, I jumped because I WAS SCARED! To me that doesn't happen very often, especially with generic versions of "The Exorcist (unedited version)", this movie made me a very happy person. Also, that creepy noise that Toshio Saeki is the same noise that my mom makes so while we were in the theatre the premiering week end (theatre premiere, not world premiere) I told my mom never to make that sound again. Also, I was elbowed in the head, pinched in the arm (twice) and bunched in my chest because my siblings (mom and aunt) got scared! Ouch! ***Caution: If planning to see The Grudge take arm guards, chest guards and a helmet!***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...Against this derivative, frivolous, formulaic, tedious drek in the disguise of "modern horror". There are virtually no edge-of-your seat desirable thrills here, yet there is an irksome pattern of fallacious climaxes delivering to absolutely no avail, rather than a "shocking spook". You'll find cringing in horror, not at the terrifying events on the big screen of course, but rather, at the sheer temerity of a film such as this to appear so promising, and to fail so horribly and cluelessly wrong to thrill or even to entertain. I frequently found myself completely dissociated with the conventions of one naive visitor meandering around the "cursed" estate, devoid of any attention or consideration as to what was to proceed with the characters' hapless fates, as every fate was lamentably predictable, ridiculously formulaic, and instinctively (hilarious). One could not imagine a human being screaming at the top of their lungs at the horrible sight of a stalking spirit possessing an eerie message (errrrrrr) could be laughable, yet the frivolous, derivative (plot stolen from countless recent "horrors" e.g. "The Ring", "Signs", etc.) convention of this scenario is so inextricably lame and gaspingly familiar, that it becomes custom to merely "sigh" or laugh at every doomed character's grisly fate. The film almost saves itself from entirely collapsing towards the very end, with a curious, eerie acquaintance between Sarah Michelle Gellar (Curiosity has certainly killed this cat) and Bill Pullman (whom we have learned has been dead for years by suicide (possibly due to afflictions from "the grudge"), where both of them realize the other's presence, yet proceed silently in their business, Pullman detesting his unfaithful wife, Gellar merely following his hopeless stride. This and the scene where it is revealed that the woman and the boy plaguing the house were gruesomely murdered by the husband and father, are some really ingratiating sequences, and capture some much wanted attention. Yet even these scenes follow the formulaic conventions prevalent throughout the film of being assembled to great promise and interest, yet resulting in some very weak, effort less "climaxes" wherein nothing is resolved, and we can only wait for the cycle to hopelessly repeat itself. What a sorry and inexcusable excuse for a horror built upon chills (which can only be achieved through surprise, which this film completely lacks) and the element of fear (which can only be achieved through careful, unwavering attention to detail and deceiving style, and this film traffics in deviation and guileless transparency). In the end, I really have developed a "grudge" towards this completely wasted execution devoid of any veritable thrill, surprise, shock, or even entertainment; a frighteningly failed attempt at conjuring any horror, that actually evokes guilty gags instead of shocking shrieks... * out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You're Confused Like I Was..Read This (The Grudge)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the movie, stop here.So yea, If you're anything like me, then you probably were confused somewhat after seeing this movie. The story was over-stylized and was hard to put together after all was said and done. It wasn't really scary either. Fortunately I figured it out in order. Here Goes...There was once an American college teacher teaching in Japan. Turns out one of his students became obsessed with him. This girl would write about him (and him alone it seems) in her diary. She followed him everywhere she could and she even could be seen in the background of some of his pictures. She would send him tons of letters and he had no clue who it was. So one day he finally decided to follow the return address on the letters and he came upon a simple looking house. In the house was a boy who looked pretty beat up. He decided to stay with the child until his mother (the obsessed girl) returned. While there, the teacher did some exploring and found the girl's diary and some pictures of her and the beat-up boy and another man all over the floor. Her face was torn out of all the pictures. He explored further and found her dead. Because of this, the teacher ended up killing himself the next day. What happened was that this girl was married and had a child. Her husband found her diary and read it. He became very angry, as you can imagine, and proceeded to kill her violently before murdering himself. Here began the curse (The grudge). The rage that the girl's husband had when he died remained in the house after his death and anyone who came in contact with it was doomed. So instead of developing this story, the movie goes on showing everybody who came in contact with the curse dying gruesome deaths (at the hands of the ghosts of these dead people) but does little to help us unravel the story. I hope I helped someone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary but very inconsistent (warning: spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was better than "The Ring" (both Japanese and American versions) in terms of being genuinely frightening, but the inconsistencies bothered me terribly and significantly detracted from the movie's potential impact. In particular, even though ghosts and other supernatural elements obviously require the audience to suspend its disbelief, that gets harder when there are apparently no limitations as to what the "ghoulies" can do. When they break those rules and become seemingly all powerful, it's the functional equivalent of the shark in "Jaws" abandoning the water to go wander the land and chomp people. SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER In particular, this movie is centered establishes itself as your basic haunted house flick. Within the house, there is some consistency in what the ghosts can do -- they appear with images resembling themselves in life, but can distort those images in terrifying ways. On the other hand, they act inconsistently, sometimes attacking those who see them, sometimes just scaring them, and sometimes (such as the encounter between SMG and the little boy) acting just slightly off-kilter. But get them outside the house and their powers actually grow: they can imitate other people's voices and take on their appearance (or even in the case of Bill Pullman, get into his head and cause him to commit suicide). Not only does this fly in the face of any type of logic (why would the ghosts get stronger and more flexible away from their base?), but it raises the disturbing question as to why such all-powerful beings seem to have problems killing particular folks other than to entertain the audience by drawing out the suspense (i.e. if you can cause someone to throw himself off a balcony, it should have been a simple matter to force the sister to throw herself down the stairwell or out of the cab, instead of letting her get home to her apartment.)Anyway, I would still recommend the film just because of the extremely disturbing images and overall tension, but the difference between cheap shocks and true terror always comes down to a work's believability, and this one lost me whenever the ghosts took their campaign to the greater Tokyo area.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly good horror movies are hard to come by. And this is not one of them.This is just a series of "jack-in-the-box" scenes. By this, I mean that somebody opens a door/lifts a bed sheet/peers around a corner and BOO, something scary pops out -usually a young boy (the creepy boy seems to have replaced yesterday's masked slasher). This gets old. Fast.And in between, there is bad, insulting-to-the-viewer writing.The good horror movies employ actual suspense, which is the result of understanding the story and caring about what happens to the characters. There is none of that here. Considering she is the "star," SMG has a very low percentage of screen time and lines. Whether she is disemboweled, possessed, or reads the dictionary while standing on her head is ultimately of little interest. The same applies to every other character.Save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for what it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I will tell you all that I'm a hardcore horror film fanatic. I've seen hundreds of horror movies all throughout my 21 years on this Earth. I've seen mainstream horror, indi horror, Italian horror, Spanish horror, big budget and no budget horror, OOP (out of print) horror, etc.One must approach a horror film in a different manner than most movies. First ask yourself, what is the main goal of a horror movie?-to scare you -to entertain you -to creep you out -often times to make you laugh -to make you have a good time...A horror movie is like a roller-coaster. You get "on board" pretty much knowing what to expect. You pay a few bucks, take your ride and then toss those memories aside after you get your kicks out of it.Horror films are (for the most part) the roller-coaster ride.Films such as Star Wars, Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, and even Requiem For A Dream are to be viewed in a much different light than the horror film.Those above mentioned films stand out because of numerous things. Whether it's the amazing story and imagination that went into Star Wars, the gritty realistic historically accurate war scenes of Saving Private Ryan, or the powerful and gripping acting in Requiem For A Dream. These types of movies are equivalent to taking a vacation at the Six Flags Theme park or Disneyworld. Horror is the cheap quick thrill/entertainment of the roller-coaster. "Epic" (in their own ways) type films are the entire family vacation to that exspensive theme park. When you leave, you will remember those events for a long time, and there was just so much to do and see. Horror is not that. Horror is......well, horror.That being said, I must say that The Grudge is a great horror film. What makes me take notice to a "good" or "great" horror film are the things that make it stand out. Hollywood seems to have lost the grasp on horror over the last 10 years, spitting out "another teen slasher w/out any smarts".While those "slasher" type horror flicks can be fun, they ultimately leave you disappointed by cardboard stories/characters and instead rely on blood/boobies (that's not a bad thing for some people's opinions).This is what makes the Grudge a great horror flick. The blood/gore is only there for impact on certain scenes. It is there to heighten the intensity and creepiness. There isn't much blood, and only a single gory element (no i won't say what it is)...but that's not the point of THIS type of horror movie. The blood/gore was used tastefully and not overdone, but at the same time, not underdone. The story is also what makes The Grudge a great horror flick. It is a unique spin on the traditional "haunted house" tale that us fat lazy Americans are so used to seeing. "House on Haunted Hill", "The Haunting", "13 Ghosts", etc....catch my drift?What makes this "haunted house" tale so interesting is that it's done in a unique way. People come and go into the house as they please, they aren't "trapped" inside or anything. Some people die, and some people don't. It makes it more realistic because while it IS a haunted house, it only appears as a normal house (I guess that's what the average home in Japan looks like). There's no hokey and stereotypical:cobwebs, creaking doors, mysterious moving objects, etc. in the usual haunted house/ghost story flicks. The entire story is done in a series of short tales, each focusing on a character/group of characters. All the stories tie into each other throughout the film...leaving us sometimes confused. Think of how the different stories in the film, "Pulp Fiction" tie together to tell the entire movie, and that's somewhat the same direction the Grudge is aiming at (although definitely not as detailed/integrated). I like that this makes The Grudge stand out from the "standard" horror film. In fact, I can't recall off the top of my head about another horror film using this same technique. While not a new technique, it does make for a much more interesting film. Horror movies either aim to be scary or just fun. This one aims to be scary. A "fun" horror flick would be along the lines of Cabin Fever (meant to be a fun entertaining ride for the audience, concentrating on that and not on the scares)......and SCARY this is. Although i cannot say in fact what film is "scary" because that is a matter of opinion, but in my opinion...it is scary. I'm not going to have nightmares or anything, but yes, the film is creepy, atmospheric and scary. This is a GOOD THING. If you thought The Ring was scary, I consider this film to outdo the Ring on scares by 2 times at least.I just mentioned how creepy the film is. Why is it creepy? It's creepy because of the atmosphere. The house is pretty much a normal house, and the scares rely on the ghosts. I like that. Most horror movies try to rely on the setting too much for the scares and don't concentrate on the actual "horror goods". This film throws in a couple of really unique and creepy ghosts that certainly do their job, and do it well. So what's bad about this movie? What didn't I like you ask? A few things actually. Some of it doesn't seem to make too much sense plot wise. I also think that the film needs more blood/gore (although it's certainly good without it). I think a disturbingly creepy film like this would use the extra blood/gore in a much more effective way than the typical horror movie. You'll get what i'm talking about when you see the scene with Yoko (after she returns from the house). I think the characters could have been a little bit more interesting. Although this is horror, and horror films tend to have cardboard cutout characters, a big budget and ambitious film like this could have been even more effective with better characters. All in all, this film does what horror films are meant to do. It is scary, creepy, atmospheric, filmed in a unique way, and most importantly...original.Some people say this is "like the Ring"...and I must argue. Both films are remakes of their same titled original Asian films, but that's really the only thing similar. The female ghost in The Grudge sorta looks like "Samara" from The Ring as well, but not like most people make it out to be.Don't let the critics stop you from watching this movie. It's worth the money in my opinion. Just go in knowing it's a horror movie, and not Hollywood's attempt to cash in at this year's Oscars and you'll end up leaving with a smile on your face. 8 out of 10 ratingCLIFF NOTES: This is a horror movie, not an attempt at an "epic" film. It has plot holes, some confusing scenes and somewhat "dry" characters. It does have scares, atmosphere, creepiness, and some unique direction/cinematography. It is a fun movie, one to take your girl to. If you enjoy horror movies, i simply cannot see how you wouldn't like this film. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scared me to death...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That movie was great. It freaked me out and it was never dull. No boring s**t at all. Everyone in the theater was either screaming or covering their eyes. (girls that is) Horror movies lately just don't scare me anymore, but this one took the cake. Like Sixth Sense, it had mystery and creepy things happening throughout the movie. CREEPY and I still can't go up my stairs without seeing that woman, and hearing that sound as she comes down the staircase. SCARY! I just know that I'm going to hear that noise and feel hands when I'm in the shower. I'm so spooked. I'm surprised it didn't get a "R" rating. In the theater we were in some moron brought his baby and toddler son. Some people are very ignorant. Great movie for Halloween!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly scary, but completely generic horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: some spoilersSo, first, I should tell you that there is absolutely nothing original about this film. There are a couple scenes where the scare is reminiscent of The Ring (in one scene, a cop is watching a monitor and sees the ghost slide up to the security camera, and she presses her face right against it, but does not actually slide through the TV) and one of the killers is an evil looking woman with long hair in front of her face. However, except for those things, The Ring and The Grudge have nothing in common. As others have stated, The Grudge likes to startle you, and believe me, at least some people will jump; I did.I don't mind a movie that has some startle scenes. They're kind of fun. But I consider it cheating if that's all the movie has. This movie has no suspense, no plot development, no character development, no real climax, and when you're not being startled (or preparing to be) you're quite bored because all the alternate scenes are of SMG running frantically around Tokyo.In the roughly 90 min movie, there is about 10 min where the film is actually interesting, and all scenes involve Bill Pullman, whose character kicked off the whole chain of events. The flashback that introduced him and showed how he came to be involved with the murdering family is very creepy and fascinating. Anyway, the story and the explanations are stupid. The basic idea is that the woman, who is the mother of the little boy, fell in love with Bill Pullman, and stupidly wrote about it in her diary for her husband to find. He freaks out, yet meticulously cuts her face from dozens of photographs and pins them to the door for her to find, then after she sees his little show, he brutally murders her in front of their son, before drowning the boy, and then hanging himself. Evidently, the mother and son were in such a state of rage that after death they were allowed to haunt the house and kill anyone who entered it.Forgive me if I am being culturally insensitive, but that's a really dumb reason. Even if there was something to that myth, the father was more enraged than the mother and son. Why wasn't HE hanging in the house killing people? There's a bunch of other stupid facets of this story, but it would take too long to type them all out. Just know that this movie might make you jump, and the creepy faces of the woman and her son might freak you out a little when you're trying to sleep, but this is an ultimately forgettable and ridiculous horror movie, doing nothing to give credit to the genre. Here's to hoping that The Saw (which I'm seeing THIS weekend) is much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and Well Done Japanese Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Grudge" follows a young nurse, Karen, (Sarah Michelle Gellar) who lives in Tokyo, Japan, and is sent to work at an old house where an elderly woman is living. Unfortunately, the house has a horrible past and a curse was laid upon it - a curse that is brought upon anyone who dares to step into the house. What would have been a routine job for Karen becomes a nightmare where she must fight against good and evil and try and stop the curse from claiming her.This movie came out at the perfect time- just before Halloween, when most people are looking for a scary movie to watch. I will say that I enjoyed "The Grudge". Sure, it does follow some horror clichés (example: after hearing strange noises in the attic, you go explore with a lighter as your only light source) but I still enjoyed it for the most part and it works out as a decent horror movie overall.This film uses loads of "jump" scenes to scare you which are effective, but there were continuous "jump" scenes throughout this movie, which tend to be overused in today's horror films. This film could've been better if it had used more scare tactics, but "The Grudge" does have some really disturbing scenes that are also effective. I guarantee you will jump at least once throughout the movie, it has some unexpected scares. The only problem people may have with this movie is that it's hard to follow, and the film ends when you wouldn't expect it to. If you pay enough attention though, you should be fine, otherwise if you don't you will be lost. I've only seen a little bit of the Japanese original so I can't really compare and contrast the two, but if you're looking for some good scares, go see "The Grudge". It's well-written, well-acted, and has some splendidly scary scenes (the staircase scene was just flat out disturbing). I think I liked it better than "The Ring" myself. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No sirree, I wasn't scared, not one bit! What was that noise?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came out of the movie thinking that wasn't scary at all. Didn't jump or scream once. (I broke a pair of glasses when I saw "Poltergeist" at the theatre, obviously I was trying to escape something on the screen.) When I got home, "The Grudge" didn't cross my mind at all that evening....that is.....until I tried to go to sleep! Two nights in a row I have slept with the lights on. Every little sound woke me with a start. Sounds that I hear that are similar to the spooky sounds in the movie give me the willies. So, although the presentation of the plot may be lacking, I believe it excelled with the visuals and the audio. Because they apparently sank into a location in my brain that didn't become obvious until I went to bed. Then, much like the murdered woman crawled, these thoughts crawled from the basement of my brain to the main floor ... and wouldn't let me sleep! Darn, I'm tired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sixth Sense meets Memento</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit, this movie starts off a little slowly and at first you aren't sure whether your watching a poorly attempted comedy or a horror movie. About ten minutes in though you get your answer and are glad you've donated your time and hard earned cash to see this movie. The acting can be a little underwhelming at times but the script, and style of the film more than make up for it. Like "The Sixth Sense" this movie does not rely on blood and gore to achieve it's scares, but instead uses more subtle psychological scares. The story-telling style reminds me of "Memento" and is very well done. You are unsure exactly what has occurred and why until the last few minutes of the movie. For anyone needs a good, thought-provoking scare I'd recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A MUST SEE!!!!! If you dare!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far one of the BEST scary movies I have seen in a long time. Finally - a director out there knows how to scare the hell out of people. Nice to know there still is hope for the future of horror movies. The trailer doesn't even come close to showing you all the terrifying scenes. I still have one image inparticular that I can't seem to erase from my mind. OK - maybe more than just one. Several!!!! FREAKY!!!! I will be one of the first people to buy this as soon as it is released on DVD. If you are a fan of horror movies you must see this feature. It is in a league all it's own. If you thought The Ring was freaky this will blow your mind. If you thought The Ring was lame and could have been better, still check this movie out. It is unbelievable. You will walk away satisfied and actually scared. Remember the feeling? If nothing else you will always look at many of life's situations differently. I know I sure do. Be afraid of the unknown, because it just may know where to find you and it's eye maybe on you. Are you scared? You should be. Certainly a 5 star movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this movie two stars out of ten. This movie is a American remake of a Japanese horror movie called Juon. The basic premise of the story is a bunch of deaths related to a haunted house in Japan. Michelle Gellar plays an exchange student in Japan who goes to this haunted house in Tokyo to look after an invalid American woman after the original caretakers disappeared. That's when the fun begins or lack thereof.Anyone who has seen Japanese cinema knows horror movies from Japan are heavily into suspense without much special effects. I remember reading some news magazine that was profiling Japanese cinema and one interviewee stated that Japanese cinemas do not have the budget like Hollywood movies to use many special effects. Therefore, they have to use mood, camera angles, and such to create suspense in their movies.Now I like this type of movie making. It reminds me of the classic thriller/horror genre of American cinemas in the 1940's and 1950's. That being said, most of this movie was not scary. Like a typical Japanese movie, the movie dragged on too long in some scenes and there is a reason for this. It makes the audience lull into complacency not expecting anything in particular, which makes the happening of a thrilling event much more scary. But again, there is just too many of these types of scenes.If you like Ringu, you might like this movie but Ringu was much more unique in its premise than your common haunted house theme. One of my friends told me that the Japanese version is slightly better than the American version and had offered to loan me his copy but I don't think I am going to see it. I did not like this movie and I was not scared at all.I would have given this movie one out of ten stars but I like Michelle Gellar so I am willing to give it an extra star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just wanted to throw my two bits in about The Grudge! Let's just say that the last movie that scared me this bad was When A Stranger Calls Back!(1980's) I screamed about 8 times(out loud) and I didn't even catch half of the scary scenes because my face was in a sweatshirt at the first sign of some creepy one-eyed face coming out! As for the plot, yeah it had some holes, wasn't explained all that well, but no movie ever explains every single detail. Then it's not fun! You have to read between the lines, and put things together! That was what this movie was all about. It wasn't supposed to be Shakespeare, but a SCARY MOVIE! I will definitely be purchasing this one on DVD and hopefully will be able to see all of it without covering my face! Oh and I really honestly think one of the scariest parts of this movie was when she was looking out of the bus window and there is that scary one-eyed face. I screamed so loud, I felt so stupid! Man that was some scary business!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary images, but weak plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge provided a very nice cheap thrill- the images were frightening, and the surprises were apt to make the audience jump. However, the lack of a decent story completely ruined this film for me. It's relatively easy to scary an audience with creepy images and sounds, but the way that these things will stay with the audience is if there is a convincing plot line. It needed to be cemented with a good story. There were too many plot holes, plus the fact that the story in itself was pretty weak, to make this a long-lasting impact. Also, I felt that much of the scary images were taken from The Ring and Ringu, so it wasn't very original for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge was hilarious. It was a romantic comedy to sooth the soul and invigorate the senses. *whisper whisper*. What's that? It's not a comedy? How did that happen? Two words: Bad. Okay, that's one, but I meant bad bad. Why, you ask? One: Where is the story line? Doesn't the tag line already give away the entire story? "It never forgives. It never forgets." Yeesh. I was hoping for complication and intricacy. So, that's all. The entire story is just padded with gore and elementary scares. Two: What is it? See above. I forgot what I was going to say. Who would I recommend this movie to? My enemies. Perhaps even my friends, if they annoy me enough. Not my family, though. They shouldn't waste their money on The Grudge. They should give ME the money so I can buy new clothes or new computer games. In conclusion, what can I say I liked about The Grudge? It was only 91 minutes long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original Japanese TV versions of Juan and Juan 2, and the theatrical version as well. While Juan part 1 was creepy and nailbiting, part 2 was a little confusing because it rehashes the story of Juan 1 until about mid-way thru, then you see the horrific beginning of the sad and morbid tale. The theatrical release was a merge of the two parts.Much like the Japanese theatrical, the English language version that opened last weekend is a mesh of the two chapters. For starters, PG-13 says it all. A total let down on what could have been a creepy gorefest. This was on a par with a "butchered for TV" movie. Lots of teases, and no pay off. The original flashback of the murder of the family was brutal. This is warm and fuzzy by comparison. Also, the fact that Gellar is in it, is indifferent. She has like 20 lines in this whole film. Any no-name actress could have done the job.This did not have the suspense of The Ring (US Version), and in fact could have surpassed it in terms of graphic content, but it just fell short. Will the DVD release be an unrated version perhaps? They also never explain the disgusting gurgling sound the ghost is making. Weak all around, please don't make an equally pathetic sequel.</fullReview>

That is the same way I felt after watching The Ring. I understand there is an audience for this type of movie and that is fine but I felt I wasted my time and money. I don't mind seeing 'bad guys' win once in a while but not evil winning. Leaves you with no hope that good will triumph over evil.The little boy screaming and hissing just made me laugh.A few parts I thought were good. One was when SMG first saw a ghost while taking care of the older woman. Another was in the sister's office building, the security camera video.After I got home I went on this site to see if The Grudge was made by any of the same people as The Ring because it was so similar in many ways. I was waiting for one of the ghosts to say "7 days..." in a raspy whisper. The Ring - you see the tape, you die. The Grudge - you go into the house, you die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Same recipe for a horror movie. The Grudge took the same spin on the new horror genre where just because things within the movie make you jump or become startled, doesn't make it scary. The movie does not qualify as a horror. This one falls under comedy. Throughout the entire movie, there are people meowing like cats and falling off of ceilings. Gellar is hardly even in it. At least she could have showed a little more skin. For crying out loud, the old horror movies were a lot funnier and enjoyable to watch and they even had some pretty raunchy scenes too. The Grudge was slow to develop and the plot was pitiful. See this movie, yes... in the middle of winter when there is nothing else to do. DO NOT blow a wad of cash on it right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Sarah Michelle Gellar ever admitted to having some kind of pact with the devil, I wouldn't be surprised.After slaying the living dead in 'Buffy', playing tortuous eye-candy in 'Scream 2' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', even unmasking ghosts in 'Scooby Doo' it seems she's happiest when there's something creepy in the air.'The Grudge' is a remake of a cult Japanese horror flick 'Ju-on-The Grudge', and sees Gellar as 'Karen', an American student living in Tokyo.Karen helps out at a care home, and when a colleague of hers fails to show for work one day, she is dispatched to a scary house in the hills to look after a woman. It soon transpires that all is not well within those four walls, as the house harbours a violent secret.Director Takashi Shimizu's first foray into dealing with Hollywood is an admirable one, although there is a worrying familiarity with other recent US reworkings of Asian cinema, notably 'The Ring'. However, where that version succeeds due to the specific channelling of the evil, (ie, a videotape),'The Grudge' falls down due to the vague manner in which the spell manifests itself.That's not to say there are no redeeming features. 'The Grudge' has strong suspense and heart-stopping shocks throughout, but often there's a sense that they are contrived plot devices which contribute little towards the complete story.Gellar acquits herself as the frightened Westerner trying to unlock the origins of the curse, but it is young Yuya Ozeki who deserves a special mention for his sinister performance as 'Toshio'.A little derivative at times, 'The Grudge' nonetheless has numerous scary moments horror lovers will devour, but fans of the original should probably approach with caution.

		<fullReview>OK, I will admit it that I was scared out of my mind at some points in the movie but the constant jumping back and forth through time just confused me.There were definitely times when the whole audience jumped (ie, the bus scene and the apartment scene) but other than that you knew when something bad was going to happen. The make up and sound effects were good but the acting was so-so.I also would like to ask (not to sound like a racist) but what is up with Japanese movie makers and having really brutal ways of killing family members in their movies?!?! In the Ring she kills her daughter and in this movie it's an entire family. I understand that he was jealous of the woman but to kill the kid... why????Anyways, if you are going to go see a movie just to get scared and not understand the story than go see this one. If you like story lines and plots than skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if i were to rate, out of 10, the grudge on the scariness, i would give it a 3. there were a few parts that make you jump, but that's it. i was expecting this to be the scariest movie i've ever seen, but i was throughly disappointed on how silly it was. there is more humor than horror. i found myself, my friends, and the whole theater in uproarious laughter for most of the parts that were supposed to be scary. it's that pathetic. but all in all, the crappiness of the movie was evened out by the hilarity and as i said before go see this if you are looking for a good time! it's the funniest mistake you'll ever see-jesse n chester</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot remember the last time I viewed such a poor movie as this.It was a waste of the actors time as well as the poor bastard that directed it.I suppose the Director just said to himself,"it ain't no the ring"and let it go at that.The theater that released it for public view are not kicking themselves as bad as the movie company.As for the good of the movie,it will be forgotten,as well as the actor's part.Movies that try to mirror good movies such as THE RING,should clarify at the start of crap as this they are trying to copy.That would be a substantial wake up call to all.I give this crap a f-.And for those that wish to argue,I was there when the audience was laughing instead of being scared.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i am a big fanatic of horror movies. at the theaters, they are always my first choice. i love them even though they put so many thoughts into my head. well, of ALL horror movies that i have seen, The Grudge is most definitely The BEST i have ever seen. i have never screamed like i did during the movie. as is, i never scream and i get annoyed when others did, but now i have no reason to get mad...i am a screamer too. even out of the theatre, my friend didn't even attempt to, and yet he scared the crap out of me because of an image from the movie. this movie i can definitely see over and over again, and it will still have me screaming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Execution, Flawed Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinematographic and directorial technique were great in this movie, but the ending was a pretty miserable failure...unable to really provide the audience with any satisfying new twist on the hundreds of horror movies that have come before. The avoidance of the gory and literally, ghastly onslaught of over the top scenes and sights was a nice touch. This more subtle, sedate, but always ominous mystery builds throughout the movie with nice flashbacks and a great scene of juxtapositions between past and present that rates with any horror movie. The sound effects, the musical background (with some familiar strains from "Wait Until Dark" were effective. This movie wasn't scary in the classic sense, the emotional dread was more saturated like a wet, humid, cloying feeling. Not all of the strands of the movie were tied up by the end, there were lingering questions, and the climax was more of huge letdown. Seven out of Ten Stars (for good directing, but lost potential for a spectacular, memorable hit).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't wait to see this movie, as it looked similar to "The Ring" which I thought was really scary. Although I didn't think it was as good as "The Ring," I did think it was pretty scary and worth seeing.I read several comments talking about the audience being annoying in the theatre--the audience I was in was alittle annoying (laughing at parts where it wasn't funny, etc...) But there were definitely a lot of jump scenes that got everyone in the theatre. If you don't like jump scenes DO NOT see this movie! I really liked the atmospere, scary music, and the creaky noise that girl made gave me the creeps. The plot is definitely not the movie's strong point, but for me, the scary atmosphere was good enough to make the movie worth seeing. I didn't like the ending that much (I thought they left a lot of loose ends--I wished they had developed Bill Pullman's character more, etc..)But after the movie I was definitely apprehensive of stairs, cats, and attics. Not a great movie, but worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought that when the little boy meowed and he was blue that, that part was freaky but then i just thougth well this is probably just a copy off of the ring and its just going to be another corny scary movie. So i went and saw it, and it was sooo scary. I mean your hearing this from a girl thats watched the exorcist at least 100 times alone in the dark. I love horror movies. But this movie made me sweat so much. It should be a classic in my opinion because movies that scary the hell out of you must be really good, and this movie scared me. I definitely recommend it. Especially if your one of those people that don't get scared easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a good career move for Gellar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Sarah Michelle Gellar is ever going to avoid being typecast as Buffy, she should avoid movies like this one. It's not so much that she's still fighting monsters, it's that in this movie, she has nothing to do. Her character isn't developed at all; the role could have been played by almost anyone.This re-make of the Japanese hit "Ju-on", by the same director, misses the mark completely. Every time somebody got "got", the audience laughed. The ideas were interesting but just don't come off. Somehow the "munch moments" come off as silly rather than frightening. It's a rather dull, flat, uninvolving movie, one that is instantly forgettable. I hope that Ms. Gellar will get roles that give her more opportunity to actually act; but movies like this one aren't going to help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film didn't have a positive effect on me as I thought "The Ring" was much, much superior not only in the scare factor but in plot and dialog as well. I just didn't really like it that much; however there were a couple of scenes that did get the audience to jump a little bit to the edge of their seats but most of them just got laughed off. One person even shouted out 'bring on Godzilla' during one of the Japanese detective scenes because it was downgrading to pure cheese relatively quickly...which definitely added some comic relief. I didn't think the actors were effective either since they usually utilized only a handful of expressions for the movie's entirety. The plot fell way short and just didn't add up and the time-line storyboard while meant to give it an intelligent feel...collapsed as well. I also felt that this whole movie was made to promote the sequel, which I don't know if they're going to make it but I certainly was overcome by that impression. The idea was there, but they exploited it instead of realizing its full potential.Final Time:Movies: Worth it in no such way!DVD Purchase: Have no intentions whatsoever.Rental: Possibly a good Halloween flick but that's about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Takashi Shimizu. I own a good amount of his movies. If you don't know anything about him as a director or seen his movies before seeing The Grudge you might be a little confused or taken back with his style. I met Takashi Shimizu at his premiere of ju on in la and asked him what his fascination with girls with long hair (especially putting that long hair in the face) and he mentions something about his ex girlfriends. This director meant some of the parts in The Grudge to be funny. He actually admitted to loving humor and comedy. So when you see some scenes in the movie and laugh thats what he actually wanted from the audience. He loves that! The American remake of The Grudge was great for me. I mean Joxer is in the movie can't go wrong with that and Toshio is my favorite character. It seems like a lot of people don't understand Toshio's character. If you didn't notice Toshio has too appearances. When he is normal skin color and when he has the blue skin color. Well when he is normal he is Toshio. But when he is blue he is possed by the cat. Thats why the black cat and him are most of the time together. His behavior also changes when he is blue(explains why he is meowing huh?) I will tell everyone to go see this movie. But also try and watch his original movies. Dark waters, Ju on, Ringu. He is truly wonderful and creative and funny at times! But if you read some people's comments and they say the Japanese boy wasn't scary or the audience bothered me or bla bla no plot then they don't know hooey lol Get educated before you comment on something you don't know about!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake over redone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I have seen the original and feel the first 45 minutes of the original are up there with some of the best directing of any horror movie ever made. The tension building is ingenious, leaving little details to be figured out by the viewer, but sadly the movie falls into satirical mediocrity soon after. I still rated the movie a 7 overall.The remake I went into knowing they would really speed things along and anything I loved from the original would be different and that's okay, it's to be expected, but this movie simply failed at building tension, and failed at being even remotely scary.It's like they spent all their energy trying rather then doing that it completely misses the mark.For remakes of Japanese movies, The Ring was exceptional but it had all the right people directing, doing effects, casted, etc.. it all just worked, and I am in love with the entire original Japanese series of Ring,particularly Yukie Nakama in Ring 0.Anyways, this was a rather mediocre film, definitely a failed remake. I dread them remaking A Tale of Two Sisters, the original is a masterpiece.All the CGI in this movie made it feel unreal, and more like Casper the ghost then an intensely powerful grudge stalking a house.From this movie I get this impression they tried TOO hard to Americanize it and in doing so sort of disrespected the culture involved. I wish more people would watch original Asian cinema, The Ring series, Uzumaki, A Tale of Two Sisters, Some movies simply should not be remade, because you're changing elements, elements that changed can really throw off all the chemistry to a story, turning it into a mockery of the original folklore.I am not saying I'm against cross culturization, but come on, if you want to bring the cultures together, make a NEW story about an American in Japan not constantly doing remakes.Sometimes remakes are good because they introduce us to the original films we may never have seen otherwise, but it's all in the way it's formulated. And the Grudge originally was a bit silly, but the remake lacked any of the original's tension and only held to the silliness. Every time the Grudge builds it falls flat and leaves me disappointed.In the original, we see near the beginning the woman cleaning the house then she takes a nap. A eerie gust of wind comes along and blows her things over in complete disarray, silently we understand why the house is so messy and why they don't even bother cleaning, it's because the Grudge destroys any semblance of organization once established. Sadly this movie doesn't confront such fascinating details in as intelligently a fashion.Things jump out at you but in the theaters no one screamed, they laughed,because the timing was wrong, just wasn't scary.The Grudge simply doesn't deliver. I say save your money, watch the original Ring series, watch A Tale of Two Sisters, watch Battle Royale, watch Inner Senses, watch The Eye... avoid The Grudge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of my favorites on the scare my frickin' pants off list. The Ring is pretty much nothing compared to this. I watched the Ring twice. Once, scared. Twice, whatever. But the Grudge? Once, AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Twice, haven't see it twice yet...*shivers* It is definitely a movie made to have you look at every dark corner twice, turn the lights on in every room, make you think twice when going up the stairs, and listen for any sounds of gurgling. Continue reading if you've seen the movie, or don't care about spoilers. If you do, skip to next paragraph.OMG! In the beginning, when Yoko goes up into the attic, I screamed bloody murder. The way that Kayako looks when you first see her can easily scare the HELL out of you. And everyone, don't tell me, DO NOT tell me you were not scared when Kayako was under the sheets of Susan's bed! Oh my-*shivers in remembering*. When Kayako came down the stairs in the end and Toshio was watching at the top, I was shaking. And when she was standing behind Karen in the hospital room gurgling in that annoying way she does...geez...AND YOKO! After Yoko died and then appeared in the office looking like a drunk, I was like Oh S-! And then she just happened to have absence of bottom jaw.YAY not. But I was so freaked out that I started cracking up. If you see it you'll get it.I LOVE the Grudge sooooooooo much! Can't wait to see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie looking for a cheap thrill. When I first heard about it, I thought it was another Ring movie and I had low expectation. There has been a slump in horror movies and I thought this would be the same as all the others.I really enjoyed this movie. It was creepy, dark, and an interesting way of presenting it. I jumped through out this whole movie and never relaxed at all. The ghosts were creepy (The eyes are what got to me) and the whole concept I thought was slightly unique. Sure there are other ghost stories out there, maybe even more scary ones. But if you enjoy a thrill or you are a fan of horror, I recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Halloween Haunted House Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not great (I think The Ring was light years beyond this one on my personal fearometer), but I'd recommend it as a fun Halloween flick that's perfect for those who can't shell out the $50+ entrance fee for an amusement park spooking.For the most part, The Grudge is an old-fashioned haunted house movie. What's new here is mainly that ghosts are portrayed in pretty high-tech ways these days, but this is definitely a "things that go bump in the night" story. It's fright value lies mostly in the technique of the unexpected hand on the shoulder. It startles more often than it scares.Sara Michelle Gellar is OK in her role as the main character. I doubt this role stretched her acting abilities much; all she really had to do was act scared every so often, and was called upon to be largely deadpan between. Her character is mainly a lightning rod for spooky things to happen as the movie moves along. I should say, too, that the movie moves backwards and forwards along the plot line in various ways, and it sometimes comes off a bit choppy because of this. Bill Pullman has a small role; he starts off the story by jumping to his death off a sixth story apartment balcony, and the rest of the film unravels the reason why he's done this.The ghosts themselves are pretty effective. The effects people did a great job of combining some truly ghoulish makeup and some choice sound effects. The ghosts are, of course, the true stars of this movie, and everyone else is more or less window-dressing.All in all, I think this movie will scare people who haven't seen a lot of horror flicks more than it will those of us who have seen so many that they've lost count. Not that there isn't something to be had by jaded horror fans such as myself, too, but I suspect that most of us who have seen this kind of thing before can see the scares coming. The startling bits aren't that startling if you already know what's about to happen. People who haven't seen a lot of movies in this genre, however, are likely to loose a scream or two, as did the audience members in the theater where I saw the movie.And please, somebody buy Toshio a new scratching post and some catnip. It'd make him very happy. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Great scary movie! Keeps the suspense and thrill throughout. Just accept that the supernaturals do have powers in this film, and you will find this a truly fun roller-coaster ride!!It keeps you wanna scream and laugh and engaged at the same time. It is funny cos you know that the ghosts are just so fake and unrealistic, but then the music and the way it was shot keeps you engaged, makes you wanna hold your breath at lots of points.Watch this in the theatre or a place with big screen and good sound system. Try not to watch this if you have jobs that does door-to-door surveys or in-house visits, or if you are prone to heart attacks, otherwise, this won't haunt you like when you stand in front of the TV at night after you watch &lt;The Ring&gt;, but it gives you a good heart/lung muscles exercise, and you will find yourself having lots of fun in the theatre!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror film I have seen in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what horror movies should be like. I was so disturbed after I left the cinema and my girl friend was having nightmares for a week after seeing The Grudge. The beauty of this film is that it is based in Tokyo and not in the United States. Just seeing the main character, brilliantly played by Sarah Michelle Gellar dealing with the cultural changes and the over whelming aura of the city of Tokyo is very satisfying. The film is paced perfectly and just when you let your guard down for a second you are sent screaming out of your seat leaving you with sharp tingles running down your spine. A lot of people will be comparing this film to The Ring, which in it's own right is a great movie, but it's not even on the same page as The Grudge. I was so impressed with Sarah Michelle Gellar, she blended in so well with the intriguing story and never tried to look like the pretty sorority girl that we have come so accustom to. Don't get me wrong I do love that look, but it would not work in this flick. Overall, I highly recommend this movie to everyone, but I would not go alone as you will probably be looking over your shoulder for the full hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was actually expecting much better than this flick. I'm quite disappointed. It didn't scare me and it was so cliché it made my stomach hurt. I sat through the whole thing, much to my chagrin.I still find it odd to see SMG all weak and teary eyed. I kept waiting for her to beat the kittens outta the "bad guys." It's also a little bizarre to see her all snuggly with the guy from Roswell.The movie seemed rather choppy and I was having a hard time peicing it all together in a way that made sense. Its too bad. This could have been an excellent re-make.But alas, 'Karen' is no 'Buffy'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horror Film The Way It Should Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love scary movies, and this is a great one. The film makers did a fantastic job. It had all the ingredients of a classic horror movie. Creepy characters, suspense, and spooky music. It kept me guessing the whole time. Sarah Michelle Gellar, could she be the new Jamie Lee Curtis? I'm not sure if she wants to be the new scream queen. She would be fine though. She could also be compared to Neve Campbell, and her work in the "Scream" series. The effects were superb. People will look over their shoulder long after they leave the theater. The little boy will give nightmares too some.With the reaction and size of the crowd, it just goes to show you that people like to be scared. Alfred Hitchcock &amp; Vincent Price would be proud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK people gather 'round. i'm about to tell you a tale of misery and woh...The Grudge trailers are lying to you! it's not as cool as it looks! before you waste your well earned money on this "movie", take this into consideration...if you have seen the ring,gothika,any freddy crougar movie, or any movie about the walking dead, then you've seen the grudge. This movie borrows every memorable scene, plot line, or moment from each of these movies. If you take out the word "tape" in 'the ring' and replace it with "the house", and put an actual person on the other end of the phone call, then you've got the grudge. Seriously, every time someone picked up the phone i swear i expected a small, wet, dead girl to respond "7 days....". Also, one scene in The Grudge bears a striking resemblance to Gothika. The first woman killed, Yoko, is somehow up and walking around again...very slowly...and very dead...not hearing the man calling her name. The walk is identical to that of the girl in Gothika. And in case i haven't convinced you yet, Karen(sarah michelle gellar) is in her apartment or something when "the grudge" (or whatever you want to call the little spirit girl there) comes to get her. Being the stereotypical horror scene that it is, Karen runs like a scared little girl into her bed, and pulls the sheets over her. At this point, all the young, annoying girls in the theatre are screaming because something is moving slowly up Karen's bed (under the sheets, of course). Karen lifts the sheets and...BY GOD! I THINK THAT'S THE LITTLE SPIRIT GIRL! Now how did she do that? Well, Karen sees the little spirit girl and then everyone's screaming and there's that annoying high-pitched horror movie sound going on, and Karen just kinda disappears into the bed. Needless to say, Freddy. The Grudge may have been better if, i don't know, THEY GAVE YOU MORE INFORMATION BEFORE IT ALL GETS SUMMED UP IN 10 SECONDS IN A RANDOM VISION BY THE MAIN Character. Seriously, it's not a good movie when the entire background information gets shown in a random 10-15 second black and white vision, that karen isn't even in(and might i add she's the one having said vision), all to the tune of a random corpse just kinda...hanging there, and banging against the wall. Oh, and before she goes into the banging corpse room, it's making an ever-louder 'thud'. Jurassic park? I think so. All they needed was the glass of water. Or better yet they should have had the Kool-Aid guy burst in with his trademark "OHH YEAH!". Anything to make the scared little kids stop screaming at the visuals, which i will admit, were creepy at times, and creepy at best. Cheap tricks. Makes you jump, you know?I had high hopes for this film. Very high. Sadly though, my hopes were brutally murdered like the stereotypical Japanese horror film characters in it. And they always seem to have the need to look for the source of this 'bang' or that 'thud'. And they die. Well, that's what you get, stupid.Overall: *.5/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly creepy and nightmare-inducing version of "Lost in Translation"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had one of the best times I've ever had at the movies last night watching "The Grudge." I wouldn't say it was brilliant film. The low-budget look and PG-13 rating combined with the fact that the audience was filled with teenagers definitely contributed to an overall B-Movie vibe. But, DAMN, was this movie scary! Even though it's not as high-budget as "The Ring," or as densely plotted, it compares favorably (if you're one of those retarded Americans who HAS to compare one Japanese horror-inspired remake to another). What "The Grudge" has going on in its favor is an unmistakable and potent aura of creepiness and unpleasantness underscoring some of the most intensely orchestrated shocks in recent memory. I saw it in a packed house and I can't even begin to describe the screaming, gasping, and shrieking that went on around me. It's been a long time since I've seen an exceedingly well-crafted and skillfully made horror film. This one definitely comes VERY close to being just that.</fullReview>

Stephen Susco's script, here, doesn't have her doing a whole whole lot, so most of her acting's got to be in the eyes. Unfortunately, all we get is a look of innocence, or a look of consternation. Lazy performance. And, the film is too mild-mannered for its own good, anyway. There are scares -- one in particular, with Gellar taking a bus home, reminded me I had a pulse -- only few, and far between. Anyone who can explain why the ghost kills certain people, while only scaring others into catatonia, wins a prize.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Great &amp; Fun Roller-coaster Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Great scary movie! Keeps the suspense and thrill throughout. Just accept that the supernaturals do have powers in this film, and you will find this a truly fun roller-coaster ride!!It keeps you wanna scream and laugh and engaged at the same time. It is funny cos you know that the ghosts are just so fake and unrealistic, but then the music and the way it was shot keeps you engaged, makes you wanna hold your breath at lots of points.Watch this in the theatre or a place with big screen and good sound system. Try not to watch this if you have jobs that does door-to-door surveys or in-house visits, or if you are prone to heart attacks, otherwise, this won't haunt you like when you stand in front of the TV at night after you watch &lt;The Ring&gt;, but it gives you a good heart/lung muscles exercise, and you will find yourself having lots of fun in the theatre!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horror Film The Way It Should Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love scary movies, and this is a great one. The film makers did a fantastic job. It had all the ingredients of a classic horror movie. Creepy characters, suspense, and spooky music. It kept me guessing the whole time. Sarah Michelle Gellar, could she be the new Jamie Lee Curtis? I'm not sure if she wants to be the new scream queen. She would be fine though. She could also be compared to Neve Campbell, and her work in the "Scream" series. The effects were superb. People will look over their shoulder long after they leave the theater. The little boy will give nightmares too some.With the reaction and size of the crowd, it just goes to show you that people like to be scared. Alfred Hitchcock &amp; Vincent Price would be proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest Movie i have ever seen!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though i am a huge fan of sarah michelle gellar (Buffy), i went to this movie for one reason alone... it's almost Halloween and i wanted at least one good scare this year. And BOY DID I GET IT!!!! From the second the movie started i could tell that it was going to be very suspenseful. What i didn't realize was that i was going to be terrified throughout as well and half covering my eyes and biting my nails all while either sitting wayyyy back in my seat or on the very edge of my seat in complete fear of what was going to happen next. Don't watch this movie alone (because by the end, you may not be alone... hehehe). The sound affects were superb and will probably haunt me till my dying day. And people... fear YOKO. When you see the movie... you will understand. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 just because it actually scared the living crap out of me from beginning to end (and even right now). Which is something i haven't been able to say in over a decade. WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE BRAVE AND Don't MIND NEAR CRAPPING YOUR PANTIES.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK people gather 'round. i'm about to tell you a tale of misery and woh...The Grudge trailers are lying to you! it's not as cool as it looks! before you waste your well earned money on this "movie", take this into consideration...if you have seen the ring,gothika,any freddy crougar movie, or any movie about the walking dead, then you've seen the grudge. This movie borrows every memorable scene, plot line, or moment from each of these movies. If you take out the word "tape" in 'the ring' and replace it with "the house", and put an actual person on the other end of the phone call, then you've got the grudge. Seriously, every time someone picked up the phone i swear i expected a small, wet, dead girl to respond "7 days....". Also, one scene in The Grudge bears a striking resemblance to Gothika. The first woman killed, Yoko, is somehow up and walking around again...very slowly...and very dead...not hearing the man calling her name. The walk is identical to that of the girl in Gothika. And in case i haven't convinced you yet, Karen(sarah michelle gellar) is in her apartment or something when "the grudge" (or whatever you want to call the little spirit girl there) comes to get her. Being the stereotypical horror scene that it is, Karen runs like a scared little girl into her bed, and pulls the sheets over her. At this point, all the young, annoying girls in the theatre are screaming because something is moving slowly up Karen's bed (under the sheets, of course). Karen lifts the sheets and...BY GOD! I THINK THAT'S THE LITTLE SPIRIT GIRL! Now how did she do that? Well, Karen sees the little spirit girl and then everyone's screaming and there's that annoying high-pitched horror movie sound going on, and Karen just kinda disappears into the bed. Needless to say, Freddy. The Grudge may have been better if, i don't know, THEY GAVE YOU MORE INFORMATION BEFORE IT ALL GETS SUMMED UP IN 10 SECONDS IN A RANDOM VISION BY THE MAIN Character. Seriously, it's not a good movie when the entire background information gets shown in a random 10-15 second black and white vision, that karen isn't even in(and might i add she's the one having said vision), all to the tune of a random corpse just kinda...hanging there, and banging against the wall. Oh, and before she goes into the banging corpse room, it's making an ever-louder 'thud'. Jurassic park? I think so. All they needed was the glass of water. Or better yet they should have had the Kool-Aid guy burst in with his trademark "OHH YEAH!". Anything to make the scared little kids stop screaming at the visuals, which i will admit, were creepy at times, and creepy at best. Cheap tricks. Makes you jump, you know?I had high hopes for this film. Very high. Sadly though, my hopes were brutally murdered like the stereotypical Japanese horror film characters in it. And they always seem to have the need to look for the source of this 'bang' or that 'thud'. And they die. Well, that's what you get, stupid.Overall: *.5/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly creepy and nightmare-inducing version of "Lost in Translation"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had one of the best times I've ever had at the movies last night watching "The Grudge." I wouldn't say it was brilliant film. The low-budget look and PG-13 rating combined with the fact that the audience was filled with teenagers definitely contributed to an overall B-Movie vibe. But, DAMN, was this movie scary! Even though it's not as high-budget as "The Ring," or as densely plotted, it compares favorably (if you're one of those retarded Americans who HAS to compare one Japanese horror-inspired remake to another). What "The Grudge" has going on in its favor is an unmistakable and potent aura of creepiness and unpleasantness underscoring some of the most intensely orchestrated shocks in recent memory. I saw it in a packed house and I can't even begin to describe the screaming, gasping, and shrieking that went on around me. It's been a long time since I've seen an exceedingly well-crafted and skillfully made horror film. This one definitely comes VERY close to being just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Never Forgets And Neither Will You (VERY MINOR SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see The Grudge with three of my friends. Even though I am a long (long, long, long) time die-hard horror film aficionado, I (for the first time ever) found the movie so frightening, I was almost in tears. While my best friend agreed with me, the two other friends with us did not find it particularly scary at all. I was shocked to hear them say this until I realized what was going on. Those two friends had seen the 2004 remake of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and left the theater in a similar state to the one I was in after "The Grudge". While I found "TCM" to be an excellent and devoted re-visioning, it did not scare me in the least...just like the original version was an excellent film but not frightening (in my opinion).Those two friends are terrified by "real life" (i.e. nothing supernatural) blood and gore films. That sub-genre of horror is everything "The Grudge" is not. Instead, "The Grudge" represents everything that has frightened me and haunted my imagination since I was a child. It is an unrelenting barrage of humans who open their mouths to release completely inhuman sounds (that literally make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end), people walking down dark hallways with a lurching limp or with their heads rolled impossibly far to one side, children who appear sweet and innocent only to look subtly inhuman and undeniably demonic upon closer view, things that are not under the bed but already in the bed waiting for you, evil that will unquestionably win in the end...it's only a matter of how much Hell you are willing to put yourself through until that defeat occurs. What makes these things (and the film as a whole) so terrifying to me is that in all of these figments of the darker recesses of imagination lies the inherent realization that they are not so completely far-fetched that they could never actually happen. They are all ordinary things that take on a sinister new personality by simply enhancing or omitting a single characteristic of the norm. This is made all the better by the tradition of Japanese filmmakers to leave it up to the audience to decide the full reasons behind the events rather than spell everything out for us...a practice not forgotten in this remake. If this type of Twilight Zone-ish horror is your cup of tea, then you will leave this film feeling as though you may never sleep with both eyes shut again. When on of the victims slowly turns around to reveal a greatly contorted mouth missing the lower jaw, I felt the need to look behind me to make sure she wasn't occupying any nearby theater seats. That is something that never crossed my mind during "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERTBefore beginning I'll admit that I did not want to see this film but was dragged to it so I myself had a grudge against it and thus am not totally impartial on seeing it. Still, I should have guessed from the previews and word of mouth that this was going to suck.The story does not make any sense in that those who enter the house die. If this is true, what about the real estate guy? The detective's assistant and the other cops there doing forensic evidence? Also I had a problem with the fact that NOBODY TURNS ON THE LIGHTS! Although I have not yet seen feardotcom (which is supposed to be god-awful) from what I have heard this film parallels it in that these characters also neglect to turn on the lights.But these are minor: the main problems are the story and editing. It was very confusing with the rapid cuts and jumping around of narrative - I understood everything that happened at the end, but I had to do too much piecework to make it make sense, and there are still huge loopholes. Worse, this really detracts from the characters in that you don't care about them since we see them so briefly and then they appear quickly and die - they just seemed like fodder for the house and didn't really have any personal life, goals, meaningful relationships, etc. And if you're going to have a haunted house, make it look scary not sterile and cold and boring like this one.This may also explain why I couldn't find it scary because the cuts happened so often that you didn't a chance to buildup the anticipation - not to mention the transitions themselves (i.e. constant dips to black at the end of every scene) were overused and at strange points. To top it off, the film goes through a checklist of horror clichés (girl in shower, people sticking parts into dangerous places despite knowing something is wrong, hearing scary noises and heading towards them are just a few). Lastly the overused sound "jumps" where a scary noise is put in was distracting and the kid who meows like a cat was just plain hilarious though I don't think this was the intent. And for the ending, well, if you couldn't see that coming (or any of the "scares") a mile away I have some swampland in Florida I'd like to sell you.There were some good things about it in that the sound and music edits were great and so was the lighting (when it chose to make a cameo). The acting wasn't bad but the script didn't require much more than delivering lines or breathing hard to indicate fear. Also, the remake/adaptation doesn't much matter it took place in Japan and seems like a lot more could have been done. And why did nobody else in the area know of the multiple deaths in the house? Don't try to make sense of this movie, in fact, ignore it altogether and rent something else.FINAL VERDICT: IGNORE */***** (1/5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>US vs. Japanese version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MAJOR SPOILERS... sorry, read another post if you want mild spoilers!!! i wanna talk about what they left out, what they included, and what they took from the Japanese films. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *i went to the 7:50pm showing on opening night. I'm gonna be real blunt about what i liked, didn't, and what i think they could have done to make it better.WHAT I LIKED: -you really felt like it was a Japanese movie, not a botched up American cast mingling with Japanese people. i like how sarah michelle gellar greeted/spoke to a lot of extras in Japanese, and the extras were speaking in Japanese. the film was shot beautifully, keeping that mood through colors and light that the original theatrical version had.-many shots were taken from the original theatrical version, almost identical. i liked that a lot. you saw more of the house in this movie.-did toshio not age or did they find a kid that looked EXACTLY like him?? haha. well, the saeki family was the original cast which was dope.-they borrowed a LOT from the first TV version (jawless girl) i thought that was soooo tight the way they did this. it wasn't the same character, but i was totally thrown off and it was a NICE surprise for those who have seen the originals. i also kinda liked the change up from the bathroom scene w/ the security camera, to the fire escape.WHAT I Didn't LIKE: -***PG fricken 13!!!. this movie could have been as HOT AS THE ORIGINAL if they would have showed as much of the ghosts as the Japanese versions did. i thought it was extremely weak totally CUTTING most of the scene of kayoko crawling down the steps. they also cgi'd her a little bit when she was making that jerky motion** (**this also, imo, ruined little girl's debut in "the ring" because in "ringu", it was MUCH more disturbing to have a real girl coming out a real TV. not a pixeled, staticy one!)-the ending!!! they slaughtered it! good lord! totally sets you up for a sequel. corny ass Americans, ha i bet, wouldn't be able to stomach sarah michelle in a bodybag in the attic.-the flashback to the family's murder: again, WHY couldn't this have been rated R?? the explanation was short and really eliminated any emotion you built up through the movie to find out WHAT happened in that house.COULD HAVE DONE TO MAKE IT BETTER: -once again, AN "R" rating!!!!!!-way more camera time for the dead.-not enough deaths-by-ghosts. i really thought they were gonna split it into chapters like the Japanese version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O.K., heres the thing. I am the kinda guy who sits through horror/thriller movies and laughs, but this... This movie was just the scariest movie I have ever seen in my life. The images and disturbing pictures made me literally paranoid last night. Every time I closed my eyes, the image would be in my mind and make me jump. This must sound pathetic to all readers but it's true. I've never seen the original movie, but after this, I don't want to. Now to the scenes. The parts I did like about the movie were that the special effects were amazing. The Computer Generated Images were out of this world and the intense shocks throughout the film make you jump. The plot was good and it was just a plain out scary movie fro a PG-13 rating. Now for the parts I disliked. Here comes a mere SPOILER. There were horrible/awful faces in it that made me cry. Blood was everywhere in the movie, and the images were just really scary. Another thing I disliked was that I couldn't understand who was who and I couldn't understand the theme/concept to the movie. It was really confusing and I wasn't the only one to think so. The other 500 people in the audience all said at the end at the same time: "What the heck is this?... I don't understand." It was a good movie, but scary and confusing. Now I'm not trying to ruin the ratings here but anyone with half a brain after reading this will know not to see it, but out of a ten star rating, I'd give it a seven. This was my movie review for The Grudge. Remember all, "When a curse is born, and it sees you, THERE'S NO ESCAPE!" Take care. :)</fullReview>

Nothing really new here that hasn't been done before. Some of the the"special" effects really weren't very special. I'll keep it vague in order to prevent spoilers. Even the ending was predictable.Pluses: Some general startling moments, and some nice little freak-outsMinuses: Freak-outs repetitive and over used. Most things were telegraphed way too far ahead, predictable.See it if you're into cheap thrills.

		<fullReview>DO NOT see The Drudge...I mean The Grudge. Sarah Michelle Geller would have done better calling in Scooby Doo. At least he would have the sense not to do the stupid things she did and you'd know that this really IS suppose to be a comedy. (the audience was laughing at some of the scenes meant to be scary). It's like The Rings ugly step child and you're actually glad that the ghost from The Ring can still find work after her first awful movie. Like The Ring, it relied on cheap scare tactics that you could see coming from a mile away. The only thing The Grudge needed was a "this 1000 pound horse seems to be scared of me, let me try to befriend it even though it doesn't seem to like me and could trample me to death" scene like The Ring and they would be undistinguishable movies. Ted Rami...or wait...I mean William Mapother (they were almost identical twins in the movie) needs to pass Acting 101. "Enter kitchen, acknowledge wife, say 'good morning', turn towards box, acknowledge box, look in box, see mug wrapped in news paper, acknowledge mug in paper, un-wrap, notice sports article on paper, acknowledge article..." ad nausea. And Takako Fuji ( the detective) needs to stay away from the William Shatner Acting School for Actors Wishing to be in Godzilla Movies. The scene where he tells Geller that she is dammed to hell and will die takes place on the roof of the police building and he delivers it so dry and mater of fact the you expect (nay, hope!) Geller will just toss herself off the roof and end the movie right then and there. However it goes on to the trite ending of her boyfriend is dead; she tried to, but didn't succeed, to burn the house down and then the hackneyed "morgue" scene where you see that she is still haunted by the ghost. YAWN!!!!! The funniest part of the movie was where Yoko comes back from the dead, ( Yoko is the first nurse hired by the Williams family to take care of their sick mother) and she's jerking through the hospital where she use to work (like something from Michael Jackson's Thriller) and her boss comes across her and keeps calling to her. As she turned around, someone from the audience shouted, "Yoko! OH NO!" totally busting up the audience and thankfully spoiling the scare scene. This movie relies on its special effects, because it has no plot. The only redeeming quality was you get to see some of Tokyo. DO NOT see this movie, or at least go to one of those multi-plex theaters and go see another good movie and then afterwards sneak into this move to see how bad it actually is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MUCH BETTER THAN THE RING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with many of the other viewers who have found this movie much better that THE RING. In fact, I rate this movie an 8 on a scale of 10. Personally, I found THE RING somewhat hokie. But, as someone who considers THE FOG a horror classic (guess I am dating myself); I thoroughly enjoyed this film.Since Hollywood considers films such as the Friday THE 13TH series &amp; FREDDY KRUGER series the best in modern day horror genre; I found this film quite refreshing. It lacked the usual "slasher for the sake of gore" mentality. Though you were often thinking to yourself, "No don't go in there"; as another viewer pointed out characters are not supposed to know that they are in a horror movie. So, even though you are thinking those thoughts it doesn't minimize the rationality of the characters actions or thought processes.I feel that the flash back sequences helped to establish the "history" of the curse &amp; though somewhat disjointed, this worked for me. While my partner criticized that many of the "jump" scenes frequently faded to black; as another friend pointed out that this effect helped you to re-establish reality/calm down before the next scene.Again, if you are looking for a scary movie that is not cast from the general slasher mold; then I feel that you will enjoy THE GRUDGE.</fullReview>

It's just a run to the mill flash flick horror.As a mature movie watcher I can see why it was rated PG-13. It's not ment for the intelligent movie watchers.

I knew that this movie was going to be scary, but when your sitting there, eating popcorn, and not knowing what comes up...it comes up!!(if you know what I mean). Personally, I'm a huge horror fan, there's a lot of movies that scare me to death, but then the night of the Grudge. No other movie in my opinion can reach such a spooky, disturbing, fightening, terrifying, creepy atmospheric level. If you haven't seen this movie yet, and you've seen The Ring and thought that was the scariest movie, see The Grudge, you will pee your pants until it leaks through. I give this movie a 10/10. I know that sounds like really crazy, but I thought the movie was really good and creepy that I really really like it. A definite Top 10 for my favorite scary movies. I recommend this movie no less than the age of 11, anyone under will like seriously have nightmares. But it's only my advice, so whatever...The Grudge is an awesome movie. GO SEE IT!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE SIXTH SENSE MEETS LOST IN TRANSLATION</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE GUDGE is a decent horror flick that could have been better without the split personality. It's based on the Japanese film Ju-on: The Grudge (2003). In the American version, the filmmakers apparently took the easy way out and stapled Lost in Translation (2003) to the front of the script.PART 1: LOST IN TRANSLATION: As a result, the first third of the movie mirrors Lost in Translation's frozen inaction and snail's pace. It's so boring I almost walked out and serves no purpose except to awkwardly splice Caucasians into an Asian movie.These elements also kill plot development. Dialogue is minimized because much of the early talking is subtitled Japanese. As a result we learn very little about the characters and develop few feelings for them. Most are bland anyway. One is an even accountant! The location is similarly wasted. Any local color that could explain why the movie should take place in Japan is abandoned in favor of generic city shots.PART II: SIXTH SENSE: But once The Grudge shifts in The Sixth Sense (1999) mode, things improve rapidly. The movie mimics the Sixth Sense's style of shadows and quick cuts of the horror to keep us scared and guessing when the next fright will strike. And the movie does deliver the chills.So if you're willing to put up with a very slow start, The Grudge will take you to a fine frightful finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Previews Enhance It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie wasn't one of the worst horror movies that I've ever seen, but it wasn't really the best. But, when I come to think of it, I can't say that I've ever seen a REALLY good scary movie. The previews on TV definitely make it out to be a scarier movie then it really is, but it is still rather frightening in some parts, but laughable in some others. 'The Grudge' was a movie that I would definitely rent, but it's your call whether you go to see it or not. If you do go to see it, make sure that you don't sit near any giggly 10 year olds... they'll scream at every part, because it is the kind of movie that makes you jump. Oh, and if you have a sensitivity to high pitch noises, or repeative moaning, then this movie isn't for you. I'd rate 'The Grudge' 8/10... You'll never enter your attic as carefree as you used to, and you'll find hiding under your covers doesn't do a heck of a lot of good...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just seen this movie this evening. Don't waste your money. A few screen flashes and some intense music, WOW, what a horror flick. I still have no clue as to what this movie was about or it's purpose. I can't say the acting was bad, and the cinematography wasn't that bad either, there was no plot. It's just a run to the mill flash flick horror.As a mature movie watcher I can see why it was rated PG-13. It's not ment for the intelligent movie watchers. More for the simple minded.My two cents,Disappointed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of all of the scary movies I have ever seen, i would have to say that this, by far, was definitely the best! It kept me on the edge of my seat from the very beginning to the end. I have never screamed during any movie(ever)and now my voice is fading because I screamed so much. I was terrified, and I loved it! Overall one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I can't wait to watch it again, and I definitely will. If you think The Ring was good, you'll love The Grudge. It was great trying to figure out exactly what was going on in the movie and I personally love movies that mess with my mind, and I love trying to uncover the mystery behind it all.

		<shortDescription>Not what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, I thought would have a really complex plot, like The Ring, or at least one you could grasp onto. It did not. It did have it's moments, scary parts where things jumped out or made creepy sounds. But I really wasn't catching onto it. I thought maybe the movie would have a great twist at the end or a good ending. This movie ended abruptly, without any answers, hopefully there will be a second (like the second Ju-On) that will fill in the gaps. The creepy parts were creative, but sometimes predictable... I like sarah michelle geller (sp?) more now though, which is saying quite a bit. The other characters were not developed enough, it seemed like the movie didn't last long enough for things to really get going. I thought the beginning was scary, but the ending wasn't. It all depends on what scares you, this one didn't do it for me. Although my sister says she is going to have nightmares, I probably won't. All in all, I give this movie a 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It wasn't that scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know about anyone else, but I watched it and I wasn't at all scared. By the way, i'm a girly girl. Seriously, the grudge did not terrorize me like it did the guy sitting beside me. What the heck? I must be braver than I thought. I was hoping for something to happen the entire time. Every time I thought something was going to happen, nothing did. For example, there was this very suspenseful part with the scary girl, and it turned out to be VERY blah. But, do you know why it wasn't scary, though? the film focused on the scary girl and you saw the details in her face. I would have been more scared if I only saw flashes of her face. Let me explain with this: you know strobe lights? When people walk towards you under a strobe light, you see 1/3 of their movement and you are distracted by the strobes. Thus, when they are right in your face, it freaks you out because it didn't look like they were walking that fast. Anyways, if you see the details of the movement, you feel like "Yeah, you're walking towards me. Hmm, kinda slow aren'tcha? I think I'll just run away now."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a good crossbreed of Japanese and American films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like a lot of the neo-Japanese films because they dare to push the envelope. Take films like "Audition" (makes "Fatal Attraction" look sloppy) or even "Zatoichi" (which mix the ancient with the new). But there are neo-Japanese films that become redundant, like "Tomie". So when I heard "The Grudge", which was based on the Japanese film of the similar name, was coming out and it was directed by the same director of the Japanese film, I was definitely intrigued.Just came from the film, and it pretty much sucked. Yeah, sucked. Though I liked the photography (by Hideo Yamamoto of "Ichi the Killer" and "Audition") and the fact that Ryo Ishibashi, the main actor from "Audition", was in it, the rest of this movie just falls more into the American schlock-shock fest. Though the concept had great potential, we kind of get the idea from the 1st 30 minutes what is going on. On top of this, put in the usual scary faces, violin shrieks, and the little gremlin who meows creepy, and you got your general teen shock flick. Sarah Michelle Gellar really does not add much to the film, not to mention that her and her fiancée's part were really unnecessary in the film. This could have been explored more from the Japanese detective's point of view (no, this is not a spoiler). I really cannot recommend this film unless you're easily scared. Half the theatre was laughing (kind of like "Exorcist IV"). The movie had potential to be a good crossbreed of Neo-Japanese and American film, but failed miserably secondary to the greater emphasis on cheap American scare tactics and less development/innovation on the Japanese part. Even more disappointing is the fact that Sam Raimi, the great "Evil Dead" I and II director, actually produced this garbage.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Grudge' has scenes that will make you jump. It also contains scenes and sequences that will make those hairs on the back of your neck stand up and your skin tingle. The movie is full of energy, flows well, and doesn't contain any dull moments. I thought it was not only more frightening than 'The Ring', it was a better movie overall. If you are a fan of this type of horror genre, you'll enjoy this movie.*SPOILERS*Do not read unless you've seen the movie!There was one scene in this movie that really scared the hell out of me, and it was by far the scariest out of any movie - ever.

		<fullReview>this movie was not bad. i had to keep my hand over my mouth to not scream a couple of times. The ending could've been better. Many parts of the movies were scarier than others, and the beginning was sort of confusing. The thing it most reminded me of was darkness falls meets The Ring. One thing I didn't like about this movie was (SPOILERS AHEAD) that if they knew the curse was in that house, why not destroy it? I mean the one cop tried that one time but he didn't have to go inside the house to set it on fire.. that could of been done outside too. Good movie to take the family Halloween weekend. I give it a 7 out of 10. Can't wait till it hits DVD. desiree.</fullReview>

The demographic of the audience was 17-20 years old and the smell of alcohol was hard to ignore. Just a bunch of partiers out at a cheap thrill movie laughing too loud at what seemed like unremarkable Japanese characters* but also powerfully startled and screaming bloody murder during the scarier parts. Sarah Michelle Gellar was bland, as was her boyfriend in the movie. Still, the good directing made it a nasty little package that will now have people scared of their attics.*Anyone think these characters were silly? I didn't. It's no Godzilla movie, surely.

		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing the movie with a friend. Still quite scared. We both got a nice startle from a guy smoking in a dark doorway, wearing all black.

It is a good American translation, from what I've seen and know about other originalJapanese horror films and their American counterparts.I did have a question, but maybe it will become clear to me after some thought. Who held the grudge against whom? Because if you think about it, the womanpretty much brought it on herself, becoming obsessed with her son's teacher,not to mention having a diary filled with his name and a photo (everyone finds it eventually). Not to say that she deserved being killed, but I'm sure the thinkers out there get what I'm saying. And, I haven't even looked into it, but is "grudge" a literal translation of ju-on, etc., etc. The questions all follow each other.Leaving the theater, there were many people disappointed, but I'm sure they do not understand or appreciate the difference in American and Japanese horror.I personally prefer psychological terror to the slasher bloodbaths.

		<shortDescription>I now have a grudge, against the person(s) responsible for this abomination of film-making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this "film" Wednesday night as part of an advanced screening and although it was free i still feel the need to request my money back or at least some sort of compensation for the 90 minutes of my life that were lost watching this tragedy. For one thing the plot sucked. oh wait, THERE WAS NO PLOT! What!?! a person is murdered so they in turn murder anyone who enters the place they were murdered? what? how ridiculous can you get? Not to mention how the deaths in the film take place *semi-spoiler* approximately 8 innocent people are killed by the ring hybrid characters (more on that in a minute) except for one person, he is killed by one of the earlier victims of the main killers, THIS MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WHATSOEVER!!! its like the main killers decided this guy wasn't worth their time so they sent yoko to do it for them, soooooo stupid.And lets not forget about the striking similarity to the ring. Namely the main "villains" of the "film." its basically like they took that little girl and split her into 2 characters. 1: they aged her about 26 years but kept the dirty white dress/nightgown/whatever and the long, dirty hair that covers her face that is so scary blah blah. 2: they kept the young creepy child but turned her into a little boy that meows like a cat for some strange, stupid and unsurprizingly unexplained reason. According to the radio personality that introduced the film to us this has been hailed as the "scariest movie in Japanese history." if that's true then my opinion of Japanese taste, especially when it comes to film, is that they have horrible if no taste whatsoever.One last thing, this film can be best summed up by two comments i heard random people in the theater spout out after one of the main "scary" scenes.the soccer mom looking lady next to me said "oh my god i think I'm going to cry" while about 2 rows back i heard someone else say "sooo stupid." a phrase that not only can be used to describe the "film" but anyone who would actually enjoy the film. good day and save your money for the love of god DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I now have a grudge, against the person(s) responsible for this abomination of film-making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this "film" Wednesday night as part of an advanced screening and although it was free i still feel the need to request my money back or at least some sort of compensation for the 90 minutes of my life that were lost watching this tragedy. For one thing the plot sucked. oh wait, THERE WAS NO PLOT! What!?! a person is murdered so they in turn murder anyone who enters the place they were murdered? what? how ridiculous can you get? Not to mention how the deaths in the film take place *semi-spoiler* approximately 8 innocent people are killed by the ring hybrid characters (more on that in a minute) except for one person, he is killed by one of the earlier victims of the main killers, THIS MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WHATSOEVER!!! its like the main killers decided this guy wasn't worth their time so they sent yoko to do it for them, soooooo stupid.And lets not forget about the striking similarity to the ring. Namely the main "villains" of the "film." its basically like they took that little girl and split her into 2 characters. 1: they aged her about 26 years but kept the dirty white dress/nightgown/whatever and the long, dirty hair that covers her face that is so scary blah blah. 2: they kept the young creepy child but turned her into a little boy that meows like a cat for some strange, stupid and unsurprizingly unexplained reason. According to the radio personality that introduced the film to us this has been hailed as the "scariest movie in Japanese history." if that's true then my opinion of Japanese taste, especially when it comes to film, is that they have horrible if no taste whatsoever.One last thing, this film can be best summed up by two comments i heard random people in the theater spout out after one of the main "scary" scenes.the soccer mom looking lady next to me said "oh my god i think I'm going to cry" while about 2 rows back i heard someone else say "sooo stupid." a phrase that not only can be used to describe the "film" but anyone who would actually enjoy the film. good day and save your money for the love of god DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, I thought would have a really complex plot, like The Ring, or at least one you could grasp onto. It did not. It did have it's moments, scary parts where things jumped out or made creepy sounds. But I really wasn't catching onto it. I thought maybe the movie would have a great twist at the end or a good ending. This movie ended abruptly, without any answers, hopefully there will be a second (like the second Ju-On) that will fill in the gaps. The creepy parts were creative, but sometimes predictable... I like sarah michelle geller (sp?) more now though, which is saying quite a bit. The other characters were not developed enough, it seemed like the movie didn't last long enough for things to really get going. I thought the beginning was scary, but the ending wasn't. It all depends on what scares you, this one didn't do it for me. Although my sister says she is going to have nightmares, I probably won't. All in all, I give this movie a 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It wasn't that scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know about anyone else, but I watched it and I wasn't at all scared. By the way, i'm a girly girl. Seriously, the grudge did not terrorize me like it did the guy sitting beside me. What the heck? I must be braver than I thought. I was hoping for something to happen the entire time. Every time I thought something was going to happen, nothing did. For example, there was this very suspenseful part with the scary girl, and it turned out to be VERY blah. But, do you know why it wasn't scary, though? the film focused on the scary girl and you saw the details in her face. I would have been more scared if I only saw flashes of her face. Let me explain with this: you know strobe lights? When people walk towards you under a strobe light, you see 1/3 of their movement and you are distracted by the strobes. Thus, when they are right in your face, it freaks you out because it didn't look like they were walking that fast. Anyways, if you see the details of the movement, you feel like "Yeah, you're walking towards me. Hmm, kinda slow aren'tcha? I think I'll just run away now."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a good crossbreed of Japanese and American films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like a lot of the neo-Japanese films because they dare to push the envelope. Take films like "Audition" (makes "Fatal Attraction" look sloppy) or even "Zatoichi" (which mix the ancient with the new). But there are neo-Japanese films that become redundant, like "Tomie". So when I heard "The Grudge", which was based on the Japanese film of the similar name, was coming out and it was directed by the same director of the Japanese film, I was definitely intrigued.Just came from the film, and it pretty much sucked. Yeah, sucked. Though I liked the photography (by Hideo Yamamoto of "Ichi the Killer" and "Audition") and the fact that Ryo Ishibashi, the main actor from "Audition", was in it, the rest of this movie just falls more into the American schlock-shock fest. Though the concept had great potential, we kind of get the idea from the 1st 30 minutes what is going on. On top of this, put in the usual scary faces, violin shrieks, and the little gremlin who meows creepy, and you got your general teen shock flick. Sarah Michelle Gellar really does not add much to the film, not to mention that her and her fiancée's part were really unnecessary in the film. This could have been explored more from the Japanese detective's point of view (no, this is not a spoiler). I really cannot recommend this film unless you're easily scared. Half the theatre was laughing (kind of like "Exorcist IV"). The movie had potential to be a good crossbreed of Neo-Japanese and American film, but failed miserably secondary to the greater emphasis on cheap American scare tactics and less development/innovation on the Japanese part. Even more disappointing is the fact that Sam Raimi, the great "Evil Dead" I and II director, actually produced this garbage.4/10</fullReview>

The movie is full of energy, flows well, and doesn't contain any dull moments. I thought it was not only more frightening than 'The Ring', it was a better movie overall. If you are a fan of this type of horror genre, you'll enjoy this movie.*SPOILERS*Do not read unless you've seen the movie!There was one scene in this movie that really scared the hell out of me, and it was by far the scariest out of any movie - ever.

		<fullReview>this movie was not bad. i had to keep my hand over my mouth to not scream a couple of times. The ending could've been better. Many parts of the movies were scarier than others, and the beginning was sort of confusing. The thing it most reminded me of was darkness falls meets The Ring. One thing I didn't like about this movie was (SPOILERS AHEAD) that if they knew the curse was in that house, why not destroy it? I mean the one cop tried that one time but he didn't have to go inside the house to set it on fire.. that could of been done outside too. Good movie to take the family Halloween weekend. I give it a 7 out of 10. Can't wait till it hits DVD. desiree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, it's scary. One jump after the next with some great scare tactics to make you wet your pants. I have to hand it to the lack of gore horror, it's great. The movie was...however...not. A scattered plot, a sea of death...it was basically a slasher with no sex or blood. (spoilers ahead)...Now, there are some definitely haunting images. The girl, of course, has that look of panic, and you're never quite sure what it is she's after, but the whole stair scene is just creepy, she makes it work. The desperation that she has to kill is something that isn't seen in many monster films anymore, and I do note this is a monster movie. Yoko missing a jaw...that one is going to give me nightmares. It was a short scene, albeit a haunting one, but not completely unpredictable. That was most definitely the problem, the movie was FAR too predictable. If you've ever scene a jumpy movie, then you'll know far in advance when something is going to jump out at you. The creaking sound is creepy, but never given reason, which makes it less scary. A great sound effect, but the editing team and writer could have taken lessons from the team that did the remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", or the various Friday the 13th movies. If you have a scary sound, use it wisely. Basically, this will appeal to any idiot who wants to scream their heads off and have steamy sex afterwards, but for anyone who is looking for a well-plotted intelligent film, I'll be waiting for "The Ring 2" with you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an exchange student in Tokyo, Japan, is sent to her first assignment to care for an elderly American woman whose nurse didn't show up for work. After getting lost, Karen finally locates the house. The front door is open and Karen enters the home, and finds the house in a mess and apparently empty. Soon she discovers her patient Emma (Grace Zabriskie), the American woman who has been lost in a catatonic state for years, lying on the floor in the downstairs bedroom. Karen takes care of Emma and begins to clean up the house. Karen hears a noise upstairs and finds a young boy and black cat in a closet. She calls her boss and tells him the strange things that she has found. A supernatural force, 'the Grudge,' begins to frighten Karen and Emma, and then we have a flash back of the evil that was born in that house several years earlier. 'The Grudge' is known in Japan as a curse of one who dies in the grip of a powerful rage. Anyone who encounters the grudge is cursed to die horribly. The first part of the movie will be a little frightening to you, but the rest of the movie was kind of funny. The audience laughed at some of the scary scenes, and some people even made wisecracks during the movie, which were also funny. I think people laughed at the scary parts as a defense mechanism. For a horror movie, it didn't make the grade, at least at this screening. (Sony Pictures, Run time 1:36, Rated PG-13) (5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grudge, another over hyped let-down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't waste your time with this one. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a mediocre role, the supporting cast is even more mediocre, especially Bill Pullman who couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. Sarah Michelle Gellar is stuck in yet another I Know What Somebody Did Wrong Last Summer in this one, with Bill Pullman being the one who did something wrong. Only in this film the only thing Bill Pullman did wrong was just to simply be stalked by some suppressed Japanese housewife. Gellar's acting leaves something to desire, she should stick to being a tease as she was in Cruel Intentions. The special effects, makeup, and cinematography are ripped off from the Ring. Without sound effects and dark music this film is a real sleeper! Save your money, rent it when it gets to Blockbuster in December.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like creepie movies that will get some real laughs, some nervous laughs, and some real creepy times than this is the movie for you. If you don't like them creepie you should skip this one. The characters seemed well chosen, the acting mostly believable, the sets simple but effective, the story deep enough. If you liked "The Ring" you will probably like this movie, too -- the feel is similar. While I am not a huge fan of Sarah M. Gellar she did a credible job. Bull Pullman is credited but his part is pretty small. While there is the inevitable "why would you do that", it is far less common in this movie than it is in many movies in this genre. All in all, for this kind of movie I would rate it quite highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest movie I've seen in a theater, ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I have to agree that the crowd really ruined most of this movie for me, I do think it was a surprisingly great movie. I didn't like The Ring, or Ringu. Nothing creeped me out. I have to say I was actually rather disturbed by certain scenes. I won't ruin anything for anyone, but one word sums up all my feelings. Yoko. Everyone seemed to dislike how it ended. Personally, I don't know if anything else would have worked. To be honest with you, I love movies, and I even love movies that everyone else deems crap. So my opinion might not be helpful... nevertheless, I thought it was the scariest movie I'd ever seen in a theater (because, of course, I wasn't alive to see movies like The Exorcist or Mark of the Devil in theaters).You want to jump in yours seat, and think twice about getting under your covers tonight?

		<shortDescription>My Review on the Grudge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay first off there are definitely spoilers in this so if you haven't seen this film, do not read on. Also, this is just my opinion on the film. Okay anyway....First of all, if you haven't seen the original(s), then I definitely recommend you go see them before watching this. And also NEVER listen to the critics. They do not know s*** about movies...especially this one..They put this movie down so bad, that they put Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid way above this. I would just like to say though that I thought the film was overall alright. It wasn't bad, but I was very disappointed with this film. The other Ju-Ons were much better than this and are probably the scariest movies I have seen. DO NOT believe what you see in the trailers. Seeing the trailer totally brainwashes you into thinking that this movie is going to be the perfect horror film (but then again, what trailer does not do this). They cut out a lot of the parts in the trailer, as usual. Such as when Kayako (the female "ghost") is crawling down the stairs. In the movie, she does crawl down the stairs, but not the way in the trailer. She wears red in the trailer and looks freaky as hell, but in the actual movie, she wears white and you barely see her crawling down the stairs. In the original Ju-On The Grudge, the stairs scene lasts for what seems a long time and scares you every second, well to me at least. Some of the things they added in the movie were pretty freaky though. Such as the "jaw" scene which was taken from the TV Broadcast of Ju-On. Definitely one of the scariest scenes in the movie. There are other scenes in the movie that will surprise you and not be expected as well. For those of you who have seen the originals, I think that you will be disappointed. I don't know what Takashi Shimizu was thinking while re-making this film. He should have just overall made the same exact movie except with different cast and added some scenes. The people who are new to seeing this movie will probably like it a lot, but do us all a favor and go see the original and you will see why the ORIGINAL and the Japanese VERSIONS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE American RE-MAKE. Why does America always have to RUIN re-makes of excellent foreign films. I know it's the same director, but he wasn't the only one involved with re-making the movie. Anyway, it's worth checking out, but I was just so disappointed with this. It's alright, but could have been WAY better....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than The Ring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's great to see a Japanese horror movie remake actually kept in Japan. Though the protagonists are now gaijin in Tokyo I believe the story is more or less faithful to the original. (It should be since the same director made it.) The movie wasn't as scary as it was suspenseful. They didn't use gratuitous violence and special effects which was nice. Just good old-fashioned horror craft, adeptly using the viewer's imagination to fill in the blanks. I liked it better than the American Ring but that could be partially because I liked the Japanese setting. Some of the illogical things I didn't care for (like if a curse exists in a place, how can it show up halfway across Tokyo?) but I feel that way about just about any movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grudge Report</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I'm going to p*** a couple of people off with my review but hey, these are the breaks. I consider myself a fan and supporter of Asian horror movies. Ringu, The Eye, Ju-On, I love them all. I am also one of those people that has gotten a little annoyed with the remake happy system that Hollywood has adopted as of late but at the same time, I'd be lying if I told you that I hated the American remake of the Ring. In fact, I consider the Ring to be one of the best horror movies to come out of the system in a while and I also think it's just as good,if not better, than the original. Which brings me to the remake of Ju-On: The Grudge. I saw it last night at a midnight sneak preview and I'm writing this review on three and a half hours of sleep so cut me some slack. I saw the original a few months ago on DVD and I was pretty unnerved while watching it but at the same time I felt that it became a little confusing, especially near the end.Right off the bat, I'd say that the remake is much better than the original. In fact, I would stand up and yell it out right now if I didn't mind getting fired afterwards. I found the movie to be well made with better production values, better special effects and really just downright scarier. I love the idea of getting the original director to do his own remake. That, to me, shows respect for the source of the film. I've seen remakes and adaptations of movies where the only similarity to the original source was in the name and that's it. I think this strategy of hiring the original director is a step in the right direction. I also dig the fact that they filmed it in Japan as well. While there were slight changes made from the original in terms of story, they weren't anything for the purists to freak out about. In all honesty, I found that the changes to the story made it easier to follow. The plot is basically the same with some details added and some of the subplots left out. The storyline is still told in a nonlinear fashion and keeps you guessing until the very end but everything ties together pretty nicely. The acting was better than I expected and I was especially happy to see Bill Pullman in the movie, though his role is small. Sarah Michelle Gellar looked just as freaked out here as she did in Scream 2 but I thought she gave a decent performance. In terms of scares, I have to say that this movie kept me feeling uncomfortable the entire time I was watching it. Even though there were some scenes where I knew exactly what to expect, they changed it around enough to make it fresh. Even the scenes that were a direct lift off of the original were done much better, with some of the practical effects enhanced by CGI. I didn't really have any issues with the movie, although I was disappointed that one or two of the scenes from the original didn't make it into the remake in some form. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I think anyone with even the slightest appreciation for Asian horror films and horror films in general will like this movie. The crowd I was with loved it also. As far as remakes go, I would say this comes in just behind the Ring. Even though the Ring had far less shock scares, I just found that particular movie to be more frightening for some reason.RATING: ***1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night at a pre-screening where both Sarah and Jason attended for a few minutes, I had fun and everyone was eager to see this movies...and of course the actors.The ReviewI did not see Ju-On The Grudge, the Japanese version of The Grudge because I wanted to see this movie first and not sound like so many others who hate on remakes because they claim Americans / Hollywood damages everything, which is not always the case...like this movie.*******************************SPOILERS******************************The film starts out with Bill Pullman committing suicide because he witnessed the murder of the family that end up being the mommy ghost (Kayako) and the son (Toshio). The order in which the scenes are shown is random...first is Bill Pullman's character suicide, then 3 years later Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) comes to the house after a home nurse, Yoko, disappeared (killed by kayako) then it goes back to when the old lady and her kids (clea duvall;daughter in law, Kadee s.;daughter) move in then killed.The plot wasn't strong per say, but enough to lead you on through the whole movie, also the scare factor was high but very little gore or blood. Scary scenes pop up randomly and everyone's performance was great...even Ted Raimi (JOXER!) was good.Sarah was very good and played the victim part to the T, I was happy with it, excellent career move. Jason, Clea and the rest were also good and I agree that even though Sarah was the main attraction, it was an ensemble cast.This is my OWN Opinion but I guess a sequel might be done given Karen doesn't die, who knows.The scary scenes were a real thrill whether you scare easily or not. Things makes you scream...jump...or laugh but I can guarantee that you will have a great time.I give the movie a 4 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY take on the Grudge.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning: this is a mixed review, it is mixed because I had a mixed reaction to the film. This movie made me like it and hate it all at the same time and I think you will see why as you read on.)Now lest me start off by saying that I do not make it a habit to go online moments after seeing a movie and talk about it but on this occasion I am willing to make an exception. I have just attended a sneak preview of the new Sara Michelle Gellar movie the Grudge a remake of the Japanese film Ju-On: The Grudge. After seeing this movie this is what I have to say.This movie is great fun, it has a lot of moments that will build up the spook factor and make you jump right out of your seat, (I must add though that their where more times that most of the audience at this sneak preview where laughing rather than jumping out of their seats.) the special effects are solid and I must admit even as a veteran Horror buff I got a good scare and found the effect nice and eerie on more than one occasion. SO I am going to recommend that you go and see this movies but my approval comes with a strong disclaimer. I highly recommend that you go and see it if you that is if you just want to see a movie where you do not have to think too much. It has great plot twist and cleaver movies devices that would normally make for a great movie that is if there was a payday to those plot twits. This movie makes you think that you need to be thinking trying to find the clues and solve the puzzle but there is no puzzle and in the end no real plot. Leaving those who wanted to get into the mystery. There are gaping plot wholes, you never get any time to care or real even like any of the main characters and as I said the lack of any real sense of payoff to the story leaves one felling sad and unfulfilled. So in summation I will say this, if you want creepy spooky fun just for the sake of creepy spooky fun, by all means go see The Grudge. If you like to have a story to go along with that creepiness than do yourself a favor save a few buck and go to your local video store and rent any of the M Night Shyamalan movies or maybe the ring, and leave this movie to someone else to pay full price for till you can catch it on home video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb reported erroneously that "The Grudge" is the first foreign-language film to be remade by in English by its original filmmaker. Not true. France's Francis Veber made "Les Fugitfs" with Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard in 1986 and then went to Hollywood in 1989 to remake it in Engoish with Nick Nolte and Martin Short. Just a bit of trivia for you. As for the remake of "The Grudge," it is about a curse that leaves one who dies in the grip of a powerful rage, based by Takashi Shimizu on his "Ju-On." Those who encounter this murderous supernatural curse die and a new one is born, passe like a virus in an endless, growing chain of horror. It's virtually the same movie, kind of like what Gus Van Sant did with 'Psycho' a few years ago, only this new version stars Sarah Michelle Geller. 'The Grudge' is essentially just a haunted house movie, one involving a black cat, a kid who could be dead and a whirl of dark smoke in the form of a human, replete with mascara-lined eyes. This material tries to camouflage its nagging repetitiveness with a lot of confusing flashbacks. The one novel touch that Shimizu repeats here is that he keeps everything light and airy, not dark and dreary. Reviewing 'Ju-On,' I wondered how Shimizu could possibly remake it for American audiences, given that so much of the material seemed to be wrapped up in the Japanese culture. The filmmaker avoided that problem by simply not relocating his remake, keeping it in Japan and populating with mostly Asian actors. He uses Geller and the other few Caucasian actors here ? most notably Bill Pullman, Clea Duvall and Grace Zabriskie ? in a dramatically valid way as displaced people who are even more confounded by the bizarre terrors here than the locals are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twice as frightening as 'The Ring'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it may take some knocks for being derivative of that other Japanese remake, 'The Grudge' actually manages more chills thanks primarily to a much simpler plot. At its core, 'The Grudge' is a haunted house flick. The beauty of it, however, is that it avoids the typical haunted house plot lapse: If the house is haunted, why not leave it? 'The Grudge' posits that anyone who enters the doors becomes cursed by the fury that inhabits the home -- a curse happy to follow you back to your house, work, elevator, car. While there are a few campy conventions -- is anyone really going to venture into an attic oozing with the sounds of thuds and moans with only a lighter to illuminate the way? -- the film, for the most part, works like a charm. Quite a haunted charm at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am only giving this a 2 out of 10 because I did get at least some laughs out of it. Otherwise it would be a 1! I watched this with my hubby and 13 year old daughter, having heard from a couple friends that it was scary. We all like scary, and it was rated PG-13 so okay to watch with our child. Frankly, after watching it, PG would've been a fine rating. As a "scary" movie, it fails to meet any criteria thereof. Slow moving, no suspense, and the ghosts are more hilarious than scary. My 13 year old was even bored, and kept pointing out the holes in the plot, which were like Swiss cheese. The only reason we didn't turn it off midway is that we all hoped it would pick up and get better. It didn't, right down to the oh so predictable ending. My daughter's final comment: "how lame". Couldn't have said it better myself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was less happening than in "The Happening". Congratulations, movie.Oh, there are ten lines required (I wish this was the case for the script...). So, there you go: Sarah Michelle Gellar is walking around. Slowly. Then, she's walking around a tad slower. Also, there are exciting subplots. All of them involve somebody walking around slowly. And there's a bathtub. And a ghost.Damnit, even the extras are bored (watch the bus scene where the one guy looks at his watch. Priceless!).One a more positive note, Bill Pullman commits suicide. Therefore, 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, this freaking scared me a lot. Especially Yoko. Oh, Yoko gave me the shivers and I almost screamed. Spoiler -- if you watch this, (which you should) do not look at Yoko's jaw. That is pretty terrifying and gory for a PG13 movie. Kayoko and Toshio were scary, too. Spoiler-- the fact that they got brutally murdered and Toshio was in a closet with a cat, for who knows how long, is very, very creepy. Many "pop - up scenes" where Kayoko or Toshio appeared suddenly happen, and may make you scared of going to someone else's house. I am very surprised that this movie is not rated R, for strong horror itself. I am creeped out sitting on my friends couch, home alone right now. I seriously do NOT recommend for 15 or younger. It is a very good film, if you get to the end without screaming or hiding your eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is director Takashi Shimizu's fourth attempt at telling the Ju-on legend, only this time he's targeting a Western audience, and is armed with a bigger budget (courtesy of Sam Raimi) and a US star in the appealing form of Sarah Michelle Gellar. It doesn't make a great deal of difference...Rather than take this opportunity to iron out the creases evident in his 2002 film (and boy, was that sucker creased!), Shimizu regurgitates almost precisely the same mess, albeit with more polished and slightly bloodier effects and a louder soundtrack to help deliver those all important jump scares.Being in English and designed for mass consumption by the multiplex crowd, a little effort has clearly been made to try and make the plot easier to comprehend, but in the end, it is still pretty confusing and not in the slightest bit scary (unless, as I mentioned in my earlier review for Ju-on, you have a irrational fear of small boys in body paint or crap yourself at either the sound of a phone ringing or someone with a very croaky throat).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vengeful Spirit With A Life Of Its Own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge, a remake of a Japanese film of the same name, finds Sarah Michelle Gellar as an exchange student in the Land of Rising Sun who accepts a babysitting gig. Little does she realize that puts her in a whole heap of trouble.It seems as though there was a murder in that house of a woman and baby a few years earlier and the spirit is restless. Anytime anyone goes near the place and that includes the Japanese police something dreadful happens to them. The vengeful spirit kills indiscriminately and it has taken on a life of its own and is called, The Grudge. Gellar sure could have used the martial arts skills from Buffy The Vampire Slayer though I'm not sure how much they would have helped against the undead.The Japanese version apparently has gotten considerable acclaim, but for me this is just another slasher flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grudge Another Disappointing Horror Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge is another disappointing horror remake that joins a long line of them being re-imagined these days if you want to call it that. Director Takashi Schimizu does a good job of giving the audiences some creepy moments but the lack of real scares, suspense, and character development besides Gellar's character is what weighed it down the most. The cast however are good in their roles but not memorable including Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jason Behr, Clea DuVuall, and Bill Pullman but most of them are developed enough because they're not in it much. The rest of the cast okay in their limited screen time. This movie did start off weird and there were some creepy moments but the bad outweighs the good in this one. There was a little suspense but there should have been more and there weren't any real scares because this film didn't frighten me at all. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times either and some characters made stupid decisions but then again what do I except this is a horror movie after all so just go with it. Overall The Grudge was disappointing because I hoped it would be a good but it ended up being a major letdown. The Grudge is creepy at times with a little suspense and good performances by the cast for the most part but this horror thriller could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Japanese horror but when I don't have a TV, don't have a radio, don't read newspapers or buy magazines, as I do, I can sometimes be a bit late catching on to things. The original 'Ring' films and 'Dark Water' where amazing and I was shocked and disappointed at the American remakes. The remakes of those films were f**king dreadful. On the whole remakes of anything are bad, and when a film is being remade scene for scene just in a different language it is beyond pointless. Why can't people watch the film in it's original language for God's sake? It's probably got something to do with the rising levels of illiteracy... and that's why I was so disappointed in myself when I watched this film all the way through and realised it was itself a remake! But wow! What a film it was! Great acting, a great cast - I even liked the annoying Sarah Michelle Gellar - and executed perfectly. The bringing together of East and West was beautiful.I pity the other reviewers on here that say it isn't scary. If this film doesn't scare you nothing will. It scared the sh*t out of me and I'm a 28 year old adult male. I was still scared literally hours after - walking around the flat on my own, walking the dog - pretty much until I managed to get off to sleep. Fantastic. I am now very much looking forward to catching up on the original films I missed out on. Thanks.</fullReview>

Revolving around a cursed house based in Japan, (as you expect there's a lot of subtitles as they speak but other than that its pretty easy to follow...)a woman tracks down the origin of what happened to a ghostly boy and a freaky ghost..The film overall is very chilling the first time watching but then it doesn't seem as scary when you know when the jumpy bits are coming.

		<fullReview>Once upon a time a Japanese man was very angry because he read his wife's journal and found that she'd fallen in love with someone else. So he murdered her and his 6 year old son and then committed suicide. Then, for no apparent reason, or else some hokey old legend made up solely for the purposes of this movie, the child and mother became angry ghosts (or "spirits" if you prefer, but I'm going with ghosts). Maybe the dad did too - I don't think so, but I'm not too clear on it, and the sequence of events sometimes gets a bit confusing in this movie.Were these ghosts interested in being helped to pass over to a more peaceful realm. Not bloody likely! They were far more concerned with generating mayhem to be visited on anyone who ventured into the house where they had been killed, including inducing people to jump off balconies, sucking the life out of people, and ripping the jaws off innocent home helps. What's more, this mayhem didn't just remain within the house - it followed the visitors around, and even travelled down phone lines (or something) to suck their relatives into mattresses (I can't believe I just said that).In fact, these ghosts were so malevolent and powerful that they even saw off Buffy the Vampire Slayer. They didn't kill her, although the final shock shot left you thinking......that they all died unhappily ever after.Definitely creepy, and a lot of shock moments, but few surprises and little sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is much less than nothing. There is nothing new in the film. Nothing fresh what so ever. I wonder how it made 100 million$ worldwide. I guess all parents took their children to this movie thinking its a children movie. And even schools must have had taken their students to this movie and so are these huge collections.There is nothing horrifying in this movie. The ghosts(supposed to be!!) are just like normal humans with some extra talcum powder on their face which the director thought was scary but in fact it was very funny. The plot of the movie is also very common and of course, irritating. House haunted by ghosts and killing whoever enters the house.The director,whoever it is,tried to convey three points to the world through this movie:1. Ghosts also have a lot of hair.2. Even a ghost's hair keeps falling if proper care is not taken towards it.3. Ghosts like bathtubs, spend much of the time there and may sometimes take bath in them.so be careful with tubs.This is what happens in the whole movie.Well, this may be a new concept to many.*****Funniest part in the movie, the ghosts in the movie show a live video to the Sarah Michelle when she goes to the house, to make her aware of their past.The only thing I felt new in this movie is,## people from the west being haunted by the ghosts of the east ##So guys avoid this movie if u want to see any horror movie.....and go for it if u want to have a comedy movie.I give 2/10.1 point for the cute little ghost boy in the movie and 1 point as a gift to the director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose we cannot and should not apply simple logic to ghost stories which we know are made out of the blue. But one should at least be allowed to follow the same piece of logic on which the whole story is strongly based .So if these ghosts are the transforms of exceptionally and brutally murdered victims, how about the innocent victims who are even more brutally and savagely frightened to death? It seemed that their processes of death are much more terrifying than that of the creepy boy and his spooky mom. By the same rule defined in this picture, they would have become even more atrocious species of ghosts seeking revenge from the Saekis!!Perhaps this is what's going to happen in Grudge 2 which I haven't seen, but I doubted. Or perhaps Grudge 2 will have a better explanation on the "Constitution "of the Ghost Kingdom and how the "legislation" on the "right on scaring others" were formed. If so, it can guarantee to be a more interesting movie than the original Grudge, but then it would likely be a comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My boyfriend really wanted to show me this movie. His quote, "It's amazing!" But really, he thinks all horrors are "amazing". So, thinking that it was probably stupid. (like most of the movies he loves) I settle down on the couch, and what do I get? Just what I thought.My boyfriend loves this movie, "one of my favourites" as he said. Me? I would complain if I had to watch it again.The reason this movie was made was to scare you. It didn't do a good job of it though. Okay, it did make me jump at least twice. But I didn't find the movie scary. Most people who haven't watched the movie will say: Ooooooooooooooo, the cover of the box is scary looking! The movie must be sooo scary! Ha.The story itself is okay, except it's with another cliff ending. *sigh* Too many movies these days (in the horror genre) leave with cliffies just so they can make more money off of another one. If The Grudge 2 comes out, I'd actually go to see it. Only if I can rent it though. It's probably a rip-off to see it in the movies.The movie box (the Canadian one that I am talking about is different than the one shown above) makes the movie look terrifying when really it's absolutely not. It is a nice DVD/VHS cover, though.The music (as I can remember) is pretty good. It flows with what is happening and when there isn't music, something important (to the plot) is usually happening.(note the "usualy")And last, the graphics. Well, to put it simple, the computer graphics suck, and the make-up is superb.Did I like this movie?: No. I know the story is okay but I like horror films by there gore/scariness. This didn't show any of what I'm looking for.Pros: The music is pretty good and so is the storyline. Cons: It leaves people with a cliffhanger ending and claiming to be scary, but isn't.The Storyline: 7 The Presentation: 7 The Music: 9 The Graphics: 5Overall: A 7 average</fullReview>

"The Grudge" is a silly movie that had a bunch of potential but was wasted when the script forgot one major ingredient in a good scary movie: the film has to be scary! The main villain in this trash looks worse than the girl from "The Ring". She makes a very dumb(and ANNOYING!) sound when she appears. Ditto for the kid who makes the cat sounds. After 5-10 minutes your eyes get heavy and you lose interest. Even if the movie was not supposed to be about the death and scares, at least it should have given the viewer more mystery and reason to spend money on it.

		<shortDescription>Grade B Horror Film Offers No Shivers or Chills!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is generally a good rule not to enter into a house after you have rung the bell and no one has answered the door. That axiom is not followed by many characters in "The Grudge" with grave consequences for a university professor and a veteran police detective, among others, who wander into the haunted house in downtown Tokyo.A good cast (Bill Pullman, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jason Behr) flounders and ultimately sinks with weak dramatic material. The direction and film editing seemed amateurish with confusing flashback scenes blended into the present action without effective transitions. This was most blatantly apparent in one of the crucial flashbacks when the lighting changed from subdued to bright light and the main character witnessed a scene from the past. It was especially the lapses in film technique that prevented this film from earning a passing grade. And the major disappointment was the absence of suspense and horror. Unless we can genuinely care about the characters and follow a story that makes sense, it is impossible to be engaged in the story. The spirits of this haunted house claimed their victims indiscriminately, occasionally even pursuing individuals outside the home in order to exact their toll. There was no logic to the scenes, and there were too many unresolved plot details. By the end of this unimaginative film, my main grudge was against the filmmakers, not the house!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japanese Ghosts and the haunted house</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Japanese directors have it seems, acquired several successful techniques about movie making from the Americans. Most noticeable the dramatic art of fear. The gist of their story is of a particular house in Japan which has become the haunted residence of a violently murdered family. Having experienced a brutal crime, the spirits now infect any and all visitors who come in contact with the possessed property. The victims range from a visiting nurse to an American family, all of whom succumb to the mysterious menace. What the film lacks however, is story cohesion. Interlacing several mixed vignettes which drag a reluctant audience towards a set of Vandalistic monsters, who's intent is on absorbing their victims, rather than devouring them. Next, is the provocative appearance of the child spirit, which evokes a morbid prurient interest, but little else. Furthermore, with the exception of Bill Pulman and Ryo Ishibashi, as the detective, terror is held to a minimum. All and all, a tolerable horror story, but falls short of American standards. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring for those with a brain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having started with the inevitable comparison in the title, I'll side-step the whole "Ring vs Grudge" argument for later. The Grudge is actually a remake of a Japanese film Ju-on: the Grudge aka Ju-on 3, the third, (obviously), in a series of movies.It's impossible to tell you the storyline, without giving away some of the "surprises" in the plot, so go ahead and skip to the next paragraph if you don't want to spoil those surprises. The basic story, set in Japan, is that of an American family taking up residence in a house whose previous occupants had been involved in domestic murder/suicide. Enter Sarah Michelle Geller as the new American care worker for the disabled mother, (the first care worker having been dispatched in one of the opening scenes) and all manner of spooky goings on ensue. It seems that anyone entering the house, is subject to "The Grudge" or curse that now haunts the house, and after a short period of time is visited by an apparition which.... well you don't actually see what it does, but you know its just not pleasant.To judge The Grudge is not that easy, it's rather non-liner style does mean that the viewer has to carefully pay attention to the movie as the story unfolds. Unlike The Ring, (which I thought was pretty excellent), which washed over and enveloped you into the storyline, The Grudge is far more subtle in it's scares. For example, when one of the characters is in an elevator, going to the top of her building, if you don't pay attention to what's going on in the background, the scene just looks like a woman in an elevator. Nothing scary there, right? But by paying attention, the viewer is left with an impending sense of dread, as the character alights the elevator, and enters her apartment, oblivious to her fate. It is subtlety such as this, that will escape anyone who thought Friday the 13th was a demanding experience, and leave them a bit cold. This is NOT an in your face movie.It's ironic that perhaps The Grudge's biggest strengths, could also be regarded as some of its biggest weakness'. The film is shot in such a way as to make the viewer is a rather dispassionate voyeur on the unfolding events. This approach is good, in that we get to see all parts of the story, and are able to piece things together in a way the characters cannot. However, it can leave the viewer feeling a little uninvolved also. Too, as mentioned in the storyline paragraph, all the actual killings occur off camera. Wonderful for those of us with an imagination, not so good for the "if it don't splatter, it don't matter" brigade.The Japanese certainly have their own style of movie making, and Takashi Shimizu who directs, (I believe this is his first film for western audiences), thankfully does not compromise that style too much. The time line jumps, are used to explain events after we have seen them, and rather than the usual "creepy" music, a soul chilling sound is used to build tension, and let us the viewer know of an imminent attack by the apparition. This certainly will not to be everyone's taste, but then I like my movies to confuse me, then give me a chance to work things out, rather than spell them out to me one syllable at a time.I started this off side-stepping the whole "Ring vs Grudge" debate, and will address that now. Let's start this off by looking at what they have in common. Both were based on Japanese films, (Ringu for The Ring and Ju-on: The Grudge aka Ju-on 3 for The Grudge). Both have apparitions with lots of hair. Both have creepy kids in them, and and both are ghost stories. Its there that the direct comparisons really end. To have seen one is definitely not to have seen the other. Was one "inspired" (read ripped off), by the other, quite possibly, but who cares? Tarantino has been making movies "inspired" by other movies for years, and we love him for it.The performances by the actors are adequate, nothing Oscar winning, but certainly good enough to keep things believable.To summarize. The Grudge is a good little movie, to be watched when one can give it ones full attention, and at night with the lights low and someone special to cling to for the scary bits. Watching it with distractions, (kids going to bed, won't go to bed, friends visiting and insisting on talking all the way through the movie, etc.), is NOT going to work.Overall, a good ghost story, and well worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The review by Togasaurus I think describes this movies structure and intent best. Americans look for ghosts (spirits) who have a reason for being, an intent, a location and a resolution. On the other hand, the Japanese believe in a more basic animism. The spirit is independent of the person who died and exists as the embodiment of an emotion - in this case rage. The spirits and the atmosphere in which they are revealed is done excellently - but there is no motivation or resolution. They are rage. They are not limited to a location, but can manifest anywhere where the victims happen to be. Supposedly, they pass their rage on to their victims. Their victims then die and new rage spirits are born. The spirits, at least in this movie, are not banished or exorcised. They continue to exist and continue to kill. Most of this is not communicated in The Grudge. You either know the culture or you do not. From what I was reading I guess this rage was passed on to most Americans who saw this movie. Watching The Grudge I felt like I was on the verge of really liking this movie, but was lacking the necessary understanding to do so - a strange feeling. Anyway, this is worth a watch on cable or DVD.</fullReview>

Very quickly though, Karen begins to notice that not all is as it should be.Japanese horror is certainly different and the focus on atmosphere and chills rather than jump shocks are two of the things that have made things like Ringu and Honogurai Mizuno Sokokara really creep me out and stick in my mind every bloody time I have to turn the lights out and walk across a dark room to the door. However, with so many average films using the formula without adding anything and American version remaking the original in a shot-for-shot way that is like an expensive form of dubbing then you do have to wonder if perhaps it will soon be a victim of its own success. Anyway, with The Grudge, I avoided it because I wanted to see the original first but, with little access to it short of buying it I gave in and rented the remake ? so I can't compare the two, which is maybe a good thing. The film opens with a mystery and a good scare and really this is how it continues. Sadly the delivery took away from it; the flashbacks etc were reasonably easy to follow but it broke up the atmosphere and didn't allow a consistency that the actual plot could have had. Without this consistent atmosphere the film becomes more about "jump" scares rather than a constant chill and fear; this still works and I did find bits of it frightening but not to the point where it will stay with me in the way that the films I mentioned before do.Without a nice flow to the story, the characters are not as engaging as they could have been and I didn't feel the tragedy that is suggested by the script. The actors therefore mostly exist within the film rather than give strong performances. Gellar isn't a great actress but she can walk around looking scared and on edge ? luckily this is all she is asked to do. The rest of the cast are mostly familiar American faces, which I suppose helps it sell to the American multiplex audience. They all do the job well enough but none of them really got me into their characters although, like Gellar, they did well enough to help sustain the scares. The direction is good and it does build up the tension leading up to "jump" scares but from what I've heard it is shot for shot a copy of the original so you have to wonder why he bothered (other than the big pay cheque).Overall this is a good film and it delivers enough scares to be worth seeing; however those who have come to enjoy the formula of Japanese horrors will perhaps see it as rather watered down and having more in common with the American "sudden jump" method. The cast act scared but can't give us people although the director uses their fear well enough to satisfy those looking for a scare or two on a Saturday night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It had its moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>really, for the first 30-45 minutes this movie had some great "jump" moments...i haven't really been startled by a "horror" film for many years. But after awhile the "cat growl" sound got pretty boring. i watched it alone at home one evening and it did cause the hairs on my arms to stand in the beginning...but as the movie progressed, it got repetitive and predictable. still, i gave it an 8 just for the first 30 minutes and the fact that it actually startled me to jump...anytime a horror flick can get that reaction, i'd call it a success....and, i'm not easily affected by these things. I think that kids face was pretty creepy too. I noticed Ebert only gave it one star...not sure what he was thinking or expected...but i've often enjoyed movies he has trashed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why watching such a movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do you call a movie with a plot line that is barely tangible, hard to understand, somewhat poor acting, and really intriguing (in a bad sense) sequencing? I think that "the grudge" would be it! I don't want you people to believe that i have a grudge against this movie... However, if you haven't seen it yet, here it goes: it's a story about a house that bares the curse of a slaughtered family, and basically kills ANYONE who enters it... The movie starts with the classic stupid curios girl wandering around in the house hearing funny noises,when she gets grabbed/eaten/whatever by a scary woman-like "thingy". Then Sarah Gellar gets in the center of attention, by witnessing the murder of the old lady, by the matter-less hand of the house spirit. After that, the pieces and sequences run pretty incoherent in a dazzling vicious circle, not letting the viewer the chance to put the pieces together and figure out what is actually happening. As the movie advances, the curse is finally revealed, BUT, there is nothing poor "Buffy" can do to stop her inevitable death that is drawing closer and closer.Conclusion: Plot: a house that kills everybody, there's nothing anybody can do about it! WoW!! FX: so and so, though the purring lady made me laugh quite a few times Sequencing: really bad Suspense: almost none - very predictable horror action Acting: good enough, considering the bad script, and bad camera angles.The reason that i gave a 2 out of 10 for this movie is because i truly enjoyed the sequence with the transparent door elevator going up and the little boy appearing at each and every floor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From reviews I've read of this movie, you either love it or you hate it. Although the majority of actors are American, this is a Japanese movie and I think most of the negative comments by reviewers are grounded in a lack of understanding of eastern aesthetics. Unfortunately, a good many American moviegoers won't like a movie unless the plot just absolutely pounds you over the head, something this movie does not do. The atmosphere and psychological component (a sense of real tragedy - something that's lacking in many American horror movies) makes this film as interesting and terrifying as it could be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is something evil there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be completely honest with you, I watched this film with my finger on the fast-forward button pressed heavily so that the jumpy scenes wouldn't make me change my pants. I thought that this was one of the spookiest films that I have seen. Director Takashi Shimizu has done an excellent job remaking this film for American audiences. While some will argue that this is nothing more than just corporate Hollywood turning the cranks on audiences' wallets, I thought there was quite a bit of originality to this film. The institution of us seeing the demon or spirits before the characters do was something that I wasn't familiar with in other horror films. Normally, there is this big "jumping out of the darkness" scene that frightens everyone because they were not expecting it, but in The Grudge there was this element of "here I am" that frightened me more than most films do.Takashi Shimizu, the mastermind behind this film, also created the original Ju-on series that became extremely popular in Japan. This allowed his vision and purpose (with a larger budget) to continue. I enjoyed the fact that the original director was on board and that our American crew was in Japan. This took me away from the idea that this film was going to be nothing more than just a pro-America horror film. It took me to this unfamiliar place (building the fear) and showcased the talents of some unfamiliar/familiar American film actors working next to a complete Japanese crew. I thought that this kept the entire film grounded. It wasn't set in New York, there wasn't the scene of raw nudity at the beginning ? there wasn't the normal American structure to this film because we were not in America ? we were in Japan. This really helped me build the excitement and utter terror that I felt while watching this film. I was impressed.The acting, well, you don't go to a horror film expecting to see Oscar caliber acting. Gellar and Pullman knew that the horror genre is slowing coming into the limelight as a prominent figure in cinema (it was lacking for a couple of years there) and I think that is why they chose to do this project. Pullman wasn't anything to write home about, thought I was impressed to see him in this film. Gellar was the exact same. She did her part, collected her money, and went home. This wasn't what frightened me about this film. I didn't rent this movie to be blown away by the acting. I expected average acting and that is what I got. What I did go into this film expecting was to shake, shiver, and be frightened to turn off the lights after the film. That is exactly what I found. Takashi Shimizu did an excellent job of building that right amount of suspense, using amazing lighting, perfect sound, and some very freaky visuals. His knowledge and ability to bring us something new was extremely impressive and honest. Here is a director who was handed the money to make the film that he wanted, and while not everything was probably to his liking, it did open the door for more fans to enjoy his work. It also opened the door to more projects from his mind to be released. This could be the new face of cinematic horror, and I cannot wait to see what he has in store for us.Overall, I loved this movie. It was the exact level of fright that I was looking for. There were scenes that I never saw coming, there were elements that were unexpected and vividly raw, and it thankfully did not follow the ever-classic Hollywood horror formula. There was originality and emotion in this film that most horror directors do not give when dabbing in the horror genre. This was a great story, and I cannot wait to gather friends for a late night horror scream-fest featuring this film. From the opening scene, to the bus scene, to the opportunistic final moment, I had my finger on the fast-forward and I was scared. This did what it set out to do for me, and for that I can only praise this film! Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film hoping for a shiver or two like I got from "Ring" (the US remake). I wasn't disappointed. So few films have given me a genuine scare since I was a child I had begun to despair of ever feeling scared by a film again, but The Grudge delivered chills aplenty. I suggest you watch it alone, in the dark, at home, and all in one sitting. I doubt that you will be disappointed either. To my surprise even my father liked it. He said he hadn't been that scared since he saw The Exorcist thirty years ago! The Grudge deserves a 10 rating simply because it is, without doubt, the spookiest film I have ever seen as an adult.

		<fullReview>Luckily, it's impossible to give away any spoilers about The Grudge since the entire plot is literally spelled out for you before the opening credits. People who get killed in some grisly manner, stay angry and malicious in the afterlife, killing everyone that enters the house where they died. There, end of plot.Since there's no need for plot development, the film decides to tell the exact same story about 5-6 times, just with different characters, all equally uninteresting. The method to pull this off? Flashbacks! Hooray, my favourite. Of course, there's no explanation for the flashbacks - they just appear in order to show (perhaps 'show' isn't the right word though...) some deaths and make the movie longer than ten minutes.The scary ghosts consist of a kid that meows, and a blue woman that burps. You don't really see them doing much, just the standard quick glances of shadows, reflections, and feet running by. They pretty much feel like low-rent ghosts.Low-rent can also be said about the acting, or what little there is of it. The script doesn't seem to allow for much in the way of characterisation, though, so perhaps the actors aren't to blame too much.On the whole, a rather dull, confusing, non-frightening, rehash of most other Asian horror films that have been successful over the past couple of years.

		<shortDescription>Some very creepy moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- The film's title refers to a Japanese myth involving the spirits of people who have died in "the grip of a powerful rage". Anyone who comes into contact with these spirits will die. The plot of The Grudge is very simple. An American exchange student, Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), living in Japan takes a job with a health care center. When one of the other workers doesn't show up, Karen is given her first solo assignment helping an older lady in her home. When Karen arrives, she immediately realizes that something is not quite right. What she doesn't realize is that this house is possessed by spirits who will kill anyone who sets foot inside.- Let me start by saying that I have not (as of 2/11/05) seen the original Japanese version. I plan to do so, hopefully, very soon. With that being said, I enjoyed The Grudge much more than I had expected. This is my first experience with Shimizu as a director, but I came away impressed. His has a nice ability to tell a story regardless of the language. The Grudge is one of the best examples of a non-linear story presentation that I can think of. As the movie progressed, it was a treat to watch Shimizu bring the pieces of the story together.- Another plus for The Grudge was Shimizu's decision (probably based on budgetary concerns as much as anything) to primarily use "real" effects and less CGI. The make-up on the Kayoka character, for example, created a far more unsettling image than the use of CGI could have. It was obvious that Kayoka was a real person, not just a computer image. The overuse or inappropriate use of CGI has ruined many modern horror movies.- There were, however, some areas where the movie could have been better. Gellar is one of the most unappealing leads in Hollywood. I've never understood what all the fuss is about. I always found her extremely annoying.- While the movie has many truly creepy (some were downright scary) scenes, the movie relies far too heavily on "jump moments". You know what I mean - a character opens a door and a cat jumps out (The Grudge actually features a cat jumping out of a closet). I've always thought that jump moments were a cheap way to illicit a response from the audience. A few jump moments can be good, but too many just becomes tiring.- Given that I wasn't expecting much, The Grudge was a lot of fun. I am looking forward to the sequel and to going back and discovering the original Japanese film - Ju-on: The Grudge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As forgettable as they come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was nothing worth noting in this film, and no reason to go out of your way to see it.In order for a horror movie to work it needs at least one of the following: 1) Actual scares. 2) Gore/interesting deaths. 3) Characters you either fear for or identify with. 4) Interesting sets. 5) Tension as to what characters will live and what will die.This film had none of the above. There were no scares. There was no gore. The characters had no depth and no personality. The set was a typical Japanese home with no character. You know immediately who will be left standing in the final moments, and therefore never feel tension when anyone is in trouble - you already know the outcome.The movie begins with promise. The colors and angles will feel familiar if you saw the Ring, but it begins with promise, giving a mysterious death and a very creepy child. It doesn't last, though. You soon realize that the deaths happen off camera and are usually unexplained. You realize the main ghost is a very confused looking Japanese woman with a facial expression that is supposed to be terror but is so over the top it's pure humor. And you'll realize the characters have no purpose other than to die. None of them say anything interesting, none have any unique characteristics. You could take the lines from one mouth and put them in another without noticing.*minor spoiler* The end is terrible, too. The ghost gets a character face to face, inches away, but saves the character instead of killing the character. Of course, this doesn't stop the ghost from stalking the character and giving the "surprise" in the end. Why didn't it just kill the character when it had the chance? *end spoiler*A movie with a decent concept but terrible, dull, and mindless execution. There's nothing confusing, nothing mysterious, nothing disturbing, nothing scary, nothing intelligent, and mostly nothing interesting to be seen in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had a good time watching this movie, even though I'm not a very big fan of horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not familiar with Japanese horror movies at all and to be honest I'm not really a big fan of horror movies in general. Why I don't like horror movies all that much? Certainly not because I'm easily scared. It's because most of the time all that is considered as horror is rather stupid, predictable and too messy.A more than average, even intelligent horror movie is sometimes very rare and hard to find. The average horror movie is about at least one pretty, young blonde girl being chased by a madman and being cut open with a giant blade while almost screaming her lungs out. Another common theme is vampires or cannibals trying to get into a house with probably very juicy looking people, so they can eat them alive. One thing they all have in common: You'll see gallons of blood flowing and you almost start wondering if you shouldn't have put a bucket under your TV.The only reason that I did go to see this movie was because one of my friends absolutely wanted to watch it. I didn't expect much of it, but big was my surprise after seeing this movie. I actually had a good time! The beginning of the movie is "impressive" to say the least (Bill Pulman jumping of the balcony without saying a word to her, as his wife says to him that he is up early) and the story was very interesting. I liked the idea (based on a Japanese legend) that if someone dies in great anger or sadness, his or her soul remains at that place and functions as some kind of curse that wants to destroy all people who come into that same place. Finally a horror movie with a more original approach (yes, I know that it is a remake, but I haven't seen the original, so for me this is all new). This was actually a rather clever, well-crafted horror movie, but if there is one thing that I didn't like about the movie, it is Sarah Michelle Gellar. I've never been a fan of her and in my opinion she only got this role because she is seen as THE perfect lure for the teenage male audience. You know, the guys who probably all have at least 2 posters of her hanging on their walls, fantasizing about her when being alone (I don't even want to think of what more they do with it)... If the role of Karen had been played by for instance Nicole Kidman I would have liked it a lot more. But OK, it wasn't so, I better stop whining about it.Overall this is a very good horror movie that has a lot of suspense to offer. Most of the time you know that something is going to happen, but the hint is given in such a way that it doesn't bother (the same technique Hitchcock used to use in his movies). "The Grudge" shows that a good horror movie doesn't need to be filled with monsters or gallons of blood, but that things you don't know or see can be more terrifying. I liked it a lot and I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS. Sometimes a film can succeed in one aspect so well that it's other considerable flaws do not matter that much. The Grudge is such a film. It's confusingly plotted and makes little sense. Apparently the director, in remaking his earlier versions of the story, supposedly tied things up better for this one. In that case, the earlier Japanese films must be COMPLETELY incoherent! The Grudge's acting is just passable. However, and this is big however, it is ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING.The filmmakers set out to do nothing more than scare the socks of people who see the film. When so many horror films fail to scare, one that does is automatically criticized. It has been said that The Grudge is simply a collection of "BOO!" scenes, that it is too relentless, and that this undermines plot and characterization. Well, these are GOOD things. This film has no let-up. It doesn't even bother with a gradual build up. The scares come almost immediately and than hardly ever stop. Maybe it's silly that the ghosts are able to leave the house which they possess, but this makes them all the more scary. You just don't know when they will appear next.A few moments where CGI is employed fall a little flat, but who cares if one scare doesn't work when you know there will be be another just around the corner. The boy in the lift. The ghost in the bed. The ghost approaching the camera. The sudden glimpse on the bus.Of course people are constantly investigating odd noises and wandering off on their own. You often know when a scare is going to come, but this means that the audience is always kept on edge.It had been commented that some people have watched this film with an audience that sometimes laughed at the film. I think it was Alfred Hitchcock who said, when people laughed during one of his films, that it is a release, that they are actually probably scared. Don't try to follow the time shifting plot which raises more questions than it answers. Just enjoy the experience, possibly best at home on your own with the lights turned out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a remake of a Japanese horror film worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge (2004) was a treat. A remake of the Japanese hit Ju-On that is about as good as the original. The only thing that I found wrong with this Japanese redux was the content matter was toned down, other than that nit pick it was a great horror film to watch. This is the film that The Ring (2002) was supposed to be, Instead of being filled with a bunch of cheap thrills and nonsensical images, the direction and the shocks were actually effective.A foreign exchange student living in Japan is also a care giver in her spare time. During one assignment she goes to a house that has a reputation. A horrific murder occurred there several years ago. The father went insane killing his wife, son and even the pet cat!, now they all inhabit the house!! The real estate agent was more than pleased to get the house sold. But the house is cursed by several restless spirits. Who ever enters the house feels the wrath from the former residents. The four ghosts appear before the visitors. But in reality they might only be one mean entity. The anger and hate the people felt before they died managed to form into one evil presence.What I enjoyed about this film was the fact that the director was trying to make a film that is sort of an introductory to western audiences about Asian ghosts and legends. Instead of making a confusing movie that would annoy viewers (like The Ring (2002).If you like horror films then by all means watch the Grudge. You should watch the Japanese original Ju-On. Despite what others say, they go hand in hand.Highly recommended!</fullReview>

Copying the original is not forbidden, but please respect the original. To be quite honest, I was frightened after seeing this, not at the plots, but the bravery and confidence of the director. The Japanese really created a fantastic base for the guys to do something of recreation, and if you find some difficulty in that, simply copy all in the Jap one, and I'm convinced the American actors and actresses have got the techniques in imitating their Jap counterparts. However, the power has got in the grips of the directer, and he successfully prevented them from achieving this. So we see in 4 classical scenes, at least, some alteration Mr. D wanted to show his creativity, where he unconsciously poisoned his cookie. My wife felt hot and enjoyed it so much though, 'cause she felt like having got move controlling power for herself. She proudly stated she didn't scream at all during watch a GHOST film.</fullReview>

The suspense works, certainly in the beginning, therefore i give this movie a 6/10. However, the story is thin and far fetched. Worse, one of the ghostly appearances is a little child. Apparently the new trend is that little kids are horrific and frightening. I'm sorry, but that doesn't work for me; i would bitch slap a ghost like this.From what i have seen so far, Asian horrors have what Hollywood lacks: originality. But as i have mentioned in other reviews i've wrote: originality does not make a movie good. It just gives the advantage; you still have to score the points.Furthermore, there are several plot holes that just simply don't add up. It seems that the time line of a few things should be reviewed. But hey, it's about the suspense. And there's plenty of it. Even the way the ghosts are portrayed in an original way, making up for the downsides of this movie.The acting is mediocre at best. I'm not a fan of Buffy the Vampire slayer, and she fails to develop her character or shine in her role. This is what i expect of a good actor.*** BIG SPOILER *** In the end, it is clear that there wanted to make a sequel; the story ends too abrupt for no apparent reason. Also, some questions are left unanswered, leaving the viewer empty handed. How can you kill the ghost ? Why was she the first time not attacked, when she grandmother died ? Why did the Grudge change his shape ? Why did the professor commit suicide ? Was this movie really worth it ? Why haven't they burnt down the house after the first killings ? If the police knew something ghostly was going on, why did they act the way they did; why wasn't there much more investigation ? The list goes on and on...So, considering all things, but concentrating on the sheer pleasure i got from watching it, i have to give this movie 5.5 out of 10. If you don't watch it, you won't have missed much. Besides, you'll be tempted again when the obvious sequel comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American angst (spoilerz)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>there is one certain peculiarity to this film. If the grudge is passed on to those who are killed, how come none of the Americans in the film go bad? I mean, this is purely nice American white middle class couples slashed by crazy Japanese - that's why this film is so totally not scary - whereas the ring made everything scary, from TV sets to coffee mugs, this one swims around in the typical American Angst for the Other. Yep - this film is one of many indications that McCarthyism is re-entering the stage of American pop culture, and it sure doesn't help much that the director is Japanese, and that Sarah is Jewish - she's not even good looking in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The grudge review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi everyone this is my first time using on IMDb.I have just seen the Grudge i would like to say it is much better and a lot scarier than i thought it would be. The film stars Buffy star Sarah Michelle Gellar, who is an American carer in Japan. When she goes on her first job she goes an American house to look after an American elderly. As soon as she enters the house the tone of the film becomes a lot darker and finds there are other people in the house that shouldn't be there. I don't wanna give anymore away- you'll have to see it! I have to say i did enjoy the film and would recommend it to others, it's diffidently the scariest horror i've see ages. There have been a lot of people saying it is a rip off version of the ring, but they are completely different stories.But the Ring overall i would have to say is better because as the director of the grudge did say his inspiration for this film was the ring. So i have to say ring is better because of it's originality and because the story is more complete than the grudge. If you've seen the ending to the grudge you'll know what i mean!. I've heard there is supposed to be 2 jap version of grudge with the same ending- this is why i was slightly disappointed with the ending it seemed as though the director didn't know how to end the story so he went for an easy you cant do anything about ( like in jeepers creepers- you can't kill the monster)the curse ending. But i've heard there is gonna be a third part to jap version which i'm hoping will give fans a satisfying ending than the he's been using for the first two films. This is why i've said the ring is only slightly better because they didn't just say you can't do anything about the curse of the ring but they give a excellent ending unlike the grudge. But i still recoommend you watch the grudge- it will stay in your head for days!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time better spent watching 'The Ring' again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not such a real fan of horror, or scary movies. But when I do watch one I'd like the tension to be like a roller-coaster ride, or better. I got spooked by 'the ring', also the second time. The Grudge, however, did not get me on the edge of my seat. Just sweaty hands of expecting something that didn't come. It has a few good scenes but nothing special.Most of all I missed some kind of explanation of why things are happening. Things don't fall into place. Could be only me, but I'd like to know why 'Karen' does not get killed immediately and why does that silent women at the beginning stay alive for so long, while others die almost immediately... It seems to me like it misses some extensions that were cut from the movie or something. Flashes of something you could not see clearly enough to spook you. Oh well... Just don't expect too much of it, is my advise, or don't go see it at all. You wouldn't miss a thing. Your time would be better spent watching 'The Ring' a second or a third time.</fullReview>

But the Grudge is in the true fashion of what a horror film is meant to be. It is a film that makes you think twice about going into a house alone. In true Hitcthcock and Hammer films tradition this film works because of suspense and atmosphere. It was great to find a film that gets the hairs on the back of your neck.

And movie didn't even have the song. Anyway.When watching this movie DO NOT try to make sense of the plot or anything. Most horror/scary movies are ruined when they provide an explanation. It was just too typical of a reason for this horror.Now, it seems like I just hated this movie. But, I didn't. I saw it in a crowded theatre with a bus load of kids jumping up and down and laughing and I was still terrified. I've never been so scared of something I knew wasn't real.

		<fullReview>The Grudge staring former scream queen, Sarah Michelle Gellar,(scream 2, I know what you did last summer and Buffy the vampire slayer) stars in the great horror masterpiece. Sarah is my obsession! and i cant wait for the sequel! the movies plot is good but not weak, and it has a ton of disturbing images that had viewers screaming. The croaking noise Kayoko maid, had people laughing, but when we saw her face every one screamed! The Grudge was WAY better than The Ring and MUCH scarier, since the ring had one jumpy 2 second part. (when katie was shown in the closit)The cast was great! Sarah's performed was spectacular and was VERY freaked out by the woman. And check out the unrated version of the grudge, it contains more scary images that wast shon in the movies and wont be show in the original DVD, so i would recommend the unrated version if u want to scream more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning - spoilers follow.Having read a number of professional and user reviews highly critical of this film - I must say I'm surprised (the Ebert review was dismal). I haven't seen the Japanese originals - and I might have appreciated more backstory - especially relating to the nature of a Japanese curse - but I felt this was an outstanding film, replete with frights and fun, an old fashioned ghost story, reminiscent of The Sixth Sense and The Others.The ghosts are the stars - not shades or transparencies, these ghosts are beings of darkness and menace, with the power to mesmerise and terrify their victims. To see adults, reduced to shivering and impotent catatonia, is the essential anxiety of this film.Structurally intelligent, the use of flashbacks heightened the sense of dread - although we needed more on the nature of a curse - and how it might be lifted.For instance, I started thinking the curse manifests itself to its victims in an hallucinatory and suggestive way - so that, for those who have visited the house, the curse (the ghosts) become an inescapable part of them, rather than an external force - but it would have been nice to have this articulated - maybe by a Buddhist spiritualist (a theme touched on but not exploited).Also the ending was a disappointment - the film might have concluded at the incendiary point of flicking the Zippo into the petrol.See this film - for the gasps and scares - perhaps it is irritating that victims are drawn predictably to points of silence and darkness - but isn't that a part of the hypnotic charm of these internalised ghosts, the power to suggest and manipulate, before striking.I didn't laugh. I will never forget these ghosts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The chore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, the latest in the trend of remaking Japanese horror films, is a chore to watch. I can only hope the original is better than this, because if the original resembles this remake in any way, it signifies that Hollywood really has too much cash for its own good. It defies belief that a film could make one feel that a good half of its running time is redundant or unnecessary, yet another twenty minutes of well-made footage would make it seem a lot more coherent.Sarah Michelle Gellar, much like her hubby before her, seems to feel her star fading with every second of this feature. In this effort, she plays a young exchange student I will refer to as Buffy simply because she never gives the character enough of an individual personality to distinguish it from the role that made her famous. So anyway, Buffy works for what appears to be a healthcare service for invalids in Japan. Her task is to clean up the mess that these invalids make on themselves, or so the scenes here imply.Strangely, the job she goes to in this film involves a grandmother who she finds with no sign of relatives around. The way the family has disappeared is hinted at, but only revealed after what feels like eight hours has gone by. Adding to the pace problem is the fact that the time seems to jump back and forth like a breakdancer, accompanied by more fades to black than even Peter Jackson resorted to in order to compensate for his poor storytelling skills. Indeed, cause and effect are very hard to follow in this film. So much so that the deaths seem inconsequential.What The Grudge does have going for it are some very creepy effects shots. The sequence in which the shadow creeps up to a CCTV camera and its eyes suddenly become visible is one of the few parts of the film that lives up to the hype. If only the ending shot didn't seem like such an obvious pilfering of The Ring. When the dialogue comes along, it is either indecipherable or just plain boring. It is never a good idea to bore your audience so thoroughly in the first hour of your film and save all the explanations for thereafter. In all fiction, there is generally an unspoken rule that if you fail to hook your audience in the first couple of minutes, you never will succeed.I gave The Grudge a two out of ten. If Sarah Michelle Gellar was hoping to resurrect her career with this first-draft mess, then she is sorely mistaken. You could find much better things to do with ninety-plus minutes, including the performance of housework.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Asian films do not translate well to western culture, which is probably why Sam Raimi tried to cross the divide by setting The Grudge amongst the American community in Japan whilst retaining the original Japanese director. A bold move for a Hollywood movie, but it really didn't help much. Apart from an insight into what it might be like for a westerner to live in Japan, I found the whole experience unengaging, incongruous and mystifying. What was mean't to be scary was actually quite laughable, and when I went for a meal afterwards I found myself mimicking that strange rattling sound every time I saw a Japanese girl with heavy make-up. The Box Office results for this film are the result of three key ingredients; the producers reputation, the actress from Buffy, an excellent poster and the financial P&amp;A might of the studio. None of it has anything to do with the film itself. If you want good horror, check out the following; Saw, Switchblade Romance and The Last Horror Movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's ever a university course entitled 'How to mess up a fairly good movie by having Hollywood remake it', the grudge should be the course's main focus.I was lucky enough to see the original just a few weeks ago and was drawn to see the remake, mostly because the original director was attached. This, as it turned out, was a mistake.The Grudge takes everything unique, creepy and scary from the Japanese original and manages to make it mediocre. If you think I'm one of the naysayers who frequently trashes Hollywood films just for the fun of it, guess again. Sam Raimi makes an all-too conspicuous cameo in the remake, miscasting himself and lowering what little tension exists by appearing goofy and out of place, not to mention that the guy is NOT an actor. Is ego why he casts himself? It can't be because he's the best candidate, can it?The absolute scariest moment for me in the original (a character's encounter with the black-haired woman in the washroom) is a wasted, barely noticeable moment in this version and I'm not even getting to the horrible cgi... Hollywood thinks that by employing computer geeks to make something vaguely mysterious (the black form overwhelming the elderly woman in the original) all high tech actually makes it better? Sorry guys, it didn't.This movie is making money hand over fists, but as far as leaving anyone with anything but a bad taste in their mouths, it's done little else.Sequel? CAN'T WAIT!</fullReview>

It seemed as if it were three hours instead of its hour and a half. The plot dragged and the same thing happened over and over. It was to the point that by the third time the 'suspense' happened, you were yawning to the point of falling asleep. Besides the fact it didn't even make sense. I was trying to re-play it in my mind when it was finished, but to no avail. I have no understanding to what happened.There are very few films that have made me feel as if I wasted my money... This being one of them. My advice to you, if you really want to see it, wait till it comes out on video. At least that way, you won't have to spend as much money to just fall asleep to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers. "The Grudge" is about the grudge that happens whenever a person enters the house where an evil event happened. I believe, it is a theory where the negative energy remains. Misery loves company, like some of the people I work with at the post office. (I know that's off topic) The director knows how to create tension. This film is one long slow burn. Anticipation of the event maybe worse than the event itself. The grudge lives for fear, and fear it creates. The Japanese director adds a new feel for the film. A ghoulish and mysterious feel. Fresh film, and strong story line that unravels in the right order. Made for the younger crowd, but a true horror film fan will love it. Worth seeing in the theater. I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even Sarah Michelle Gellar couldn't make this pig fly. Director Takashi Shimizu does a remake of his own bad Japanese film and produces an American version that is just as bad. Perhaps the Japanese are more easily entertained.I like Sarah Michelle Gellar (aka Buffy the Vampire Slayer) as an actress very much, but her choice in movie scripts is getting pretty poor. Even Buffy couldn't make this film any better no matter how well she acted. Bill Pullman, Clea DuVall, and the beautiful KaDee Strickland are also good actors but the script just gives them nothing to work with. I certainly can't fault casting or the acting here. It is just a terrible, somewhat juvenile, script and all the star power in the world couldn't have fixed that.The direction and cinematography wasn't bad. The camera was always in focus, the segues were nicely done, and everything seemed to be in frame when it was supposed to be. However, the special effects weren't scary at all. In fact, they were a little silly. The only thing that will have you jumping out of your seat is the loud sounds whenever an event of some kind takes place. It is just more annoying than anything else. What made this movie so bad was the stupid premise and even dumber script. It is truly the "Dumb and Dumber" of horror movies. The premise is that when a person dies in a rage that the place where they died is then haunted. If that were true then one out of every twenty homes in America would be unlivable. It is just a silly and untenable premise. I also couldn't believe some of the ignorant things the characters did and said in this movie. It was so bad it was funny! People in the theater were actually laughing.Perhaps this is what happens when we outsource our horror movies to Japan. I'll take a good old copy of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" over these foreign films any day. Seriously, foreign writers and directors are just too mild and timid for American tastes. They are going to have to do a heck of a lot more then yell "Boo" to scare us! I hope this trash isn't an omen for the rest of the October movie season. Where is George A. Romero, Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper, and John Carpenter when you need them!Rating: 3/10. Don't waste your time or money. Too bad, I had such great hopes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A handful of clichés sugar-coated in plot holes galore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I went into "The Grudge" having low expectations. However, after seeing the 6/10 critics average, I thought, maybe it might not be so bad after all. Boy, was I wrong. The movie lacked dialogue, that of which wasn't extremely horrid (but there wasn't much of), and the only highlights of the movie were the scenes with the wonderful Clea DuVall and the actress playing her husband's sister. The movie was too reminiscent of other "Japanese" movies/remakes--"Ringu/The Ring" "The Eye" (all of which I actually liked) --but didn't hold as much originality as they did. It just basically pulled the same tricks out of the bag--black cats, creepy boy, creepy "ring" like girl, the two-dimensional characters...and not to mention the plot holes, which I won't ruin by going into detail. I found it quite amuzing, actually, due to the fact that several people were terrified of this typically predictable flick. There were too many unnecessary characters just there to have time added on in the movie to draw out their death, more-or-less. After all, this movie only tallied at a total of 96 minutes. "Oh, we only have an 80 minute movie!" "Let's add a random character in, away from the plot of what's going on and ex him/her off after 5 minutes of scary music and what-not like we do in the rest of the film." "Good idea!" "The Grudge" just overall did not deliver, and the only thing saving this movie from getting a 1 in my book was that it defied a very sacred place most people afraid of the boogeyman/ what-not go to when in a scary situation, (which if you ever see this god-for-saken movie will see) and, of course, the appearance of Clea DuVall (13 Conversations About One Thing). I'm sorry but the girl is amazing, and this goes in the "Why did you do this movie?" category with "Ghosts of Mars." The finale/conclusion happened so fast too, I could hardly catch what was going on and when analyzed it afterwards realized that maybe it went by so fast trying to show 'images' explaining what happened so that the audience would be confused but so wrapped up in the film that they wouldn't think of it's plot holes, but it was just a build up for me that did nothing but make it worse by "not explaining all of what happened." The concept, itself, really isn't as appealing either--Someone dies, they hold a grudge, their spirit lingers and kills all who gets in it's way--isn't near as original/exciting to me as You watch a tape, seven days later you die mysteriously, or You're blind your whole life and after getting a cornea transplant are able to see ghosts--Yes "The Ring" and "The Eye" had plot holes too, but not near as many as "The Grudge." "The Ring/Ringu" was artistically innovative in its shots in a sense and had good performances, "The Eye" was even better with it's haunting illusions, terrifyingly creepy score and even very touching moments of human emotion and the path between life and death, ane the love we have for one another, but because I have to make this short- "The Grudge" was a waste of my time, money, and by the end of this movie I was holding something far beyond a grudge....2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't do it for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge is a very simplistic horror flick with very little in the form of a plot. Basically Sarah Michelle Gellar is a nurse who goes to work in Tokyo, she encounters an evil spirit that posses its victims and claims their souls, before moving on to the next victim. The premise behind this is that when a person dies a terrible death, it leaves behind a curse that in turn takes another life in a terrible way, and so on.I thought the film created a creepy atmosphere, and had some cool imagery, but overall it was just way to dull for long periods. I don't think its the Japanese style that caused it, because i really enjoyed the Ring; perhaps this is just an inferior film - yep, i reckon that's the reason.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge was a big disappointment. I didn't see it in theaters but i did buy the unrated version on DVD. When i watched it I was excited because the commercial scared me so i thought I love a good scare so this should be really good. Wehen i was through with it I was angry. The movie to me didn't live up to the box office success or the hype. It didn't scare i fell asleep watching it. I got lost through the movie and didn't know what was going on. How it did so well in the box office is beyond me. Though i will say i tried to give the movie another chance by watching it without falling asleep. It didn't help I think it made it worse i still got lost and i saw more of the movie need i say more?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts off with an intriguing scene with Bull Pullman, and with few exceptions, is all downhill from there.I certainly didn't expect much from it, but I did expect a few good chills and an entertaining movie. The Grudge is all eye candy and false bravado, and while I'm all about the eye candy, I usually want an entertaining and engaging horror film to match. I didn't find it here. I knew I was in trouble when the old noise-turns-out-to-be-a-cat routine happened relatively early in the film.There are some cool effects, but they don't make the movie worth paying for. Throughout the film, I felt like the movie was made for people who haven't seen many scary movies.I liked The Ring. Forgive my ignorance, but I believe Grudge was made by the same people. And while The Ring had more than its share of glaring flaws, it was still very entertaining. Not Grudge.The movie did manage to create enough of a creepy backstory to keep you watching until the very end. The end arrives and I was left with the feeling that there was definitely a good story in here somewhere, but the result was very unsatisfying. It just wasn't worth my time.</fullReview>

HELLO, go to a friend's house or just stay up all night in a restaurant or a bar or anything.....When the detective decides he will burn the house, why does he go there in the night????????? Why does he go there alone? HELLO, get a freaking friend to go with, also why go inside the house to burn it? Couldn't try to burn it from outside?????????(btw the scene where the ghost of the boy fools him to think he is drowning was scary as hell because u know this detective will be dying soon)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good, but it could be better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today I watched the Japanese version of "The Grudge", is almost the same, in some scenes is better the original, but the American version wins in others (like the end). But let's talk about the one with my goddess Sarah Michelle Gellar; it is not as scary as I thought, I think the scary scenes must be longer, however it has three or four good horror scenes. Here in Mexico when the newspapers talked about "The Grudge", they said it was scarier than "The ring", I think not. "The Grudge" deserves a 7, the ring 8.5. The story about the original family at the house is not very clear, in fact on the Japanese version they told you more about the boy, who, by the way, is the same actor in both movies. It is not a bad movie, but definitely it could be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Translation from Japanese film to English - fine job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've often been disappointed with Japanese films translated to English versions (remake). I must confess that this particular translation is exceptional. True to the second JUON film, dialog and scene setup looks and feels like the original version. I believe that Bill Pullman was wasted in this film. He deserved a larger portion of screen time. This film as in the Japanese film, featured not the actors but the mood and story structure. It did not depend of actor's charisma. This film would've had the same punch and dynamics had it starred unknowns. Still, because this film is purely Japanese in concept, English audiences will find themselves perplexed with the concept of the haunting and the Little details of this story. The editing style is ingenious, one must keep his or her attention to every scene and dialog. You will not be disappointed with this film. Using the same director and a few of the original actors was wise of Sam Raimi. Raimi being a fan of genre helps this production greatly. Unlike Spielberg who lost his sense of wonder and found a sense in money. Enjoy and have plenty of popcorn on hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extremely entertaining movie for those that wish to be scared. Quite similar to The Ring but I have to admit that in overall Grunge is even better (I loved The Ring).The main difference between the two movies is that The Ring contains more plot while The Grudge concentrates on scaring the XXXX out of you.There are some very memorable scenes in this movie. Particularly unpleasant is a surveillance camera scene with a Japanese police officer seeing the ghost looking at him through the camera (reminds of the "girl going out of the TV screen in The Ring).Sarah M Geller is probably not "optimal" as the leading actress in this movie, although this may depend on the fact that I always associate her with the "less serious" Buffy series.Highly recommended to people with strong nerves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Japanese scary tale hasn't become Lost in Translation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Grudge' is the one of the spookiest films that I have ever seen. I was absolutely terrified especially by the end. If you want to make your girl friend scared, this film will deliver, I promise, not to mention the fact that you will probably be scared witless, too.Firstly, however, I hadn't expected it would be spooky enough for me to enjoy the film. To be frank, it seemed that the film would be funny because of the situation involving a group of foreigners come to Japan and, what a coincidence, meet typical Japanese ghosts, 'Grudge'. It sounds strange, doesn't it? But after seeing the movie, I changed my mind completely. I found it terrifying, I mean, really fantastic! This Japanese scary tale hasn't become Lost in Translation.Then, what makes the film work so brilliantly? I think it is exactly because the sound effects and the lighting techniques work so well ? real genius. I'm not a technician, so I can't really say how they do it, but for example they used a whole range of sounds for scenes with movement, which really stand out in the memory, and no sounds at all in the transitions. They used blue lights to make the screen clear, which I wouldn't love to see, and shadows for making the screen black, as well. These are really well executed but I was curious that there was no splatter on the screen.To sum up, 'Grudge' can't be recommended for someone who has a weak heart or children, but for someone who fancies seeing something really frightening, it's great. If you see the film once, you will agree Japanese houses are too scary to live in. Something may be lurking within! What a dangerous place to visit Japan is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think, before you see this movie, you need to ask yourself exactly what you expect to get from it. Do you want a good movie, with an inventive plot, great acting, and imaginative directing? Or do you want a very pretty movie that will frighten you?'The Grudge' will scare you. If you truly allow yourself to be taken into that world, the silences and sudden bursts of activity are sure to startle you. The cinematography is disjointed and creepy enough to keep you reeling and interested from the first "ghost mauling" to the final scare.Unfortunately, in retrospect, "The Grudge" just disappoints. This is because, frankly, I just didn't care. Something that would have elevated this movie from a "cheap scare movie" to a great viewing experience would have been to include even a "smidge" of character development. Instead, we get to witness a cluster of caricatures being hunted by some supernatural force. The movie missed its chance to allow the audience to love the characters before they are torn away from us, which kept the film from being truly great.Also, like most horror movies, the story line finally comes into focus in the final third of the movie. When it inevitably happens in 'The Grudge,' everything seems to make sense...but it's something of a let down. "Oh...so...that was it?" I remember asking myself at the time. There are no surprises, or clever twists at the end. Just...a solid explanation that is sufficient, and nothing more.In all, I'm disappointed that the obviously talented filmmakers missed their opportunity to make a truly memorable film ? something along the lines of "The Ring" (although I believe that movie has serious shortcomings as well).Instead, I imagine "The Grudge" will most likely languish in the dark pit of "movies that did well in their first week, but dropped off the radar once something better came along." See it if you want to have a good, solid scare. Stay away if you desire a movie that is completely filling, and memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try Not to Hold One When Watching the Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another recent horror picture trying to reach the intensity and intelligence of "The Ring", but failing miserably. "The Grudge" is a pretty bad dud as an American in Tokyo (Sarah Michelle Gellar) becomes the newest target of some unspeakable curse that has befallen a seemingly normal looking house. It seems that a terrible tragedy that involved a college professor (Bill Pullman) was the thing that caused the evil side of the supernatural world to rear its ugly head. The movie does not have much going for it. None of the characters are developed and the film-makers try to go for atmospheric tone to make up for the narrative's clear lack of pace and conviction. Really there are few scares, few effective scenes and very few smart cinematic executions within "The Grudge". 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films of 2004...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about THE GRUDGE in June of this summer. I was very excited to see it because I haven't had a good scare since...awhile. Although, I was a little skeptical as to whether it was just following in the footsteps of THE RING, which I enjoyed, and was just relying on the sudden hype about Japanese horror films to initiate its box office rather than containing an actual decent plot, craft, and performances. And you know what? My skepticism was correct. THE GRUDGE, in my opinion, is one of the worst films of the year. One of the main reasons it was so bad is that it is absolutely degrading to the original film in just its existence, and the fact it was advertised and promoted so well with complete deception. The plot, to begin, made sense, within its own context, but externally left many wholes involving the question of WHY? and SO WHAT? Ultimately, it was a very weak basis to deliver any scares, which leads me to my next point. There are no scares! I was absolutely disappointed with the lack of tension, and terror because there was none of it. There wasn't one moment where I felt scared or even jumped at the ridiculous, formulaic attempts to jolt you.The performances? Let me just say this... The best performance is from Bill Pullman who dies in the first five minutes (that shouldn't be considered a spoiler since it happens in the very beginning). It is probably the most shocking moment of the whole movie, actually it is. Not in the fact that it happens but more the way it happens. For the rest of the film, I envied his character. What I wouldn't give to be lying on the ground, dead, instead of having to watch this film. Sarah Michelle Gellar's performance was ridiculous and nothing short of. Actually, no other performances should be mentioned; they're all more horrifying than the film itself.To top it off, the directional skill is sloppy and seems incoherent. I was shocked to find that the same director of Ju-On participated in this film. There was nothing creative, nothing different, and nothing good. Pretty much summing up the entire quality of the film, which is structured in a senseless manner, exposing the stupidity of Americans who walked towards the sounds rather than run from them. By the way, I'm really curious as to why most of the characters are American, and if they're not, they still speak English most of the time. The film takes place in Tokyo! It makes me so livid just thinking about how BAD it is. Overall, the film lacks any sense, any scares, and any cause for care, making it one of the worst movies I have seen all year, and I've seen a lot!

		<shortDescription>The best horror film since "The Exorcist"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flat out scariest film in thirty years. Not since the "Exorcist" has a film scared me. This one gave me the shivers at least four of five times. Although the reviews on this one are all over the map the fact that so many comments are registered is a testament to the impact this film has had. Not recommended for children. The creative innovation of not giving the characters or the audience any breathing room or break was highly effective. If you watch this one alone you will be looking over your shoulder for awhile. Although I don't gravitate toward horror films I wonder if the fast paced style employed (like a Indiana Jones paced horror film) has ever been attempted previously. It was unrelenting and offered no hope for the victims. I recommend this film and marvel at its impressionistic flavor and ability to tap into basic childhood type fear scenarios. Scary stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only things that made this worth watching were the scenes of what I presume was Tokyo. Of course, my comments are probably irrelevant since I am not attracted to horror films. I realize the director also wrote and directed the original version in Japanese. I am not impressed. John Carpenter's "Halloween"...now, THERE was a horror flick that had legs.The acting was awful; the main character (the nurse)is insipid and has about three facial expressions: smiling, bewildered, aghast. The scary faces are pretty good, and the bodies are artfully rendered. However, the tension was lackluster. The explanation is idiotic. The inconclusive ending is just stupid. I watched this because someone recommended it -- he kept telling me how great it was. Hmm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sarah Michelle Geller is horrible in this movie. As is the director. Why do movie directors feel the need to end horror movies with some sort of last scare? It's not scary anymore because it is so predictable and in the case of this movie it doesn't even make sense. It feels tacked on for no reason - which it is.The middle of this movie delivers some real scares, but not enough to make this worth watching. Don't waste your time or rental money.SIDE NOTE: In the special features section of the DVD Sarah M. Geller talks about how the house in the movie is another 'character' in the film. No it's not. And I am sick and tired of hearing people say that about movies. If anything has some type of importance to a film (like a soundtrack or a set) people call it another character!</fullReview>

There could have been a little bit more scary part but there was a good story behind this and i hope that the producer could come out with another grudge and maybe this one would get a better rating on it. Some of my friends thought that this movie sucked b/c they didn't find it scary enough so they left in the middle of the movie.

		<fullReview>Ghosts stories are always creepy when it is in a decrepit old mansion at the far reaches of a small town. A ghost story that takes place in a modern Japanese bungalow in a residential district of one of the most densely populated cities in the world is creepier by putting the eerily aggravated poltergeists right next to everyday life. The frights come regularly and logically adhere to what little story there is. As a cinematic haunted hayride, this Americanized version of "The Grudge" succeeds with intelligence and reserve. It doesn't have anything to say, it just works like hell ? and succeeds - in making you feel terrified.The prologue is a gruesomely realistic death that does not hint at the supernatural, but the story is told out of sequence. The reasons behind everything become clear with time. It is a device that that keeps you very naturally involved through curiosity. We are introduced to the house in question. The living people are a transplanted American couple with a catatonic mother-in-law and a local visiting nurse (Yoko, played by Yoko Maki). Yoko comes to visit the mother-in-law and they are the only ones home when noises come from upstairs. Naturally, Yoko goes upstairs to check in the midst of checking an answering machine message; only to disappear with an astonished scream after meeting the first ghost, Kayako (Takako Fuji). The care center sends a replacement when Yoko fails to report the next day. Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) follows in Yoko's footsteps through the messy house to the immobile patient and falls into a shocked state after a glancing introduction to the horrors. Fortunately, her supervisor (Ted Raimi) has become suspicious of the absences and comes looking for her and gets the police involved. The terror comes frequently and unrelentingly after this encounter. It expands to consume the family, the investigating police officers and everyone Karen cares for in Tokyo. The bounds of this ghostly rage are not simply to be escaped by leaving the property, staying awake or lasting until sunrise.Director Takashi Shimizu keeps everyone reined in with the emphasis on minimalism in both production and acting in this Americanized follow-up to his original "Ju-On". There are special effects to enhance the supernatural, but the horror is done largely with the physical: lights turn off without explanation, a knock at the door comes impossibly fast after the person at the far end ends a phone call. This control urges the audience to anticipate and this ratchets up the tension. Bill Pullman has proved in various roles that he is adept at bringing quiet intensity to roles and he does here. Every character is given equal respect and screen time. Although this is an ensemble cast, the headlining star on the poster is Sarah Michelle Gellar. Clearly she and her agent are trying to edge her away from the threat of the "Buffy: The Vampire Slayer" role becoming a career buster. There are no sassy one-liners for her to fling at the monsters here. She is understated and finds a polite and frightened but upstanding demeanor to make Karen work. There is no melodramatic plot contrivance between events. People are drawn in by fear and curiosity. There are no ghost hunters, exorcists or supernatural experts of any kind here. The reasons for the ghosts' rage are hinted at through the characters' speculation and memories. Although I understand the original film is used as the back story."The Grudge" might not break new ground in creating a haunted house story, but it brings real terror, The camera isn't there to dazzle you, but rather to show you exactly what Shimizu wants you to see. You can't help but hold your breath for the next scare that comes forward to consume both characters and audience trapped like deer in headlights.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I've noticed with a lot of IMDb comments, certain reviewers seem to demand that every film they see have smugly intelligent plots that wallow in there own cleverness. I am not one of those people. If I watch an action film, I want to see explosions, gunfire and heroics. If I watch a comedy, I want to have tears of laughter in my eyes. You get the idea. Therefore watching a horror film, I primarily want to be scared. The Grudge is a very scary film, in both it's well executed 'jump' scenes, and it's creepy imagery. I've been a horror film fan for many years, and I'm talking about the masters such as Dario Argento, rather than directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that are churned out these days. If you want to be scared, watch this film. Way scarier than the original Japanese 'Ring' (which I also think is a great film).</fullReview>

I was a bit disappointed with the filming at the start of this movie, it skipped from one persons story to another without any real recognition that they had swapped stories.

		<fullReview>I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I first bought tickets and then checked the reviews at IMDb. I worried about seeing a bad movie. Well, I had fun watching the movie. Some parts, which obviously were meant to be scary, were actually quite humoristic, almost as in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.I don't consider this a bad movie. It's not a great movie either. Just a rather well made horror movie. It does not rely heavily on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. In my opinion, the acting was OK. Sarah did a very good job, quite convincing. The other actors were definitely not bad either, I liked Yoko.The sets are nice (and I don't care that the sets are the exact same ones that were used in the Japanese original).The scary moments were often predictable. But not always. I have seen quite some horror, and did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. Nice.The movie had some nice scenes that were almost original, like the trails of rubbish, the simple special effects for he ghosts, the eyes of the boy, the cat that made eery noises, the gurgling of the dead boy and his mother.Don't go if you want to see Sarah in another Buffy episode, because it is very different from her Buffy work, much more serious. Don't go if you only want to see movies that gather Oscar nominations. It's a good horror movie, enough suspense. I gave it a 7.</fullReview>

The Ring set the bar so high for movies of this genre that it's hard to match up. Remember... a great story line or an interesting plot are not requirements of a good horror/thriller (in my opinion). This movie scared me enough to think about it laying bed that night, a little more scared of the dark than usual. To me, any movie that does that deserves a 7+. If you liked "Saw" then you'll love this! (Saw sucked). If you thought "The Ring" was OK or bad...you'll hate it. Also i appreciated Gellar not being used as merely eye candy...nothing ruins a good movie faster than cheap wet t-shirt shots or half naked sprints through the yard with the sprinkler on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen the original (Ju-on) a year or so ago, and liked it, but I'd have to say that the remake was smoother than the original, and creepier. Keeping the story in in Japan was a nice touch, preserving some of the original feel. The plot was also tweaked in a few places to make it more accessible - for instance the time travel scene in the remake was better integrated into the plot.The movie begins with the unsettling and mysterious suicide of an American professor (Bill Pullman), setting the tone and providing some background for the unfolding story.Sarah Michelle Gellar, in Japan with her boyfriend (Jason Behr) who is studying at a Japnese school, is thrust into a bizarre supernatural world when she is assigned to substitute as a caretaker for an American family, in place of the regular caretaker, a local Japanese girl who has gone missing. Devoid of any Buffy-like powers, she nevertheless copes gamely through persistence and pluck.Ryo Ishibashi, who played the ill-fated suitor in the horror film "Audition", gives a workmanlike performance as the hard-boiled cop assigned to investigate the missing persons report. He soon discovers more than he ever bargained for.As the plot develops, these and other threads slowly come together and reveal a tale of unrequited love, jealousy and murderous rage, which transforms into a deadly and persistent spirit oppressing the house where it all took place.Some ghastly and gory surprises await the viewer, as the eerie, persistent sense of foreboding, of something just very wrong, pervades every scene and builds to the final conclusion. This is a keeper - I give it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Karen is an American nursing student in Japan. When a catatonic woman's home caretaker goes missing, Karen fills in for her to get some school credits. She arrives and learns what the audience already knows: there is something evil lurking in the house.The American version of the Japanese "Ju On" is an entertaining and quite scary haunted house horror flick, but overall I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied.Comparisons to the American film The Ring seem inevitable before stepping foot in the theatre, as The Grudge is the first (in what could be a long line of) American-remade J-horror films since the huge success of The Ring. However, upon viewing The Grudge, such comparisons are fair and perhaps telling.The movie is scary, but mostly because it relies upon quick and consistent scare tactics (many shamelessly lifted from Ringu and The Ring) rather than by creating an unsettling atmosphere--which made the others movies so successful as horror films. That isn't to say that the scares in The Grudge aren't effective. The images are indeed creepy and caused me to scream-and-jump almost every time. However, there is hardly a build-up or engaging mystery to the back-story of "the grudge", and when it is revealed to Karen and the audience, it is really difficult to connect it with the terror we are witnessing.The movie doesn't offer much in terms of characterization, which is an important element in ghost stories. The audience isn't given much of an opportunity to sympathies with our leads. What we have is a handful of Americans living in Japan and being terrorized by two (croaking and meowing) Japanese grudge-holding ghosts. And their hair. From Kwaidan to Ringu, it seems that the female ghost with long black hair has long been a theme of Japanese horror movies. I am assuming that this is a cultural thing that I do not understand, as I am very unfamiliar with Japanese culture. In the American The Ring, most traces of Japanese culture are removed and the movie has no Japanese characters or mythology. Samara and her dark black hair covering her face are horrifying across the board, due to great effects and even better atmospheric build up. The Grudge goes right for the money shot: Look! She's being haunted by BLACK HAIR! The basic plot of The Grudge is apparently rooted in cultural mythology, but it is not expanded on in the film. It is briefly mentioned by the Japanese detective, who I found to be the most interesting character in the movie. The Japanese director (Takashi Shimizu, who helmed the Ju-On series), has said something to the effect of needing to change many elements of the original that would not appeal to American audiences--most obviously, by switching to an American cast. While it is obvious that changing the lead cast is for language and financial reasons, I still find it curious that it consists of three separate groups of people (Karen and Doug, the Williams family, Peter &amp; Maria), all of which are American. Some are getting along fine with their jobs, studies and the culture, others are experiencing "lost in translation" isolation.The Grudge has a fair share of scares, and it will have you jumping out of your seat. But by the end of this movie, one can't help but wonder about the underlying narrative about Americans and Japan, especially with regards to the current trend of Hollywood dishing out the dough to remake J-horror films.My rating: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband and I went to see this movie, being the horror movie buffs that we are. Two hours later I found myself wanting both my money and time back. I was so disappointed. The teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film. There was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances, etc. I found most of the 'scary' parts to be more comical than anything. After viewing other movies based on the works of Japanese writers, I have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in Japan is not what is frightening here in the US. My advice: If you are a fan of true horror movies, save yourself the pain of sitting through this one. I can't really say that I would recommend renting it either, unless you have a free rental coming to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Real Ring 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Friends, this is a grand time to have a life in film. There are real advances still underway in this still new thing which is more about how we imagine than how we entertain ourselves.A particular device that interests me is the trick of transporting the viewer into the story in a way that actually works. Scary movies have this as a particular challenge because you cannot be afraid of something that doesn't actually threaten you.Check this out. It is a cross between the timeshifting usually associated with "Pulp Fiction" and the "watching" mechanism that worked so well for "Ringu." In this case, we have three watchers: the first two are a child who becomes an agent in the haunting, and Bill Pullman's character who stumbles onto the scene both as witness and cause. With this setup, we are introduced to a third "watcher," Geller's character. She has some elements of the detective, this inherited from many prior horror films, necessary because this is how much of the explanation is presented. But that's in the background here. Her main role is literally to exit her reality and enter a deeper reality as the watcher of the murder, watching also the first two watchers.In order to achieve this reality shift, the writer does something very clever. He slices the story up, shifting from time to time and among several related groups of people. This makes us watch closer, investing us deeper in the thing, but that could have been accomplished otherwise. The main effect of this shifting is to make it seem natural that as we shift, so can Gellar. When she does, she becomes us in a visceral way. Off-screen watchers get folded into on-screen watchers. Every image we have seen becomes a demon.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

The main ghoul made stupid clicking noises that sounded like "Preditor" and looked like a geisha having a really bad hair day. The second major ghoul was a cute little boy, made up like Eddie Munster that you just wanted to hug.Others have said that you have to understand the culture to "get it". No. Rule number one with good horror movies is they are SCARY....and they translate "scary" universally. You don't have to understand the "culture".

		<fullReview>The reason people say that this movie isn't scary is simple.Have you ever seen a really good scary movie or sad movie with an 11 year old boy and watched the boy in the theatre and seen him cry and get emotionally shaken up? Then after you are out of the movie he says it was stupid and that he wasn't frightened or sad at all. That is what these guys on here are doing. Intellectually, that is where they are at. Just look at their grammar.When people who are immature are disturbed by something they try to distance themselves from it and play it down. They think that by saying that it is silly that it won't scare them as much.This was one of the most excellent horror movies ever made. The plot is well written and has the feeling of credibility to it. The characters in the movie and their motives are believable. The special effects are effective but not overdone or "Hollywood".It will be a real shame if people miss out on this movie because it was so effective at scaring the pi$$ out of people that some people can't deal with it and have to try to cut the movie down.This one was better than the Excorcist and Amityville Horror put together.

		<fullReview>Creepy ghostly phantasms appear out of nowhere, a nasty house, fairly standard horror-flick components, but nicely put together in a superficial and derivative mix that somehow is not only fairly entertaining but not entirely without artistic merit. Most of the attraction is maybe from the Japanese style episodic nature of the story telling, the judicious but unashamed special effects, and the equally Japanese tradition that says you don;t have to explain all the details of the story. I must admit I did (I am told) fall asleep at least once, but I honestly don't think I missed too much. Like about half the rest of the people there, I was practicing the spectre-like a-a-a-a-a-a at the back-of-the-throat-sound on the way out. This is the kind of silly horror film you jump in, have nightmares about, giggle stupidly when recounting it to your friends, and generally enjoy before having fun slagging it off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Haven't seen any of the Japanese Grudge-films, but I really enjoy this one. I rarely get SCARED when watching films. I can jump, if the effect and sound is startling enough, but getting scared from a movie is a rare thing for me. But I did get scared from Grudge. Maybe because I didn't expect anything at all when I watched it. I didn't expect getting scared. I didn't know anything about it either. That was probably a good thing.This is a film that you, apparently, either love or hate. Most people seem to compare it to the Japanese Grudge-films, but even though I haven't seen them, I believe it isn't right to compare any film, actually. This film stands on it its own.The story is weak, most people say. I don't agree. The story is minimalistic, and done so on purpose. The story-telling techniques used - the broken time frame for instance - is perfectly done. The director knows exactly what he's doing, and I believe he got his vision through as he wanted it.I gave this film 8 of 10. It is a film you will enjoy watching, or hate. It's as simple as that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Grudge' is scary, yes, so on that level it will be enjoyed by dating teens in drive-ins and a few chirpy preteen girls in the theater, but scary is all the movie is. It isn't smart, it isn't well-written, well-directed or well-acted, it isn't intriguing or even interesting, it isn't fun, it isn't well-paced, it isn't even surprising. It's just scary and bad.The main character of the movie is the haunted house, which looms by itself in a leafy branch of a city street in Tokyo. I say the house is the main character because it's the only consistent thing within the droning two hours of the movie. What happens is: characters enter the house, hear a strange noise from the attic, go up to see what it is, see a cat, and then die. Occasionally a character lives only to die later, or leave the house and go home, to be killed by the ghosts of the house.There, I've just described the movie for you. You may be saying 'no, there HAS to be more than that!!!!!111' but there isn't. The reason for the deaths has something to do with a curse caused by someone dieing within 'the grip of rage' in that same house. When I say 'something to do with' you probably think that there's probably more to it than that?what I say is, there probably is, but I wouldn't know. I'd call the movie confusing but that's too much, it just plain and simple makes no sense whatsoever. By the end my friends and I were so disappointed and duped, we had about a hundred questions we were asking, but then we realized that the filmmakers themselves probably didn't consider them. So we stopped caring.The plot, or story, or formula, or whatever it qualifies as is merely an excuse to have different characters wander slowly through the same hall of the house and then pop something out at us, usually a hand or a cat, to give us a jump. Usually these jumps work, sometimes the movie goes so far as to be creepy, but that is it. Who cares if a movie is scary if it is not interesting in any way?I said the acting is bad, but that's not fair. The characters are so utterly flat and devoid of energy, the only human characteristic they have is curiosity, and they have a stinking lot of it. There are so many points in this movie where the characters walk slowly up or down the stairs, or through a vent shaft, or whatever, when any, ANY real person would've got their ass out of there.The movie is what no horror movie should be: boring. Don't see it. Please, don't see it.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***spoilers***spoilers***spoilers***spoilersThere are bad movies and then there are movies which are so awful that they become affectionately comical in their ineptness. Such is the case with Columbia Pictures' 'The Grudge.' This cinematic atrocity began when an otherwise well intentioned American saw a Japanese made for TV film 'Ju-on' and was inspired to remake the movie in English. This began a virtual tsunami of bad decisions which circumnavigated the globe until it washed ashore in Orlando on October 21, 2004.The premise, and I use the word loosely, involves a house in Tokyo haunted by a skinny Momma ghost who looks like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, along with her ghastly sidekick a chubby, rambunctious but evil second grader. Is there anything scarier than a creepy 8 year old Japanese boy? Sure there is! Count Chocula comes to mind. With this whimsical bunch we must add a mysterious black cat who I have affectionately named Chim Chim. (Remember Speed Racer?) As you have already guessed, they were murdered in this domicile of doom and now desire to kill everyone who enters the premises. You see, as explained by a Japanese detective, when someone dies in a rage their ghost seeks revenge on everyone who steps on the property lines as defined by the county commissioner or something like that, I forget. The story begins innocently enough with acclaimed thespian Bill Pullman leaping to his death from a balcony. My guess is Bill Pullman got this job because of his kids begged him for a trip to Tokyo Disneyland. Next we endure the mildly interesting saga of Nurse Yoko, 'oh no don't go in there' screams the audience, but alas she heeds not the dire warnings and is predictably snuffed out like a magic lantern. About 30 minutes into the movie we finally see its American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar might be a competent actress but I could not help thinking of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so much so that it was distracting. It is the equivalent to having Jennifer Anniston star in a movie about the adventures of six friends in New York. Try as you may, you just can't stop thinking about the other project which made her famous. But I digress, Karen, the nurse is hired as a replacement for the original care giver who disappeared at spooks r us. She snoops around, meets the ghosts, coma lady dies, and some other stuff happens. Watching the fair haired vixen searching for clues I half expected her to find the ghost and pull its mask off to reveal it was actually old man Gower who owned the abandoned amusement park! 'I would've gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids and that dog of yours!' Director Takashi Shimizu, who is vying to be the Ed Wood of Asia, made two unfortunate decisions involving sound. First, he choose to use a soundtrack only when someone is about to be killed. This is an excellent devise for obliterating any suspense because the audience gets a two minute warning to prepare for another miserably predictable murder. Second, he gave the ghosts a bizarre guttural noise that sounds like a gargling gopher. After the movie, I heard several people exiting the theatre making the sound and laughing.Sarah Michelle Gellar ends up being the sole survivor. And of course we learn that the fire she set to burn down the house was extinguished in time for the obligatory next chapter. However, considering the humorous reactions of the audience, they did not want a sequel but an apology. 'The Grudge' could be easily re-edited into a comedy, perhaps then it will be appreciated for its camp value. Baring that, this will go down as the greatest cinematic thriller since 'Godzilla vs. Megalon.' I would suggest waiting until the movie comes to your local discount theatre where it can receive the public ridicule it so richly deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Grudge" is a decent Americanized Remake of the Japanese original, but it pales in comparison, and has many small issues holding it back from being a great remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those reviews that's hard to write, if for no other reason than I feel that the score I am giving this film (a 6 out of 10) may be somewhat misleading. And it was a hard choice. I bopped back and forth between giving it an "average" score of 6 and a "pretty good" score of 7. But I had to fundamentally stick to my guns and give it the score I feel it deserves.Takashi Shimizu directs this 2004 American remake of his own 2002 release "Ju-On: The Grudge." (Which itself is the third film in an ongoing horror-movie series over in Japan, although it is the most well- known entry overseas, where the first two films have yet to see release) And it is a fairly faithful adaptation of his prior film, albeit with some large changes both in content and style to accommodate the mostly American production and the aim at a wider western audience.The film, much like Shimizu's original, follows a non-linear series of short story-vignettes set in Japan. These vignettes piece together like a puzzle to tell a much larger story of the effects a ghostly curse has on various people unfortunate enough to feel its grasp. The dominant focus is on Karen Davis, portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar, an exchange student in Japan who volunteers as a caregiver for elderly and disabled people to fulfill a college credit requirement. We also follow the impact the vengeful spirits have on the Williams family, an American family who was forced to relocate to Japan for work-related reasons. (Portrayed by actors including KaDee Strickland, William Mapother, Clea DuVall and Grace Zabriskie)The acting is uniformly good, although (similar to the original) some of the characters are under-developed and serve as little more than canon- fodder. Gellar sticks out as the only character with much development, and she does a great job with the material. Strickland, Duvall and Zabriskie also do great work with their small roles, which unfortunately almost exclusively boil down to nothing more than a few lines of dialog before screaming in fear during the scares. The other big standout is Japanese veteran actor Ryo Ishibashi as a troubled police detective all too familiar with the curse of the house. While he only has a few scenes, he's a lot of fun and does command the screen quite well.The production is also very competent, although I find it to be more troubled than the original. Shimizu, who was given a larger budget for this film and obviously a lot more "toys" and sets to play with behind- the-scenes, does set up his scares quite well. And his visual direction is generally well put-together. However, I did find that he almost degenerated slightly at times. His original film was a much more claustrophobic, slow-burning thriller, and it made the scares land so much harder as a result. This film feels more sanitized to me in terms of direction. His camera-work has a lot less "character" to it, and does feel a touch bland at times. But I won't complain too much.The rest of the production is quite nice. The set and costuming is very natural, the photography is basic and works for the atmosphere, and the music from veteran composer Christopher Young is quite nice.I suppose my fundamental problems with this film, despite a strong production and a capable cast, is that it feels like an unneeded and slightly inferior remake. Outside of the Americanized casting (which really felt pointless- why not just cast Japanese actors, or set the film in America with American actors?), the film is strongly similar to the original, with the only major changes being a few scenes that were dropped or added. And due to the more sanitized direction and loss of the "character" of the filmmaking, it just feels like an inferior rehash too often.I'm not saying it's a bad film. It's a very decent remake, and I do enjoy it, but it just didn't quite live up to the promise and quality of the original film. I know I shouldn't be thinking about that and that I should rate this film on its own merits, but it's just too big an issue to ignore. And honestly, if the original film had these issues, I wouldn't hold it in nearly as high a regard.As it stand, this is a remake worth checking out, as it is still definitely one of the stronger remakes to emerge from the "remake craze" of the past 15 years. (Which was arguably kicked into high gear by the outstanding American remake of "The Ring") But it isn't one of the best. (Though thankfully it is exponentially better than any of the trashy Platinum Dunes remakes that have been polluting cinemas for almost a decade now)I give this a decent, slightly above average 6 out of 10. (I'd give the original a good/very good 8 out of 10) It's creepy, it'll definitely give you chills... it's just not as good as the original.</fullReview>

The scariest part is probably that a person carrying the rage carries it all the way long. There is no place in the world where he or she can be safe. That in my opinion is creepy. Still I won't rate this movie good, cause as I mentioned its week on plot. I found The Ring way better with respect to the thrill it provides to the audience. Scary plus thriller is a deadly combination and as good as it can get for horror movies. Having said that I would recommend watching this movie, its worth your time.

		<fullReview>Compelling horror movie with a particularly jarring sound effect that while sounds like a noise you make in the back of your throat, is surprisingly effective at conjuring some truly nightmarish images. SMG stars (don't let that deter you though) as an aged carer living in Japan while her boyfriend chases his dream (Behr) when the woman for whom she's caring (Zabriskie) dies suddenly from unexplained forces that continue to haunt SMG and anyone with whom it comes into contact. Local police regard the crimes as being sub-human and inevitable, able to do little as the tainted house and its far-reaching curse claim more victims.More than a little reminiscent of "The House Where Evil Dwells" (1982), this American version of a highly successful Japanese movie ("Ju-on" 2002) is quite tense and although not especially gory (perhaps one memorable moment in the hallway of the school), still packs a punch. SMG is cute in her pixie, upside-down smile kind of way, and the supporting cast including Bill Pullman, KaDee Strickland, Ted Raimi, William Mapother and Grace Zabriskie are all pretty effective.Director Shimizu (who also directed the Japanese version) seems pretty capable in building almost unbearable suspense, delivering more than your average 'haunted house' picture. If there's one, mild criticism it's the Bill Pullman character connection was a little under-played, with only limited explanation for his character's relevance, though he does enjoy a couple of the more surreal and terrifying moments. Simple stuff, well told.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above average American remake of a foreign film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is due in no small part to the fact that the director of the original Japanese film, "Ju-On: The Gruge", Takashi Shimizu, is also at the reins of this effective shocker, which succeeds at melding a constant melancholy atmosphere with the traditional jump scares of the genre. It holds no surprises for anybody who has seen "Ju-On", but is still a good example of storytelling, as it moves from various points in time, telling of the assorted doomed individuals who come into contact with a Japanese house that had tragedy in its past. In 2004, an American exchange student named Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) does some investigating of her own, determined to find the cause of the horrific visions she's experiencing. Shimizu brings a great sense of style to this film, and, working from a screenplay by Stephen Susco (adapting Shimizu's original screenplay), does a nice job of capturing the experience of foreigners living and working in Japan. Even in its "unrated", extended form it's never as gory or exploitative as some viewers may expect, preferring to go for mood and atmosphere at all times. The director is also highly adept at building the mystery, as he reveals plot details a bit at a time and follows his characters on their doom laden paths. Moreover, we can like these characters and maintain genuine interest in seeing what happens to them. Special effects are generally well done, and one extremely effective touch is in seeing a supernatural occurrence actually show up on a surveillance tape. The integrated cast does very well under Shimizu's direction. The actors who played the ill fated family in his Japanese film - Yuya Ozeki, Takako Fuji, and Takashi Matsuyama - reprise their roles here, and Ryo Ishibashi of "Audition" fame plays the investigating detective. American cast members include Jason Behr, William Mapother, Clea DuVall, KaDee Strickland, Grace Zabriskie, Bill Pullman, Rosa Blasi, and Ted Raimi, whose brother Sam's company Ghost House produced the film. This has to rank as one of their finer efforts, a remake that is entirely respectful of its source and is just as legitimately creepy. Highly recommended. Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The U.S. remake is action-oriented, and pacier but is tamer than the original Japanese one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems to me that Takashi Shimizu was bound by certain constraints when he made this one. And it seems to me this film does not bear his mark whatsoever or do full justice to him.The original Ju-on had a much deeper story to it and is also more disturbing. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you do so NOW!The actors in the remake are the dumbest bunch of losers you could get with a dime. And I never did like Sarah Michelle Gellar.The C.G.I. effects run rampant in this version to the point of the film becoming a joke. I saw the U.S. version first and the original Japanese film much later. And boy did I feel CHEATED by the U.S. version. Plot: Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an exchange student who takes a job as a care worker to obtain social studies credit. Karen finds a closet that's been taped shut with cat-like noises coming from it. When she rips off the tape and opens the door, she finds a little boy (Toshio). The boy refuses to come downstairs so she asks him for his name. "Toshio," he says, in a toneless, eerie voice. Emma begins stirring and muttering in the other room. As Karen calms her, a dark shadow of hair emerges from a corner of the room...which soon reveals to be a face of woman covered by her hair. The woman's hair, which was covering her face, flies back to reveal the whites of her eyes. The irises roll into place and focus on Karen as she backs away in fright and then faints due to sheer terror. Karen wakes much later in Hospital. Karen tells her story to detectives, emphasizing the appearance of a boy. Over the next few days, she is constantly tormented by Kayako, in her shower, on a bus (while with Doug), etc. Frightened but determined, she starts research on the history of that house on the Internet by searching in Google. Eventually, she learns of the murders from the website of a Japanese Newspaper. On the same page, she also comes across the news of death of The American Professor, Dr. Peter Kirk. She now decides to know the entire history from Dr. Kirk's widow, Maria Kirk.... The U.S versions have 2 more sequels Grudge 2 and 3. Grudge 2 is again directed by Takashi Shimizu and is also a poor sequel to his original but adds more depth to the story.Grudge 3 is directed by Toby Wilkins taking Takashi Shimizu's place. Out of all the three Grudge films, Grudge 3 is the best one and has the most horror and is also the most disturbing one I have seen.Bottom line: SEE OR BUY THE ORIGINAL. IT IS A MILLION TIMES BETTER AND MORE REALISTIC. ALSO REMEMBER THAT THERE IS A SEQUEL JU-ON 2 (2000). If you want a COMPLETE COLLECTION, there are 5 Japanese FILMS and 3 U.S FILMS in all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Terror Lost in Translation in The Grudge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The whole time I was in that house, I felt something was wrong." -- Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar)It's a curious paradox. Human beings desperately hope there is a life after death, yet the core of all our nightmares is the terror evoked by anyone (or anything) that has actually managed to transcend death. It's instinctive: We just know that ain't supposed to happen. Ah, but if it didn't, there wouldn't be any need for Halloween -- currently, if polls and surveys are to be trusted, America's second favorite holiday -- or the creepy movies we like to celebrate it with.Like The Ring, The Grudge is a transliteration of an original Japanese film which deals with a fury that not even death can extinguish. And, like its predecessor, The Grudge combines time-tested techniques for startling an audience with an impressive and distinct visual style that takes those techniques and pushes the envelope, as well as recasting the story with better known occidental faces -- in this case, Sara Michelle Gellar, who has forged a career by fighting the supernatural in five years of starring as Buffy, The Vampire Slayer, and for the toddler set, the live-action Scooby Doo franchise. Well, I'm here to tell you that, hopefully, no toddlers will be attending The Grudge because, if they do, don't count on 'em sleeping through the night anytime soon. Geller stars as Karen, an American student in Japan who supplements her income by providing at-home care for housebound, English-speaking invalids. When one of her co-workers evidently fails to report for work, she is sent to fill in. It's, of course, immediately evident that something isn't right with the suburban home, as she and other witnesses keep seeing an eerie, noncommunicative Japanese child accompanied by a yowling black cat. Of course, the audience knows immediately that the boy and his ill-tempered pet are dead as doornails, with Karen left to solve the mystery of why their spirits are so restless.I'll confess right now that, while I've never experienced anything that I even remotely suspected was supernatural, I'm a sucker for scary movies, and writer/director Takashi Shimizu (who also helmed the Japanese original) knows all the right buttons to push, and then some. I'll qualify by saying that close friends have told me about some nightmarish apparitions, two even reporting manifestations not unlike several pictured in this film. I've even arrived on the scene scant minutes after such encounters, but, as I was told once by a psychic, I'm so insensitive and close-minded to the world around me that I'm completely incapable of perceiving the paranormal. Well, good, because if there are horrific things like these prowling around, I don't want to see 'em. Except, of course, in movies.However, the principal difference between "real" hauntings and cinematic ones, at least of what I've read and been told by supposed witnesses about things that jump out of closets, is that's all they ever really do. Any actual harm to a human being resulting from an encounter with a ghost is always personal injury due to trying to get the hell out of the house. But, if you didn't have actual victims in a film, there wouldn't be enough conflict, so movie ghosts, it seems, must have homicidal intent to be interesting. Accordingly, the wraiths in The Grudge are intent on drafting as many living humans to join their undead existence as possible, and they're pretty successful.The only place The Grudge really breaks down is in repeating the mistake of so many American horror movies, which is the Law of Dark Places: If there is somewhere you are convinced is inhabited by a dangerous maniac/demon/monster, as many of your cast members as possible must go there alone, and preferably at night, so they can be conveniently picked off one by one. In the last 20 minutes, no less than three characters, who all know what awaits them, race off alone to the haunted house, in the dead of night. There may admittedly be some justification because one of Shimizu's dramatic innovations is the realization that, having once visited the house, its evil will follow you wherever you go and you can never be safe again, and there's some mighty creepy stuff going on in Japanese office towers, commuter trains, even a local police station. Still, who in his right mind is going to go back in a house that is the very nexus of the evil?Certainly not yours truly, and I will readily admit I completely agreed with the members of the audience exhorting the characters, especially Geller's, not to return. The Grudge is an audience participation film, which you will certainly not get anywhere near the full impact of if you wait to see it on video in the safety of your own home. Fear, like humor, is a vastly more potent emotion when experienced communally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland "horror".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once you have become a part of it...it will never let you go. I'm sorry."I remember thinking that The Grudge was a pretty good horror flick when I was a teenager. Scary, as well. Boy, I must have been easily entertained back then.I suppose it would be pretty frightening if an evil spirit attached itself to you in real life, and there was no way to break the curse. But seeing it happen as The Grudge portrays it is pretty meh. This movie simply isn't scary. It relies on the simplest of jump scares, and it's only very often that they actually startle you.&nbsp;Scenes suddenly end and move on to the next, without ever explaining what happened to the characters in the missing time. People see things that would have any normal human being freaking out, and then carry on with whatever they were doing, as if nothing untoward happened. I haven't visited Japan, but I'm pretty sure that seeing vanishing, drowned ghost boys is so common there, that it doesn't cause much comment.&nbsp;Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a role that is so bland, that it hardly counts as a character. And she's the most fleshed-out of the entire bunch. Even the short runtime seems too long for what actually happens. The Grudge may have been passable back in 2004, but no longer. See Ju-on, instead. Or any of the other superior horror movies that have been released since then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a self-proclaimed horror movie 'junkie' it doesn't take much to draw me in. The trailer really pulled through for this movie, if it had not made it look so great, I would have never even bothered. Needless to say, I was severely disappointed. I think they threw only the remotely decent parts into the trailer... and made it look pretty darn good.But it wasn't.Throughout the whole movie, I recall one time I had almost jumped. Aside from that instance, I was trying not to pull my hair out at the rest. I found it more hysterical than frightening. Over all, I felt it to be very cliché and over dramatized.I do not think there is a movie that I regret watching more than this one. Give it a try if you want, but if you're looking for a thrilling horror movie, you are probably in the wrong place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grudge, The (2004) * 1/2 (out of 4) I'm all for remakes whenever they actually try to do something different, tell the story from a different point of view or whatever. However, I can not stand when a remake is basically nothing more than a scene for scene remake of the previous film. I watched Ju-On: The Grudge about a week earlier and found it to be a flawed, if creepy little horror film. This American remake just got on my last nerves because nothing new is really tried. It's rather shocking that the man who directed the Japanese version also directed this. It would seem that he would look at his original and try to fix the things that didn't work it in but instead he pretty much just repeated them here or made things worse. Unlike the original, this one here has no atmosphere, no creepy moments and the only real benefit is Sarah Michelle Gellar is hotter than the women in the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the senseless Buffy re-make? (no point)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How come we have to re-make movies that were not hits, to try to make more money? I don't understand, why did The Grudge need to be made, again? Why? Anyway after the little remake hate speech I feel a little better. So The Grudge was horrible, stupid, and pointless. The wooden dialog and typical horror movie behavior made me want to hit my self with a 2 by 4. The story senseless, the acting horrid, the creatures, dumb and stupid looking, and most of all not scary. And isn't the point of a horror movie to be scared? Oh no it's just to make it a PG-13 movie so little 10 year old kids can see it, and then brag about it to 9 year old kids. Why can't we just get out of this PG-13 stage, and move on to more mature films? So the basic plot of The Grudge is that there's some typical curse invading the typical house, with the typical characters of any typical horror movie. Soon the characters begin to explore the house and learn about the curse, and then of coarse try to fight it, and that leads us to a, ah sequel. What!!!!! I'm not going through this garbage again, no way, no The Grudge 2 for me.Basiclly, if you like your typical Japanise horror you should enjoy your self, other than that, stay away, far away. You don't want to see this one if your anything like me. Don't see it, a waste of money, and film.</fullReview>

I almost shut it off, because I had no clue what was going on; each successive scene contained characters different from anything we'd already seen, at different places, doing different things.I thought maybe they would all connect, and they did, eventually, but by that point, I'd forgotten who everyone was and why they were there.Sarah Michelle Gellar's acting is terrible. You don't really know why she does anything, it seems...The "jump" moments are okay, which is why I gave it two stars, but the end was so not-scary I just laughed, the entire time. The woman, groaning, coming down the stairs... that noise that's supposed to be scary but just sounds like someone with a dying radio in their throat coughing up a hairball everywhere... and then the woman in the closet, "oh no!! be scared!"

Sarah Michelle-Buffy- Gellar is as expressive as a Barbie Doll and cannot be compared to Julie Harris ,Claire Bloom or Nicole Kidman.The only good actor ,Bill Pullman has only got a supporting part.

Sarah Michelle Gellar might find it hard to get work after this project and its sequel. Another thing that was funny, when the kid opens his mouth, he meows. I mean, did he eat a cat at some point in the movie? Or is it still stuck in his throat after he got murdered?

I had to wait until this one was on InDemand so I could watch it after my lady went to bed since she doesn't like the scary stuff. I dug the hell out of this flick. It was pretty creepy and had just the kind of stuff I'm looking for in a scary movie. Also, I'm not at all a Sarch Michelle Gellar fan but she was good in this, I have to say. It's worth a look for sure. The one thing that I expected (as I expect with all movies of this genre) was a B.S. ending which The Grudge certainly has but what the heck, right?

It shows they really do lack the creativity and insight that the Japanese film industry has, and coming up with their own scripts is just asking too much. Sequel this sequel that, remakes and replays is what the American film industry has funneled down to.One of a few things that kept me away from wasting my time on a bad film were the CGI characters. CGI is understandable in most cases where a human cannot act in place of a certain fictional character, but I see the American film industry would rather crutch than do the homework. What made some great horrors so intimidating is that the creatures lurking about were not computer-generated stand-ins.I encourage everyone to watch the original "Ju-on: The Grudge", also recently released by Lions Gate Films "Ju-on: The Grudge 2". "Ju-on: The Curse" and its sequel "Ju-on: The Curse 2" (which is more of a continuation of its predecessor rather than a sequel) has not yet been released in the states, and was aired only on Japanese television but is available on (import) DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie by myself when nobody was home, ready for a big scare, right? Well, not really, I wasn't expecting much, and I was justified because this movie is pretty bad. There are maybe 2 parts that are actually creepy, and the rest leaves you thinking, "...okay... so where's the scary part come in?" This is a typical new age pg-13 horror movie. A bit of mediocre special effects, a few images the writers thought were creepy, a tortured soul or two, a creepy ghost-child, and a ghost that has a habit of making weird noises and, coincidentally, looking exactly like the girl from The Ring. Long black hair, pale, deteriorating skin, and an unexplained lust for vengeance...or something? Oh, and let's not forget the coincidence of, "Once you {spoiler edited by myself}, you're gonna die real soon!" and "Once you watch this video tape, you have 7 days to live!"? Yep, same boring crap, same boring scare tactics that don't work, same creepy music, typical lame ending that leaves it open for a sequel.It tries to be creepy, it tries to be the same overdone Japanese ghost suspense story, but it's just bad, that's all there is to it. Oh no, a face in the window! A creepy ghost woman on camera! Okay, what does it lead to? A big let down.Just watch The Ring if you want a decent American remake of a Japanese horror movie. But whatever you do, don't watch the sequel to that one.*SPOILER AFTER THIS POINT* One thing that really bothered me. The girl who somehow got her jaw ripped off. It was pretty scary and pretty gross when they showed her wandering around the lobby, and then another character goes over to her to help. Suddenly, we hear from another character...oh, they're dead now. What the hell? Just terrible writing.</fullReview>

Know, why am i so harsh? because every minute i watched "The grudge" i thought about "The Ring". The two seem to be alike, but "the Ring " is pretty OK. Maybe not everybody saw the similitude between the two but i think it is obviously. The symbol of the child who had a not-very-nice childhood, the child that walks on the hall of the building, chasing the woman, seems to be the twin sister of Samara, the fact that people die one by one, and they are attracted to the house, etc etc. Now speaking only about "the Grudge", not about "the Ring"...there are fun things like : boo-hoo, the bad spirit lives - of course - in the attic, and innocent-looking persons die first...if you want a really good, equilibrated, thrilling movie of the genre, watch "The Exorcist" (the old one) ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Japanese legend, there is a curse that occurs when someone dies in a grip of powerful rage. The curse gathers in the place that the person frequented in life, anyone who comes into contact with curse will be consumed by its fury until the curse claims their life, and then spreads to its next victim.The Grudge is an amazing horror story, with a fantastic use of jump scenes to keep you on the edge, or maybe even hiding behind your seat. The creepy imagery and sound effects make it impossible not to be scared, even if you close your eyes! Many people compare The Grudge and The Ring. However The Ring is too drawn out and confusing, but The Grudge keeps you guessing adding the element tension and anticipation.The Grudge keeps you on the edge of your seat because you never know whats round the corner. Much better than the original, its less confusing and a lot more scary, plus you don't have to read as many subtitles! I hope you enjoy this film as much as i did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a jewel in the history of scary movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since Carpenter's "Halloween", I was disappointed with so-called Horror Movies: there was a quick trends towards splatter &amp; gore, without any subtleties at all. So that when a friend ask me to go watch "the Grudge" I was rather reserved: I'd seen the Japanese original, as well as "The Ring" both the American and the Japanese version and neither of them had given me the creeps, though the lack of chopped-off hands &amp; feet, or too predictable shock effects were definitely a nice (unpredicted ;) surprise. Don't get me wrong, though, the original "Ju-On" is a brilliant movie in itself, but it is just not scary and "The Ring" is just plain boring.So, as I said I was very reserved and, to be honest, even more so knowing that Sarah Michelle Gellar starred as the main character: I considered her far from being a good actor. In fact, my friend only wanted to see the movie because he's such a fan of Sarah. Well, he got me to watch the movie in the end and, boy, was I in for a surprise: AFTER ALL THE WAIT A REALLY SCARY MOVIE, FINALLYFor all the fans of blood, intestines, torture and whatever: go watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre - this is no movie for you! This is a movie to feed your paranoia, your fear of darkness and of empty houses. It makes you watch the door to your cellar or the attic with goosebumps, lets you hear sounds in the night and makes you feel watched from behind. In short: IT GIVES YOU THE CREEPS.Notably, the movie does not rely only on the subtle effects of old movies to build up tension: not just quick glances of creeping shadows to hint at a monstrosity. You'll get all that, but sooner or later you'll be confronted with "the monster" face-to-face: no highly sophisticated latex Hollywood masks (that are more funny than scary), no rotten flesh and all that stuff, but still VERY SCARY (don't ask me why though).I must admit, though, that some of the surprise effects are very predictable, as many critics have observed before me. And yet, you won't mind them, because as opposed to many of the other movies where there is just the odd dismembered hand floating into screen to give you a quick scare without any real "justification" in the story, these shock effects just belong there: they are not scary because they are "surprising", but because YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T AVOID THEM. And finally, Sarah Michelle Gellar turned out to be a convincing actor after all ;)I bought the DVD the moment it appeared on the market and later also the Director's cut (which is not worth the extra money, unless you haven't seen "Ju-On" or liked it better: it is much closer to the original) and I MUST HAVE WATCHED THE MOVIE 5 TIMES BY NOW AND IT IS STILL CREEPY.If you're looking for subtle scares and, like me, are longing for the "good ole" creeps of early horror movies, this is just the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge, a remake of a Japanese film (Ju-on), is pretty well-made. The music adds suspense to the scenes and moments that make you jump and spill your popcorn are thrown in everywhere.The story is set in Tokyo when Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is assigned to care for Emma, a woman who appears lost to the world, when her previous caretaker, Yoko (Yoko Maki), disappears and doesn't return for work. After first meeting Emma, Karen goes to explore the house and then the scares begin soon after she finds a duct taped closet.This movie is not like any horror film I've ever seen. Some say it's too much like the Ring, but I think otherwise. The ghosts, spirits in this movie who are left because they died in powerful rage or sadness, don't just pop out, say "Boo!" or "Seven days.", Kayoko is welcomed into the scene by the noise she makes through her throat since her throat was crushed by her jealous husband and Toshio is recognized by his cat or his hisses and meows. It's not just a haunted house, either. The house isn't really haunted, it's the people who spend time in the house. Kayoko is found haunting many other places elsewhere.I hope this comment helps and gives you a new view of the movie. I rate it 9/10 because it scared the crap out of me.</fullReview>

I think so many American film makers feel if they can put in gore, it makes a good horror flick. To me, the scare factor is what makes a movie downright frightening and I think the Grudge does that.I was stuck with images and sounds from the film for days afterwards - I couldn't get some of the sounds out of my head. Even after the source of the images and sounds were explained in the film, it was still very disturbing.I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 because I do not frighten easily and this scared the living s---- out of me. I haven't had a film cause me to have problems sleeping for years and this one did the trick.

		<fullReview>The American remake of the Japanese Ju-on, this time know as The Grudge, is just as good as the Japanese original - but this isn't necessarily a great thing. This is because I found the original Ju-on very slow and not very scary - and this can be said about the American remake. I think the main reason for this is because Ju-On and The Grudge both has the same director, Takashi Shimizu. And with all due respect, though I never found Sarah Michelle Gellar to be a great actress, she does a good enough job in the main role as the American nurse Karen Davis living and trying to fit in a foreign country. This outing deserves a good enough 7 out of 10.If you really want to see a far superior Japanese-style psychological horror, then try The Ring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how bloodthirsty are you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film in the last I.T lesson of the year, and spent the majority of the time hiding behind my eyes with the other girls in the class. I would not have even chosen to watch this film if it hadn't been a democratic vote and I hadn't got a load of bloodthirsty people in my class. But i have so I was stuck with it.The film starts alright, from memory a woman wakes up just in time to see her husband to throw himself over the balcony, thats alright I an deal with that, but then the story seems to jump to different places and times constantly, not allowing a plot to develop.As my I.T lessons are only an hour long I didn't see the entire film, but what I saw was enough to put me off, a monotonous plot that seems to only consist of people walking in a house, seeing something and screaming in fear. In some cases the Grudge follows the characters elsewhere e.g. to work.I think the music in the film, is probably the best aspect, it enhances the development of each scene and adds some interest to some of the more boring areas of the film. I could tell this from hiding behind my eyes, being told by the boys when the scary bits were! So in conclusion, only watch this film if you are heartless, fearless and love scary faces! Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>undoubtedly the scariest film ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the grudge is without a doubt, truly terrifying! not only did i lose sleep after seeing the preview on Halloween day, but, it haunted me for days after. the other thing i like, is that it challenges your thinking by giving us a very difficult and complicated plot, but, that doesn't spoil it, it just enhances your thinking. trust me on this film (i'm training to be and expert critic and screenplay writer) it SCARY! with overall good acting and a unique score, it also delivers nearly 2 dozen scares! true masterful film-making. i'd chose this over the ring any day. it's also great to see for the 1st time ever, the director of an original movie come back for a remake, which makes this film even more great. filming in japan seemed to do even better for the grudge because it kind of made you feel awkward, especially watching Karen Davies (gellar) trying to fit in. if it was made entirely in Hollywood, i predict it might've failed, as we probably would've got another modern horror, but, filming away from the usual territory has almost made it look ancient and mythical. the grudge is the stuff of nightmares and nothing will come close to it, except perhaps for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GRUDGE (2 outta 5 stars) Okay, maybe if I hadn't seen "The Ring", "The Eye", "A Tale of Two Sisters" or a zillion other similar Asian horror flicks I might have liked this one a little more. There are a few scary moments... but, for the most part, this movie is not gripping or compelling at all. We barely get a chance to care about the characters. Heck, Bill Pullman throws himself off a balcony in the first two minutes. A pity that Sarah Michelle Geller has to stick around for the full 90 minutes to show off her non-acting talent. Hey, I loved her as Buffy but some actors only have one good role in them. I fear that Ms. Gellar's talents have about run their course. None of the other actors are able to garner any audience empathy either. We know is that something bad is going to happen... over and over and over... but we don't really care about the people that it's happening to. I'm sure the original Japanese movie was much better than this. I should have known better than to try watching the inferior American remake first... even if it did have the same director. How is it that the WORST remakes are made by the original foreign directors themselves? (See also "The Vanishing"... the Dutch film, not the American.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scared !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the store to look at movies on DVD and I was mainly looking for a good scary movie. I saw the movie, The Grudge, and I remembered I had heard, from a lot of other people that it was a good movie to see so I decided to purchase it. I saw a couple other movies which looked like good ones to get, but I figured I didn't want to spend all my money in one place. So after enough debating, I chose The Grudge and White Noise. both good movies. I had previously seen White Noise and decided to get that one since I had liked it from viewing it previously. The Grudge was one of the scariest movies I had ever seen. I would recommend anyone to see either one of these movies. I definitely got what I expected to get.... a good scare !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A completely unnecessary remake of the original. What's the matter with the American producers, or even worse - the audience? Is subtitling really that scary?Is this movie only worth a 1 as compared to the 8 I gave the original then? Well, in all fairness perhaps not. After all it's the same director who's done them both and he's still - despite the bigger budget - been very careful with adding special effects (which usually are the dearth of all American original horror stories). However I maintain that the original was far more effective and a lot more unpleasant to watch.Unpleasantness is after all that which we're looking for in a good horror movie. :)</fullReview>

Why didn't the movie show the crime scene investigators being killed by "The Grudge". The assistant to the police man that was killed even went upstairs with him to find the phone and he wasn't killed in the movie. Any one besides me noticed these things? I also wondered why the sick mother wasn't killed immediately - it seemed like "The Grudge" allowed her to live and die later on in the movie. I was also confused as to whether or not the boyfriend of Geller in the movie was allowed to live or not? Also does anyone know if the original version is for sell with English sub-titles or voice overs? I thought it was a pretty good movie but it left me wondering about so many things in the movie. Why was "The Grudge" lady in every picture with the professor - Did he know she was in love with him? Why didn't he notice her following him so she could be in the pictures? Would someone please help me understand the movie better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film was passable, but the plot didn't really seem to be going anywhere. its watchable if you are really into your Japanese remake films, but as always they miss a certain something that the original has in spades. whats that, you ask? ACTUAL SCARY BITS. possibly its just because you have to actively watch the film in the Japanese version due to the subtitles but they know how to hold you in suspense, whereas the American version made me laugh or go talk to my mates on my phone, make a cup of tea...it just bored me to tears. my advice? go rent the original along with the Ring and Ring 2 Japanese versions and appreciate them, rather than watching the dire crap American attempts. poo poo poo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of the suspense thriller horror movie. I much prefer the blood and guts thrasher style horror. There are a few exceptions though when done right, this was not one of them. Imagine the Ring, but gayer and in Japan. It has the similar special effects and even the "zombies(?)" look very similar. This movie however does not have nearly as good of a plot or script. They try to make it more interesting with the flash backs but it was just confusing as to what was going on and why. Then it all came together at the end and it was lame. The girl going down the steps at the end was very reminiscent of the scene from the Exorcist, except the Exercist scene didn't suck and was totally creepy. The only thing this movie had going for it was Ted Raimi, that dude rules, and he had hardly any screen time. Would not recommend this unless you are into totally unoriginal suspense thrillers that suck, then you would probably love this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>yet another ho-hum horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At exactly 17 minutes and 45 seconds into "The Grudge," the ever-reliable cat jumps out of a closet and scares somebody. I tell you this only so that you will know when you will be able to take a quick refreshment and/or restroom break and not miss anything. It also pretty much underscores the modus operandi of this film, which is "don't bother with something new when something old will do." For although "The Grudge" is a remake of a recent Japanese film ("Ju-On," made by the same director, Takashi Shimizu), there really isn't anything here that we haven't seen hundreds of times before in haunted house movies made east of the International Date Line.The bland Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a young foreign exchange student living in Japan who volunteers as a care worker in her spare time. When she is sent to the home of a strangely "lethargic" woman, Gellar begins to suspect that there is something not quite right about the residence. From then on, she and several other people, who also share a connection with the house, are haunted by a ghoulish specter who keeps popping up in the strangest places and at the most inopportune moments to exact her revenge for being done away with in an untimely manner (although none of the people she pesters had anything to do with her demise).Although there are a few mildly suspenseful moments scattered throughout the film, "The Grudge" is simply too derivative and too hackneyed to register much of an impact on our psyches, with a great deal of its imagery ripped-off from that seminal horror film "Carnival of Souls." The story makes very little sense when you start to analyze it seriously and, after all the huffing and puffing to arrive at a stunning climax, the ending deflates like a slowly leaking balloon. I haven't seen the original version, so I have no idea how it compares to this one. But I can hardly imagine it was anywhere near as undistinguished and lackluster as this one is (or else why remake it?). Even with the same director at the controls, perhaps something simply got lost in the translation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story and 'scare' overdose kill this professionally made, good looking horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very good looking. The 'ghosts' are extremely creepy looking and the sound effects are horrifying. Everything a good horror movie needs you might say. Well, not exactly, unfortunately the movie also suffers from some bad storytelling and a 'scare' overdose that take away a lot of the movie its tension and scary moments. It makes "The Grudge" a good looking but lacking horror movie, that perhaps still has more goods as bads but still remains a bit of a disappointing movie with lots of missed opportunities.Problem is that they basically tried to put a scary moment in literally almost every scene. I don't know why but after a while some of the scene's loose their power to scare you. Maybe its because you get used to the atmosphere and the scare moments of the movie, or something like that. Instead of making the movie scary it made the movie predictable and too much of the same the whole time.The movie its story is told in a completely illogically way. the time-line is very messy, it jumps from the present to what happened a few hours or days or years before to some totally different characters. It's not that it becomes difficult to follow but it's just that it feels pointless and unneeded that the story is told in that particular way. It also distracts from the main story line and the main character played by the boring and untalented acting Sarah Michelle Gellar. As a matter of fact, the story is told in such a way that the main character is perhaps only on screen for 50% of its running time, at the most.Big plus of me was Ted Raimi in a typical Ted Raimi role. His more famous brother Sam was one of the producers of the movie. Too bad Sam Raimi didn't directed this, I'm sure he would had made something more of this movie.It's all too bad, cause "The Grudge" is a well made movie that had lots of potential to become just as good as the other Japenese horror movie remake "The Ring". The movie however heavily suffers from the makers ambition to make this the ultimate scary movie. You might say that this movie died of a scare overdose.Still of course the movie still remain perfectly watchable thanks to the visual look of it and some nice sequences.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conjugated plot about a "house" that destroys all those who enter it and the curse that began it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The absolute worst movie of all time. This movie displays the non-existent acting abilities of Sarah Michelle Gellar in the starring role as a "house-keeper" or something or other. The assignment she is given seems harmless until the people living in the house, and those involved with people living in the house, turn up dead. Also, a weird little boy is seen in parts of the house that have been closed off for years. In an attempt to complicate things, the plot also includes the origin of the curse placed on the house. All in all, the plot is only a front to stick as many "don't-go-in-the-closet" scenes as possible in one movie. This would have been fine except for the fact that all the scenes are shown in agonizingly slow and predictable style, with a scream, whoop, holler, or shriek around every corner. When the "shocking conclusion" finally comes around, you're to strung out to care, still trying to recover from the last random blood-curdling scream. Some of my more weak-willed and easily scared friends have called this movie the "scariest movie of all time." To me, this movie is a run-of-the-mill Hollywood product without a mind of its own.It is a sorry attempt to take a movie that was a hit in Japan, throw it through the "Americanizing" machine, and send it to a "theater near you."Bottom of the barrel shriek-fest.</fullReview>

The ghost of Kayako was so creepy, she even scared me when I watched the behind-the-scenes sections. This is one spooky movie, mostly because the people involved are completely in the mercy of the ghosts. In America, the heroes would be looking for a solution, but in this one, they don't have much of a chance. That makes for a big difference. In the behind-the-scenes sections, they talked about how in American horror movies, the people who get killed are shown having deserved it, somehow. In Japanese movies, the victims are truly innocent, and that just makes it all the much worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Grudge' is a horror film about a haunted house, although the characters are able to leave the house. Not that it really matters, once you have entered it you are doomed. Sarah Michelle Gellar is one of those people, Bill Pullman belonged to them three years earlier. The opening sequence involves the Pullman-character and it felt so good I thought this film might be pretty good. For me it was not, the first scene stayed the best, but I realized that a lot of people might enjoy this. I mean, you want it to be scary and I guess it could be for many. At least the person I was watching it with found it to be quite scary.My main problem here is that even when it is scary for some, the moments are created through the ways we have seen so many times before. Empty places and people alone, instead of walking away they take a look. Funny how people in the film are instantly scared when they hear a noise, even before they realize strange things are happening. The music tells us something will happen, the camera stays close to the character so things can enter the screen quite suddenly and then... well, most of the time something that has nothing to do with the story gives a reaction to most members from the audience. 'The Grudge' has these moments, although most of them actually do show us events that involve the story. I just didn't care much since we have the same approach here.Up to a level I guess I enjoyed it. For me some of the fun came from guessing what would jump in front of the camera, but again, my friend was actually scared at times. Therefore I must admit this film does the job better than most horror films. Films like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' or 'Wrong Turn' depend on gore, this one at least has the nerve to depend on the old simple tricks (keeping it a PG-13 rated film), apparently succeeding from time to time. If you normally enjoy this kind of film you will like this very much. If you want an interesting and intelligent story you should avoid this, it is as simple as that.</fullReview>

In the movie theater you do not get the real affect of it because u can hear other people there with you. When you watch it alone it scares the crap out of you..

		<fullReview>"The Grudge" might be uneasy to watch for some moviegoers, because not everyone is willing to appreciate the special way of storytelling (jumping back and forward in time). But it delivers everything the original did. Its scary, sometimes you jump (especially if you own a surround system) and the story about a curse, that remains in the house where the crime happened, haunting everybody who's getting in touch with it, is just great. There is no escape...I love this movie for what it is: a spooky little nightmare with no way out and some great scares. I had to get used though, to Gellars acting, but altogether she did the job not that bad...Its a good thing to remake Japanese classics for the western screens. Up to now, none of them failed my expectations and finally there is more on the horror screen than just screaming teenagers and dumb dialogs"The Grudge" deserves - in my eyes - 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last ghost movie I've seen that made me feel a bit uncomfortable was "What Lies Beneath". A suggestive movie that had the touch to really creep you out with the occasional scares.When a friend of mine asked me if I would like to join him for a movie night out for The Grudge, a new horror movie with Buffy, my expectations were low. I don't like too much blood, gore and all that other stuff that's actually more hilarious than frightening. And when he said the word "horror", that was the first thing that popped into my mind.But from the first scene of The Grudge, I immediately had the feeling that this could be another kind of terror. And, my oh my, during the entire movie, I held my hand in front of my face, scared of what was coming next! I never thought a movie could be so extremely psychological terrifying. A good horror movie is a movie that scares the h*ll out of me, and The Grudge did more than that. Perfect camera angles, creepy music or just nothing but silence. Excellent.My friends and I still talk about it and we all agree that this is the best horrorfilm we've seen until now. Props to Takashi Shimizu for making this film as it is now! It worked ... it definitely worked. ;-) Can't wait for the second americanized installment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The whole time I was in that house I felt something was wrong."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi. I live in Tokyo, and I just went to see The Juon at a cinema in Ikebukuro.As a horror fan who is aware of and disappointed by the fact that 95% of horror films are pure and utter shite, I am constantly on the lookout for a decent, full-blooded, and - damn it - scary, horror flick. The Juon is it. At last, another gem to prove that horror is not dead and will continue to shamble on zombie-like producing the occasional spine-chilling shocker which makes the wait worth it.It may be true that there are some cultural factors involved (which might explain the negative reviews from some of our western friends in the discussion boards), and I will readily admit that perhaps it had such a big impact on me because I could relate to so much of it.I mean, the interior of the house looks exactly like my apartment; tatami floors, sliding doors and closets, and so on; the Tokyo scenes were all familiar; the freaky wild-cats-in-heat noises that sound like babies from hell all over the city during mating season; I know what it feels like to be a fish-out-of-water gaijin in Japan (I'm Irish) and like Bill Pulman's character I am an English teacher.Without wishing to create any spoilers for those who haven't seen it, I'm sure those who have will appreciate why I was suitably freaked out.There is often terror to be found in the familiar (just ask Stephen King), so perhaps it was a little too unfamiliar for western audiences.Also, people complain that they can't understand this or that, and demand explanations. In Japanese horror, it is the understated, the inexplicable, the unknown, that makes it scary. The same thing happened with The Ring. People wanted explanations for everything: who is Sadako? What motivates her? A lot of these questions were addressed in the American remake, with the result that the clarified story was too ridiculous and unbelievable. Basically, they tried to explain too much.On the other hand, it should be borne in mind that a lot of the negative reviews (saying it's not scary, etc.) are referring to the American version of the movie only. If you check out the "trivia" section in the menu on the left of this IMDb page, you'll find that the movie was released cut after American test screen audiences viewed it, presumably because it was too scary.Can't have that now, a scary horror movie. I know, I know. I'm scratching my head too.If you're a horror fan, do yourself a favour and try to get a hold of the uncut Japanese version (ie; the real movie). I'm not sure, but it might crop up on DVD. Now that is what scary is all about.Forget 'Freddy vs Jason', or 'Jason goes to Space' or whatever. I give The Juon 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sarah Michelle Gellar has done it again.She really showed that even if Buffy the vampire slayer show has been canceled,she still is a horror queen.Sarah plays a caretaker in Japan and lives with her boyfriend named Doug played by Jason Bher who is known by his role in Roswell. I really love every project Sarah did in the past but this is my favorite one.I would like to suggest to every Sarah fans to watch this film.Jason bher has worked with Sarah before.He appeared on the show Buffy as her ex and wanted to be a vampire.Sarah is married to an actor Friddie Prinze Jr.In this film you will see many scenes which are just alike the Japaneas version.So ,Sarah's fans, i want you to go out and see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scares, scares and more scares!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grudge is the scariest horror film of the last 15 years. Made by horror-pro Sam Raimi it is a lot better than his previous remake of The Ring, and 100 times as scary. The story unravels superbly throughout the film and is presented in well thought-out flashbacks. Sarah Michelle Geller gives an okay performance, and although it's nothing special she is good enough to keep you entertained. Bill Pullman, however is very good and it's a shame you don't get to see more of him. Not only is this film scary, it's very interesting, it not being just another brainless horror movie. The story really grips you and doesn't let you stop thinking until the end. It's a creepy, chilling, disturbing, sad and frightening film, with the scariest scenes being enough to make you want to close your eyes and shut your ears. There are enough scares and jump out of your seat moments to keep horror fans happy, and to make non-horror fans wet themselves, But really, if you're not horror fan, you shouldn't be watching this. It's not all blood and gore, instead the supernatural world that provides the scares and that prospect is always more frightening than films of s splatter fest nature. Be warned though, if you're a strong believer in the paranormal you won't sleep for weeks, having the end scenes imprinted on your mind and THAT sound (you'll know when you hear it) ringing in your ears. You'll switch off thanking your lucky stars it's over, but being thoroughly satisfied at the same time. NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sucked so bad! I was disappointed, I thought this movie would be scary but it was just stupid. I didn't get the point of it. It wasn't scary just stupid. Lame attempt at scaring people. The first part was the only scary part, and that was barely scary. I mean the movie is just blood and the music doesn't scare and is not used right within the movie. This director did not know what he was doing. Even Sarah Michelle Gellar who is usually good was really bad in this movie. The movie wasn't explained well either. The end was sudden but welcome. I was just glad the movie was over. I love horror movies, I know when something is good and scary, this was neither. It didn't deliver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grudge Sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be the worst horror film I have ever seen. Just make a quasi-burping sound and bulge your eyes out and that is how scary the film got. There wasn't even any flesh in the brief shower scene with Sarah from Buffy fame. If you are going to make a cheesy horror film at least toss in some flesh. But nooooooooooooo. Just a bunch of Japanese kids making burping sounds. Perhaps they ate some bad Sushi.Not scary, interesting, sexy, or anything at all. They even shot most of the film during the day! What kind of a horror film is shot this way? Save your money and play Bingo with your grandmother.Shutterbug</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grudge............</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First time I went to see 'The Grudge' is was already nervous about going to watch it but then it got worse as I watched the film. I staggered out of the cinema and was really nervous and a bit scared 'cause i had to get the bus home late at night..... it freaked me out as well!!! I had to watch the comedy programme 'Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps',I need something else to think about.. all I could see was parts of the film flashing before my eyes. 'The Grudge' knocked me off my feet..... it was such a good performance by Sarah Michelle Gellar!! I thought the film was excellent and I can't wait to see if they do a sequel like they have with 'The Ring'. If they do its gonna be great!!! 'The Grudge' was one of my favourite movies of 2004.... and I hope they do, do a sequel. I can't wait....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good scares, but confusing story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To most Americans who watch this, with no previous history of watching the prior Japanese films, and without reading anything about it, this film will prove to be illogical and quite confusing. There are plenty of wonderful jump scenes in the film, and it is perfect for a dark stormy night if you just feel like being scared. However the plot won't make much sense to anyone who hasn't read a whole lot about it before viewing it. And in most cases you need to watch the film more than once to get the "full effect" from it and catch everything. Overall an enjoyable horror film..not one of the best, but certainly not one of the worst. We are not nearly as jaded by these types of film that the Japanese audiences are, so we can enjoy these interesting new horror concepts as we see them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not sure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming back from the cinema after seeing this film, I'm not quite sure what to make of it. I guess it was on the way back, through the dark, empty streets, that I realized something was missing. Something important, maybe even crucial, something that needs to be there after just seeing a horror film on the silver screen. I wasn't scared. I wasn't looking over my shoulder, I wasn't listening for any strange sounds, I wasn't even looking twice on any person I walked past on the way. I'm a sucker for scary movies, I'll tell you that right away; but this didn't scare me. It startled me, made me jump in my seat, but that's it. That's what the 'horror' portion of the film is, a long series of jumps. There's nothing wrong with that... but that's just all it is. No real gore, no atmosphere, no psychological terror... just jumps. I'm not saying that any of the aforementioned qualities would make a better horror movie... but they probably would make it more 'full'. The truth is, sadly, there's nothing in this movie that will really stay in your mind for very long after you leave the cinema... if there's still anything after the end credits. Luckily, the director rarely resorts to the cheap jump scares... few of the shocks come from a cat jumping down from a shelf or a friend appearing behind the main character, reaching out and grabbing their shoulder. Most of the time, when you jump, it's because someone just died or something genuinely disturbing just happened. The worst thing about the jump scares is probably that you can only watch and still... well... jump, because after that, you'll know where and when the jumps will occur. What makes this watchable apart from the undeniable effect of the jump scares is that, on some level, it manages to appear deeper than it is, without being condescending. There are plenty of little details, stuff that only the most watchful eye will notice. The way the story is told is masterful in a way... very little dialog is used to explain it. A series of situations and powerful acting tell us far more than Hollywood-like dialog(which the film has slim to none of) could. The plot isn't deep, and it isn't really the driving force in the film, but there's enough of it and it's mostly good. The acting ranges, but most of it's pretty good. The characters are well-written and interesting, but most of them just aren't developed enough for us to care about whether they live or die, which is a fatal mistake on the directors part, because it kills a lot of the suspense. The non-linear time-line is presented so casually that many viewers will probably be thrown off(I know I was), and not know when exactly something is happening. One final note before I pass verdict; personally I thought it was a mistake to cast Joxer of Xena: Warrior Princess(Ted Raimi) in a serious horror film, but at least his role isn't very big. Also, he *is* the executive producer's brother, and, well, that's pretty much Hollywood in a nutshell. All in all, the film is pretty much worth watching, but probably only once, and with reasonable expectations. I recommend it to fans of the Japanese horror films, keeping in mind that this is an Americanized version(but done by the same director). However, even though I haven't seen them myself, you should probably see the original Ju-on film(s). Also, personally I don't think this is as good an American remake of a Japanese horror film as The Ring. Go see that first, as well. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can we have a plot, anyone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Japan has a somewhat unhappy love story with Western culture and Takashi Shamiza is part of that. They might be good in learning the techniques, but usually miss the humor and the irony. Just trying to make copies isn't enough, however good the copy might be.There have been less clever horror movies than this one. There are some jump scenes here that (almost) make you freeze, even if you know that such a scene is coming, but the plot isn't narrated in a good way. Sarah Michelle Gellar doesn't look scared enough and why does she have to go and check out the strange sounds in the house? Hasn't she seen any horror movies before? The script isn't logic, not even according to spooky film standards. This movie is just an average one in its genre, which means it's not a must. Not at all.By the way, it's strange finding that this has a PG-13 level in USA. People dies here, but that's all right for children to watch. Had there been any bare breasts, the R rate had probably been put on without discussion, even if the film was a total feel-good one. But maybe God wants it that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarrier than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The grudge was scarier than i expected it to be. (Japan)Mainly it's about a woman and her son who's murdered in their home by the husband.. The woman and the little boy haunts the house and kills everyone who comes in contact with it. The film acts out three years after the murder and an American man lives in the house with his wife and mother, there is also a woman named Yoko, who helps out with the mother. When Yoko goes missing, Karen(Sarah Michelle Gellar) get's to substitute for her, and she goes to the house to care for the mother (Emma). Karen finds a scarred boy in a closet, she doesn't know that the boy has been murdered three years earlier. She calls her boss and tells him about it. She goes in to check on Emma who is lying down staring. Karen looks in the direction Emma is and she sees something really creepy. When her boss comes to the house Karen is sitting shaking in a corner, Emma is dead and they also find Emmas son and his wife in the attic - DEAD. It goes from there.. with a lot of death and other scary things. Karen discovers why they were murdered, and finds out that since she's been in contact with the house she is in a real danger zone. Sarah Michelle does a great job acting scarred and I give a lot of credit to the Japanese film makers. They really know how to give you nightmares (remember the ring?) Haven't seen this film? then i suggest you do..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect much but was I wrong. I can only say that it is a very good horror movie. Maybe the storyline was too thin and could have been spread out better over the movie, but there are lots of great effects and the acting is good, although Bill Pullman doesn't do a lot of acting in the movie. Sarah Michelle Gellar did a great job; I didn't once see her as Buffy. The obscure Japanese setting really works in this movie. It gives a great atmosphere to the movie If you liked the Ring and Dark Water, you must see this one. Actually the effects are better than in The Ring; the story though isn't.

The house was extremely creepy, and the way the ghosts moved gave me the shivers. I must admit that often the story line was predictable, yet I still screamed because the ghosts were really scary/creepy.I still get creeped out when I'm alone in the dark and think about those ghosts, and the way they moved. It was that slow slither yet sudden jerking that the little girl in the Ring did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films I've seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only one word describes this movie: Awesome. This movie draws the viewer in and holds them from the first scene to the last. As some may know, this is a re-make of the Japanese horror film Ju-on. I own this movie and the original is much better than the re-make, but the American version is wonderful. I think that the Grudge is so good partly because the director from Ju-on is used for this movie. They left the story true to the original, unlike The Ring, which wasn't anything like the original, Ringu, other than the main plot line. Anyway, back to The Grudge. The only thing different from Ju-on in this movie was that the main characters were American and they left a few scenes out. I'm glad that at least the setting was left in Japan. Over all, I'm very pleased with this movie. I highly recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in a crowded theater, and it might have affected my view on it. Right now i feel it wasn't that scary, if at all, but i think if i was alone in a dark room, i would have had a heart attack.The movie its self wasn't designed to be suspenseful, if it was they did an awful job. They seem to have based it on the jump tactic- having sudden things happen at calm, unsuspicious times. The other thing they did was they added some gore, but it wasn't violent they just showed some gruesome sights, these scenes were kind of creepy but not enough to make your heart race. The other not so good part of the movie was that the ghost was very unrealistic, it looked very animated. I myself feel this movie wasn't very scary but if you are an amiture then it is a good place to start before jumping into truly scary movies, but if your not easily phased then i would skip this one if u crave a true scare, but if you aren't in the mood for a really scary movie then go and give it a shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film on my birthday with my girlfriends on 17/11/04. I had wanted to go see it since i saw it on TV.I had a rough idea of the plot but nothing definite. From the moment Bill Pullman fell over the building i knew it was going to be a good film. At the first scary part with the cat...all of my friends jumped, including me. From then onwards we were hiding behind each other and squeaking. I was told it was the scariest film of the 21st century. Thats correct. Its the scariest film i've seen so far and i've seen quite a lot of films. Unlike most scary films, this actually has a plot that makes sense. It becomes clear though only at the end. Its a brilliant film, brilliant music, camera work, tension building and brilliant plot. I love japanesse films, and this is definitely one of them.</fullReview>

Most of the top rated horror movies in North America today started in a Japanese or Chinese theatre. Such movies as the ring and the grudge. (I guess Chinese/Japanese people have a better idea of what gives people nightmares three weeks after they have seen the movie.) But I guess the theatre make the movie much scarier then if you saw it at home. I hope you enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the film that SMG has been waiting for since Cruel Intentions. The plot revolves around the house where a gruesome domestic murder took place. Gradually every one who visits the house dies. We are shown flash backs to the original killings. The director knows how to crank up the fear factor and the whole cast delivers. This is an adult horror film. No doubt fans of the original will complain about the "westernised" remake but I feel that it works well.This is definitely one to watch, but not if you have a seriously weak heart.Since this film is shot in Japan it does capture something of the original and it is good to see the ordinary side of Japan rather than the normal image that you see portrayed in film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best 'haunted house' movie in recent history...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think 'The Grudge' proves a number of things - firstly many audiences these days will not be scared by anything (if the Grudge doesn't pull it off there is pretty much nothing else that can and you 'have' to reach back to films such as the original Psycho etc) - a mix of conditioning and a dumbing of the general imaginations of people due to a number of factors is the cause. So one really can't blame a movie that is firing from all cylinders if yours are not.I 'love' haunted house movies and this is the ultimate one - I asked someone whether they would like to visit this one and their response after the movie was that they would not only not like to visit it but they wouldn't even want to look in its direction. 'That' is a house that has left a mark. From start to end we are left with a barrage of atmosphere which is tangible with a mix of jumps which really are a staple these days in these types of movies. The director remade this movie from its original for the Western public and he integrated the 'jumpiness' of those movies with the classic Japanese horrors of Ringu (which it relies *very* heavily upon, in fact to such a degree and copying certain elements that one needs to remember if you think of this movie as 'better' than Ringu/The Ring, which came first and thus deserves some of the originality praise).I think the movie was brilliant and deserves a rating in the 8s here rather than the late 5s but as I said, it has more to do with the public than the film. The storyline was not weak in my opinion - but in a movie of this length, there is little to be said except the 'event' that led to the 'curse' which then led to multiple deaths. I don't recall many of the old horrors having stellar stories either - perhaps the only criticism is that none of the characters were fleshed out very much including Sarah Michelle Gellar's character. I would say my heart is still with Sadako/Samara and the Ring but Ill definitely have to watch the original Ju-on just for comparison sake. I've long given up on relying on others to determine a decent movie and this one (from a true horror fan) is brilliant stuff and will be one of my favourites for quite some time. I also benefited from an audience that was sucked up by the movie in the cinema... the guy next to me jumped out of the seat only a few minutes in, people were screaming and the end was met with a hushed almost nervous silence.The movie was a huge success 'despite' the unimaginative public and that shows just how impressive it is - I have heard people laughed at certain scenes that one would consider far from amusing.. examples of either humour to hide nervousness or conditioning to all types of horrendous acts. You decide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>plain &amp; simple.. a different type of scary movie than you are used to seeing.Goose bumps on my arms from watching it.Geller does a great job, although it is starting to look like she will be forever cast in "alternative reality movies".Some complain that they see no traditional styles of scary movie making in this remake of a Japanese movie.But therein lies the charm of this movie. A different approach.Very reminiscnet of the original B&amp;W movie, "Haunting of the Hill House".Not suitable for small children as it's bound to give them sleepless nights and nightmares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing.. If it wasn't so darn scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie and I had no idea what to expect. I hadnt seen any Japanese versions or hadnt even seen a trailer for this movie. So of course, I entered the cinema in anticipation of it being just your average horror movie, based on the fact that Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the starring role :P.I was pleasantly surprised. I am a lover of horror movies and its a rare case that I am scared during a horror movie but this film truly scared me to the point that at times I was praying in my head that the person currently in the house wouldn't go and enter the room with the cupboard in it and I even found myself looking away at times when you get the music build up. It was really that scary for me and the mean croaking noise is nothing short of haunting lol, the noise just makes it so much more spooky.The storyline can be confusing if you aren't paying attention but I found it pretty easy to follow, even after some confusion when Sarah Michelle Gellar is watching the other man's story of being in the house as if she was walking round the house aswel (if you haven't seen it yet then and you are going to then you will see what I mean).Overall it is quite a good movie and worth seeing, as it is so scary. I left the movie and said to my girlfriend that I never want to see that movie again ever, not even on DVD because that noise just spooked me out to much and what would you know it, 2 days later (tonight) I am going to see the movie again with a friend lol. I just watched the trailer of the movie and now I am very nervous hehe, even after seeing the actual movie :P10/10 for just how scary it was for me (you personally may not get scared by the same things as me though in all honesty) and 7/10 for the interesting story, even after the unsatisfying ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary movie..if it weren't for immature audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My biggest complaint about this film isn't about the movie itself, it's about the audience. I guess this is what occurs when a film is rated PG-13 and not R and the teenyboppers get let into an otherwise good film.I wasn't a big fan of "The Ring" and I don't get scared easily in a film. However, in this movie, there were plenty of moments when I was freaked out. The ghost/apparition kid was damn creepy. The music and sound effects were also well-used. The plot: There were major holes in the storyline and if you don't pay attention you may get confused. The ending was rushed and I was irritated that they didn't tie up a lot of the loose ends. Guess that's what we get when movies are steered towards teenagers and sequels.The acting was okay..not fantastic. Sarah Michelle Gellars character was underdone, which may have been done purposely, but nonetheless, it was played well. The movie had a rather artsy feel to it which was played up by the way it was filmed and edited. It may seem choppy or confusing to some, but it made sense in the long run. Here's my big complaint and why I can't review this film as well as I like. The audience in this movie had the IQ of a gnat. It started with the first scary moment in the movie where some jerks in the right side of the auditorium started laughing at an inappropriate moment. They kept doing it whenever something scary would occur, when one of the characters were Japanese and walked onto the scene, when a Japanese person would speak, when the music would get creepy - basically whenever an inappropriate time to laugh would be, they laughed. It totally killed the effect of the movie and made an otherwise good film, do poorly in my opinion. I found out that this occurs with all of the viewings of this film and apparently it happens with many PG-13 horror movies. I saw "The Ring" on DVD and didn't have to worry about an audience, and I should've taken the same route with this film. I think directors should be more concerned with making a good film with an R rating than taming it down just enough to become PG-13 so that trashy people and teeny-boppers can give them grosses. This film would've done well if it was an R rated film. In fact, I think it would probably do better if it were an R rated film.My recommendation: Wait until the crowds die out before watching this movie or watch it on DVD. It's a good film and don't let other people ruin it totally for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't bash this movie! *major spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I repeat, *major spoilers*. The Grudge is a remake of a Japanese horror movie (Ju-on, Ju-on 2: The Grudge). Its goal is to give people chills, which I think it achieves.Sarah Michelle Gellar is an American nurse moved to Tokyo, Japan with her boyfriend, Doug (Jason Behr), and is chosen to take care of a batty old woman named Emma after her other caretaker, Yoko, has mysteriously not shown up for work. The audience knows what has happened to dear Yoko, but the cast in the film haven't the brains to figure it out. I guess they actually have to find her body before they put two and two together!The Grudge is told in two separate stories; one is the story of the Williams family (consisting of Matthew, wife Jennifer, Matthew's Sister Susan, and Matthew's Mother Emma) moving into the house which we know to be haunted/cursed. The other is the story of Sarah Michelle Gellar taking care of Emma, the last member of the Williams family, after the rest of the family has disappeared. Again, we know what has happened, but apparently the police need bodies to figure out that they're dead.The first clue that there is something suspicious in that house is, of course, when Yoko goes up into the attic and is murdered by a freakish-looking female ghost in the shadows. I might add I jumped out of my skin the first time I saw that ghost. Heh?heh, heh?After Yoko dies, Karen (Gellar), steps in. She feels something weird in the house, and hears strange noises. She goes to investigate, and finds a young boy, Toshio (creepy Yuya Ozeki), and his black cat taped inside of a closet. If you think that's weird, keep reading!After Karen calls for help, she finds Emma curled up on her futon talking to something that isn't there. That has scary written all over it, right?The ghost makes her second appearance, this time in front of Emma and Karen. What does she want? Is she after someone in particular?Afterwards, Karen goes investigating about Toshio and his family via the web. Ah, where would we be without technology? It turns out Toshio has been cutting his Mom's face out of every picture. What strange behavior! And what's this? He likes to meow like a cat and murder people, too? Well, that's just the icing on the cake!Yes, it seems our little Toshio lured Jennifer Williams into a bedroom one evening, scaring her half-to-death. When Matthew came home to check up on her, scared both of them fully-to-death. Interesting hobbies this young boy has. I wonder if all Japanese boys act like that.Matthew's sister Susan had left a message on his answering machine, and when we flash over to her at her workplace, she starts to get worried as he hasn't called back yet. Susan then proceeds down to the stairwell where Matthew phones her. Hey; isn't Matthew dead?This is where very creepy noises from the ghostly girl come in over the phone.Susan hangs up. She continues to hear the noises, only this time, they're louder. They're close by. Ack. The lights flicker. ACK. The ghostly figure starts up the stairs towards her. ACK!Susan runs back to her hotel, and she takes the elevator up to her room. On the elevator next to her is Toshio, of course, but she doesn't notice because her eyes are conveniently closed from being so relieved she got back safely. Right. Sure you did, Susan.Susan gets another phone call. This time it really is Matthew. What?! Matthew's dead, dammit! This isn't real! Only we know that, though. She doesn't.Until she buzzes him in and the door rings not but two seconds later. When she answers it, no one's there. The noises on the phone start up again, and she smashes the phone. Sorry, Susan, but?bye-bye!Anyhow, now that the police can't get any answer from Susan, and now that the police have figured out that Jennifer and Matthew are dead along with a strange piece of a body on the ground in the attic with them, what are they to do? Search her apartment and find nothing there.When Nakagawa-san figures out that whoever goes into that house becomes a target of the ghost, he returns to the house to try and burn it down. However, not being too bright, he investigates the crying he hears once in the building. Stupid Nakagawa-san!Return of the cat boy, Toshio! Nakagawa-san was afraid Toshio was a poor boy drowning. Oh, boy?bye-bye, Nakagawa-san. Toshio so elegantly drowns him instead.Karen goes to Peter's (Pullman) house to talk to his wife about his suicide. She looks at old photographs and discovers that in every single picture, the then-alive ghostly figure appears in them. She has to find out who she is and what she wants.When Karen returns home, she finds out that her boyfriend has gone to the house. No! If he goes there, he'll be a target, too! So, of course, she goes after him.The next scenes are frightening as they are told as flashbacks relayed through the present. Karen sees Peter talking to Toshio about his Mom, and then sees him looking through pictures of his Mom. His Mom is the ghostly figure. And her husband murdered her.When Peter opens the closet with all of the pictures on it, the corpse of Kayako Saeki.When Karen finds Doug, Kayako is still haunting them, and crawls very creepily down the stairs towards them. Unfortunately, Doug seems to be paralyzed, and Karen isn't heartless enough to leave him behind, so they're both stuck there awaiting Kayako's ghost to do something terrifying to them.Karen eventually sets out to do what Nakagawa-san couldn't, and sets the whole place on fire. She's lucky that she winds up alive. Doug dies.When Karen goes to say good-bye to Doug's corpse, guess who?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big Sarah Michelle Gellar fan, so whether this movie was good or not, I still loved it, because of her.If you like the movie "The Ring", then yes, you will LOVE this movie. And depending on how easily you are scared, also makes things a little different. Myself, I don't get scared that easily, and I only jumped once during this movie. But that's good, because I've gone to see movies like, "Dawn of the Dead", and fell asleep. This movie, even though at times, may not be scary, does keep you awake and wanting to know more. For those of you with a weak stomach, you will scream, and possible wet your pants. Definitely a must see in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grudge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is strange that the director of the Japanese original, Takashi Shimizu, would remake his own film into English (well, American), this obviously came two years after The Ring remake, but this has Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead, Spider-Man) producing. Basically Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the American nurse who has moved to Tokyo, Japan, and is caring for the elderly and immobile Emma Williams (Grace Zabriskie) in her home. Of course this home has had some strange things going on over the years, and when Karen is caught up in this deadly curse, i.e. The Grudge, through flashbacks we see the other victims who suffered the consequences. Obviously we see Emma's family, her son Matthew (Lost's William Mapother) and his wife Jennifer (Zodiac's Clea DuVall), and then we see Peter Kirk (Bill Pullman) and his wife Maria (Rosa Blasi), all are eventually pulled into the horror where they are haunted or killed by the mysterious long haired girl or see the little Japanese boy. Karen is somehow taken back in time to see Peter's encounters with The Grudge, and in photos we see that the Japanese girl with the long hair has been stalking for some time, and obviously the film ends in the dark way. Also starring Jason Behr as Doug, KaDee Strickland as Susan Williams and Ted Raimi (Sam's brother) as Alex. The story is rather complicated, and not even the smallest scary moments that do grab your attention, such as a shadow becoming a live figure in a corridor, and hands appearing in Gellar's hair, can save this film from having a dreary story, and not all making much sense, a pretty terrible horror thriller. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grudge is a very disappointing movie. I'm not going to beat around the bush, I didn't care for a single thing this film had to offer. Well except for.... well I'm not going to spoil anything for you. The picture is so close in feel and look of "The Ring" that it's almost laughable, and in the end it isn't anything close to as original and terrifying as "The Ring" was. This is just kind of a hunk of fall crap, that scores it's screams and scares from merely cheap shots. But the cheap shots aren't what really frustrates me about "The Grudge", it's the fact that they never explain what is going on and more importantly why. The filmmaker spends so much time flashing weird circus crap in front of you, that he forgets to add in an actual reason why all the supernatural events are happening. There are enough unfinished and unexplained events that take place in The Grudge to fill up a 500 page novel. The acting is nothing to shout from the hilltops with glee about either. Sarah Michelle Gellar phones in her performance like she's ordering a pizza, and the actor who plays the detective investigating the horror of the Grudge is in desperate need of a career change. Maybe he should try working at McDonalds instead of acting. The only decent acting we come in counter with during the entire span of the film is from Bill Pullman, who's in the film for only the first two minutes. In conclusion, The Grudge runs for 96 minutes, but if you ask me it seems like 96 days. I've never been so anxious in my life to get out of the theater and finish up my homework at home then I was when I went to see The Grudge. Don't waste your time or money on The Grudge. Time is better spent picking fluff out of your navel, then going to see Takashi Shimizu's latest travesty. Grade: D (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 10/23/04)my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces).</fullReview>

Great direction by Takashi Shimizu. The film is really good and the movie really keeps you going until the end. This is a scary and thrilling film. If you like Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jason Behr, William Mapother, Clea DuVall, KaDee Strickland, Grace Zabriskie, Bill Pullman, Rosa Blasi, Ted Raimi, the rest of the cast in the film, Horror, Mystery, Thrillers, Comedy, and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During The Grudge, you hoped that maybe the movie would mix Lost in Translation with The Ring and a couple of fresh scares. Instead, the movie sucked on all fours. The fresh scares you would expect from a modern horror movie were replaced with the same generic garbage we've been force-fed since our youth. Which is sad really, because the idea of The Grudge originally had the potential to be a very good movie. Seriously, please give this movie fifteen minutes and you can see how they blew it. When Bill Pullman opens the movie, you wish later on that you joined him.Strange things are amuck in a house in Japan that forgives neither American nor Japanese.Was there some point where you had no clue what was going on? Minutes are spent looking at scenery and rooms. There's a dim hue that becomes annoying. And sadly, there are the obligatory references to a more famous film based on yet another Japanese film, The Ring with: ghastly women, photos that intrigue and, eyes, oh no, eyes! I would encourage anyone to watch this movie if they want a headache. It's safe to say for now that it cannot get any worse than this second rate rip-off of any true horror movie you might have wanted to see.</fullReview>

It was a waste of time to see. It made no sense.The "scary" noise that the ghost or evil thing kept making was the same noise that we all made as a kid.

If they'd spent all this time, money and effort into creating something a little bit new, a little bit different (and not such an obvious "The Ring" ripoff), and worked on a story that had content, without relying on confusing the audience of it's horrible script by poorly imitating "Pulp Fiction" by skipping back and forth between pages, we'd have had something pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ya better believe I have a GRUDGE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You bet I have a 'Grudge'!I remember when horror movies ? specifically ghost/haunted house stories ? were actually SCARY. For me it begins and ends with 'Poltergeist' ? one that got under your skin and scared the heebie ? jeebies and actually had one scream at the screen while watching with a popcorn audience in full tilt horror. Sadly since then I can't recall a genre film that has matched its excellence. And this is certainly no contender. Based on a highly popular Japanese horror film of the same name (and directed by its director here for Hollywood) ? which I admit didn't see but having seen another (also inferior one) called 'The Eye' and the Americanization of 'The Ring' (another disappointment for yours truly) ? the story such as it is focuses on a seemingly ordinary split-level house in Tokyo that is ?.cursed. Yup that's about it. Seems that a nasty familial homicide/suicide took place a few years back and the realtor has been having a helluva time unloading the property until a gullible young American couple sets up with the hubby's mother in tow ? that unleashes the anger/rage ? OK ?'grudge' and well you know, bodies begin to disappear.Enter nubile nursing student abroad from the States, Karen Davis (Gellar, not one of my fave actresses ? sorry never saw one full episode of 'Buffy' so sue me; everything else I've seen her in she has yet to impress me) who is assigned by her school to the house with the mother ? who is now practically comatose ? when another student apparently never showed up for her duties. When Karen arrives she is confronted with the older woman's shocking appearance (for the record Zibriskie, a fine character actress better known as Laura Palmer's distraught mom on 'Twin Peaks', is suitably spooky) and eventually comes face-to-face with the angry spectral spirit of the woman who was murdered who appears to be a mix of Kabuki Gone Wild and tendril-like hair that must have some truly severe split-ends.What follows is some jaw-droppingly awful acting (the aforementioned Gellar), ridiculous repeats of Don't Go In that Empty Dark Room (again, and again, and again?.), Don't Stick Your Hand/Head/Choice of Anatomy in that Dark Space, Don't Walk Slowly Down That Dark Corridor and Don't Ignore Your Boyfriend (the blank Behr). The film even throws in the kitchen sink of horror films : the cheap 'scare' of a thrown cat!!! No I am NOT making this up! This is one of the film's highlights! Didn't anyone learn from the 'Scream' movies that audiences are not putting up with lame bits for cheap thrills!The sold-out screening I saw this with an full audience of unbelieving at each set-up of how LAME things were! There were unsolicited giggles of disbelief and incredulous anger of just how STUPID the characters were behaving including the Japanese detective (Ishibashi) who knows the entire history of the haunted house because? drum roll please? he was part of a team of buddies who INVESTIGATED this when it happened and his three police buddies wound up MISSING!!! I truly hate films that think they can be coy and clever and assume 'Oh no one will mind if we use the same set-ups and gags over and over' or 'We haven't told a scary story like this for years' because no one would suspect some Hollywood studio to naively think a new renaissance is occurring even if it is an import from a foreign land!Oh I hated this film so much it made my teeth grind and ask simple questions like BILL PULLMAN, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY WHY DID YOU SIGN UP FOR THIS CRAP??? Among other rants of dismay at a truly wretched, scare-free genre film. The only thing that the audience reacted favorably to is Strickland's encounter with the vengeance seeking apparition with shrieks of glee. Maybe it was because she got to leave the film before we all did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, just in case you were wondering, the summary up there was a joke. This IS a summary for the grudge but it was almost exactly like the Ring that it was surprising. First off, they were both directed by the same man, Takashi Shimizu. That might explain their uncanny resemblance but who knows?Anyway.... This movie was not to good. It was totally unoriginal and had a horribly boring plot. You could almost always tell what was going to happen which made it even less scary. There were parts of it that were totally overdone and didn't make sense that I wont talk about, but I know that if you've seen it you know what I am talking about. I gave it a one out of ten which I guess was kinda harsh, but it was just sooooo bad. At least there was a shower scene with sarah michelle gellar. But aside from that, nothing. I advise you not to waste ten bucks to go see this awful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Difficult to call The Grudge a horror movie. At best it made me slightly jump from surprise at a couple of moments.If one forgets the (failed) frightening dimension and looks at other sides of the movie, he is again disappointed. The acting is OK but not great. The story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning, while one is trying to get what's happening. But toward the end one understands there is not much to understand. "Scary" elements seems sometimes to have been added to the script without reason...So... (yawn) See this movie it if you have nothing more interesting to do, like cutting the carrots or looking at the clouds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Grudge paying for this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ugh! What nonsense. American remakes of Japanese horrors are all the rage at the moment. Between this, The Ring and a forthcoming remake of the rather weak Dark Water it seems as if Hollywood has tapped into a new well of unimagination.Which is weird, considering how pointless this remake is. Its only purpose is to serve those who cannot be bothered reading subtitles as the same director and some of the original cast remain as well as the fact that it's set in Japan. If they were bothering to remake it then why change 2 things? The presence of English dialogue and mostly new actors seems a vague reason to redo this film.As PG-13 rated horrors go, this one is still scraping the bottom of the barrel. Seriously, The Grudge is the dredge of horror. I've not seen the original, despite being 'asked kindly' to do so. But I could still see every scare coming. You just know because of the camera angles suddenly changing to an off-centre shot to accommodate something new. Either that or a scene of silence is built up so much that a sudden jolt is the only logical end.Unlike The Ring, there is no mystery to this film. It's all very straight-forward and, in the end, just boils down to typical slasher fare. Or scare-em-to-death fare as no one is physically killed in this film. Other than the Yoko character. Her fate made no sense and did not fit in with the internal 'logic' of the script. And can someone explain Bill Pullman's actions at the beginning for me?A very poor film indeed. Very repetitive, very slow and utterly pointless. As a horror film, The Grudge has as much integrity as Darkness Falls.This film is basically a cure...for NOT being asleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, horror movies can be roughly divided into two categories. The visual and the story driven ones. This movie is almost driven entirely by the visual side, and as as such has received a lot of bad reviews by people who does not find those sort of movies scary/good.For my part, I think visual horrors are by FAR the most scary. Intelligent dialogue and an interesting plot, I admit, would make a technically better movie. However, for pure "scare-effect" this movie is superior to anything I have ever seen before.Describing the visual details will not rightfully describe the horror which they can produce, only a viewing can accomplish that. I only want to stress that this is, in my opinion, the most haunting visual horror ever made.9 of 10 - For being perfect in its particular genre</fullReview>

The movie had potential, but it was predictable. I wish I could say otherwise because I heard that the original or whatnot was fantastic. Thanks to the American remake I may never see the original as I have no interest whatsoever now. Just a side note, a little trivia for anyone who wants to know. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jason Behr, and Clea DuVall all were in something else together. Can anyone guess it? How about Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Series. Jason Behr is in the episode titled "Lie to Me" and Clea DuVall is in the episode "Out of Mind, Out of Sight".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is complete garbage. This could very well be the worst movie I have ever seen (I have even seen Bogeyman). This movie lacks suspense, creativity, and scary scenes. It is a horror movie that is not scary at all. A ghost boy opens his mouth and meows like a pet cat, creepy. A ghost girl makes sounds like she is clearing her throat, spine tingling. An old lady, who is also supposed to be creepy, says nothing the whole time she is in the film. She supposed to be frightening and mysterious with red circles around her eyes, but she simply comes across as stupid and annoying. I want my hour and a half back of my life I wasted watching this film. Why did Bill Pullman kill himself in the beginning??? Why did the police detective try to help the ghost boy when he knew ghosts were in the house. Why did this movie ever get made??? How did some of the viewers enjoy this???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Some Of The Freakiest Stuff I Have Ever Seen In My Life!, With An Amazing Performance From Sarah Michelle Gellar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite simply some of the freakiest stuff i have ever seen in my life, with an amazing performance from Sarah Michelle Gellar!. All the characters are fantastic, and i thought those weird noises were very frightening, plus Sarah Michelle Gellar is simply amazing in this!. This is my 2nd viewing after 1st having seeing it in theaters, it frightened me to death, and i started to panic, upon 2nd viewing it wasn't quite as scary, however it still scared the crap out of me, and i found the score pretty creepy as well, plus i thought Gellar and Jason Behr had very good chemistry together. The plot is hard to follow at times, as your wondering what the hell is going on, however it explains itself pretty good at the end in my opinion, plus the people who are calling this funny, are absolutely messed up in the head. It relies on a lot of jump scares, and boy do they ever work, and i thought the makeup effects were great, plus the ending was awesome!, and paves way for a sequel, and one of my favorite scenes is when KaDee Strickland's character Susan looks under the sheet, and has a surprise waiting for her. This is simply some of the freakiest stuff i have ever seen in my life, with an amazing performance from Michelle Gellar, and i say go see it immediately!. The Direction is wonderful!. Takashi Shimizu does a wonderful job here, with amazing camera work, fantastic angles, constantly adding scary images, and very scary atmosphere, and doing a great job on making us the viewers scared (in my opinion)!. There isn't much gore. except a severed jaw, grotesque faces, blood here and there, a graphic fall victim, and other minor stuff. The Acting is fantastic!. Sarah Michelle Gellar is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, she is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS!, fantastic in the acting department, was vulnerable, had very good chemistry with Jason Behr, wa s very caring, and proved she can carry a lead role like a champ!, i loved her! as usual (Gellar Rules!!!). Jason Behr is very likable, and id what he had to do very well, he had very good chemistry with Gellar, and just did a great job. William Mapother is okay here as Matthew and did his job adequately. Clea DuVall is so so here, i am not a big fan of hers, so i wasn't really a fan of her in this one either, she did OK i guess. KaDee Strickland is hot and shows up to collect a paycheck and that's pretty much it. Bill Pullman is fantastic here, he looked awesome, and was just too cool, wished he had more screen time though!.Ted Raimi has a small role here and he did good. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall Go see it immediately,it's some of the freakiest stuff i have ever seen! Ju On is next! i can't wait. ***** out of 5</fullReview>

I loved the Grudge, I thought it was terrifying (although I couldn't keep from thinking of Sarah Michelle Geller as Buffy...). In this movie, I actually screamed, and I have never screamed in a movie theater in my life. I actually had claw marks from my best friend grabbing my arm in the middle of the movie.

		<fullReview>To be honest, The Grudge, in my opinion is a fantastic film. The way it is written and the settings and the actors, everything about it is good. The girl that plays the actual 'grudge ghost' is brilliant. She looks amazing and does the whole thing really well. From what I can gather, the director is a brilliant director. It's not really gory and I suppose some people might find it quite scary but I didn't. I'm completely stunned by the film and I've become obsessed with learning Japanese language and doing other Japanese stuff. I think maybe Sarah Michelle Geller kind of spoils it a bit but only slightly. I guess its because every time you see Sarah Michelle Geller you stereotype her as Buffy and therefore cant imagine seeing her in anything else. All in all its a great movie. No hang ups about it. ITS A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror films are a tough genre. I'd say maybe 1 in 100 are great and 10 in 100 are very good. "The Grudge" is one of those very good horror films. To me, it's all about creating an atmosphere of horror, making the audience feel a deepening sense of dread all the way through to the finale. "The Grudge" does this well.Japanese horror films are a great new phenomenon. I think they have really injected some fresh blood (ahem!) into the genre. And, it's cool stuff! Even when some of the plotting gets kind of crazy (reminds me of anime story lines), there's still a lot to like! I enjoyed the slow, deliberate pacing, along with the jarring moments that came at just the right times. Many talented filmmakers contributed to this film, and it shows! I haven't seen the original, but I'm putting it on my DVD rental list.7 of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ring outdoes this film many, many times over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got through watching The Grudge, and I have to admit it's at the top of my list of worst "movies" ever - up there with "Jeepers Creepers" and "Final Destination." And yes, notice how I refer to it as a "movie" - it's not worthy of being called a "film." I got the feeling this movie was trying to be something like The Ring, but it failed miserably. The Ring was the first (in terms of popular American movies/remakes) of its genre, and it achieved a level of suspense, mixed with equal amounts of originality, and intrigue. On the other hand, The Grudge is nothing more than a few highly predictable startling scenes and a bunch of rip offs from The Ring. Feel free to go about your normal routine with this movie playing in the background - nothing you'd miss could be critical to the plot, since there really isn't a plot at all.If you're considering renting or buying this, save your money. Instead blindfold yourself in your backyard, and have your friends jump out at you as you stumble around. The end result is the same - a few mild scares, with nothing to think about afterwards, and nothing worth seeing during.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly good remake for a change!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been less than impressed with the recent crop of Japanese horror films. Perhaps it's just because I don't like ghost stories much, but I think that for a bunch of films that are so highly acclaimed; they fall massively short of the mark, especially since they're so similar to one another. Another thing I've been less than impressed with is the way that America have been snapping up everything from Asia that they can get their hands on and remaking it. The Ring was remade with disastrous results, but nevertheless we find ourselves here with the latest remake; The Grudge. I haven't seen the original version of this film (and am in no rush to), but to my surprise this film is actually quite good. The Grudge stars Sarah Michele Geller (from that Buffy rubbish) and it follows her as she goes to work for a woman in Japan who needs caring for. The Grudge professes that whenever someone is killed in a fit of rage, a curse is broken and the spirit lay dormant for someone to enter that curse. Something that Buffy has just done...The Eastern setting helps to add mystery to the already mysterious plot. It is customary for American remakes to be moved to America, but the fact that this one didn't get relocated is much to it's credit. The film's effects are really good, and some parts where the ghosts are shown are genuinely quite creepy, due to the effects. However, the film goes a bit overboard with it's scares at times, and it goes for the money shot too often. For example; tension is mounting and then suddenly! ...the phone rings. It's such a waste, and although it does help to build the unease; the film would have been much better served if it kept the tension building, rather than diffusing it every five seconds with another nonchalant happening. The music in the film is very good, however, and it always serves in adding to the bewilderment that the film is keen to capitalise on. The Grudge relies a lot on it's sense of dread, and the music helps to capture that.The film isn't a complete whole, mostly for the reasons mentioned. However; as remakes of Japanese films go, this is a very good example and I recommend this one over most other films in it's class.</fullReview>

Though I didn't think the original was amazing either, I would say it was far better than this 'remake' None of the actors added anything to this film,...ie, everyone of them could have been replaced by unknown high school actors and it wouldn't be any worse for it. In fact, maybe it would have been better. Yes, it is a horror movie, but still, it seems like they are just going through the motions. That goes double for SMG, who's best work is behind her, I've sorry to say.If you are really interested in this movie, then spend your money on the original instead.

There is simply not enough background given to explain the rather mundane,run of the mill demons and their unexplained attacks in remote areas unrelated to the place they haunt. Far more continuity would be required in order to explain the deaths and the relationship they have to the haunting. The film is only watchable if one considers it to be a farce and to be made fun of. The various supposedly horror scenes raise not a hair on the nape of my neck.

		<fullReview>If you've read about the premise of this movie and it sounds interesting to you, skip it and watch the original (Ju-On). The Grudge is such a carbon copy of Ju-On that I'm starting to suspect that the only reason it was made was so that Sam Raimi could enjoy a Nihon vacation and give his brother Ted a job. Just kidding, Ted Raimi is a fine character actor. Seriously, though, there really was no reason to make this movie except to cash in on the Ringu trend. It reminded me of the Steven Wright joke where he talks about somebody breaking into his house and stealing all his stuff, then replacing it with exact duplicates. Only in this case, the duplicates all happen to be American citizens living in Japan. And what's up with that, anyway? Is the point of view of this movie that if Americans decide to go live in Japan, they will have to contend with vengeful rage-ghosts? Does the tourism council even mention it? And fair warning, don't eat any rich cream soups or drink a large glass of strawberry Nestle's Quik before seeing it, as the slow motion belch sound effect that is so pervasive in the movie (both movies actually) is likely to have an ipecac like effect on you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-trick pony. The same scare over and over, ad infinitum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should admit that horror movies aren't my usual fare, and I don't see many in theater. A friend told me this was the scariest movie she had ever seen, and sheer curiosity led me to venture out and see it. I think my expectations were too high as to how scary it would be. The first real scare was slightly spoiled by previews and also by the fact that you could see the scare source faintly before it came fully into the light (which was probably intentional and would help the scare rather than hinder if you weren't searching so specifically for it as I was). Other than that, though, it was a truly creepy scene and a good scare. However, the rest of the movie is really nothing more than the same "scary lady pops out unexpectedly" over and over, which kind of defeats the scariness, in my opinion. Personally, I'm hoping something was lost in translation, and that the original wasn't also a one-trick pony like this one turned out to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a cultural twist on the too familiar haunted house story...but with an abundance of attitude. You will jump; you will think your heart has stopped; and your goosebumps will have goosebumps. Based on the Japanese powerhouse JU-ON:THE GRUDGE(1963), in a modest house in Tokyo resides hidden terror. It is possessed by a plague on the lives of those who enters it. "The Grudge" causes victims to die in a powerful rage and like a virus becomes a chain of horror as it moves from one victim to the next.An American exchange student(Sarah Michelle Gellar)studying social work in Japan agrees to care for an elderly woman(Grace Zabriskie)victimized by more than her catatonic being. The house should otherwise be deserted when the young woman begins to hear the sound of scratching and upon investigating she is starkly introduced to supernatural horror. The story might lose something in translation; but what makes this movie so creepy and heart pounding is the superior collaboration of lighting, sound and camera editing. The atmosphere is confusing and profound. The only way to prepare for this suspenseful horror roller coaster is Prozac and a change of underwear.Also in the cast are: Jason Behr, William Mapother, Clea DuVall and Bill Pullman. Kudos to director Takashi Shimizu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>English-speaking version of Japanese movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Grudge" probably doesn't translate very well as a title, because the English-speaking world doesn't use the word in the same context. This is a remake of a Japanese movie, by the same Japanese director. Which was a good idea, because otherwise most of us would never have seen it with subtitles. It is based on Japanese myths which are explained in the DVD extras, which is almost essential for fully understanding the story. It is appropriately scary, and begs for watching a comedy next, before going to bed. I didn't particularly like Gellar in the lead role, but I suppose she was OK.SPOILERS. Set in Tokyo, early in the story we see Peter (Bill Pullman) acting strange on his upper floor patio, then without saying anything he just sort of bends over and slides over the edge, down to his death in the street below. We don't find out why until near the end, when it turns out he was the lover of a Japanese woman who, along with her small son and pet cat, were killed by the enraged husband, who then killed himself. Inspired by an old Japanese story of a king who took a similar revenge after a subject of his beat him in chess. According to myth, the building then takes revenge, it holds the "grudge", not a person. So the house of the Japanese family is haunted by the dead son and cat, and everyone who enters the house will die. Gradually all the new residents are done in, and as the movie ends Karen (Gellar), studying in Tokyo and doing volunteer work, will likely be next. The point being the building doesn't discriminate between good and bad people, they all die. And in the beginning, Peter was possessed to kill himself because he was responsible for the husband's rage that resulted in his family's deaths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it ain't scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie is stupid it is not scary at all and the storyline is not exactly great. i have to say it is more of a humorous film. like the part where the man dropped of the balcony on to the street.i couldn't stop laughing i was choking on my kit kat i was eating for god sake. its a very poor effort to make someone scared. he people who were scared obviously looked at this the wrong way. i thought the security guard was the best actor. i liked his facial expressions he made it all seem real. if they make a grudge 2 i don't think it would get high applause i don't even think they would be able to make another one of them daft trailers they made. the company would get bankrupt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alright this is a review for the movie "The Ring" oh wait no, sorry "The Grudge", oh wait no sorry my mistake it was "The Ring" wait wait wait alright I don't know, but they wer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, just in case you were wondering, the summary up there was a joke. This IS a summary for the grudge but it was almost exactly like the Ring that it was surprising. First off, they were both directed by the same man, Takashi Shimizu. That might explain their uncanny resemblance but who knows?Anyway.... This movie was not to good. It was totally unoriginal and had a horribly boring plot. You could almost always tell what was going to happen which made it even less scary. There were parts of it that were totally overdone and didn't make sense that I wont talk about, but I know that if you've seen it you know what I am talking about. I gave it a one out of ten which I guess was kind of harsh, but it was just so bad. At least there was a shower scene with Sarah Michelle Gellar. But aside from that, nothing. I advise you not to waste ten bucks to go see this awful movie.</fullReview>
