		<shortDescription>Friedkin's Swan Song before Sinking into Mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of Henri-George Cluzot's 1953 film The Wages of Fear (also on DVD in a lovely Criterion Disc), this William Friedkin film stars Roy Scheider (at his weary, doomed finest) as one of four men exiled to an unnamed South American country by their mistakes and crimes. Trapped in squalor (and it's damn convincing looking squalor, too, far beyond the sunbaked black-and-white compositions of Wages of Fear; this film looks like it's leaving mud on your shoes), unable to return to the lives they abandoned, they're driven by circumstance to accept a normally unthinkable job. They have to drive old, unstable dynamite from its storage site hundreds of miles over mountain terrain and washed-out roads to the location of an oil well fire so the blaze can be snuffed out. The pay is exorbitant -- but it's commiserate to the danger. The risks are colossal ... and they ultimately have no choice. Sorcerer is tense, suspenseful film-making at its finest; you become physically uncomfortably during this film thanks to the incredible sense that at any minute our heroes would literally be blown to hell. (I mean, we all walk around with the philosophical knowledge we could die at any moment, but talk about your concrete metaphors ... ) Friedkin creates a palpable sense of place, and Scheider is immensely powerful as a man whose every move suggests that he knows he's doomed. Taut with suspense, completely convincing and breathtakingly human, Sorcerer is an unfairly maligned film that delivers in every way. And the Score is unique and nightmarish. A new DVD would be welcome to many happy fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorcerer is a unique, brutal, brilliant film burdened underneath a terrible, wholly unappropriate title. Watching this film, it is not only easy to see why the film was both a huge financial and commercial disaster, it is downright obvious. This is the most un-american/ hollywood/ commercial film backed by a major studio I have ever seen. It is a tough, gruelling 126 minutes that goes nowhere fast, yet holds you firm in its tight grip and beats you senseless throughout. I was exhausted when the film finally arrived at it's rather downbeat ending. The multi-national cast is faultless. Scheider is magnificent. This is an exceptionally demanding, difficult role and he hits it head on, creating an anti-hero who is very, very real: desperate, frightened and desructable. Taking this role, at the height of his fame, was either very brave or very stupid. I'm going with brave. His performance here is a million miles away from his work on Jaws and Jaws 2, yet equally compelling. The photography is in a league of it's own (I only wish the DVD came with an original 2:35:1 print, assuming there is one, as the current disc is presented in a 4:3 full frame), and the music from Tangerine Dream complements the vision perfectly. This is a brilliant piece of film making from the most daring decade of cinema, made by one of cinema's true unpredictable's. Tense, dazzling, dark and fresh, this is an underated film that deserves to be re-evaluated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Essence of Film Storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After _The French Connection_ and _The Exorcist_, William Friedkin made it three masterpieces in a row with this remake of the French classic _Wages of Fear_. As an exercise in pure cinematic storytelling, _Sorcerer_ may be the best film of the three Friedkin greats.Structurally similar to the other two of his films, and working from a tough, bare-bones Walon Green script, Friedkin gives us all the back story we need in the first reel. Once the characters are brought together in the South American jungle, the film grabs you and doesn't let go until the final frame. The viewing experience is supremely visceral. You literally feel the tension as the four major characters and their two trucks loaded with nitro encounter and attempt to overcome the elements and some very rough terrain. Each scene is its own brilliant set piece. The film would work well as a silent movie, but the sound design and Tangerine Dream's musical score in themselves are among the film's towering achievements right along with the direction, cinematography and production design.I'm perhaps the only one not put off by the film's allegedly inappropriate title. On the contrary, I think the title adds an element of mystery to the story -- as if trouble is being concocted by an unseen force acting upon the film's morally dubious main characters. It gives a demonic personality to the confluence of fate and dumb luck. The title also serves to give the film some added distance from the very fine Clouzot original.The performances are all first-rate, if economic, and Roy Scheider stands out with some real tough-guy charisma. He also gets to wear the coolest hat this side of Gene Hackman's porkpie derby in _The French Connection_.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original Is Good, This Is Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's one exception to the general rule or opinion that re-makes are not as good as the originals. This is even better than the 1953 "The Wages Of Fear.""Sorcerer" (a better title might have helped in the status of this film) is divided into three segments. The first part deals with the various criminal acts committed by the four principal characters in their particular part of the world.The second part shows the seedy life these criminals must now endure in a poor South American town after they are forced to flee their respective countries.The third segment is the major part of the story. An oil well fire rages out of control and these men are selected to do something that can solve the problem, in exchange for enough money to get them out of that hellhole. The job: transport cans of extremely-volatile nitroglycerin in a truck in a harrowing 218-mile trek through jungle terrain to the site of the disaster.This long segment is one of the most suspenseful and well-photographed scenes I've ever seen on film. This is good stuff, particularly for the first-time viewer. There are some amazing scenes that just about wear you out.Added to the no-nonsense story directed by one of the best, William Friedkin, is some unique electronic music by "Tangerine Dream." If you are thinking of the kids watching, there is no sex and very little profanity but some of the violence is very bloody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just getting this one filmed was a huge accomplishment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Friedkin claims this was the toughest film to make of his career, and it isn't hard to see why. The balance of this film takes place in some woe begotten Latin American country. You can just feel the poverty and desperation in the air as the only work is for an oil drilling firm who doesn't exactly seem bent on worker safety. The elements are intentionally brutal and they only add to the tension. And thats even before this story really gets going.Early on, we are introduced to four characters who are all guilty of doing something terrible in one corner of the world or another. Roughly a half hour into the film, all four find themselves in a tiny impoverished Latin American village trying to eek out a living and forget the troubles they left behind. Not only is the local economy weak, but the place is socially on the verge of revolution. It's amazing the kind of jobs men will volunteer for to get out of these circumstances. Anyway, these four men are given the chance of transporting some highly explosive dynamite through rugged terrain in crappy old trucks so it can be used to put out a massive oil fire some 200 miles away. It is noted by one of the men that more than enough explosives are being transported. Obviously, at least one of the trucks is not expected to make it! Not only do you have an explosive cargo with unreliable trucks, but also there are armed rebels along the way who probably won't just let you pass right on through. Still, the reward for completing this job is just too much to pass on.The film is very, very good. In fact the skill that it took to make the film is responsible for most of the stars I'm giving it. The story itself is often just not believable. The journey these four men take is ludicrously perilous. They drive their vehicles over rickety bridges that nobody in real life would have tried to get over in those trucks. Like in other Friedken films, no character is completely likable, but that only makes it tougher to figure out who will live and who will die. There are a few nice twists here and there, right up to the very end to keep you guessing. The acting is exceptional. Scheider was Friedkin's fourth or fifth choice for the main character. Steve McQueen originally wanted it badly, but he demanded a part included for then wife Ali McGraw. Friedkin balked at this and then later regretted the decision. He later stated that he never thought Scheider was a good enough leading man. This is an error, however. Scheider is a terrific actor and his performance here is outstanding.The film bombed badly at the box office. Heck, if you weren't in line to see Star Wars that year, you were in line to see Smokey and the Bandit! This is definitely one of Friedkin's best, and it has somehow almost been completely forgotten. The film apparently got a PG rating but it is filled with violence and all manner of evil goings on. You'll have to suspend your disbelief for some of the scenes, but you'll be glad you did. I'll give it 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.Added Feb 14, 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of Friedkin,i wanted to see "sorcerer" for a long time;after several months of researches,at last,i could on an old videotape and ,immediately,it emerged as one of the best movies i've ever seen.I must be one of the rare who don't consider it's title so inapropriate,even it's been chosen for obvious commercial reasons (the exorcist/the sorcerer).The sorcerer,it's this fate which gathers 4 men of 4 different countries together;they have nothing in common but will be obliged to collaborate for the same reason;it's too an evil nature which,a little bit like in "deliverance",seems to make everything it cans to make the mission fail.There's a subtext ,"man vs nature",which, from Friedkin's words,was wanted from the beginning,and that,to my mind, considerably enhances the film. The systematic comparisons between the 52's version and this one don't appear to me valuables;i prefer seeing it more as a second adaptation of Arnaud's novel than as a remake.In fact,it's much more close to "the treasure of the sierra madre": the painful irony of the ending and Scheider with his hat looks exactly like Bogart.According to me,even it's a good flick,the original version is very-too much?-faithful to the novel and so,quite easy to foresee (for instance,before the mission, one of the truck is sabotaged so we're sure it's gonna explode at a moment or another). One said,including Friedkin,it bombed the box-office because was no star like Steve mc Queen to attract the audience,but nothing is less sure;first of all,it's unfair for Roy Scheider who previously starred in "the french connection" and "jaws" and was quite famous and,then,it's above all a question of concept:the audience of 77 didn't want to see that kind of movie anymore,-pessimistic,ironic,with an all-male cast and unhappy ending,-and was rather ready to enjoy Lucas and Spielberg's movies. I could speak highly of its qualities for hours: cast and crew,the work on the sound,the Tangerine dream's score,the sequence of the bridge,the surreal atmosphere of the last scenes,but it's already been described in other comments;let's say it's a very special,precious and unforgettable film to me.Hoping now there will have in next months a beautiful dvd edition like those of "to live and die in L.A.",and a serious rehearsal.It deserves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An underrated film with a typically stellar Roy Scheider performance, an eerie Tangerine Dream soundtrack, and brilliant visuals. This film's reputation suffers from its inexplicable title and unfavorable comparisons to the original. But it's useless to compare since this film is an altogether different beast. Friedkin gives it his usual nihilist/fatalist/existential stamp, making it a much darker film than the French version. Very suspenseful and well-made. Made by Friedkin at the height of his powers. His third best film after Exorcist and French Connection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underrated Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Story goes that when Sorcerer was released it was at a theatre where Star Wars was having an incredible Run selling out every night. When this movie was released there was lines around the block to see it and then in it's second week NOTHING! The movie died a horrible death at the box office and was alway relocated to the Heaven's Gate Orphanage for lost movies. Such a shame. Sorcerer is a mind blowing ride into desperation and horror. The Story is this four men who committed large crimes ranging from Fraud to armed robbery and outright terrorist attacks to cold blooded murder flee to a small south America country once there they struggle to survive. When an oil well explodes and the fire runs out of control the only option is dynamite to cap the well. But the dynamite is old and the nitro is leaking out making transport hard but not impossible. No one wants the job so they recruit 4 men our heroes in an manner of speaking take the job for a incredible amount of money They are given two trucks to repair and overhaul the trucks become main characters as well according to the movie novel they were abandoned army trucks left after WW2 and superstitious natives named them SORCERER and LAZLO . When the trucks are ready the journey itself proves to be the road to hell. one of the most famous scenes is where the Sorcerer truck is trying to cross the swing rope bridge during a harsh storm and the sorcerer almost does not make it that scene in it's entire sequence is a incredible feat of film making. Right to the end the suspense and the fear are kept up and Friedkin a master of this knows how to do this. The Story is excellent so is the acting all of whom should be more then proud to put this film on their resumes. Outstanding work by all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Many Ways, Superior to Wages of Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Friedkin's unacknowledged masterpiece is clearly superior in the 1st and 2nd acts as he gives superb backdrops into the individual stories of the main protagonists. When we see them in the 2nd act, amidst the grit and grime of a backwater Latin American nation, we understand the desperation that would have led them to such a place.The seering reality of the depravity they now live in was much more effective in Friedkin's movie. You don't expect to see a gorgeous hooker in this environment, unlike the unrealistic Wages of Fear. Oddly enough, Wages of Fear is actually much more Holly-wood like in its storytelling than Sorcerer.Mind you, I do like Wages of Fear and actually thought it was a great movie, but I have to revise my opinion after seeing a movie that actually does it right.Congrats, Friedkin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly this is a great film, I've always thought that, even though the original Wages of Fear is my all time favourite film. Roy Scheider is at his best in Sorcerer, totally believable at all times, if ever a man deserved a gong it was Roy.A question: 1.How many versions of this film are there? I've seen at least two: the US DVD (sadly just full frame and panned and scanned), and a perhaps longer TV version that was shown on UK TV circa 1981-82. The DVD starts with a close up of a stone statue, the TV version with a long helicopter shot over the jungle with Tangerine Dream's excellent score. The group are credited at the beginning in red titles. The TV version also has one of the oil bosses describe the area as the 'Devil's Asshole!' the endings are different as well (I won't mention what happens in either just in case you haven't seen the movie) Perhaps one day Billy Friedkin will re-release this film in a package that it deserves and Mark Kermode will have something to talk about apart from the Excorcist :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trying to get my own copy of this film for AGES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I completely forgot about this film until SPEED TV played it latenight on TV and I missed nearly half of it. Ever since I've been scrounging around for it and finally specially ordered it from A&amp;B Sound.Sorcerer was made by the same man who made the French Connection and the Exorcist around the same time, so it definitely has that early gritty look to it which I love. The premise is brilliant. Four men on the run with lives each flushed down the hopper united in some mad and dangerous journey.Set up.An oil rig has blown in some forsaken hole in South America under some generic dictatorship. The rig is burning and they need to blast it out as soon as possible.Problem The only cache of explosives big enough to do the job were kept 218 miles away and they weren't stored properly. Dynamite sticks need to be turned every so often in storage or else the nitroglycerin bleeds out the bottom and pools at the bottom of the stack. This makes it incredibly unstable and ready to blow.Solution Drive two trucks through the most treacherous and insanely difficult terrain to get the really unstable explosives from point A to point B, 218 miles away. Offer a truckload of money and find four men desperate enough to do it. Our heroes, men on the run with nothing to lose and little to live for, who just happen to also be crack mechanics and damn good truck drivers. They're using two trucks because odds are one wont make it. They're actually carrying six times as much explosive as they need to do the job.So after a brief road test to see who can do the job, they turn the men loose. And what you get, in my opinion, is some of the most insanely dangerous and brilliantly filmed sequences ever captured on film. This movie rocked. In this film is a moment that is on the top of my top ten list of most amazing moments captured on film. It's when the second truck, a 10 ton rig, tries to cross a rickety swaying bridge that isn't fit to hold up an anemic mule. The guide is hanging on for dear life waving the truck forward, there's a torrential downpour hammering down, there's a flooding river beneath them, and this truck just teetering on the edge of flipping over making its way across. Not one lick of computer animation in it and it totally kicks the butt of anything captured on modern film. Beautiful.This film should be viewed by every CG-obsessed film maker to show what can be done in the real world to bring back real organic suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>4 desperate men and two trucks called Sorcerer and Lazaro carrying a cargo of tempestuous explosives.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorcerer is directed by William Friedkin and adapted to the screen by Waldo Green from Georges Arnaud's novel Le Salaire de la peur (The Wages of Fear). It stars Roy Scheider, Bruno Cremer, Francisco Raba and Amidou. Music is scored by Tangerine Dream and cinematography by John M. Stephens and Dick Bush.It bombed famously at the cinema, was a location shoot nightmare with rows aplenty between cast and director, and even recently a court case erupted over the film as Friedkin sued Paramount and Universal over ownership of the picture. A film with such a mystical sounding title, could it be cursed? All the shenanigans surrounding Sorcerer have sort of had it hovering around the "forgotten" bin, where were it not for the Friedkin purists and 1970s movie aficionados it would have dropped in and had the lid put on it. However, if ever a movie from 1977 deserved to be revisited and treated better on home formats, then Sorcerer is the one. Where in its complete two hour form plays out as a lesson in skilled story formation, letting us know how these guys came to be in the situation they find themselves in, which in turn gives way to utter suspense as desperate men fight nature's jungle whilst perched on the precipice of explosive doom.There are a number of factors put forward on why Sorcerer failed at the box office. The title itself is a classic case of misdirection, the name given to one of the trucks in the story, it conjured up images of mystical and magical dalliances, it's safe to say that the film is a million miles away from that sort of genre. It also went up against the box office monster that was Star Wars, in comparison, and Friedkin readily admits this, it's dwarfed in production scope and cross demographic appeal. Then there is the matter of the "cut" version that did the rounds, where almost thirty minutes were chopped to allow more showings in theatres, without Friedkin's permission, the resulting film was a travesty of Friedkin's vision. Lead man Scheider, who is terrific, didn't want to promote the film, such was his anger at Friedkin cutting a subplot involving his character being shown in a sympathetic light. Have to say the director was right in keeping it grim.Also there's the Clouzot's factor and his version of the Arnaud novel released in 1953. Much beloved by many a critic as some sort of sacred cow of French cinema, Clouzot's The Wages of Fear is a very good film, but hardly a masterpiece. Looking back at some of the reviews upon Sorcerer's release, it seems that some big critics of the day wanted to appear cool by lauding from the roof tops about a foreign movie and how it shouldn't be remade. Weird really since Sorcerer isn't a remake, it's an interpretation on Arnaud's source. Inspired by Clouzot? Undoubtedly, but it's not remaking his movie. They moaned about the good hour of build up, calling it slow, but I'm sure I remember it rightly that Clouzot's movie does the same thing, and that didn't have Friedkin's fluid camera and Tangerine Dream laying hypnotic synthesisers all over it.Though the current Region 1 DVD of the film is full frame and grainy in print, the skill of the director, photographer and actors really comes to the fore. Film is often gritty and realistic and playing better now thematically than it did back in the 1970s. The locations are real and you are easily transported into the character's world, you feel the danger as nature and human bandits enter the fray; as if it wasn't bad enough with the case sensitive explosives in the back! There are risks at almost every turn, breath holding the order of the day, and the famous bridge scene is as good a sequence as 70s cinema has to offer (a logistic nightmare for Friedkin that required take after take to finish). All this only works because we have had the hour of build up previously. True, we may hanker for deeper character interaction as they traverse the perilous terrain, but this isn't about bonding, it's about men risking their lives for freedom and redemption. It beats a black heart and never once cops out. A truly great film crying out to be rediscovered by old and new film lovers alike. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've not yet seen The Wages Of Fear, but I have seed the American B picture remake The Violent Road. That was a good no frills film, but Sorcerer is really first rate and shows what can be done by a good director with the budget to use it. A lot of which was spent by hiring a truly international cast to play his four protagonists.The phrase 'international cast' is a rather overused description for a group of players of various backgrounds. But in this film William Friedkin used four players who were top names in the cinema of their respective countries. Roy Scheider, Paco Rabal, Amidou, and Bruno Cresson insured that the various countries they represented would be plunking down their money to see Sorcerer as well as guaranteeing some great performances.These four people who no one would say are the cream of the crop from their society all wind up in exile in a South American jungle working on an oil rig under assumed names. Roy Scheider is a gangster from America on the lam because he pulled the wrong job and shot the priest brother of a Mafioso. Paco Rabal is a contract killer from Spain, he might be there looking for Scheider. Bruno Cresson is a French war hero fleeing a banking scandal. And Amidou who is from Morocco is a terrorist the Israelis want real bad.There's an oil fire that's threatening to burn over the jungle and the only available explosives to use to blow it out is some really unstable nitroglycerin which has to be transported 200 miles on some bad roads and other hazardous conditions. So four guys who really have nothing to lose volunteer to drive the stuff in two trucks.William Friedkin made some great use of the location cinematography in the Dominican Republic to show what the great risks these guys are taking. You feel yourself riding shotgun with all of them on the trip.As it happened I took a vacation in Spain in 2001 and when I got there the Spanish media was full of news of the death of Paco Rabal on a flight from Montreal to Madrid. You would have thought the head of state had passed away, he was that idolized by the people there. He and Roy Scheider played well off each other, their scenes are the best in the film.Sorcerer is destined to be one eternal classic over the years, don't miss it if broadcast or better revived on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rare Chance To See Scheider Carry A Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following Jaws and a supporting role in Marathon Man, Roy Scheider starred in William Friedkin's remake of The Wages Of Fear: Sorcerer. The plot concerns four criminals who intersect when living in exile in Central America. The men are asked to drive cases of nitroglycerin over 200 miles of jungle infested hazards, including muddy terrain, dilapidated bridges, giant trees blocking their path, and jungle rebels. The four prologues of the men are confusing at first because viewers aren't sure of the common thread binding them together until well into the film. Once the men arrive in the remote jungle village, tension builds slowly until the men are selected to do the driving. Once they leave the village, the tension is riveting as the men face one unbelievable obstacle after another. Director/producer Friedkin utilizes all the classic conflicts: man vs. himself, man vs. man, man vs. nature, man vs. machine, and man vs. fate. The film moves incredibly fast for one that clocks in at just over two hours with jaw-dropping scenes prompting viewers to wonder aloud how certain scenes were possibly filmed. The film received an Oscar nomination for best sound, losing to a film entitled Star Wars. Also, the film bombed at the box office due to its release during the Star Wars phenomenon. Walon Green wrote the screenplay based on Georges Arnaud's novel. It remains one of Friedkin's best films, and his personal favorite, due to its nail-biting tension and lack of lulls. *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When ever I am asked what my favorite movie is, I always say that is too hard to pick. The best I can do is discuss my top 10 movies. Scorcer is one of them. It is also one of those great 70's movies that as of yet, no one other then myself has ever heard of. William Fridkin is a grand master of building tension in a film. The way he develops the back story of the characters and presents them to us at there worst, sitting in a filthy bar, in some crappy 3rd world south American town, out of money and out of luck.. This is where things get interesting. An oil fire in the jungle requires explosives to put it out, however the only explosives have been stored in a forgotten shack and has become so unstable that the slightest bump could set it all off. This is where our out of luck characters come in. They are recruited to truck the crates in different trucks, across the worst roads and conditions on earth. The sound track from Tangerine Dream is like a relentless heart beat that keeps you on the edge. As these beat-up military 4x4's attempt to cross raging rivers, and muddy washed out jungle roads. To get paid you have to be the first one there. Just a fantastic tension filled film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film, its my favorite William Friedkin film, and i believe its probably his best film ever. The film stays true to his style as an intense filmmaker, who wants everything to be reality based and realistic as possible. The only problem with the film is the title, it gives off the wrong image in peoples mind of what to expect. They should have call it "Wages of Fear." Another disappointment for me is i heard that a special edition digitized version of the movie was about to be released and over a year later nothing is even out. I love this movie and it should have gotten at least 5 Oscar nominations for 1977. I hope Friedkin makes another movie soon. Universal and Paramount needs to release the DVD now or I'm gonna cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intensity: A Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:I am not getting into the whole which is better this or the original The Wages Of Fear. They are both excellent movies. I prefer this for a couple of reasons. First, the town looks like it should just hideous, it is not all immaculate and idealized like it was just cleaned up for the movie. The people are wearing rags and it is one big, muddy crap hole. The guys look like they just came out of a sewer pipe even Scheider. Friedkin was an excellent director for intensity, frankly, Live And Die In LA, The Exorcist and The French Connection were a little too intense for my taste. Here, he really takes the script, changes the ending but keeps the rest and intensifies it a thousand fold. The movie is worth owning for the crossing the rope bridge, in the truck with the dynamite, dripping with nitro, in the pouring rain with the bridge pressed down to the swollen river swaying back and forth in the gale. Remember this is 1977, way before CGI, whatever they paid the stunt-men it wasn't enough. This scene alone is why I prefer it. Wages is a great movie, I own it on Blu Ray, I just like this gritty, intense like you cannot believe classic. Why did it bomb? Well, guess what was released one month after it came out in 1977? This little movie called Star Wars. It disappeared in the tsunami that was that cultural phenomenon. The above is not my favorite scene, the last ten minutes, as Scheider is the only survivor of the two explosives trucks, Friedkin shoots the desert vista all in blue light he leaves his dead partner on the desert floor. As he is driving, in the creepy blue light, all the horrors of the journey flash back interspersed with the unearthly blue light giving the scene true existential surreal otherworldly depth; I have never been a Friedkin fan, I will be honest with you this is the only movie of his I own. I hated the Exorcist for theological reasons, the wrong Deity won, and the French Connection has a dreadful ending. Here, he really darkened the French classic and Scheider turns in one of his best acting performances. Fate still kills the survivor as it does in the original, I will not spoil it for you. He twists it so not the explosives but the past wipe out Scheider. Some people may find the intensity too much; true, the original was more aesthetically pleasing; I simply found this more realistic. Friedkin spends less time developing these characters, they remain strangers to each other throughout the movie.Yet, this is what I liked. The intensity comes from the journey itself, the rope bridge in the rain is but one of several intense moments. A true criticism is that Roy is alone here while the French movie had good acting throughout the cast but that is why Friedkin jettisons the chatter of interactions you find in the original. I thought this delineation of men in hiding being more anti social to be more realistic. I can tell you this; it is one intense movie once the journey with the explosives trucks begins. A bit slow at the beginning but not for long. They each have to go into hiding. Odds are you missed this movie, Star Wars annihilated it at the box office, it is a great, hidden little treasure. Not for kiddies, but one good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A harrowing documentary-like thriller and one of the 70's lost masterpieces ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I learned that "The Wages of Fear" had inspired a remake, my immediate reaction was 'Why'? Remaking a popular and universally acclaimed classic such as Henri-George Clouzot's masterpiece sounded as blasphemous as the idea of remaking "Gone With the Wind" or "The Godfather". You simply can't touch movies that already achieved a certain level of cinematic greatness. But that was an immediate reaction ? My interest toward "Sorcerer" increased; I found out that the movie made Roger Ebert's Top 10 great lists of 1977, an interesting endorsement. The casting of Roy Sheider spoke also in favor of the film, not only for my deep appreciation of this actor, but also because his name is associated with some of the greatest thrillers of the 1970's : "Marathon Man", "Jaws" and of course, "The French Connection", which has another name in common with "Sorcerer" : William Friedkin.We all are familiar with the plot of "The Wages of Fear", four men recruited for a suicide mission, to drive two trucks full of nitroglycerin over mountain roads. Any bump, and the truck explode with no warning and the four men must deal with natural and psychological obstacles with nerves of steel. The film was simply one of the most suspenseful movies ever. So, who else than the same film-maker who directed the chase sequence in "The French Connection" or the psychological thrills of "The Exorcist" could have handled the story with the same, if not better, level of intensity? So, I finally discovered "Sorcerer" ? And all I can say is that William Friedkin proved again his masterful talent to accentuate the tension and the sense of pressure with a gripping documentary-like realism that almost surpassed the original. I almost blamed some parts for having indirectly pointed out minor flaws from the original film. Indeed, while "The Wages of Fears" had the entertainment value of a great adventure film, "Sorcerer" made me touch the dirt, smell the grease or feel the humidity in the Nicaraguan tropical jungle and on these men's boiling foreheads.I was positively surprised by the deliberate distance taken from the original, with never betraying the core of the film. The four protagonists are all criminal, running from the law and outcasts in their respective countries, as the only reason that could justify their motivations to move on in such a hostile setting. In a long almost half-an-hour sequence, we're introduced to each one of them. The South-American Nilo (Francisco Rabal), the Arab terrorist Kassem aka Martinez (Amidou), a rich French businessman accused of fraud Victor Manzon aka Martinez (Bruno Cremer) and a mob killer Jackie Scanlon aka Juan Dominguez (Roy Sheider) From Paris to New Jersey with a detour to Jerusalem, the movie shows the characters' backgrounds, providing an international feel to better underline the dead-end aspect of the location they will all end up. It's a very significant change from the original film as it respects our intelligence enough not to throw borderline stereotypes in our faces and make their flaws more understandable and the eventuality of their death more poignant. The movie avoids any kind of cinematic cliché, including the waitress character that's physically far from the glamorous Vera Clouzot, but her relationship with Scanlon provides a genuine oasis of tenderness in a rather harrowing film.The movie gets even deeper by explaining how the explosive liquid was in fact dynamite badly conserved which transformed it into 'sweating nitro' , what's the purpose of such subtleties? I think this the kind of details that make the difference, never taking anything for granted just because the material worked before. Thoughtfully dedicated to Clouzot, I will never go as far as saying that the movie is better than the original version, but it does create an atmosphere that exclusively belongs to it, an atmosphere embodied by the electronic score of Tangerine dream that captures the thrilling vibes of the late 70's.Among the uniquely memorable scenes of the film there is the cult moment when they drive the truck on the suspended rope bridge. This is film-making at its best, you must see it to believe it, and I couldn't believe a few people only experienced that in a theater. The special effects, the editing, the direction, everything is perfect and when you have this big truck that can't go back; driving on a swaying bridge, under a violent wind and a pouring rain, if ever there was a Top 10 most nightmarish situation from a movie, I would include this one.The nightmarish feel increase as the elements and fate never cease to harass these men, descending them into a level of madness highlighted by the existential realization of their missions' innate futility, where there's more than a reward to gain, there's also honor and dignity. More than a remake, "Sorcerer" is an extraordinary work of art and I can't believe its astounding sequences didn't earn it more than a lousy Oscar nomination for Best Sound.Now, why isn't the movie more famous, or appreciated ? I considered the answer might come from the release's year and my suspicion was confirmed. The movie opened just after a certain movie named "Star Wars" ? and besides that cruel irony of fate, the movie suffered from a particularly misleading title. I'm among those who believe the title was wrong. Seriously, just ask yourself what you would expect from a movie named "Sorcerer" released by the guy who made the "Exorcist"? You know what the title in French is: "The Convoy of Death", how cool and relevant does that sound? Or what if the title was simply "The Wages of Fear"? If one thing, it would have at least avoided a misinterpretation as there's absolutely no supernatural elements in that film!Mystery, it's as if the movie was victim of its own sorcery ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"No One Is Just Anything."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorcerer's keynote is epitomized early on when introducing Bruno Cremer's wealthy character, living an ivory tower existence, with no reason yet to feel insecure about much. His wife reads to him a war article. He comments, "Just another soldier." She replies, "No one is just anything." Indeed, in William Friedkin's merciless adventures, heroic characters tend to be defined by any and everything contemptible, villains are unknowable, the lines between them are exceedingly vague?and arbitrary. The French Connection, man-versus-man. The Exorcist, man-versus-unexplained. With Sorcerer, man-versus-chance, an indefinable, undetected competitor. The realm of Friedkin's visualization is a perilous, brutal, ethically insolvent one where there bluntly is no God, just randomness, meaninglessness, pure survival.Unlike Clouzot's incredible original film, Friedkin doesn't allow for easy identification with any of the central figures, and despite Roy Scheider's impressively physical central performance, it remains emotionally aloof. But that doesn't matter. Seeing each man's prior exploits tells so much, voyeuristically, about their behavior when they happen upon each other in the thirsty alien setting where they're all out of their elements. We also see how regular joes can be monsters.Also, throughout their respective prefaces, Friedkin foretells the boiling dangers awaiting our scandalous foursome, with sardonic counterpoint. Francisco Rabal abandons the hotel in a wrought-iron elevator decorated green, as are the hotel walls. As Amidou and his co-conspirators plan their getaway, they hurriedly study a map. When he chooses "the long way," the suggestion's far more poignant than he realizes. It's also in the early New Jersey fast-sketch that Friedkin's murky jesting emerges: In a church cellar, various priests calculate thousands of dollars, wearing visors, more like bookies than Christ's followes. Armed robbers break in. At the wedding upstairs, the ceremony's priest declares, "Christ abundantly blesses this love." Back to the basement as dollars gush from canvas bags, robbers jam their pouches. Upstairs, "You've strengthened your consent before the Church." Friedkin pushes into bride and groom. The bride has a black eye.In a Paris café comprising close-ups of enticing culinary delights, Cremer, his wife and their friend babble about substandard lobster in humid South American waters, while Cremer merely half-listens. The truck Scheider runs into has a Meridian Freight insignia. Friedkin's pessimistic joking could be doubled here: Scheider zigzags off a "meridian" in a manufacturing district, a massive water tower dwarfing everything else. He'll eventually find himself in a manufacturing gutter of the world. During his getaway, he passes big color signs promoting things he won't see, have or enjoy again.A handful of exiles and fugitives from starkly different backgrounds, cultures, nationalities are driven by desperation to go into hiding, working in an obscure oil drilling operation in South America. When fire breaks out of control, they each seize a chance to earn enough money to escape their hellholes, earn citizenship, feel as if they might restore honor, by transporting crates of unstable dynamite through miles of perilous jungle in rusty, rickety old trucks. But this dynamite, negligently stored, literally oozes nitro. Any shock, any vibration, they detonate. Somehow, driving in pairs, these men must carry their cargo past a crumbling rope-suspension bridge, swinging ferociously in a savage storm over a flood-heaving river, a colossal tree blocking the road, and a flock of forlorn, vicious bandits.The cash sum being rewarded to the drivers is erratic all through the film. The oil company first says they will pay 8,000 pesos to each driver. Later the demand doubles. Later one boasts that he and another one will get double shares of 20,000 each. By the end, a check reads 40,000 pesos which would be just 10,000 each. This seems like one of Friedkin's sadistic impositions of his thematic intentions. We're drawn into circumstances so desperate, so reckless, any amount sounds beautiful, any amount will do, then eventually, returning to any semblance of relatable civilization is all that matters.Friedkin and screenwriter Walon Green strip the source story's existential themes to the core. Driven by a series of striking images, it ultimately goes one step further than Clouzot by suggesting that humankind is subject not only to the vagaries of fate and nature but to its own vengeful, venal essence. What's so enrapturing about Sorcerer is that the needs and situations that occur, one after another, are so primal, these characters are hairpin turns between murderously divided and collaborating with implicit trust. Friedkin exemplifies the seduction of voyeurism in the very close, detailed but utterly omniscient way we follow each unrelated character to this godforsaken place, where they know absolutely nothing of each other, but we've seen them all in their respective realms of normalcy, the shameful predicaments that got them here. But just as well, we're ever so subtly implicated in the vengeful, venal, not in what we see but what we find ourselves expecting. Take for example the riot that erupts in the street after the oil explosion. The townspeople are violent, frenzied, relentless, but Friedkin leaves out the authorities' retaliation. And we expect it?indeed, we begin to want it, relate to it. It's a disturbing feeling.Friedkin loves to show mechanisms, the down and dirty way things work, as in the montage with minor-key synth music showing the rag-tag bunch preparing trucks. It makes us that much more conscious of the threadbare fragility of the utterly extraordinary ensuing action sequences, most notably the hazardous rainstorm crossing of the fragile rope-bridge. No matter how much these men exert themselves to cover every corner, suspect everyone, spot every detail, do whatever they can to ensure their survival, they never have any control over their own fates, not how they got into this mess or how or if they get out of it. They don't all speak the same language, none of them trust or even understand one another, or even use their real names. Even if they do succeed, or some, or none, they have about as much control over their deaths as they do their births.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rare kind of Action movie experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS This is one of those movies that demands a close second look. At first glance it seems like a unique action movie with some good performances. But upon closer inspection, this movie is almost like a minor horror movie, somewhat reminding one of The Sixth Sense, with its twisted vision of a man in hell. If one were to pay close attention to several scenes in the film, one would come away thinking that the main character played by Roy Scheider, has literally died and went to hell. From the beginning when he is involved in a car crash, what follows is a subtle, yet highly symbolic underlying theme of a man who is on a journey to the devils domain. COnsider the car crash, was Roy Scheider the only survivor, or was he indeed dead, perhaps a ghost. Consider the group that he was forced to join on their suicide mission, an assassin, a terrorist, a swindler and a gangster, all headed for the fall, and a trip to hell for their bad deeds. Consider the burning fires of the oil factory, this is where they are headed, the fires are symbolic of hell itself. Consider the crossing of the bridge in the storm. The sound of that terrifying wailing wind, the demon wind, could that have been the entrance, the gates to hell itself, there are so many slight references to the idea that this is more then what it seems. In a nutshell Sorcerer is simply brilliant, the kind of movie that they just do not make anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" If The Devil Paid our wages, . . we would own him some change "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the world of crime, there are many things a criminal could do to have someone seek revenge. If one chooses to go ahead with the crime without regards to the outcome, then it is said the devil will have his revenge in due time. The author of the book (George Arnaud), " Wages of Fear " said as much in his original work. If you read the novel, you begin to realize there are a couple of organizations in the real world who might have been created by the devil. The two are The Mob and the second is the F.B.I. With the help of Inter-Pol (International Police) anyone who makes their most wanted list will never be able to hide anywhere in the world. The second and more sinister organization is The Mafia. Commit a crime against them and its said 'you can run, but you cannot hide' from them. This basis is the foundation of the film, " Sorcerer ." Although the first choice of star for the film was the Late Steve McQueen, the second choice of Roy Scheider as Jackie Scanlon was fated to be just as good. The rest of the cast Bruno Cremer as Victor Manzon, Francisco Rabal as Nilo and Amidou as Kassem all join in to create a feature film of superb quality. Each man is someone else when an oil company reaches into the heart of the Amazon seeking desperate men for an extremely hazardous job of trucking a cargo of sensitive and unstable Nitro over rugged mountains, treacherous bridges and monsoon jungles. The men hired are hiding and on the run, but each seek redemption through wealth if they live. The hand of fate had left them in obscurity but the film alludes to what length it will go to remind them of their destiny. An excellent job by director William Friedkin as he offers this movie to anyone seeking a dramatic classic. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That bridge scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Try to clear your mind of the fact that "The Wages of Fear" exists as a previous French movie. I've seen it and its a great movie on its own merits. Would it be better if Sorcerer had not been made so that Wages would have its pristine place in the film pantheon. No, it would not.I saw Sorcerer in a movie theater when it first came out (having seen and like Friedkin's two earlier films) and was knocked for a loop. I wonder how many of the reviewers here who disparage Sorcerer have only seen it on a TV screen.Because, I gotta tell you, some parts of this movie seen on the widescreen are mind blowing. Getting that truck (which just about has a personality of its own) across that rope bridge during what looks like a hurricane has to be one of the most intense moments in cinema history. What they pull off in that scene looks patently impossible. And without a speck of CGI.One of the great adventure movies.The score by Tangerine Dream ("kings of the German synthesizer") is spellbinding. (For another great TD-drenched movie, see Michael Mann's Thief.) And it has one of the late Roy Scheider's greatest performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An unfortunate circumstance slipped Sorcerer into the ether. And that circumstance was Star Wars. They were released at the same time and any film up against the Wars of the Stars was dwarfed in comparison. It's terribly unfair as Lucas' success consequently became Friedkin's downfall. Sorcerer is a very good film, a great one in fact. Based upon the same book as the classic French film The Wages of Fear, it's material worth repeating in the perpetually sweaty grit of the 70s. The problem with Wages is that it spent an unnecessary hour and a half on setup. Sorcerer is a bit better, spending an hour instead, but it's much leaner and doesn't waste time. Opening with quick engaging vignettes, I can see how a viewer who wasn't aware of their appearance would feel alienated. They're not exactly necessary but it opens up the world of Sorcerer in a way that it wouldn't do otherwise. It's thanks to its dynamic editing, super quick and super sharp all the time while holding onto the tension.As a result, the film is like the most thrilling parts of The French Connection put into one volatile barrel. It's a shame that Friedkin doesn't like working with Roy Scheider in hindsight, considering he got him an Oscar nomination for Connection, but I'm a big fan of him. He's a great leading man in All That Jazz, for example. Here, the cast do struggle to stand out and make their mark, but that's because the material doesn't lend itself to personalities and inner struggle. They're best used metaphorically, which Sorcerer doesn't do overtly. Instead, the joy is watching the men's resourcefulness, especially in a sequence where a big trunk is in the way, or the nail-biting bridge scene. What stands out is the remarkable sound design that makes every crunch feel life-threatening. It's a shame the score by Tangerine Dream is so dated, even if it was celebrated at the time. Works at times, doesn't at others. Sorcerer is a rough around the edges movie, but a thrilling ride nevertheless.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before MAD MAX 1 and 2 and before APOCALYPSE NOW came William Friedkin's utterly terrifying remake of THE WAGES OF FEAR called SORCERER. Many similar images and human themes came up in those latter films first explored in this truly visceral truck and jungle thriller. I saw it in a cinema a few years ago with Freidkin present as host and with a terrific Q&amp;A session afterward. The full 121 minute version not seen in 1977 in its 93 min form (Leave off reels 1 and 2). Seen on a big screen and in proper widescreen SORCERER was a gripping revelation. Thoughts of scenes and images lifted into the MAD MAXs and APOCALYPSE NOW also became noticed. However it is the utter reality of the filming location and the overwhelming nightmare concept and visuals of the truck trek through the hell of the wet jungle, climaxing in the most startling stunt work on a suspension bridge with both trucks creaking they way across rotten logs with a torrent river below that literally had grown men in the audience gasping in sheer horror. This is a monumental film and I can see why it cost $22m. Roy Schieder proves again why he was a great and reliable actor. If you can see SORCERER as a film in cinema you will appreciate it's full scope. Outrageously and insulting is the DVD which is a square screen cropping and should be binned until the blu ray comes out in full terror splendour.</fullReview>

The group led by Roy Scheider are given the opportunity to earn enough money to get out of the dirty banana republic by transporting two crates of unstable nitroglycerin through miles of jungle in trucks that have seen better days. In my opinion 'Sorcerer' is Nothing short of a masterpiece but it needs more recognition at the moment it is widely available on DVD but it is not of a high standard that one is used to seeing. The aspect ratio i believe is 1.66.1 but the format used for the DVD is atrocious it is in full as opposed to Wide-screen and to add insult to injury it is panned and scanned and is not in a great transfer, William Friedkin should re-release this film either theatrically or domestically he got away with doing it with 'The Exorcist' so why not Sorcerer?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luckily this movie differs from the earlier French movie version "Le salaire de la peur". But does this make it a better movie as well? Slightly yes but it obviously is not one without its flaws.I know that the 1953 "Le salaire de la peur" is considered to be an early action-classic but I just never really got why. The movie is overlong, with a very slow first half and the movie is filled with some unsympathetic, lazy, lying, crooked bunch of characters. I was therefore also pleased to see already from early on into the movie, that this movie was taking a different approach with its story. Biggest difference between the two is the time period it got set in. Both movies are set in the present time, so for this movie that means that it's being set in the '70's, which is always a plus, for basically any sort of movie.But still the characters aren't much better in this one. All of their backgrounds are explained more interesting and exciting but not really their motivations to take on this extremely dangerous job, that plays the central role within the movie its story. It just didn't made much sense, as did a whole lot of other stuff in this movie.It nevertheless still remains a pretty entertaining movie to watch, though I just didn't seemed to be as grabbed by it as a whole lot of other people seem to do. It just seems to me that with a this sort of concept they could had explored so much more, tension and action-wise. To me the movie is just lacking in its excitement and tension, though there are still plenty of great moments in it.It's not really an actors movie. Seems actually that the actors become sort of secondary in the story and I actually kind of liked this about its approach. Yes, perhaps it's a reason why the characters remain kind of flat and distant ones but it does make the overall story as a whole still more interesting and compelling to follow. There are actually as few dialog as possible in this movie, so just don't expect Roy Scheider or anyone else to shine in this.Overall I still mainly liked this movie, though I just don't love it as much as everyone else seems to.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

I can put this on and enjoy it immensely every time. I can die peacefully if they remaster it with deleted scenes, outtakes or even dailies! A fascinating remake of Clouzot's Wages of Fear which was overshadowed by the release of Star Wars that summer. Tangerine Dream provides the Haunting music that fits perfectly. 4 men trucking Nitro-glycerin over 200 miles away to snuff an oil rig fire.

		<fullReview>(Some Spoilers) In a depressing backward but oil rich South American third-world country the lives of four persons cross from four different parts of the globe. They all, with the possible exception of professional assassin Nilo, have one thing in common; their on the run from the law the mob and the Isareli Mossad and their lives aren't worth the raggedy and dirty clothes that their wearing. Being an exciting remake of the 1953 French Classic "Wages of Fear" the William Friedkin suspense /thriller "Sorcerer" was not the success at the box office that it should have been because a lot of moviegoers mistook it to be a sequel to Friedkin's previous horror blockbuster "The Exorcist" released four years earlier in 1973. Looking forward to nothing but an early grave the three fugitive's Scalnon/Dominguez, Roy Scheider, Manzon/Serrar, Bruno Cremer, Kassen/Martin, Amidou, are stuck in this dingy little town of Poza Rica with no hope of ever getting out. Another outsider Nilo, Franiscc Rabal,is also in town but not as a fugitive but as a hired hit-man to do a job for his employer. At Roza Rica a major fire breaks out at the towns and country's, biggest oil well that if not put out immediately would cause the country and the US oil company that's there to go bankrupt.The only way to put out the fire and save the oil well is to get a truckload of dangerous nitroglycerin sticks that are stored in the jungle, some 200 miles away, and bring it to the oil well fire in order to detonate it and then smother and choke out the flames; but that's easier said then done. Calling for volunteers and offering them from 8 to 10, later as much as 20, thousand pesos the American manager of the well as well as the oil field surrounding it Charles Corlette, Romon Bieri, get's Dominguez Serrar Martin and his friend Marquez, Karl John, to drive two trucks each loaded with three cases of nitroglycerin. But they have to drive them some 218 miles back to Roza Rica through some of the worst roads in Central and South America and one mistake can mean instant death for the person, and his partner, driving. Nerve whacking action coupled with a bone rattling soundtrack has the four drivers, Nilo who whacked Marquez earlier in the film later took his place on the truck, go through hell and high and treacherous mountain roads and low jungle swamps and streams. As they try to make it back to Roza Rica with the desperately needed nitro but not all of them do. Only Dominguez makes it back alive. You need to gulp down a bottle of extra-strong sedatives to just be able to sit through and watch some of the incredible scenes in the movie that seem to defy the laws of modern physics. With the trucks literally hanging on a string to keep them from falling off a cliff or a bridge that could barely support a 160 pound man. The film ends with Dominguez now a hero in the town and about to leave, for God's knows where, with a 40,000 peso certified bank check having just one last dance with the cleaning lady, who seems to be the only woman in town, to the sweet and tender music of "I'll Remember April". It's then that his dark and terrifying past, that he left back in New Jersey, finally catches up with him.</fullReview>

Along comes a film called 'Sorcerer' A title promising something that just may eclipse William Friedkin's 1973 effort 'The exorcist'. What was delivered was a very gritty, sweaty film about guys driving trucks brute force through exotic jungles of South America. The stories a throw back to early 70's road (action) films that had an inherent dependence on good story telling.It's shot on a massive scale and drags you through some of the most godforsaken hell holes on the planet. It's presentation is realist and confronting with nothing being over or under done.There seems to be plot holes and entire sequences appear to be missing, however this film is a rough ride and the jerky narrative is spot on.The scene were Scanlon dances with the girl is much discussed. My slant on it would be that Scanlon is so utterly disillusioned with his grotty rat like existence his grasps the moment and the music to revisit humanity, a device that may just save his sanity from tipping over.For anybody who's had their fill of CGI abused film making this picture is ready to be discovered. Perfect movie making.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Friedkin's best film, an overlooked classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorcerer got a bad rap for a long time. An extremely arduous production that ran over budget only to be steamrollered at the box office by Star Wars, it marked the beginning of the end for 70s auteur films and the start of the modern blockbuster era. When Easy Riders, Raging Bulls told the story of the era, Sorcerer was portrayed as the epitome of a director who had got too big for his boots making a monument to his hubris.It's true that Friedkin got out of hand on this film (insisting on going on location to reshoot inserts that only required a close up of a truck mileometer), and that the film didn't find a big audience in 1977 and would find it even harder to find one now. What's been forgotten is that this is nonetheless a brilliant film, and the fact that films like this don't get made any more is to be mourned rather than celebrated.Now available in a pristine remastered version that looks amazing on Blu Ray, and hopefully to be rereleased for at least a limited cinema run, this is a classic of downbeat 70s cinema and of sheer naked suspense. The protagonists are deliberately difficult to root for, and their world is a squalid desperate one. Much of it is still current now; one of the men taking refuge in South America is an Arab terrorist on the run, another a disgraced banker guilty of wholesale fraud. The crisis that sets off the story involves international oil operations using cheap labour in dangerous conditions, and political unrest among the locals amid corruption and military dictatorship.As a huge oil well fire rages and desperate men recruited to transport ageing, unstable nitroglycerine in trucks 200km through the jungle, the pasts of the men selected threaten to catch up with them, then become irrelevant as they realise the danger of their situation. Only one truckload is needed, but they send two as there is a good chance one of them will be destroyed by their own dangerous cargo.The film builds up an almost unbearable level of tension, as the trucks crawl through treacherous jungle where any bump or knock could blow them sky high. The men sweat buckets through their grimy pores, clinging on for dear life inches from huge drops, literally crawling across broken bridges, all for the pay off and legal work papers that will alleviate their horrendous twilight existence. Roy Scheider is the perfect leading man for this story, a study in twitchy fear and determination, and is brilliant here.The story builds to a tremendous finale and some classic 70s bleakness, leaving you breathless. This is Friedkin on top form, with everything from the visuals, sound, direction and acting in perfect service of the story, and haunting musical score from Tangerine Dream. This film is well worth seeking out on the region- free blu ray that was released in 2014, and if the opportunity arises to see this in the cinema you must not pass it up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For my money, the original one-sheet for "Sorcerer" is one of the most effective pieces of movie advertising. A cargo truck trying to negotiate its way across a sorely decrepit bridge. Simple, but highly effective. The whole movie is distilled into that one image. Which isn't to say that that's all the movie is, far from it. "Sorcerer" deals in high suspense like a seasoned pro, cavalierly dismissing the laws of physics in favor of truly nail-biting cinema. The whole thing feels doomed, and that sense of dread just builds, baby. It's a movie that spends its first half in set-up, but surprisingly is never boring. And Friedkin milks the gritty atmosphere out of that third-world jungle.It's been a few days and I still can't get this movie out of my head. It doesn't shake off easily.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this film is called what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than anything this was a fascinating watch, coupled with reading the IMDb trivia afterward as well as the letter from William Friedkin that came with the Warner Blu-Ray package.Definitely a bit of a time capsule action/suspense movie, much more drawn out and methodical than anything you'd see today. One to struggle with exposition that doesn't slap me in the face with explicit clarity I found the first act a slog, even if theatrically beautiful.In keeping with the '70s fascination with the anti-hero, not one character in Sorcerer is remotely likable, which works for the gritty, existential, survivalist tone of the film. The Tangerine Dream score was so far ahead of its time; I thought it was an early '80s film rather than one made in 1976. It might have seemed jarringly misplaced for the film's visuals and geographic setting but hey, it's Tangerine flipping Dream.Warner's restoration of the print and the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, the latter mainly evident in the numerous explosions and storm-drenched bridge crossing scenes. From what it sounds, the production was a grueling nightmare fraught with setbacks and resulted in a financial bust ($21b production budget, $9b box office take). I just wish we had a commentary and some extras on the disc, even if just retrospective interviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1977 there was a turn in New Hollywood: George Lucas' epic space fantasy tale had been released and taught the audience to escape from the problems of the real world to a faraway Galaxy. Star Wars has become a franchise, and several great movies has been forgotten, including William Friedkin's adaption of Clouzot's thriller, Wages of Fear.Although, it was a box-office failure and knocked the famous movie-brat of French Connection and The Exorcist off the saddle, it is a very complex and unforgettable movie. There are only anti-heroes in it. The main characters are purely human, not good Jedi knight or evil Sith lords. They are all filthy, they are only after money. But at the time of crisis they have to cooperate. Unless, they are stuck and they won't get their money.Friedkin's movie has a great atmosphere. It builds slowly (even a little bit too slowly at the beginning), but it serves a greater good: this way it could catch our attention and pulls us to the world of the story.Furthermore, Sorcerer was still a part of the Hollywood Renaissance movement, so it is very ambiguous movie. It criticizes the society of the 70s. It represents Americans and Europeans as filthy outcasts, who see the Third World only as the source of money and power. And Sorcerer sentences this attitude to death. Therefore, it is no wonder that the audience of the forced optimism of the late 70s did not like this perspective. They wanted to forget the traumas of the past. They wanted an other Galaxy instead of the mud of the rain forests. They wanted Star Wars instead of Sorcerer. Fortunately, real film fans could enjoy Friedkin's achievement in spite of its box office failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A refreshingly realistic and non-sympathetic approach to portraying terrorism. Perhaps the smug-yet-clueless Marxists who made "V For Vendetta" could learn a thing or two about the actual nature of terrorism, instead of glorifying it the way they did in that silly commercial turkey with wooden actress Natalie Portman. The Arab terrorist is shown to be aggressive, anti-Semitic, even willing to run over a few children during the truck test-run, and very much angry that the old Nazi was murdered. An explosion in a civilian section is just that: an explosion. Limbs being torn off, flying through the air (and hopefully hitting Sean Penn and Tim Robbins before they hit the ground). Anyone who glorifies suicide-bombers and the like needs to have a lobotomy ? quick."Sorcerer" is not only unique because of its unusual plot, it's the only 70s movie I've ever seen that looks like it was made in the mid-80s. I can't explain it, but the movie has that (un)mistakable 80s look. Even the stark realism, typical of Friedkin's earlier flicks, isn't enough to evoke the 70s.For a moment there, when Scheider reaches that strange desolate clearing which looks more alien than Mars, it appears as if the movie will have one of those it-was-all-just-a-dream endings, with Scheider drawing his last breaths in the crushed mob vehicle. It would make perfects sense, because the squalor that we see in this Latin American country evokes the idea of Hell (or at least a run-down Purgatory) several dozen times. A mobster, a corrupt banker, a Latino assassin, a Palestinian terrorist, and an ex-Nazi. Those five look as if they'd ended up in a much worse place than the prisons (or death, In Scheider's case) that would have awaited them instead. The irony is obvious.It was predictable that the Latino assassin would kill the ex-Nazi in order to take his place on the trip. It was also to be expected that Scheider would not get his much-desired happy ending, when New Jersey mobsters park outside the bar in the last scene. But otherwise "Sorcerer" pretty much goes where very few movies had gone before, moving from political thriller to drama to buddy movie (almost) with surprising ease, without appearing too over-the-top.If there is any flaw, it is the plot-device used to justify the basic premise: "no helicopter pilot would ever try it, for any amount of money, it's a suicide mission." There was of course the easier, more sure-fire method of bringing new dynamite via helicopter from a city nearby. Even training one of the workers to be pilot the chopper may have been easier than the practically impossible (not just hazardous) task they'd been given. The idea that a helicopter would shake the dynamite MORE than the trucks is also somewhat dubious. Nevertheless, this is a minor point, as far as I'm concerned. It hardly gets in the way of enjoying the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sorcerer" is about as "heavy" as American cinema gets. You will leave this experience with mixed emotions. I did anyway.The film's production values are aces. The cinematography, the acting, the soundtrack.. Everything in terms of production quality, amazing. It's a tough film to score. On one hand i want to rate this a ten, and on the other a five, so i met in the middle.The five was for one reason and one reason only. The basis of the plot doesn't really make sense. How driving six cases of nitroglycerin is easier on two raggedy old trucks instead of on a chopper is totally beyond me. One the other hand, if i can escape that thought, this is movie perfection. Scheider is awesome, as is the entire cast. The film is well put-together. Paced like films were paced 40 years ago, but it's terrifying, tense, unrelenting, unnerving, and a total blast regardless. I can see how many new age movie fans will hate this. It's got a hint of Stephen Frears "the hit", along with vintage freidkin grit and action. The tangerine dream music is spot-on dead-tap center, and the ending, much like the rest of the film, is a shot to the solar-plexus. I'd recommend this to film buffs over 35, but not to just anyone. It WILL beat the crap out of you! Glad i own it. Even with it's major flaw, it's one heck of movie.Ever-so-slightly overrated here, my score 74/100 You'll like this of you liked: The Hit(about even), Apocalypse Now(is better), Dogs of War(not as good), Papillon(about even)or Salvador(little better).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Sorcerer first, then Wages of Fear, but, in retrospect I had to give Wages of Fear the advantage, if only because of its presentation of some of the passages in the story: Two of the drivers in an ancient truck are toiling up the cordillera, ahead of their compatriots, a half-mile behind them. One pulls out his tobacco pouch and starts to roll a cigarette. A strong, sudden gust of wind comes into the cab of the truck and scatters the tobacco; the two men look at one another, and then hear, delayed, the explosion from a half-mile behind them. We, the audience and the characters, know in that moment that two lives behind them have been snuffed out. I've never seen, anywhere else, a metaphor for death presented on screen with that kind of simplicity, sensitivity and conviction. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen "The Wages of Fear" and I have to go against most opinions and say that this version is much better. The Story is not told in the standard Hollywood way. The beginning is like 4 short films portraying the lives of 4 men in different parts of the world who eventually become fugitives and end up living in squalor in a Latin American town. The antiheroes consist of a small time American gangster, a French embezzler, a middle eastern terrorist, and a Mexican hit man. Roy Schieder is the only one recognizable as the small time gangster. The rest of the cast involves foreign actors. The movie emphasizes the desperation they feel as they take the high paying job of driving the nitro trucks over the dangerous jungle terrain in the hopes of buying a better life for themselves. Director William Friedkin (The French Connection, The Exorcist) shoots these events with very much subtlety and little dialogue which seems to suit it perfectly. The last hour is one long action sequence as the men set out on their drive. The action in this film is much more interesting and intense than the endless machine gun/explosion ballads that action films have evolved into in the last 15 years. The rope bridge sequence particularly stands out. There is very little that is predictable throughout and the film is enhanced by a great Tangerine Dream score. If this film were to be made today it would cost 150 million and probably not be nearly as well done. One of the great action films from the 70's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the film first came out, I saw the TV spot, but never got to see it (came and went so fast from the theatres, with no tape rental available). So few years ago, when it came out in VHS, I was thrilled to race back to my place for a long over due viewing. I was rewarded. Sorcerer's story telling is very adult, requiring vigulance, investigation and discovery. Much different from today's "take no risks" films.William Friedkin is the master of suspense, action and gritty retribution. All of which are beautifully delivered in this '70s masterwork. When you see Scheider sweat, you believe it because its real.Socerer might be an homage to "Wages of Fear", but in it's own right a modern telling of a timeless story -- the falling from grace and the courage needed to survive. This is a must see for fans of intelligent film making.A real hidden masterpiece. Bravo, Friedkin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most underrated films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Friedkin once said that when he dies his tombstone will read "The Director of 'The Exorcist'". While "The Exorcist" is a brilliant film, I believe his best film is "Sorcerer" released in 1977. It is a remake of the French film "The Wages of Fear" and tells the story of four fugitives from different parts of the world who end up together in a seedy Latin American town. When there is an explosion at an oil refinery the fugitives agree to take the job of transporting two trucks carrying nitro glycerine to put out the fire. This film is filled with incredible tension. The most famous actor in the film is Roy Scheider of "Jaws" fame but all of the actors are very good. The film features a great score by Tangerine Dream (with other music by Keith Jarrett), brilliant direction by Friedkin as he sets the story up gradually, and great work by the sound men and the cinematographer. It is a shame that this film is more famous for how it bombed at the boxoffice than for its aesthetic qualities. It is one of the best films of the 1970's and one of the most underrated films ever made.</fullReview>

I wonder if the author of the book was able to put it down in writing as well as the director of the film. I will look for the Yves Montand film of the same story, which many seem to prefer, but I think this version will remain my favorite. I wonder why. Scheider, in this film, did a better job than any other actor that I can imagine: Steve McQueen would have overwhelmed the role. Really, I wish I could see Scheider in Papillon, or in Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Once an actor becomes celebrated, typed as a tough guy or adventure hero, he loses something. This almost unknown man, Roy Scheider (have I even got his name right?), who played the police chief in Jaws - a part which was so unremarkable that I hadn't even remembered his name - had so much more to give, as this film shows. I would bet it is the favorite of his career.</fullReview>

The four introductory opening scenes, shot in Mexico, Jerusalem, Paris, and in an US east coast city, give a realistic quality to the movie. The rest of the movie is action, whose accuracy is supported by technical presumptions. The plot also unfolds quite nicely, with a introduction of characters, then slowly picking up, to thundering action. Wish movies like this were made today, again.</fullReview>

Above all watch the unedited version which shows the backgrounds of the characters before they meet up in South America, it adds that much more to the desperation that is felt."Sorcerer" is tense, dramatic, and sometimes surreal. Some of the cliff hanger moments with the trucks are amazing, and the soundtrack complements the mood of the story.I only wish they'd let us know what happens in the bar at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Friedkin's Fall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "The Exorcist" (1973) and "The French Connection" (1971), William Friedkin fell hard and fast into the world of mediocrity. Before his career crashed and burned, however, he made 3 fairly interesting films.Released in 1977, "Sorcerer" was Friedkin's remake of 1953's "Wages of Fear". Both films find a group of international criminals hiding from the law in a small South American village. Struggling to make ends meet they agree to work for an oil company. Their task? Drive truckloads of volatile nitroglycerin over three hundred miles of treacherous jungle terrain. Though tense in places, "Sorcerer" was a huge box office flop. A stupid title and poor marketing meant that audiences stayed well away. Like Coppola, Friedkin took his crew to the jungle and seemed to never quite return. Three years after "Sorcerer", Friedkin directed "Cruising", a little known film staring Al Pacino. Here Pacino plays an undercover police officer who poses as a homosexual man in the hopes of catching a serial killer responsible for murdering several gay men. As such, Pacino infiltrates the "leather bars", a subculture of gay life in which men wear S&amp;M fetish-wear. "Cruising's" a fairly interesting film, but Friedkin's portrayal of gay lifestyles is too caricatural, too derogatory (homosexuals as lair dwelling vampires?), and his plot rarely excites. Worse still is the film's thin vein of homophobia, and Friedkin's aligning of gay sex to physical violence (earlier edits subliminally spliced shots of hard-core penetration into the film's murder sequences). This isn't as dubious as some of Friedkin's other works - the racist/crypto-Imperialist "Rules of Engagement", the death-penalty loving "Rampage", the ultra conservative, science/woman/hippie bashing "Exorcist" etc - but almost. Lifting the climax to 1977's "Looking for Mr Goodbar", Friedkin then ends with Pacino's character's latent homosexuality triggering a self-loathing that sees him assuming the place of the film's killer. This climax has been criticised by many, but is one of the film's saving graces. Here, law enforcement and bourgeois values are portrayed as being inherently repressive, violent and constructed via the destruction of everything that deviates from traditional masculinity. In other words: cops hate gays because they're repressing their own touchy-feely, homo-erotic feelings.Beyond this, "Cruising" boasts some fine cinematography, the director using the black and white motifs of the leather bars to sculpt the entire look of his film. Aside from some cold blues, "Cruising" might as well be monochromatic.Friedkin's last watchable film was "To Live And Die in LA", one of the better crime pictures of the 1980s (see the superior "Cutter's Way"). It stars William Petersen as a Secret Service agent responsible for tracking down a counterfeiter, but Friedkin's plot is unimportant. Savour instead the film's breezy atmosphere, catchy soundtrack and its slick action sequences. What's most interesting about "To Live And Die In LA", however, is its possible influence on director Michael Mann. Petersen would star in Mann's "Manhunter" several years later, a film in which Mann's style changes drastically from the dour tone he initially utilised in "Thief" (1981). Mann seems to have also been influenced by Friedkin's use of the German electronic group Tangerine Dream (who scored "Sorcerer" and who brought synthesisers and trance music to the mainstream) and the stylised visuals that Friedkin had hit upon. Of course Mann's "Miami Vice" was released a year before "To Live and Die", so it may well be Mann who's the influence on Friedkin.Regardless, in many ways "To Live and Die in LA" is the link between the gritty crime films of the 1970s and the more stylised crime films that would came later; the point at which neo-realism meets slick MTV visuals and cutting. In the 1990s, Michael Mann would marry this cocktail to the designer existentialism of Jean Pierre Melville (see "The Samurai", "The Fingermen", "Bob the Gamber"), giving rise to "Heat".7.5/10 - See "Cutter's Way".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn;t get any better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We're all entitled to our opinions. Moviegoers spoke in 1977 when "Sorcerer" absolutely crashed and burned at the box office.I was lucky to see it the first day of it's general release. It fared so poorly it was also the last week of general release.I's still, IMO, one of the best movies ever made. The river crossing in a vicious storm is spectacular. The 4 main characters, all on the run from something, and their love/hate relationship with each other, gives me the shivers. The off-set location filming (Nicaragua? Costa Rica?) will have you grabbing for your nitroglycerine pills.I cannot say enough good things about this flick. I only hope that one of these days producer/director Bill Friedkin loses his cojones long enough to release in Blu Ray Hi-Def. Which is where it belongs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... William Friedkin ever made, by far better than the original french movie, Clouzot's Le salaire de la peur. The sequence of the trucks going over the rope bridge is part of the cinema anthology. A new digipack DVD with commentary tracks and making of by Friedkin would be great, considering the effort that went into making this film. Even if Steve McQueen was the studio's first choice for the Scanlon role, I think Scheider really did a great job, as well as Bruno Cremer in a french Indiana Jones' role. The music composed by Tangerine Dream is overwhelming. Just a little regret ... the title that for the people not being aware of doesn't make any link with the original movie. Personally I would have chosen the same title as the original one, being proud of this 'remake'. But why in the hell not issuing a European Region version ? This movie seems to be definitely cursed ... like Cimino's Heaven's gates !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tangerine Dream at their best meet William Friedkin at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorcerer is a masterpiece. You may not like it, but it is. Worse : it is an unknown masterpiece. Based on H.G. Clouzot's Salaire de la peur, it reaches far beyond the original movie to start a totally experimental scenario that brings new forms for the future of cinema. Before Short Cuts or Magnolia, Friedkin explodes the rules of narration by making a two part movie : first is a following of four short movies that concern heavy political zones of the seventies : south America, new york Mafia, Israel and France's financial frauds. Second part is a one hour movie. The four short stories conducts to the one hour movie. The whole form in the same time a visual trip close to Apocalypse Now but made two years before and in the same time a kind of a experimental resume of seventies global politics : the center subject of the movie (the petrol) used as a bombastic form (the petrol creates wars, burns, explodes) to illustrate the globalization of politics. Dictators, mercenaries, petrol, money, religion, third world, capitalism, international bank, wars, explosions, adventure, vengeance, Sorcerer is all about that, with a part documentary part cinema scope / hallucination visual style. It borrows from the documentary style of French Connection (and of Friedkin's early political documentaries) and of the very baroque and mystical aesthetics of The Exorcist. Lots of people consider SORCERER as Friedkin's masterpiece. I don't know if it is true. Compared to French Connection and to The Exorcist, it is surely the third part of a "break the rules" masterpieces trilogy that led Friedkin at the center of history of Cinema. Often forgotten because of its contemporaries such as Scorcese and Coppola, Friekdin is surely as important as them, for he has created three revolutions : in the film noir, in the horror films, and in the "i don't know what it is i've never seen anything like it before" movies that you can find also in Tarkovski's Stalker or Otomo's Akira. Forget Clouzot (who's a great director), SORCERER is a pure William Friekdin movie. You'll never forget it. And Roy Scheider (one of the best actors of all time) is amazing as always.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent action movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not many remakes come close to matching the quality of the original, especially a revered classic like "The Wages of Fear." But William Friedkin, hot off the success of "The French Connection" and "The Exorcist," did a remarkable job, not necessarily surpassing the original, but adding a gritty realism that energizes the story. It's hard to think of another film, even thirty years later, that strips away all sense of glamour in order to tell such a compelling, earthy tale. It's a harrowing journey. The opening introductions to the four main characters are admittedly confusing, but their purpose is well served once the action gets under way. The film's title remains a matter of contention; It's misleading and doesn't fit, even after you become aware of its vague connection. Friedkin comes through with a final twist that feels more convincing than Clouzot's ending. Highly recommended as an intelligent action film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this at the tail end of its (very short) first run almost 25 years ago, and had never heard of The Wages of Fear. Have still not seen that legendary film, but from what I've heard since then I imagine Friedkin was after something very different aesthetically. Maybe that's why the credits say Sorcerer (a very good and appropriate title, I think) is based on the original novel, and is only dedicated to Clouzot. There's still a strong existentialist undercurrent to it, but of an American rather than the French variety (even at their most alienated, French existentialists really have to force themselves to look like they wouldn't enjoy a sharing a half bottle of Calvados in a tabac somewhere). Friedkin's four are really all alone.Some of the other criticisms expressed in some of the comments here may be correct so far as they go, but the bottom line is that the film has stuck very firmly in my mind. I think the four vignettes at the beginning work quite well, and are similar formally to the set ups at the beginning of the French Connection and the Exorcist. Without them, I don't see how the later scenes would have the power that they do. When he switches to the mining camp, Friedkin wants you to be totally jarred by seeing these four men in such an abruptly different, and degraded, setting, and it works. It's as though something has been stripped away from them and you're only now seeing the reality; before, you only saw the people they thought they were.Maybe I was just a sucker for high impact visuals back then, but I still think the conpositions in Sorcerer are superb. The pacing just picks up and gets tighter and tighter as the picture moves on, and if the last 30 seconds don't make it, that's OK for now because I don't remember them.Curious that Sorcerer was panned and bombed when it came out, because I suspect it holds up a hell of a lot better than the Exorcist, which struck me when I saw it again a few years ago as unintentional self parody, not much less nuttily campy than Mark Robson's Valley of the Dolls. You could almost call Sorcerer a return to form. Possibly people found the title puzzling, although again I think it works. Possibly Scheider was too subdued a presence for audiences and a Steve McQueen would have given it the shot of star power that Montand reportedly gave Wages of Fear. But I somehow remember this as being an almost dialogless movie; what there was was hardly even needed, and Friedkin clearly wanted to tell a story where nature overwhelms the characters, not the usual Hollywood triumph of the human (most definitely what it would have been, with McQueen). In that respect, Scheider was just fine.See this one in a theater, for sure. And keep the positive comments coming; maybe Friedkin will treat us to a nice new print one of these days, or even a Director's Cut?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie pales in comparison with the 1952 French version, "The Wages of Fear." It relies too heavily on special effects to tell the story rather than on human relationships, as one sees with the original. Since there is hardly any character development in "Sorcerer," it is impossible to develop any warmth or sympathy for the characters. Likewise, the characters never develop anything resembling a bond between them, as one sees in the original, and as one would expect to happen between people who must depend solely on one another to stay alive.There is none of the existential philosophy of the human condition in "Sorcerer" that one finds all throughout the "The Wages of Fear." There is none of the compassion for the many permutations that a personality takes on in times of desperation. In "Sorcerer" we only see cartoonish machismo.Very disappointing overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a worthy successor to "The Exorcist". In an alternate universe, this gritty thriller would have topped the box office and brought crowds to the theatres in 1977. But the studio didn't market it. No one saw it. The movie everyone saw instead that years was "Star Wars". That movie cost $11 million dollars to make. "Sorcerer" cost $12 million dollars to make. I sincerely regret not knowing about the film and trying to see it on the big screen. My first exposure to this film was when it debuted on a cable movie channel in the 1990s. At first, I was convinced that I had screwed up searching the TV listings, because the beginning of this film includes a sequence shot in France, starring French actors, and spoken entirely in French. This didn't fit in the synopsis of the movie I read: 4 desperate men are hired to move explosives through the jungle. Based on a classic foreign film "Wages of Fear", which I was able to see in a revival theatre, there is a story setup that pushes the tension and almost dares you the audience to live through the experience. The movie begins immediately with a murder, without any setup or dialogue. The movie abruptly cuts to another country and three new characters who commit a terrorist attack. I mention one word as the title of this review, and that is "Riveting". William Friedkin, with a background in documentary filmmaking, directs this sequence with an immediacy that feels real. He achieved this with great success in "The French Connection". Using hand-held style of cinematography, Friedkin popularized this style that has seen a resurgence in recent years (Bourne films). The French sequence I mentioned has a completely different timbre, as if we switched the channel to another movie with another director. Credit Friedkin for creating a provocative opening sequence that can challenge an audience, and which they find their reward for following the unorthodox setup of the story. I am reminded of the opening sequence of "The Exorcist", which approaches the story with seemingly detached characters, and allows the audience to be intelligent enough to fit the pieces together later. The fourth sequence returns to New York, and almost feels like an deleted scene from "The French Connection", complete with car chase. Here, we also recognise Roy Scheider, the costar of "The French Connection". Except he is now on the opposite side of the law. Nevertheless, Scheider now is the central character of the film, and it his charisma that is necessary to carry the film through the rough ride ahead. Scheider always has been a good guy character and well liked by audiences. He carries "Jaws" very well. His tough guy role in "Marathon Man" also was memorable. Friedkin makes a deliberate decision to minimise the dialogue in this film, instead letting the action tell the story for us. With the first act setting up the four main characters, the last being Roy Scheider, now on the run from the mob, we the audience are given the setup as Scheider is told his fate. He is getting on a boat to (presumably) Latin America or South America. An unnamed village in a third world country, through a montage of shots of fantastic cinematography, reveals that it is a corrupt government with a militant leader, and a poor population working for a western oil company. Again, all this exposition is told without a spoken word. There is also a deft approach to the story setting up the oil field explosion. Special care by the filmmakers makes sure each character in the films feels pressure. From the oil field foreman who must keep the quota, to the local police that must manage rioting workers, to the very survival of our four main characters who have bounties on their heads. The four men are hired to move very volatile explosives to the oil field (the explosives are used to snuff out the flame). Again, the setup of the macguffin, the explosives, is done expertly and causes the audience to twitch, knowing that the slightest slip could cause the nitroglycerin to blow up. As I mentioned, it is at this point that Friedkin dares the audience to live through the experience, as the explosives are driven along a crumbling mountain road that also encounters rivers and jungles. Watching these trucks navigate almost impossible driving conditions is nerve wrecking. Just when you think the truck has negotiated a formidable obstacle, a group of banditos or something else gets in the way. Watching this film for the first time in a few years (I deliberately held off until I could watch the Blu Ray copy), I was thoroughly entertained at this masterfully constructed thriller. This films should be considered a classic, by way of how expertly the story was told through new but yet entertaining and effective methods. Your heart pounds almost through your chest at times. I was even entertained when we learn the fate of Scheider at the end of the film. A film that successfully maintains tension from almost the very beginning should end the story with something to twist the knot even tighter. I give this film an 8, a kind of film achievement that can't be duplicated (even though plans have been made for another remake).</fullReview>

The original book is "The Wages of Fear", and the film was released under this title in some territories. I suspect that if it had this title today, it might be better remembered. A name like "Sorcerer" clearly suggests a fantasy film, which this is not.That major hurdle aside, it is a good movie and a very ambitious one. With four different prologues, a casual viewer might gt lost or bored or just not know what to think. It pays off as the story progresses, however, and we get a film that is a war movie, a mob movie, an action thriller... it has a little something for everyone.</fullReview>

An Energetic Movie with the Demanding Director at His Best. It Ranks with His "The Exorcist" (1973) and "The French Connection" (1971) as one of the Best Films of the 1970's. Friedkin Considers it His Most Accomplished Work.Accomplished, For Sure. He and the Crew Suffered Greatly bringing this Masterpiece of the Surreal to the Screen. A Film Craftsman at Work that Sweated and Labored to bring His Vision Home in all of its Grimy and Gritty Glory.Films Like "Aguirre, the Wrath of God" (1972) and "Apocalypse Now" (1979) are Infamous concerning the Trials and Excesses of Possessed Directors and this one Reminds of both. It had a Hubris of Hollywood Success Paving the Way for Friedkin to let loose and take almost Dictatorial Control of the Project. What Results is a Crackling and Visceral Descent Into Hell for the Criminal Characters and the Audience. Analogous and Angry and at times a totally Unwashed Display of Capitalism's Control Over Third-World Countries and Their Despairing Populace. One of the Greatest Unknown, Unseen Films ever. Roy Scheider and an International Cast all Add to the Film's Otherworldly and Etherical Appeal. Although it's Not an Appealing Film in a Lot of Ways by Design. The Film is a Sweaty, Bleak, and Horrific View of Desperate People Caught in a Limbo of Barely Survival Conditions. See this Forgotten Film to See who Survives. It's Not a Very Pretty Picture but the Movie is One Pretty Picture if You can Call Hell a Pretty Picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By remaking 'The wages of fear',William Friedkin achieved what no other American director could even dream of.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing which one can say about Sorcerer is that it would remain a true 'auteur' film in every sense of the word. It allowed its director William Friedkin to depict an absolutely 100% indigenous American version of the French writer Georges Arnaud's famous book 'Wages of fear'. It is known far and wide that every intelligent world cinema fan knows that this film has been compared with its French counterpart 'Le Salaire De La Peur'/The wages of fear. However, both critics and viewers need to understand that both films were made in different circumstances, represented different cultures and were seen by different audiences. Hence, it would not only be illogical but also ridiculous to compare them. Some more points need to be noted before attempting to carry out a critical analysis of 'Sorcerer'. It is believed to be more accessible to global audiences as it was shot in color as opposed to Clouzot's 'The wages of Fear' which was shot by DOP Armand Thirard in pristine black and white. Its cast is as prolific as that of Clouzot's film. Lastly, in many ways, Sorcerer concern for its protagonists is slightly more than that of Clouzot's classic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorcerer is raw - but it is the essence of that word: it presents us with an unfiltered, brutal view of the world. It is the world as it is intended to be seen, stripped of politics, class, norms and standards.This "stripping" Friedkin conducts for the audience is linked to the subversive nature of this masterwork. We have 4 men who are anti- heroes in the strict sense and maybe something more - they are exemplars of the ultimate cynics of modern society, they are criminals and killers. And once their cynicism - or rather, rebellion - leads them on a path of negating any and all utility they might still retain in their worlds, they flee to a symbolic land, off the grid and beyond the radar of those norms and standards they have already rejected, we see them in a different light. Criminals and killers take another form.The 4 pariahs in 'our' world (capitalist, Western, etc.) become 4 supermen in the 'other' world (the victim of that capitalist, Western world).Hence, human nature as a concept is nullified yet also strangely edified and exalted for its uncompromising authenticity in remaining fluid.Really spectacular piece of work with a perfect cast and soundtrack. Gritty yet majestic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't mention the tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was doubly skeptical about this movie before watching it. I absolutely hated the original Wages of Fear. I bought the Criterion DVD way back in 2000 after hearing many good things about it but the tension just wasn't there. I thought I was missing something. When I heard about Sorcerer (thanks to a brief parody in the Mr. Plow episode of the Simpsons) I looked it up and learned about its terrible release history and assumed it was a stinker. Now, all these years later, William Friedkin has fully restored his lost treasure and presents it to us once more without the threat of George Lucas stealing his audience.It's a slow-burn movie that initially feels a lot like the Exorcist in that several plot threads in different parts of the world are established first before being tied together in the second act. Four desperate men stuck in a South American peasant village agree to drive trucks filled with volatile nitro-glycerine to an oil fire 218 miles away. It's a suicide mission fraught with danger and peril. Leader Jackie Scanlon/Juan Dominguez (played by the ever-vulnerable and haunted Roy Scheider) is a lowlife from Queens hiding from a mob boss, and his comrades are a French stock swindler, a Palestinian bomber, and a rodent-like assassin. Together they make for a quartet as nervous and unstable as the explosives they are transporting.William Friedkin's jungle is full of lush darkness and menace. One bump in the dirt road could lead to disaster. The rivers rage, the wind and rain batters the windshields, and every other corner disintegrates beneath them. One standout scene involves the trucks slowly inching across a derelict rope bridge as the wooden boards splinter to pieces under the wheels.It's better than Wages of Fear, but what is up with that title? No matter how much Friedkin argues that it was a good choice...it's not. Sorcerer is a title that kills this movie as it has virtually nothing to do with anything. So it's the name of one of the trucks, so what? That's like calling Speed "2525" or calling First Blood "That Army Truck He Drives For A Bit". The word Sorcerer has absolutely nothing to do with anything and if you look for a deeper reason you are not going to find it. Friedkin is wrong about this title. It's a stupid, stupid choice and no doubt one of the many reasons why this film was a box office bomb. They should have just called it Wages of Fear. Friedkin doesn't really consider it to be a remake, more of a loose reinterpretation, and it's not like American audiences would have even been aware back in those days at the French original was something of an obscure flick in 1977.That's not to say that there isn't anything deeper to be found in the film, it's just that the title has nothing to do with it. Sorcerer is an existentialist nightmare that's about as close to Cronenberg as Friedkin will ever get. The huge close-ups of sweaty tormented faces, the slowly-building mental breakdowns, the hostile, creeping jungle surrounding and containing us ? it's not the exotic adventure that Thomas Cook promise, it's a place you don't want to be.Friedkin made Sorcerer at the height of his creative freedom and stands as a perfect example, and as a warning, of how good and of how expensive a talented director's vision can be. Is it indulgent? Sure. But it's also a labor of love, this wage of fear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The wages of fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard about Sorcerer for decades. Film connoisseurs have raved about this film especially as it concerns a remake that is not a remake but a re-imagining that is equal to the original 'Wages of fear.'However I cannot recall the film ever being shown on British television, there exists a poor DVD version that the director has disowned and is only been recently been made available in a restored Blu Ray version which does justice to this forgotten epic.The film flopped at the box office as it was released in America at the same time as Star Wars. The title Sorcerer gives an image of a mystical flirtation when it is actually the name of one of the trucks.William Friedkin starts his films in different quarters of the globe as we have sequences in Mexico, France, Israel and the USA as we are introduced to our characters and we have prolonged sequences with subtitles. A fraudulent banker, an Arab terrorist, a Mexican hit-man and a low rent gangster who robbed the mob end up in a rat hole in South America where people go to get lost and work for an American oil company that brings jobs however a fire means that the four men have to bring dynamite from 200 miles away and cross dangerous terrain that could see them being blown up as two trucks are used to make this journey.Like Werner Herzhog would do several years later in Fitzcarraldo, Friedkin has to set up an environment in South America that is a challenge for the production as its for our antagonists on screen. The bridge sequence as the trucks try to pass a dishevelled bridge will make you squirm.This film deserves a re-appraisal and needs to be widely shown. It is a forgotten classic of the 1970s cinema and in my opinion is better than Friedkin's Exorcist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Friedkin's 'Sorcerer' is a grim, dirty, visceral experience and descent into the bowels of hell for four criminals. After the introduction of why each character fled their home countries for some Central American impoverished dictatorship, we are taken right into a remote village in the middle of a hot, humid, and dangerous jungle. These four men, one an assassin, one a robber, one a terrorist, and one a financial thief, live in squalid conditions with the other poor peasants trying to eek out a living by being paid sub-par wages doing dangerous work for a nearby cavalier American oil company. When there's an explosion at the oil well, the company needs to transport volatile nitroglycerin there in order to blow up the raging fire and seal the well. Our four shady protagonists volunteer to drive two trucks over 200 miles on unpaved roads through a rain forest to transport the nitroglycerin there in return for a substantial amount of money.What follows next in this masterful remake of the French film 'Wages of Fear', is one of the darkest films in American cinema as the characters experience one dangerous obstacle after another, while simultaneously going mad as the journey becomes more and more perilous. The suspense that Friedkin creates throughout this terrifying journey is incredible with the bridge sequence, in particular, being as suspenseful as anything Hitchcock ever did. By the end of the picture the audience is as emotionally drained (if not physically) as the survivor(s) on this slow descent into hell. Is their dangerous trip punishment for the sins they committed? Perhaps, but perhaps not, in traditional Friedkin style he gives his audience no easy answers and instead poses questions about life and death and morality that I was left pondering long after the credits rolled. Give this film a look after seeing the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William Friedkin at His Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a great film. I can't wait for this film to be released this April of 2014 on Bluray. Ignored during its initial release in 1977, the film has been slowly rediscovered by audiences and now hailed by the same critics who hated it.This film is a masterpiece. It's ironic that the film is more relevant today with its theme and story then back in 77. Roy Scheider turned in an Oscar winning performance that was also ignored. The cinematography? Stunning and breath taking. The music? Unconventional and daring. The Friedkin? at the top of his game. His 3rd Masterpiece in row with French Connection and The Exorcist. We need more films like Sorcerer today.The bluray is the best print of Sorcerer ever made. Guaranteed. Some scenes appear as if they were just shot yesterday. The colors are vivid, appropriately saturated, sharp, natural, and gritty, although the jungle green might be too green. The sound mix is absolutely perfect. What the bluray lacks is an audio commentary and extras, which Friedkin stated in a tweet of April last year that will accompany the bluray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four men grapple with themselves, equipment, nature and fate to transport explosives to an oil fire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a show "Sorcerer" is! Unbelievable. There are scenes filmed in here that look impossible. There are trucks crossing narrow bridges of rotting timbers and trucks crossing swaying and decrepit rope bridges in driving rain. There are a number of explosions that look absolutely real. The sweat and dirt and mud on the actors' faces and bodies are real. There are mob scenes that look totally genuine. The location work, some in Dominican Republic and Mexico, is stunning.Forget the title altogether. Forget the fact that this movie bombed at the box office. There are large numbers of famous and excellent neo-noirs that have very low grosses. This is a superb movie directed by William Friedkin. He dedicated it to Clouzot, and it is another version of "The Wages of Fear", and a riveting one.The setup of the movie shows us 4 men, each of whom has reason, rooted in criminality and their being pursued, to have fled their native lands and taken new and precarious identities in a semi-tropical land. They work for an oil company and they are trapped as much as if they were in a prison. These 4 win the job of transporting explosives through 218 miles of jungle and back country to a raging oil well fire. This is their chance of getting passports and a stake.Their trip is man vs. equipment, man vs. nature, man vs. man, man vs. decay, man vs. robbers, man vs. fate. You name it and they face it.Roy Scheider is tough and magnetic, as usual. Bruno Cremer is a recognizable French actor, veteran of French films for over 50 years. He is shrewd and ready to take the risks. Francisco Rabal had been acting in films since 1946, and his career lasted to 2002. He plays a sinister assassin, but such a man has a skill with a gun that may come in handy. Amidou was less well-known, playing a former Arab terrorist. These 4 embark on the perilous trip.What we see on the screen is as powerful or more powerful than "Aguirre, The Wrath of God" (1972), and that is a very powerful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Apocalypse Now" with trucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hot on the heels of his success with "The Exorcist" (1973), William Friedkin decided to do a remake of the 1953 French film "The Wages of Fear". The project took years of preparation and almost a year to film, mostly in the jungles of the Dominican Republic. The production was so hampered by problems that just getting it shot was a huge accomplishment.Unfortunately "Sorcerer" was released one month after "Star Wars" in 1977 and it couldn't compete with the mass hysteria of that film, which signified the debut of blockbuster-oriented cinema and the demise of the New Hollywood movement that more or less started with "Bonnie and Clyde" in 1967.Aside from the competition of "Star Wars", there were two other factors that prevented "Sorcerer" from appealing to movie-goers at large: The first fifteen minutes featured foreign languages with English subtitles and North Americans were turned-off by what they thought was a foreign film. Secondly, the title was misleading. This was the next film by the maker of the popular "The Exorcist" and it was called "Sorcerer", but there's nothing conventionally supernatural about the film at all; it's a gritty adventure-suspense flick, not horror. (We'll look at why the film's called "Sorcerer" below).THE PLOT: Four men from around the world -- a Latin assassin, an Arab terrorist, a French extortionist and a New Jersey gangster -- are exiled in a poverty-stricken remote village in South American whose economy is reliant on an American oil company. After an explosion at the oil well, the company enlists the four outcasts to transfer nitroglycerin to the well in order to put out the fire. It's a suicide mission because the nitro is unstable, the jungle terrain is rough and it's a 218 mile journey, but they're so desperate for the the high wages (of fear) they have no choice but to take it."Apocalypse Now" was being shot when "Sorcerer" was released in '77 so it obviously didn't rip "Sorcerer" off, but there are similarities: Both films had long, expensive and troubled shoots deep in the jungle and their plots deal with long jungle journeys, the former takes place on a boat up a river and the latter on two trucks over wild frontier "roads". Also, coming from the same era and the same cinematic movement -- the aforementioned New Hollywood -- they have the same gritty, surreal feel."Apocalypse Now" is the superior film only because it focused on character development and was more epic in nature. The main problem with "Sorcerer" is that the first act establishes the four main characters as criminal dirtbags and so it's hard to care about them later on. The fact that you do start to root for the gangster, the extortionist and the Arab is testimony to the film's quality. These are desperate men forced into a extremely hazardous situation.The best part of the movie, of course, is the second half, which focuses on the long journey. It's rough &amp; wild and hampered by one serious obstacle after another. How they got those two piece-of-junk trucks across that hanging rope/wood bridge I'll never know.The surreal score by Tangerine Dream is very effective in establishing the film's desperate ambiance.There's a funny scene in the second act where Roy Scheider's character gazes at a billboard in a saloon. It features a hot babe on the beach with a bottle of Coke, but that's the closest he's gonna get to either in that Latin sh**hole.About the name of the movie, "Sorcerer" is actually the name of one of the two trucks, which is painted on the hood in French. But this only reflects the surface meaning. I used to interpret the deeper meaning as a reference to the miracle (or magic) that the men figuratively concoct in delivering the dynamite on a suicide mission. This interpretation is legitimate, but Friedkin said he actually named it "Sorcerer" in reference to the evil wizard of fate, which people supposedly have no control over. The grotesque idol-like face we see at the opening of the film and later along the jungle road presumably represent this sorcerer of fate.My wife objected to one aspect of the ending, but it ties into the whole "evil wizard of fate" theme, as well as the biblical "your sin shall find you out", "you reap what you sow" and "he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword".We all know the four men are allegorically in hell, is it possible that they're in literal hell or purgatory, at least Roy Scheider's character? After the car wreck some strange man appears and tells him, "They're gone." As he stumbles away from the wreckage it's odd that the police don't see him. Did he die in the car wreck? Is he a ghost at this point?After his hellish experiences delivering the nitro he thinks he's free, but it's clear that his past has caught up with him. This could be an endless tormenting cycle (hell) or perhaps purgatorial in nature.Friedkin may insist that "Sorcerer" is a straight adventure thriller, but the supernatural undertones -- including the title -- point to a metaphysical interpretation. It may have been a subconscious thing. The film runs 121 minutes.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mrs Pimpin returns after a stint at home. Mrs.Pimpin: Pimpin, what did you do when I was at my home?Pimpin: I watched this movie called Sorcerer.Mrs.Pimpin: Are you sure you did not get drunk? I checked the Smirnoff bottle in the cupboard. It was half full when I left. Now its almost gone.Pimpin: Ulp! What? No way. I didn't touch the bottle at all. It was at the same level when you left.Mrs.Pimpin: Then why do the pillows smell faintly of vomit? Are you OK?Pimpin: You are hallucinating, baby. Sometimes pillow covers smell that way when they have been in the cupboard for a long time. I swear I was watching this movie called Sorcerer.Mrs. Pimpin: How was it?Pimpin: It was awesome. Its by the guy who made The Exorcist.Mrs. Pimpin: Oh yes, I remember we watched Exorcist together. Demon Pazuzu was scary. You scared the hell out of me once when you imitated Pazuzu after you got drunk. Anyway, is this a horror movie?Pimpin: Not at all. But Pazuzu does make a few appearances in the form of a carving. His presence can be felt in the film at various points. The film takes place in this multicultural melting pot in some Latin American country.Mrs. Pimpin: Oh! Is it like Babel?Pimpin: Well, it did remind me of Babel. The exploitation and helplessness of the wretched of this earth is one of the themes of this film. But it is rendered without any of Innaritu's irritating humanitarianism. Friedkin does not portray the poor and the wretched in very good light. Its about a bunch of people from different backgrounds volunteering for a dangerous mission.Mrs.Pimpin: Oh OK. So it is a men on a mission movie?Pimpin: Yes, sort of. But it is more like Apocalypse Now than say The Dirty Dozen. In fact, it released a couple of years before Apocalypse Now. I wonder if Coppola was inspired by this film. It has the same sweaty atmospheric vibe where these four men undertake a ridiculous and deadly mission fighting the vagaries of nature, themselves and each other.Mrs. Pimpin: OK. Who is acting in it?Pimpin: It has Roy Schnieder who worked with Friedkin in another crime film called The French Connection. Im not a big fan of his. But it has this great French actor called Bruno Cremer. I was not aware of him. He owned this film. The two other lead actors were quite tough looking too.Mrs. Pimpin: How were the action scenes?Pimpin: Absolutely spectacular. Some of the best hands on action sequences ever filmed. Even better than Deliverance. It also has this terrorist blast that shocks the hell out of you due to some amazing sound effects of the screams of the victims.Mrs. Pimpin: I'm surprised you haven't spoken about the background score.Pimpin: Oh yes. I already downloaded it. The film has a very eerie sounding electronic score by this band called Tangerine Dream.Mrs. Pimpin: Jeez! So you will be playing it in the car from now on?Pimpin: Er, yeah.Mrs. Pimpin: So where does Pazuzu feature in all of this?Pimpin: Like I said, there is a carving of Pazuzu at the beginning of the film. And even the front of the trucks driven by the men look a lot like Pazuzu. Its almost as if there is some sort of devilish force driving these men to undertake this mission. These are not ordinary working class men. They are terrorists, assassins, bankers and thieves who have taken refuge in this Latin American country. Louis Ferdinand's quote - "It's not the good Lord who rules, it's the devil. Man and Nature's disgusting, just look at it, bird life, animal life." came to mind while watching this film.Mrs. Pimpin: OK. I don't think I want to watch this.Pimpin: I insist that you do. Come on man, I watched Prem Ratan Dhan Payo with you last weekend.Mrs. Pimpin: OK then. You would watch it a second time?Pimpin: Absolutely.</fullReview>

"How did the oil rig fire start?""The rig blew up, but that isn't important," he says. "The important thing is that these four guys are driving across a South American jungle in two dilapidated trucks that they rebuilt themselves. They're each carrying enough nitroglycerin to leave only tiny bits of their huge lorries lying on the ground when it explodes, and the nitro is more than likely to explode because it has been sitting in the jungle for a long time. You like it?"I decide to approach it from another angle because I still didn't fully understand the hook. "How did these four men end up in this position?""That's not important. They just end up somewhere in South America working for an oil company. If you really need to develop them, just make one a terrorist in Jerusalem, one a mobster from Jersey, one an assassin from Vera Cruz, and the last a banker from Paris. Everything else will come together around the drive through the jungle.""Do they make it?" I ask."Yes, and no." he answers. "One makes it, but it looks like he dies anyway.I guess I wasn't getting it, but I decided, 'What the hell?' and threw a bunch of money at the kids. Enough money so that they could film on location and make one hell of a movie about driving through the jungle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of outcasts from different backgrounds/nationalities are forced by misfortune to work in a remote drilling operation in South America. When fire breaks out of control, four of the outcasts are given the opportunity to earn enough money to get out by transporting six crates of unstable dynamite through miles of jungle in two ancient trucks. Will they succeed and regain their honour and citizenship, or die for their efforts?....Friedkin in my opinion is a genius. Yes, he has had a few blips (The Guardian, The Hunted), but for fifty decades, he has made some really exciting and important movies.The seventies: The Exorcist and The French Connection.The Eighties: Cruising and To Live and Dies in LA.The Nineties: Jade was okayThe Noughties: BugThis decade gave us Killer Joe.Sorcerer is a very different kind of film. Like Apocalypse Now, it's one mans journey against the impossible, and the casting of Schieder is very good, and i'm glad Eastwood and Nicholson were busy, as this would have been an entire different movie.The first two acts are a perfect build up for the honey pot here, the moving of the explosive material to another place, and in one scene, Fitzcarraldo comes to mind, with the bridge and the truck.It's all tense psychedelic stuff, with deleted footage featured in flashbacks, and a really gritty feel to it.It's the the anti Convoy, and seeing it was rated PG originally just makes the whole thing more bonkers.Not a classic, but interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorcerer is one of those films that I'd kind of heard about but never quite got round to seeing mostly because I don't recall it ever being on TV in the UK and it not being available at the local DVD store.It is a real slice of gritty realism looking at the seamier side of life and the realities that a lot of people face. Most of the characters in the film are very negative and it a slightly depressing film for this reason but don't let that put you off.I enjoyed it mostly because it's so different to films being made now, where so much of the agenda is more concerned with not offending people rather than telling a story.The film does look slightly dated, which is not surprising given that it's over 30 years old, but it is still an interesting look at what life is like in a South American country that is totally corrupt.The title of the film is wholly inappropriate but, like one other poster said earlier, it was an obvious trade in on the director's success with the Exorcist.</fullReview>

But when the story does get going, it is one of the finest thrillers ever filmed. The sequence on the bridge is worth the price of admission by itself. The score by Tangerine Dream is also one of the highlights. This film likely bombed at the box office because by the late 70s films were beginning to be dumbed down for the MTV generation and because the film title was very misleading.

		<fullReview>Four men end up as drivers transporting unstable dynamite through the jungles of South America in two ramshackle trucks. A mob had set fire to the oil wells and the boss needs the dynamite transported over 200 miles. Nilo (Francisco Rabal) is a killer from Vera Cruz, Mexico. Kassem (Amidou) is an Arab terrorists on the run after setting a bomb off in Jerusalem. Victor Manzon (Bruno Cremer) is a Frenchman accused of fraud. Jackie Scanlon (Roy Scheider) is the getaway driver of a gang that wounded a priest that turned out to be the brother of a mafia leader. Just before departing, the Jewish Nilo kills driver Marquez who is presumably a Nazi and they take Nilo on as the replacement.Director William Friedkin remakes, reinterprets, reimagines, or re-whatevers the classic 'The Wages of Fear'. IMO it starts off badly and slowly trying to show the four vignettes of the four men. Simple flashbacks or just talking about their past would be more compelling. The four vignettes confuse matters and takes away the pacing from the opening act. Opening a month after 'Star Wars' didn't help matters either. Also the title is all wrong with people expecting something like 'The Exorcist'. Even the trailer seems to suggest a supernatural theme to the movie. This is more like a foreign language art film that turns into a big action thriller in the second half. It is also one of the first sacrificial lamb to the era of the Hollywood blockbusters. The movie gets more interesting about 30 to 45 minutes in. It is a big production and Friedkin knows how to build tension. The drive over the bridge is insane. The location is muddy and grimy. It's sort of a drive into the heart of darkness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only saw this film cos of the Tangerine Dream soundtrack (in actual fact most of the tracks off the album aren't in the film) and was surprised that it was quite a good film. I haven't seen or heard of the original Wages Of Fear but am now on the lookout for it as it is apparently infinitely better than this version and this version is great. Special effects are quite good too. The scene where they are trying to get the truck over the broken bridge was a killer. Only thing is, when I ordered Sorcerer, I had no idea what it was about. In 'The Exorcist', what is the one thing you would expect to have in the film? An Exorcist perhaps? Yeah, I have no idea what possessed (ahem) Friedkin to call it Sorcerer, even towards the end I was still expecting a sorcerer to jump out. Anyway it's available on DVD although region 1 only, and it's worth getting. I bought mine on Ebay, brand new and had it shipped to UK from US for $20 all in. Oh, and the Tangerine Dream soundtrack is absolutely fantastic too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a highly underrated foray into character driven non-dialogue reliant movie making. Intense would be the word most people use to describe this film after seeing it, and there is certainly every reason for that. While it borders on being over the top at times, for the most part, this film somehow remains believable and realistic. The story (don't worry I won't reveal details) begins with four very distinct men from four very distinct parts of the world. Each of them ends up in a very bad situation in their own country, and they are forced to flee to a horrible South American looking third-world jungle. Once there, their only chance to get out is to go on an extremely dangerous mission for the local oil conglomerate. You may think I've already revealed too much, but trust me I haven't. Unlike today's modern thrillers with all their slapped on twists and turns, this movie goes straight ahead the entire time. The power of it comes from a mix of excellent acting and incredibly shot action scenes. And when I say action scenes I don't mean some shoot-em up junk from a bad Arnold movie, I mean actual action. This movie is unlike just about anything else out there and even if you end up thinking it was too over the top, trust me it is still worth a look.</fullReview>

The four men to try and accomplish this are Roy Scheider, Bruno Cremer, Francisco Rabal, and Amidou.The photography is superb and the story involving these men and their nearly impossible task of somehow making it through such heavy ordeals as damaged elderly bridges, bad weather &amp; muddy swampy earth will have your stomach tied in knots. The sequence regarding the swinging bridge immersed in a battlefield of unfriendly rain is a harrowing highlight as is how these characters will get along with each other so that they can make it to their destination. The overall power of the film hinges on those very difficulties that occur to our characters.A major work of unheralded greatness that should be appreciated more than it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>:"Sorcerer" retells the story of Clouzot's classic b&amp;w "Salaire" in vivid color, and ultimately triumphs, not by a slavish re-capitulation, but through a provocative distorted reflect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw the French "Wages of Fear" as a child home from school sick with the flu, running a fever, and remembered the plot forever. It made a real impression on me in many ways. I fell in love with Vera Clouzot and seemed to experience the desperation of the characters first hand. Later I enjoyed the music of Tangerine Dream and found the Sorcerer soundtrack vinyl in a used record store. I liked the cover, but I thought the music was so dark and depressing that I thought that I have to see this film. It didn't add up; the title didn't match the cover and the music seemed like such a challenge, and so inaccessible. I was curious. Years later, I found the film on VHS and saw it, and immediately called it my favorite film of all time, and also recognized the plot as the same of that French film I saw as a child. Since then I've seen each flick a few times, and personally I prefer the Sorcerer over Salaire de la Peur. It has always been my theory that the Sorcerer in the Friedkin film is the truck that survives to the bitter end. This is one of the elements that I find more satisfying. The trucks in the film have the most incredible unique physical characters and stand as allegorical figures in the plot. The story, as the original proves, is a morality tale, and works on many levels. This is one thing that makes this film superior to most others; It doesn't just tell a good story in a slick way: It makes you think for a long time. Sorcerer works even better when you see the French original. Both films are excellent, and they are both so different. Sorcerer really portrays bitter ugliness and selfish motivation transcending itself through a fascinating obstacle course that forces a tetrahedron of antagonistic personalities into a bizarre semblance of teamwork where individuals end up contributing to success of the "mission" where cooperation would seem highly improbable. Many people find the story depressing. Deep down the movie is uplifting and optimistic. The story of Tangerine Dream's score is interesting. Liner notes indicate that it was composed without seeing the film, and only a script. In reality TD used the title as a starting point. The music is not outstanding, but it gives the film a creepy feel, that adds a lot. I must say, that I was dissappointed with Vera Clouzot's counterpart in Sorcerer. I was expecting a buxom supermodel Hollywood style vamp, but you get the worst imaginable whore instead. Well, it's right to have her that way. Friedkin's film is more believable that Clouzot's. For one thing, the physical obstacles themselves are believable, and the ingenious ways they are overcome, while bordering on the miraculous, are still pulled of in a physical reality, whereas the original's treatment of nitro (a recent treatment is in the film "Vertical Limit") is flawed, for example. This film is essential viewing. Sorcerer has many sterling moments. I like Scheider's portrayal of futile anger against the jungle, and his despair, so real and sympathetic to watch. My favorite obstacle, is of course, the bridge. This scene makes the chariot race of Ben Hur look wanting. Enough. See the movie again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that perhaps I have seen this movie more than any other. I first saw it 20 years ago in the theater and I will never forget it. The first 20 minutes leads up to where all the characters are going. Then we have that awful place where they live. I have never seen a location made to look so disgusting. This is a real "dog eat dog" movie. Then we have that incredible truck trip to the well fire. I even bought the soundtrack album at the time from Tangerine Dream. I wish that the english speaking version of the Wages of Fear that it was based on were available.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood remakes of European classics usually disappoint. But I thought if this was 50% as good as "The Wages of Fear" it would be worth watching. Even if it was only 10% as good.Sorcerer is abysmal. "The Wages?" mixed human suffering, posturing and pathos with friendship, warmth and rich humanity. Sorcerer is only suffering with horrible characters that you can't relate to. You won't give a damn about a single one of them. The action and suspense isn't even as good. Surely that was one area that could have excelled. (With the exception of a particular scene which wasn't even shown in Wages, only the aftermath.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have three really good actors, Roy Scheider(excellent in "All That Jazz"(1979) directed by Bob Fosse), Bruno Cremer and Francisco Rabal(excellent in "Viridiana"(1961) directed by Luis Bunuel). We also have an exceptional director, William Friedkin, who made "The French Connection" (1971) and "The Exorcist"(1973). And an old screenplay, made film before by Henri-Georges Clouzot, with Yves Montand, Peter van Eyck, Charles Vanel and Folco Lulli. The original is better, Friedkin's film is... deadly boring. Even the music signed Tangerine Dream did not save anything. Only for the lovers of jungle scenery and the fans of the actors and the director William Friedkin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Friedkin remakes Wages of Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has developed the reputation of the greatest re-make ever committed to celluloid. It might just be that. A reimagining of a favorite work of mine, the '50s French film Wages of Feat, it offers a particularly American interpretation on the story of exiles driving deadly explosive chemicals through the treacherous hills of South America. Where the French film was about the broodingly existentialist nature of all individual human interaction faced with eminent death, the American remake is about the ways that living life as anything other than a capitalist tool leads to death under this system. It's characters are Hollywood super-men... until they acknowledge that something beyond profit motivates them. When they realist that, they are destroyed. An amoral masterpiece of the capitalist system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those noble failures that great directors endure after much success...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wiliam Friedkin's SORCERER was a flop when it was first released in 1977. One reason surely had to be the impossibly high expectations of both critics and audiences. Friedkin's prior films were the Oscar winning THE FRENCH CONNECTION and the mega box-office hit THE EXORCIST and hopes for a cinematic hat-trick were in the air. Another reason for the film's failure is that it's not a terribly good movie. A film of the Georges Arnaud novel had already been filmed by Henri-Georges Clouzot in 1953 and was already very much a solid classic by the time Friedkin decided to make his version. When plans to cast the likes of Marcello Mastroianni, Steve McQueen and Lino Ventura fell through, Friedkin "settled" for Roy Scheider, Bruno Cremer and Francisco Rabal, all fine actors but none with particularly electrifying screen personalities. None of these actors make us believe they each have a life or death reason to be in the situation they're in. Casting woes aside, the film, despite it's inflammatory scenario (pun intended) consisting of a group of disparate types hauling a load of nitroglycerin through the treacherous mountains of South America, is slow to start with long back stories (that smack of padding), very few thrills and little real suspense. The synth score by the wildly over-rated Tangerine Dream adds little. On the plus side, the production design by John Box IS astounding and the cinematography by Dick Bush is excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but not a good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, as many reviewers have already remarked, this is a remake of a glorious french movie, "Le salaire de la peure", "The Wages of Fear", 1953, by the extraordinary Clouzot, based on the same novel by Georges Arnault. A good remake? I have many doubts. I must admit that it was not an easy task, having to compete with "monsters" like Ives Montand, Folco Lulli, Peter Van Eyck, Charles Vanel, but there is no way that the actors in "Sorcerer" can attain that level. Francisco Rabal, for instance, never seems to understand where he is and what he is doing. Even the narration here and there is clumsy. If you already know which (more or less) will be the end, very little suspense remains. And you can not in any way compare the tragic, almost Wagnerian finale by Clouzot with the arrival of the 2 ugly Mafiosos. In any case, if you have not seen the masterly Clouzot movie, you can enjoy also this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's not even good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It bears comparison with the Cluzot's film.I don't know which film is more attached to the original book, but the Friedkin's plot doesn't work. There's one main rule in a story, it's to got one principal (even unique) subject. In the Clouzot's film, that's obvious: they have to go to point A to point B with dynamite. That's all. Simple, efficient. You can evoke the personal stakes of each characters in a first act, then during the development to enhance their character, etc. But that's not essential in the story. In the Friedkin's film, the first act is one hour long! What's the point?! Give us the dynamite and en route Germaine! One hour to explain why the characters are here... Don't explain! Show!... You can make a very long first act, like in Deer Hunter, but it has to have a point, like creating an opposition between two states, two times. And once it's show-time (at last) 20m on ONE bridge! 50 times the same shots. I understand the idea, move on! At least, the actors are great. But some effects, the music, the sounds, the editing work... all seem very outdated, abusive, and out of tone. The Cluzot's films is centered to the characters, their fear; that's universal and primitive concerns: just survive to this absurd quest. In the Friedkin's films, it's focused on the oil company interest, and their own interest to make money... OK, I take the simple and the cathartic angle, approach.Friedkin just missed to make a better film with an unique and very simple film. You can't enhance a masterpiece giving it more material. So if Steven Spielberg would love Bergman's Persona, he would try to give special effects to the film? more characters, more scenes with different locations? Typical American approach with remake movies. That's a terrible fail.At the same time, there was Fitzcarraldo, Aguirre, and at the opposite, two Spielberg masterpieces, Duel (vroom-vroom: simple, efficient) and Jaws. They all have made necessary films, with genuine innovations. Friedkin wanted to be part of this movement -- he clearly crashes leaving the road. Stay on the main track, Willie! One subject! Watch out, Willie... "It's OK, I take the lead!" -- Boom.Yep, you took a lead balloon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, suspenseful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this remake of Henri-Georges Clouzot's The Wages Of Fear when it was first released, and instantly fell in love with it. Sad to say, that was before I had seen the original, which is far superior. Not to say that this is a bad movie; far from it.The plot involves four low lifes on the run (an American gangster (Roy Scheider), an Italian assassin (Francisco Rabal), a Palestinian terrorist (Amidou), and a French embezzler (Bruno Cremer)). They are all hiding out in a small village in Venezuela, which has to be the armpit of the universe. They are offered a way out of their miserable existence when an oil well 200 miles away catches fire and they have to haul the nitroglycerin needed to blow it out. Thus these four men in two trucks embark on a dangerous, harrowing journey towards death or salvation.This is my third viewing of Sorcerer (the title comes from the word painted on the side of one of the trucks), and my first viewing after seeing The Wages Of Fear. Friedkin does an admirable job, and has some incredible set-pieces (the bridge crossing in particular is gut-wrenchingly tense), and the acting by all the principles is good, although Scheider does go a little over the top from time to time. The set design is also quite good (I especially liked the surreal landscape towards the end of the journey).The problems come in the script by Walon Green. In the original, Clouzot knew that the character development and the interaction between the men was of the utmost importance, and their histories didn't matter all that much. In Sorcerer, Friedkin and Green opt to show the backstories of each of these men. Maybe they thought that knowing their history would give the audience more empathy with their characters. Since these guys are all pretty much scumbags (with the possible exception of the French banker), I suspect that it had more to do with the fact that they could show some cool explosions and car chases in the first hour.Thus we are left with a very stylish movie that has some great action and suspense sequences, but lacks the soul of the original. For those who like action or adventure movies, though, I'd still recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I noticed a number of people wondering (as I myself once did) why this film is called "Sorcerer." Apparently, Universal felt that in order to best capitalize on Friedkin's success with The Exorcist, they needed to make people think that his next film was also about the supernatural. Having no choice in the matter, I guess Friedkin sort of tried to tie the name into the film by having the word painted on one of the trucks. There is one very brief scene where you can see "Sorcerer" painted in faded white letters on the passenger side door of the red truck (the one the blows up).</fullReview>

One outcast, for example, is a terrorist who got caught. The main character, Scanlon (Roy Scheider), plays a small time crook who picked a Catholic Church to rob while the parish is holding its weekly Bingo game. &gt;While the first half of the movie drags a bit, the individual plots come together in the second half of the movie. The action picks up and the viewer is now left glued to his seat as the drama unfolds and the excitement builds up to a fever pitch.To get the most of story, this movie should be viewed twice.</fullReview>

Tense atmosphere, palpably sweaty suspense, and serviceable performances (particularly by Roy Scheider and Bruno Cremer) help make up for a meandering script. William Friedkin directed, and he knows how to construct an exciting narrative--but not a tight one.

		<fullReview>... by the Sorcerer's Apprentice and he washed out. From time to time I get the feeling that the bulk of the people who post comments here and myself watched two different films but in this case we simply disagree on a fundamental point. All the comments I've read are falling over themselves to award Freidkin brownie points for beginning with the back story i.e. literally showing us how the four losers wound up in the South American hell-hole. I would argue that this weakens the main thrust of the story rather than strengthens it. Henri-Georges Clouzot who made the original and best version in 1953 knew how to construct a suspense-laden screenplay and knew that what mattered was how the men coped with the stressful, perilous journey; the very fact that they had pitched up in this remote cauldron of despair presupposed desperate pasts and I doubt if any one of the millions who watched and thrilled to Clouzot's screenplay devoted even a nano-second's speculation to how the four losers came to be there. Clouzot himself earns brownie points for shooting in black and white; colour detracts far more than it adds to the story. This leaves the cast and whilst Roy Scheider and Bruno Cremer - who played Inspector Jules Maigret in several TV movies - are adequate they are light years short of Yves Montand and Charles Vanel. Like the man said, if it ain't broke don't fix it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole of "Sorcerer" is much less than the sum of its intermittently brilliant parts. This pretentious, pseudo-european remake of "The Wages of Fear" fails as both an american action movie and a european art film. The expensive explosions and stunts get in the way of character development. Much time is spent in the beginning showing the characters' origins, but then they never have any meaningful dialogue during the drive to develop the theme of desperate, fatal men on a quest.There are a few outstanding visuals that stand out. The scene where Roy Scheider goes up and collapses in front of the giant tree blocking the road is great. The giant truck creaking across the rope bridges is harrowing. And the hellish looking end of the road with the Tangerine Dream music is surreal. But aside for these great moments, the movie is ponderous and unengaging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorcerer Vs. The Wages of Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Georges Arnaud's novel LE SALAIRE DE LA PEUR has been filmed twice, by Henri-Georges Clouzot as THE WAGES OF FEAR (1953) and by William Friedkin as SORCERER (1977). While both films are worth seeing, the earlier version is the one regarded as a classic, and rightly so. SORCERER has its strengths, to be sure -- but the title isn't one of them, in my opinion. "Sorcerer" is the name of one of the trucks used in the antiheroes' nitroglycerin run, but I suspect it was used as the title primarily to make fans of Friedkin's EXORCIST think it was another supernatural chiller. If anything, SORCERER harks back to Friedkin's Oscar-winning FRENCH CONNECTION, having been filmed in the style of the grim-and-gritty school of 1970s crime thrillers; its realism in this respect gives its best moments the feel of a tough-minded documentary. The acting is top-notch all around, particularly from Bruno Cremer and the ever-charismatic Roy Scheider, who brought to my mind Humphrey Bogart in TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE. Having said that, although SORCERER goes into more detail about the political climate and the various misdeeds that led the four desperate protagonists to the South American hellhole where they accept high-paying but life-risking jobs driving nitroglycerin through treacherous terrain, WAGES... distinguishes the men's personalities better, giving the audience more rooting interest in them. Both films have excellent casts, with compelling lead performances from Scheider and, in WAGES..., Yves Montand. In addition, WAGES... provides feminine charm in the form of beguiling Vera Clouzot as the café waitress who loves Montand, while the few women in SORCERER are virtually interchangeable. Both films also have tense action sequences, but somehow for all the staging and skillful editing, SORCERER's action scenes seem strangely slow, slogging along in the mud just like the men in their less-than-state-of-the-art trucks. Both versions have enough good things in them to be worth a look, but if you only have the time and resources to check out one of them, WAGES... pays off more handsomely than SORCERER.</fullReview>

This version, a brand new 35mm print with 27 minutes of extra footage, was presented by William Friedkin himself. It's been 25 years now since I first saw it in Sydney, where it had a very limited run beforedisappearing without a trace, to eventually turn up on video in a much truncated form. So, I went along to see it again. Upon leaving the cinema (I wasn't at the screening presented by Bill Friedman), I conceded that while being brilliantly photographed, and a very good performance by Roy Scheider, I still believe that the 1957 Henri-Georges Clouzot version, is still the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original for this film, Clouzot's "Wages of Fear," is one of the greats. It is not only a great thriller, but manages in the last minutes to tie a wide range of issues together and leave you thinking about all you've just experienced. In spite of excellent cinematography and first rate sound design, "Sorcerer" is a big bore that never adds up. The first half of the film spans the world and provides a sense of place worthy of Hitchcock. In fact, it really got me thinking about how the four apparently unrelated events might eventually fit together. Well, they don't It's sole purpose is to set out the back stories of the 4 main characters. Unfortunately, the 4 characters are never developed and what we learn here is largely irrelevant to the film's actions or themes. When we get to the main story, we care little about the four characters and their fate. In fact you may have trouble remembering who two of the characters are and none of the characters ring true. Where does a guy who spent his prior life as a wealthy banker (or, in fact, any of the characters) get the skills to assemble and tune the engine, suspension, etc. of the trucks that he will use to transport the explosives? The back stories make up half the run time of the film but never answer such basic questions. As a result, we are left with a thin thriller about characters who behave in unbelievable ways and never arouse either sympathy or hatred. If well-shot thrill sequences are all you seek in a film, you may enjoy this. While it is true that there is something a bit Hollywoodish in Yves Montand's naiveté in "Wages," and that is contrasted with the grittiness of the characters in "Sorcerer," the ending of "Wages" gives that Hollywood simplicity just the right ironic twist.In "Wages of Fear" Clouzot limits his focus to the backwater hell hole where everyone lives in poverty enslaved to the world oil market. Clouzot focuses much attention on making us feel how bad this place is. By the end of the film Clouzot has us thinking about the relation of the lives of these characters to our own. While I understand why Friedkin in "Sorcerer," might wish to show the global interconnectedness of the modern world, and that the whole world is now a mean and dangerous place, he never attempts to connect the meanness of that world to the poverty and brutishness of the oil backwater, the current lives of the characters, or our own lives. While he makes the squalor of the backwater convincing, it too has little connection to the world's meanness. Yes, the world is dangerous, revolution is always about to boil over, but what has this to do with us. Clouzot's characters learn and grow as the film accumulates ironies right to the final death waltz. Friedkin's characters barely exist and the film finds no thematic center to hold itself together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because I'd already seen (and admired) Clouzot's THE WAGES OF FEAR, I was frankly less than thrilled by Friedkin's SORCEROR. The former is a quiet but gradually unnerving conversation between filmmaker and film-goer, the latter an often slapdash rehash. Presenting the protagonists in a series of totally unnecessary prologues was Friedkin's first (and perhaps most unforgivable) mistake: not only would the film have been better served by flashbacks showing same, it's arguable that said scenes were totally gratuitous to begin with: watch the movie without them and you'll see what I mean (the only flashback that might be unavoidable in such a case would be the Roy Scheider backstory- although even that could've- and should've- been shorter: it was as if Friedkin wanted to relive or recreate for no real good reason the infamous action scenes from THE FRENCH CONNECTION). SORCEROR boasts some outstanding direction- one gets a true feeling for the place as well as the plight of the men once they're on the road (a la John Boorman's DELIVERANCE)- and the Tangerine Dream music is a dream, but THE WAGES OF FEAR is, overall, a better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Wages" Has Nothing to Fear from this Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to admire Friedkin for the way he tackled this project. He was in awe of the French thriller "The Wages of Fear" (1953) and challenged himself to do an original retelling of the story. He refused to borrow the best elements of that classic and just took the basic storyline; totally altering its film-making style and carefully excising the very elements he most admired in the original-substituting his own ideas and avoiding any hint of taking the easy way out. Even insisting on a title that reflected not the film but the process of transforming the original into something very different; and it was a two year $22 million process. This was his masterpiece (he had earned the chance with two big hits-"The French Connection" and "The Exorcist") and he wanted "The Wages of Fear" to be his inspiration, not his blueprint.So instead of a subtle off-camera explosion, "Sorcerer" graphically illustrates the event. Instead of a languid first half character study he shows short action-oriented background segments. Instead of an undefined location (filmed in the south of France it could be anywhere from the Middle East to South America) he titles his locations and sets the main story in Venezuela (filmed in the jungles of the Dominican Republic). And on the most fundamental level the claustrophobic closeness of "The Wages of Fear" (its most unique and pervasive element) is replaced with a distanced perspective. Tight shots become wide shots, interior scenes are brought outside, a bigger budget transforms intimacy into scale. While you especially admire Friedkin for taking this risk, it is unfortunately the film's fatal flaw (at least comparatively). Without the tight shots in the truck cabs and the evolving relationships between the characters, there is little to identify with and no real point of view established. Because the motivations are superficial, the reactions are unconvincing and the suspense less involving. What is left is a good action picture without the basic themes and extreme dimensionality of the original. Four desperate men lack the funds to escape Porvenir, a backwater village in South America. Nilo (Francisco Rabal) is an assassin from a Central American city, Kassen (Amidou) is a Palestinian bomber, Victor (Bruno Cremer) is a white collar criminal from Paris, and Jackie (Roy Scheider) is a small time American hood fleeing a mob contract. When a revolutionary group sets fire to an oil rig, the company offers big bucks to anyone who will drive a load of very unstable explosives 200 miles to the wellhead; where they will be used to blow out the fire.Amidou was Friedkin's only first choice for a part, the other three parts were offered to actors who turned them down and he was forced to settle for this cast. Which could be one reason that Friedkin pulled back his camera and minimized the acting component of the film. For some reason a great deal of time is spent filming the men repairing two junked trucks, getting them ready for the expedition. Then they are off and the superiority of "The Wages of Sin" begins to really show. In that film an early obstacle is a hairpin turn that requires the trucks to back up. What happens to the first truck sets the viewer up for the difficulties that the second truck will have. In "Sorcerer" Friedkin substitutes a more elaborate bridge, but the sequential technique does not work nearly as well.There is some astonishing cinematography in this part of the film, and a gripping musical score by Tangerine Dream. It would be nice to have it available in the original widescreen format.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

Aside from an exciting chase scene, the first 40 minutes that I saw were unbearably talky. Nothing remotely interesting was happening and I was tuning out more, and more as it went on. If a film doesn't interest me by the 40 minute mark, I usually end up turning it off. Sometimes I am a masochist and watch the whole thing. Thankfully; better judgment prevailed here. I have read this is considered a remake of a film called "The Wages of Fear" Considering how I couldn't finish this movie; I doubt I'll be checking that out. You never know, though. Roy Scheider was fine from what I saw, but boredom prevented me from continuing on. Some might find it odd that I am criticizing the film when I haven't watched the whole movie. That's fine. Everyone has a right to their own opinion, but maybe you will get more out of it than I did3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from perfect but well worth the time ? a reference to Trinity?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some parts of this movie are really great. The opening sequence takes the viewers to Jerusalem, Paris and New Jersey where the main characters cause disasters which force them to flee to a godforsaken place in Central America. This works really well and sets the tone of the movie.Later on, the pacing of suspense is less good. The main characters transport highly explosive material through the jungle. Somehow the sense of urgency on the side of the mentioned characters and also of their employers is not convincing, tension at times sags a little. In my opinion it is a big flaw to let the viewers see the final destination of the trip early on, it makes the way from A to Z, for the main protagonists a nightmarish drive into the unknown, much less dramatic. I also found there a lack of continuity in the road (geography and weather) which, for all its realistic documentary value, distracts. The ending is rushed and something of a letdown. I like jungle movies shot in studio settings, I wonder if in this case the message wouldn't have been more poignant if a more minimalistic, low budget approach had been chosen (I don't know Henri-Georges Clouzot's version of the story yet but am anxious to see it).Nonetheless the Sorcerer lingers on in my memory. Director William Friedkin has a good eye for the picturesque and the performances, especially Scheider's (in my opinion one of the great under-appreciated American actors) and Kremer's are superb.I wonder if the tree blasting scene is a reference to the Trinity test, the first explosion of the atomic bomb. The whole setup, including the uncertainty of the protagonists and not least the tripod solution strongly reminded me of what I have seen and heard of this experiment that completely changed the history of humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SORCERER (William Friedkin, 1977) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had always been interested in this one for a variety of reasons: for being Friedkin&#x2019;s follow-up to THE EXORCIST (1973), for his daring to remake a classic of international cinema, and for the film&#x2019;s subsequent notoriety as a failure. Frankly, the director&#x2019;s greatest coup was to render such thrilling material (as H.G. Clouzot&#x2019;s original film certainly was &#x2013; and to whom this is dedicated) dreary and needlessly glum! Actually, he&#x2019;s seemingly more interested in showcasing the squalor of the setting than in dealing with characterization (in spite of a deadly first act in which we learn each of the protagonists&#x2019; back-story). In fact, there&#x2019;s very little interaction between the four &#x2018;fugitives&#x2019; &#x2013; which rather dissipates one&#x2019;s involvement in their plight (surely not what Friedkin or screenwriter Walon Green intended); Green had been Oscar-nominated for his best-known work, THE WILD BUNCH (1969) &#x2013; which also dealt with desperate men on their way out, albeit in a far more cohesive and introspective manner.With respect to the actors themselves, Roy Scheider and Bruno Cremer are adequate enough under the circumstances (Scheider especially makes for an interesting substitute for the original film&#x2019;s Yves Montand, though Friedkin apparently considered him &#x201c;the worst casting decision he has ever made&#x201d;!) &#x2013; but Amidou comes across as a non-entity, while Francisco Rabal is miscast in Charles Vanel&#x2019;s old role (in retrospect, aren&#x2019;t Friedkin and Scheider lucky to have worked with two Luis Bunuel alumni: Rabal here and Fernando Rey in THE FRENCH CONNECTION [1971]?).Easily, the remake&#x2019;s best sequences are the treacherous crossing of a bridge during a storm (which alone cost $2 million and took 3 months to shoot!) and the explosion of a massive tree-trunk which is barring the drivers&#x2019; way. However, one of the most disappointing aspects about SORCERER is its decision to alter the death scenes of the characters from those in the earlier film &#x2013; or, in the case of Cremer and Amidou&#x2019;s spell out what in Clouzot&#x2019;s version is almost a throwaway moment (to a far more devastating effect, in my opinion)! Rabal and Scheider&#x2019;s individual demise (the latter&#x2019;s only inferred) is especially unimaginative and, well, ludicrous. By the way, Scheider&#x2019;s dizzy flashbacks during his breakdown towards the end features inserts from a scene which was subsequently deleted &#x2013; and, curiously enough, the continent-hopping establishing sequences were dropped from a number of the film&#x2019;s import versions! At the very least, SORCERER is a visually striking experience (in spite of the pan-and-scan format utilized for the DVD edition); aurally, too, we&#x2019;re treated to an unusual and effectively moody score by the German rock band Tangerine Dream &#x2013; while the sound recording is handled with extreme consideration (consequently presenting the film with its sole Oscar nomination). Incidentally, Friedkin came up with a pretentious title for what is, basically, an adventure epic &#x2013; claiming it&#x2019;s a reference to &#x201c;the evil wizard of fate&#x201d; (yet one of the trucks transporting the nitro-glycerine is actually named &#x201c;Sorcerer&#x201d;!). He also cites this as his favorite work &#x2013; stating that &#x201c;it's one of my only films I can watch because it came out almost exactly as I intended"&#x2026;Go figure! While nothing special, the supplements on the Universal DVD do extend to some neat production notes (detailing the film&#x2019;s big budget, extensive schedule and expansive locations &#x2013; it proved so expensive to make that Universal were eventually forced to seek help from a rival studio, Paramount!) and equally well-researched cast/film-maker biographies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good suspense. Bad plot. Good music.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(spoilers)I actually don't get the ending. I just really don't approve of cliffhangers like this. Sure The original Italian Job is a good one. But it is a good one. This movie is great on suspense. But the plot sucks and it's very boring. I can see how the director almost messed up his job. Good suspense and no plot makes for one very poor replay value. I'm not saying the acting is bad. It's just it's so depressing. Not much for bright spots. Can't believe I'm writing a review on it. Probably more like the Mosquito Coast in level of ho hum.. oh lemme die quick!6/10Quality: 8/10 (some poor editing too)Entertainment: 2/10Replayability: 0/20</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why you do not remake classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a sterling example of when filmmakers should leave well enough alone. We already had "Le salaire de la peur". Why do we need this? The short answer is we don't.Every aspect of this film was better handled in the original. This version is in colour; the Montand version was in stark black and white. The French version spends a long time getting to know the characters before they set out on their hazardous journey. The American version assumes you've already seen the French version so they can just skip over character development. You just don't feel the desperation in "Sorcerer".Do yourself a favour and see the original. It deserves its accolades.</fullReview>
