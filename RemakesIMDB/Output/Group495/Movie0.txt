		<fullReview>A sweet and honest movie. It's definitely a family film. I liked the relationship of having to fill someone's shoes in a sense, because people are so attached to them. Sarandon was awesome of course. She carried her part with grace and the feral intensity of a mama bear. Nothing got over on her and I liked that because she wasn't going to be around much longer. It wasn't about sizing up the competition, but making sure she was the right person her kids could grow up with instead of her. It was heartfelt and real. Great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still wondering why Susan and Julia didn't even get a nomination of the Academy, or the screenplay. This movie is a great movie about jelousy of a mother, that is scared that her children might love someone else as their second mother, and gives such a hard time to that person. And in the other hand, you see that young lady, in love (with the father of those kids), that forgives everything that has been done to her. She was called a bitch a couple of times (the dog scene with Ana, and when she brings the kids at Jackies, and Ana has make up). Was ignored, and even lost her job for those kids. And she forgives all of this, and tryes to like everyone. The world sure would be perfect if everyone would be this way. The problem is that the world has too many Jackies, and not enough Isabels. If you are someone that likes to cry, and cry. Watch it. Is one of the sweetes movie ever, talking about peoples feelings, fears, and happynes. Great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>delightful &amp; heart warming ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stepmom is one of the most delightful movies in recent times ... ! It's a touching tale of maternal love that doesn't fail to move you no matter how many times you see it. It's a gem !Stepmom tells you the story of an American marriage that loses its spark with time and the man seeks love outside of it. This sensitive film deals with how the family handles the delicate situation --- at times, holding out bravely ... and at other times, buckling under the emotional trauma ! The other woman, very ably portrayed by Julia Roberts, is a genuinely good human being who tries to bond with her lovers' kids inspite of their mother's (and their own) initial bitterness towards her. The plot thickens when the mother of the kids, portrayed with finesse by Susan Sarandon, is found to have cancer. The mother's days in the world are now numbered and the family must learn to carry on without her ... ! Stepmom now paints a warm and endearing picture of how the members of this family reconcile their differences and stand united and strong in the face of this crisis.It would be UNFAIR if I rated this one anything less than 9 ... !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stepmom review from a fan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie! If you are in the mood for a tear jerker movie, this is the movie too see. Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon are remarkable together. This is the absolute best I have seen Julia Roberts act and this movie defiantly brings out her talent. Susan Sarandon can make any movie good. But she delivers outstanding effort to make her character relate to other women who have had the problems that Susan's character faces. This movie is of course a 10 out of 10! Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon will make you laugh now and then, but they will also make you cry with the difficulties that they face together on screen. Stepmom is a movie you'll enjoy and "always always" remember as a movie that filled your heart. So if you haven't seen Stepmom yet...go and see it! You'll be glad that you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts work so well together to make this a lovely, heart warming story. I loved every minute of it. I love the bit at the end where Anna says goodbye to her mum because it shows the relationship between mother and daughter beautifully which always makes me cry and think how I'll have to start appreciating my mum more!! Julia Roberts is my favourite actress and I have always wanted to see her and Susan Sarandon working together. Susan Sarandon's film Thelma and Louise reminds me of this film, two women facing dificulties and hardship to come out on top stronger and together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got Stepmom for Julia Robert's performance, and I expected it to be pretty good. It did not fail me- it exceeded my expectations. This movie is beautiful.It's the story of a husband and wife with two kids who have fallen out of love, and now the father is getting married to a new, younger woman. The mother of the kids does everything she can to make her children hate this woman who is going to very soon be a permanent part of their life.Julia Roberts indeed gives a fine performance as the fiancée of Ed Harris, the husband. She steals your heart in every scene she's in as this young woman who is trying so hard to be exactly what those children want and need. And in the end, she's searching for acceptance and love from them as much as they are from her. And then there's Susan Sarandon, giving one of her best performances as the mother of the children who wants nothing more than to remove her children from The younger woman completely. Sarandon's character is horrible- one of the most awful and hateful people in modern movies. She backstabs, she's overly-critical, and for a long time, she finds every chance possible to turn her children against the other woman- yet you cannot help but feel for her. As nasty as she is, you sympathize with this woman who is having to deal with her children being in the care of a younger, inexperienced woman who is living with her ex-husband. It's impossible not to understand her character's mourning and confusion. For the first time in her life, this woman is not the only mother in her children's life.Don't be surprised if you cry- more than once. It's that good, and that affecting. Truly, this film is one of the better delights of the past few years. Beautiful story, great performances, real emotions- 8/10 stars! Jay Addison</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stepmom is a really good drama. Their are some very sad moments in the movie but their are also some funny ones too. Julia Roberts stars as Isabel, who is of course the 'Stepmom' and what a brilliant job Julia does. Other good performances come from Ed Harris who plays Luke, Isabel's boyfriend and Susan Sarandon who plays Jackie, Luke's ex-wife. Jena Malone and Liam Aiken also do quite a good job as Luke's kids Anna and Ben. The music in the movie is really nice too. I give Stepmom a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Columbus directed 'Stepmom' is a winner all the way... a true 1998 Classic! The film is highly entertaining, in fact there is hardly a moment when you feel bored in this 123 minute-film. Columbus has made superb films, and 'Stepmom' ranks as his best.The film has a beautiful story, a story about a divorced couple, their children and the Stepmom. The film explains the worth of a family... it surely leaves a great moral behind. The climax is superb, it gets you moist-eyed.Performance-wise: Ed Harris is Incredible, as ever. He steals the show in a small, but significant role. Julia Roberts is fantastic as the Stepmom. Susan Sarandon needs to mentioning, she's a class apart. Liam Aiken &amp; Jena Malone, the kids, stand out.On the whole 'Stepmom' is a must watch for each and every cine-lover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>two giants of cinema make this an appealing 'chick flick' for all to enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grab a box of Kleenex, a bag of popcorn and a sweetheart to share the tears with in this coming together of two women who would otherwise despise each other. They are the ex-wife and girlfriend of a busy dad who must learn to co-exist when potential tragedy arises. Oscar winners Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts both shine in this more recent variation of "Terms of Endearment", "Steel Magnolias" and "Beaches" where women end competition for the greater good. Sarandon is a force of nature as she goes from resentful of her ex's fiancée to confiding when a potentially fatal disease strikes, making it necessary to prepare her two children for the possibility that they will have to go on with future step-mom Roberts. The kids have understandably conflicting feelings and even when the teen daughter gets bratty, you empathize with her. Watching these two remarkable suddenly become pals is touching and rewarding, and scenes of New York in the fall and winter are beautiful. Roberts underplays her part, instilling her character with understanding and integrity, even humor. In an era where women seem intent on allowing themselves to be presented in a less nurturing light and allow the media to focus on mainly negative aspects, it is films like this which truly remind us of the qualities that make women great and give us the chance to celebrate their true strengths which do not have to result in a cat fight on a TV reality show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sarandon and Roberts Shine!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stepmom is a wonderful, life-affirming film that benefits from the great direction of Chris Columbus, the beautiful music of John Williams, and a great screenplay.Ed Harris is great as the father, though his role is smaller. The two children are spot on. But what really drives this film are the portrayals of the mother by Susan Sarandon and the stepmother by Julia Roberts.This film is about universal truths: Life has its ups and downs. Love has its ups and downs. Some of the strongest familial bonds are forged from needing. And when you really love someone, there is no wrong way to do it.The story traces the progress between the mom and the stepmom--two women who have to face their fears of a new family dynamic. The mother was there for all the tender moments, all the wounds and all the memories. The stepmom is the "cool" one who knows the lyrics to all the songs and is current with today's fashions. To become a whole family, the mother must overcome her fear of being replaced and the stepmother must overcome her fear of comparison with an irreplaceable mother.This is a tearjerker. The resolution goes far beyond the daily struggles of a family rent by divorce. Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching and honest telling of mixed families</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie honestly addresses the emotions and stories behind divorce, stepparents, and cancer. One of the strengths of this movie is that it does not vilify anyone. There is no evil stepparent, ex-wife, ex-husband, or stepchildren. You identify with every character, even when they act imperfectly. When the stepdaughter, Anna (Jena Malone) acts completely bratty towards stepmother Isabel (Julia Roberts), you do not only identify with Isabel at having to make the best of this situation. Your heart also goes out to Anna, a young child who is going through this tough time. It is Jena Malone's Anna that has the most touching lines. "You do not walk out on your mother!" Father goes. "No, that is your job." Simultaneously the insecurities of the normally perfect Jackie (Susan Saranadon) are understandable.The movie's only faults are that it sometimes overemphasizes points and it does not fully address its topic. By giving Jackie cancer it does not explore the complexities of a mixed family. Instead, it leaves you with the cop out. "You have their future, I have their past.Nevertheless, I love this film. Another great thing about this film is the acting. Julia Roberts, Susan Saranadon, and Ed Harris are known commodities as is Chris Columbus. However, the children actors, including Jena Malone, acted superbly. Therefore, I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new women in a previously married man's life creates stress for both his children and his ex-wife.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very enjoyable film to watch. This must be due to the fact that it's bright and filled with life through Liam Aiken's character Ben. It's also lighthearted through the new love emerging between Julia Robert's character, Isabel, and the two children, not to mention her relationship with Luke, played by Ed Harris.The movie is also done well through the visual appeal that it holds. The beginning of the story is in late summer and ends at Christmas. The entirety of the film's scenes all use various camera angles and shots. This helps the viewer to be involved in the story and get to know the characters.The topic of Stepmom was very difficult because of Susan Sarandon's character's fight with cancer. The most touching scenes were those of her and her children during Christmas. It was highly emotional when she talked to her daughter about how she would aways be there with her, if the daughter let her. The scene was so poignant because most daughters could clearly picture herself in Anna, the daughter's shoes, or even the mother's.All in all, this is a great movie which deals with two major issues. Even the film is from 1998, it's still just as prevalent ten years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having gone through a slightly similar situation myself, I can really understand this movie, and I don't agree to any review saying that it is "artificial" at all. Stepmom made me cry bucketfuls of tears - it is an extremely well made movie, with superb acting performances, great drama, and a terrific star cast.Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and Luke (Ed Harris) are a divorced couple with two children, Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken), living in New York. The children are finding this change of lifestyle difficult, and the parents are struggling to keep them happy. Luke has been dating and living with his new girlfriend Isabel (Julia Roberts) for a while now, who is many years his junior, and a professional photographer with a successful career. Jackie and Isabel are finding it impossible to get along with one another, as Jackie blames Isabel for her failed marriage, and despises Isabel's love for her career, as Jackie is a 'family comes first' woman. After a lot of painful, tear-stricken arguments and difficulties between the kids, Isabel, and Jackie, Luke proposes to Isabel. Now the two children are left with the news that tears them apart: They have a stepmother...who they hate. Suddenly, as if it couldn't get worse, Jackie is diagnosed with cancer, and she is told after a string of treatments that she is going to die from it. The story then unfolds from how Jackie, the children, and Isabel have to deal with this new dilemma in their lives.Susan Sarandon was perfect for the role of of Jackie. Her performance really stood out to me, apart from this movie and Thelma &amp; Louise I haven't really seen any other film with her in it. I was really impressed by her. Apart from Susan, I also loved Julia Roberts in this film. She looked really pretty, and played her role so well. Susan and Julia's chemistry was the highlight of Stepmom - it is impossible to miss! The two kids were practically pros, though I thought the little boy was much better than the young girl. The guy playing Luke was average, his performance was weak compared to Julia and Susan.Overall, I would say this movie is very well made. It has a very real sense to it - you WILL be able to identify with something. What I love most about Stepmom is that it is able to touch you every time it is watched - and I have watched it many times.I love this movie.</fullReview>

Julia Roberts &amp; Susan Sarandon do the best roles of their careers in this one as the stepmother and the mother who (naturally) hates the younger, beautiful woman her husband has chosen to share his life with.

		<fullReview>It is hard to believe that this film is 15 years old now: it is as fresh and refreshing as the year it was made. Much of that is due to the story that tends to be a bit Hallmarky (written by Gigi Levangle and manipulated for the screen by Jessie Nelson, Steven Rogers, Karen Leigh Hopkins and Ronald Bass) but with Chris Columbus' direction and a cast of incredibly talented actors is really works.Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken), the two children of Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and Luke (Ed Harris) Harrison, have to cope with the fact that their parents divorced and that there is a new woman in their father's life: Isabel (Julia Roberts), a successful photographer. She does her best to treat the kids in a way that makes them still feel at home when being with their dad, but also loves her work and does not plan to give it up. But Jackie, a full-time mother, regards Isabel's efforts as offensively insufficient. She can't understand that work can be important to her as well as the kids. The conflict between them is deepened by the sudden diagnose of cancer, which might may be deadly for Jackie. They all have to learn a little in order to grow together.The lightness of the film is highlighted with some very entertaining Karaoke takes on popular music as performed by mom and the kids and by a little Thanksgiving talent show. But over and above the cutesy schmaltz are a lot of well shaped statements about life and death and family. It remains a very fine movie. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stepmom is the second cancer drama I've seen in the last five months; the other being One True Thing. Both deal with a mother dying of cancer and a family in turmoil. The difference between the two, however, is that One True Thing was much more of a melancholy movie than Stepmom was. Stepmom has moments of comedy and excitement. This takes some of the pressure off people who are prone to crying during dramas. The thing about Stepmom that stands out very well, is the superb acting by the ENTIRE cast. The adults as well as the kids did a great job in their roles, and that alone made this already great movie outstanding. Some may cry, some may laugh, but one thing is for sure, you'll walk out of the theater after the movie satisfied. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God, i can't believe this movie is rated 6.2. It should at least be rated 7.5, and it could even be 8.5!Let's just say this movie is the one that has moved me and made me cry the most in my whole life. Well, moved me in a sad way.I don't know what kind of ability Susan Sarandon's got, but all she did in this movie made me cry. She's such a good actress, and this movie suits her perfectly.I've never been much of a Julia Roberts' fan, considering i find Notting Hill and pretty woman kind of boring, but i loved her in this movie, how she really tries to bond with the kids and Susan to get to the point where the kids almost rather being with her than with their mom. Julia gives her best, in my opinion, she is a very good actress as well. Drama suits her.The kids are the other thing that gives movie that amazing flavor. How the girl answer to Susan, Julia and her dad is just so sad and good. Klaus Baudelaire's actor is so small and great as the little kid, who knows enough of the situation and gives the movie it's nice and happy moment.I didn't think the husband was anything important.And, of course, what makes this movie as sad and as great as it is, is the incredible directing of Chris Columbus, who directed two of the movies of my favorite movie series and book series: Harry Potter. I don't know why, but he's just got this gift for directing. Oh god, when i saw it i didn't know it was Columbus', and when i realized i now know why it's great.Some may say it's melodramatic, but i wouldn't agree. It's just good drama, one of those were you can't stop crying but that has a good plot involved as well.Bottom line, loved it. Very enjoyable and i recommend it highly. Good job Columbus, as usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cheesiest Movie Alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Minor spoilers ahead*Julia Roberts strikes again! Basically, this film is a big ol' sticky wad of total melodrama about a bunch of snobby, spoiled rich people throwing tantrums whenever they don't get their own way. It's supposed to teach the audience something about growing up and bonding with stepparents and coping with divorce and terminal illness and a whole slew of other things, but in the end it's just stupid, contrived and stereotypical. All three of the female characters (Jackie, Isobel and Anna) are self-absorbed, rude and manipulative and the younger child (I forget his name) is supposed to be all cute and handsome and charismatic and blah-de-blah but instead he quickly becomes annoying. Anyway, the plot basically goes round and round in circles for the first forty-five minutes and then the writers realized that it wasn't going anywhere and decided to deal the Tearjerking Terminal Illness(tm) card just to wrap it up. So they have Susan Sarandon's character get cancer, resulting in a half-million Heartwrenching Goodbye Sequences(tm) which ultimately bring the family closer together. I have a lot of respect for many of the actors in this film, but in all honesty, the film itself was way too cheesy for me to stomach (no pun intended). If you're a big fan of any of the actors, it's probably worth it, though.</fullReview>

The squealing little moppet, the two dimensional characters, the overused plot contrivances, the steriotypes, the hideous music, the pathetic attempt at emotional manipulation, the... the "dialogue" if that's what it can be called... How bad was it? Well, the bus was delayed, so they showed "Money Train", too. And after the horror that was "Step Mom", "Money Train" actually felt like a breath of fresh air.I got to see "Step Mom" on the way back, too. Thanks, "Peter Pan"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have seen 3000 movies in my lifetime. Stepmom was the first I ever walked out of in my life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stepmom after being hyped by its two stars for the past month was without any doubts the worst movie I have ever seen. It replaced that horror of horrors "Body Guard". The characters were unlikeable the plot was non-existent and the dialog could have been written by a high school freshman. Every one from stars,who by the way were executive producers (thus the reason for the hype), to the director should be held responsible for putting this piece of trash in theatres. The only redeeming factor from the entire miserable process was that Ed Harris only embarrassed himself three maybe four times. Two words say it all..."IT STUNK" .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sappy, manipulative drivel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually try to be objective when I watch films, to appreciate their technical merit above all else, but in the case of Stepmom, I fail. It's exactly the sort of puffy, ridiculous Valium that Hollywood shamelessly pumps into growing generations of cynics to brainwash them into the belief that every person in the world is a cuddly, fluffy elf-like creature and conflict only exists because it's been too long since we all sat down for a singalong around the piano.I know I sound like a terrible cynic for judging this film in this way (I am a terrible cynic, let's not deny it), but it's difficult to swallow this tripe. I come from a - dare I use that devilish phrase - broken home myself and in fact my old man is getting remarried very soon, but I still fail to see any resemblance between Chris Columbus' vision of family harmonics and the interpersonal dynamics that exist here on Earth. And by that I refer both to the grating, fire-and-brimstone conflict at the beginning of the film and the sugary hug fest into which it slowly descends as it progresses.There is however, nothing inherently wrong with sugary, optimistic scenarios; if they are grounded, well-driven, well-plotted explorations of discovering the light at the end of the tunnel. It's hard for me to put my finger on a perfect example but the most obvious one would have to be the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which has nevertheless received a certain quantity of criticism from yours truly for drawing too distinct a line between "good" and "bad". In spite of that trilogy's shortcomings though, it's a good example of a golden-sunshine-lollipops conclusion that is plodded out solidly over a long arduous journey of storytelling.Chris Columbus here dispenses with any nuance of hard work, or respect for his audience's intelligence, and dishes up a glib, emotionally manipulative treat for us to wolf down hungrily, starved for happy endings in our cinematic universe of chainsaw massacres and David Lynch.There really isn't a saving grace to this film, as far as I can see: Its lack of realism obviously renders me incapable of truly appreciating whatever fine qualities it may have, but the dialogue is dull, performances are average and being such a suburban story, there really isn't much room for technical film-making brilliance. On top of this, every single time I think back on it I get "Ain't no Mountain High Enough" stuck interminably in my head, and that, more than anything else, is unforgivable.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ludicrous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler alert -- (if you care about spoiling such an awful movie) -- There's one scene that captures just how ludicrous this movie is. A heart-to-heart between Julia Roberts, the younger new bride-to-be, and Susan Sarandon, the dying, middle-aged ex-wife. Susan Sarando talks about how she'll miss out on her children's future. Julia Roberts replies by saying imagine how *she* is going to feel in the future, when the girl is getting married and can only think about how she wishes it was her mother and not her stepmother there to help with her wedding.I guess the screenwriter really expects us to swallow this. Sure, yeah, the REAL tragedy is that the new trophy wife will lack confidence. Come on Mom, quit feeling sorry for yourself! Cancer, chemo, and death before your children hit puberty -- well, that's nothing compared to the suffering Julia Roberts is going to face. Wish I could get the two hours I wasted on this movie back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stepmom (1998): Dir: Chris Columbus / Cast: Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, Ed Harris, Jena Malone, Liam Aiken: Nauseating spectacle advertised as a cheerful comedy but fits more as a dramatic punch to the genitals. Julia Roberts plays the stepmom who represents growth and the acceptance of further responsibility. Many unnecessary problems enter the lives of the children. The daughter's problems at school are not relevant and poorly handled, and the son's trip to the hospital only serves as an excuse for the two leads to bicker. Roberts is a fashion photographer who wishes to communicate with the children. Sarandon suffers from cancer and uses a former job to cover it up. The result is a boring farce with two highly paid actresses rehearsing Family Feud. Directed half-heartedly by Chris Columbus who seems to lose touch with the subject matter. He dealt with this theme in similar fashion in Mrs. Doubtfire,which is much funnier, while this film is about as depressing as being on a ledge and readying to jump. Roberts and Sarandon bicker until arriving at a contrived revelation. Ed Harris as the ex-husband only surfaces for plot convenience. As for the children, they sniffle and whine until those closing credits indicating the film is over gives viewers reason to cheer. As oppose to a theme of amendments, it presents a celebrity argument. Score: 1 / 10</fullReview>

Why marry Luke Isabelle?? He has a young son but just "falls" out of love with his wife and leaves them?? I cry bullshit. Luke's answers are so maniacally 1 dimensional it frustrated me....and she is supposed to be some great photographer but is just willing to give up her career? Did anyone think the daughter was such a brat because Mom had issues when life focused on someone other than her?

The selfless love they have for their spouse and the kids was so heart warming.

		<shortDescription>Forceful Tear-Jerker of a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stepmom" tells the dramatic and forceful tear-laden film in which a New York City advertising photographer named Isabel Kelly (Julia Roberts) has recently been engaged to the much older and recently divorced attorney name Luke Harrison (Ed Harris). Although he is divorced from his ex-wife, Jackie(Susan Sarandon), she still has legal rights to visit her kids, the rebellious Anna (Jena Malone) and the bratty younger son Ben (Liam Aiken). At first glance, we take our sympathies towards Isabel who's trying so hard to win the approval with the rather difficult and exasperating kids and that Jackie seems quite judgemental over Luke's choice of a new fiancé because she's not from the same class system as her. But as the film progresses, we find ourselves taking pity over Jackie who in spite of her obnoxious character and her overbearing poisonous tongue, we discover that she has terminal cancer. Meanwhile the kids seem to adapt to similar behaviour patterns, and Luke just goes on what needs to be done without saying very much. In spite of the ensemble of talented performers, "Stepmom" was cursed by a mundane script and forceful attempt to get the entire audience in tears. The box office success was quite mediocre at best as Susan Sarandon was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance. I was quite surprised that the Academy Awards neglected this film, since their mindsets are based on films that provide emotional backdrops from the characters. To me in my estimation the demographics of people who'll look up to this movie are likely upper middle-class women in the 30-40 year old age group. Perhaps the Anna Harrison character might attract the adolescent girl demographics especially those who have a divorced or deceased parent and are struggling with adapting to their new parent. The middle-aged parents who are sadly diagnosed with a terminal illness might also find the story intriguing and might have a better understanding of the physical and emotional stages they're going through let alone the hardships of those surrounding them. I might sound like an insensitive jerk, but I really did not feel at ease watching this movie. The acting and the cinematography were the best things going for this movie,but there was a lump in my throat after the final credits rolled. I really thought director Chris Columbus did too much manipulative tactics to force us into one tear-fest after another. The representing of the tear-factor shed very little impact plus there were many scenes that made me feel very uncomfortable. If you thought "Stepmom" was a feel-good movie, what were you thinking? When Isabel learns that Anna's had a nasty break-up with her discourteous boyfriend Brad Kovitsky (Jason Maves), she encourages Anna to inflict verbal abuse towards him by calling him names like limp-dick, while Ben is can be seen giggling at every word that's said. Gee, I thought adults discouraged kids to call others names, not encourage them. Sure Brad may have deserved that, but adults should know better that it's not appropriate behaviour. I was also taken aback by the rich, posh multi-million dollar estate that Jackie was residing in and clichéd of course was the fact that it came with a horse and a horse trail.It made me ponder at just how did a nice charming New York City fashion photographer like Isabel Kelly would ever get romantically involved with a much older, mundane guy like Luke and having to put up with two quite incorrigible children who clearly hate her for the sake of her existence. I also couldn't believe my eyes during the scenes at the school play where all the kids were dressed in perfect Hollywood style costumes and each and every one of their voices sound purely angelic. Didn't they have at least one kid who felt awkward or uncomfortable? That would have been believable. What's also strange was that Anna was six years older than Ben. How the hell are they in the same play? Shouldn't they be in different schools? Okay so maybe the scriptwriter may know the classic song of "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, but it makes me wonder how did Anna and Ben seem to know this song quite flawlessly? They were born in 1986 and 1991 respectively several years before this song was ever released. The other thing that bugs me was that the connection they had with this song serves as the unity between them. It also sickens me that they play this song on three occasions. Gaye and Terrell had other songs that weren't about going through get lengths to unite with one another.One a plus note I'm really impressed with the resiliency towards Isabel. I mean surviving through all the ordeals between this very hateful family, deserves a standing ovation. She standing up to the materialistic Jackie and her obnoxious step-daughter without the desires to strangle either one deserves my praises.Overall this is not a horrible film, though I can't really recommend it due to the hateful characters, the uncomfortable atmosphere and the details that make me cringe. We should feel sorry about someone dying, but we can't embody pity because of the venom that comes out of the victim's mouth. I would steer clear from this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sentimental drama that will tug at your heartstrings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julia Roberts from Mirror Mirror and Susan Sarandon from Enchanted team up in this touching drama about a woman named Jackie(Sarandon)who's husband(played by Ed Harris) divorces her and is now engaged to a much younger woman named Isabelle(played by Roberts)and has two children from her ex. Of course when Jackie first meets Isabelle she detests her and would do anything to get her kids back even if it was signing a contract to keep her kids. But Jackie of course in hiding a painful secret(yup what I am going to say is like what Nicholas Sparks would do in his novels been turned into movies). Jackie has cancer. Of course she doesn't tell her kids or her ex husband about it and would go to a private clinic to get herself looked after. But how long has she left to live? And will she get treatment?From the man that brought you Mrs Doubtfire and Home Alone as well as the first Harry Potter film,this is a real tearjearker to watch,especially near the end where I was left teary-eyed in the end. The cast was spot on. Susan Sarandon was excellent as the bitchy ex wife to Ed Harris who is dying of cancer. While Julia Roberts(sporting a much lighter hair-do than her frizzy curly red hair)was great as Isabelle the photographer that steal Ed's heart. The story to its credit has been done to death and like I have mentioned this movie might as well been made into a novel by Nicholas Sparks as it carries the same cliché as his novels(even though he never wrote a novel on this movie).Bottom line if you haven't seen it and if its on TV I recommend it to you or if you want you can just buy it on DVD.B-7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't seen this tearjerker in years but remembered really enjoying it. If I'm honest think I liked it more the first time around than in my re-watch. Its still a pretty good movie that you can't help getting pulled into, a bit soap opera-ie, lots of angst, moments of humour all held together by a great cast.Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon give amazing performances here (even if Julia's lips are distracting at times) The kids also do a great job capturing cute, bratty and sad realistically. The little boy is very cute. Ed Harris even pops in and out as the father/boyfriend (which is always nice) but this story is about the relationship between the woman.So yeah this is a heart-tugger with Roberts playing a career minded photographer whose relationship with a lawyer (Harris) gets complex as she clashes with his supermom ex-wife (Sarandon) over the well being of the children. They are forced to rise above however when Sarandon is diagnosed with cancer and that's when things get super sad. 07.13</fullReview>

It's also a realistic movie which makes it even better. Their mother doesn't like the stepmother at first because she still loves her ex-husband and she hopes to get back together but when she sees that their love is real she puts her hate aside and just tries to live through it all. The fact that the mother accepts the fact that another woman will take care of her children when she's no longer there had me in tears. It's a real tearjerker and a really good movie to watch with the whole family. It's a movie that will stay in your mind and heart forever. If you haven't watched it yet, this is your chance.

		<fullReview>Stepmom is a well acted drama if slightly melodramatic film. I'm not quite sure why it's billed on here as a comedy/drama, although it does have some lighter moments it's a serious film and definitely not comedic. Knowing you are dying and are going to leave your children with another woman must be terrifying prospect for any woman. Stepmom does a good job of giving a balanced view both women's situation. Susan Sarandon is fantastic as the bitter ex wife who finds out she is dying. Julia Roberts also does a good support job as the prospective step mom. Jena Malone gives a great performance as the young girl struggling to come to terms with the situation. The film builds nicely towards it's inevitably sad conclusion. This is certainly up there with the saddest films I've ever seen. Be ready with the tissues if you are prone to crying at sad films. Stepmom is definitely a film aimed more towards the female market (it's one of my wife's favourites) but I'm not ashamed to say I really like it. Recommended.</fullReview>

As some of us know it is completely impossible to accept a stranger as your new mother, but this film does a excellent job to establish the steps it requires to obtain a mother position in a obscured family. Julia Roberts does a excellent job portraying a new, younger mother of this age and explaining purberistic problems that young women may experience these days for young women.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for Stepmom at the movie theater, I wanted to see it because it was believable. The parents are divorced and the father is engaged to a woman young enough to be his daughter. Jackie is jealous because Isabel is not a younger version of her and she may feel Anna and Ben will get close with her. My parents were never divorced, but for those whose parents are and remarried may know exactly what it's like to be in Anna and Ben's shoes. Before I saw the film I had no idea Jackie was going to get cancer and die. The trailer was poorly advertised. When Anna became fond of Isabel, Jackie resented their friendship because she felt as though she were being replaced. The ending was good because there was peace in the family and Jackie grew fond of Isabel and knew her children were going to be fine. The only thing I didn't like about Stepmom was that a woman Susan Sarandon's age playing a mother to a 12 year old and a 7 year old. After seeing this movie, I saw that being a childless Stepmom can be a lot of pressure.</fullReview>

This movie was done much better in 1995 when it was a Lifetime made-for-TV movie starring Jill Eikenberry called, The Other Woman. Step-Mom even mimics the houses used in The Other Woman - the first wife's wrap around porch, quilts and rockers and the new wife's ultra modern house. The performances in The Other Woman by Jill Eikenberry and Laura Leighton were much richer and more likeable than Sarandon and Roberts.

		<fullReview>With Julia Roberts in the cast, you get always a good film. But also Susan Sarandon is a very good and talented actress, so you would expect that Stepmom would be a good film. And it is so! The story was sad but it was a wonderful end. This film just smashing. I loved it and everyone have to see it!Rating: 9/10 or ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unoriginal...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, as I watched this movie, I thought 'How can these people be such jerks?' Every single person in the movie is completely self-absorbed. I really hated the thing with the Pearl Jam tickets. And these people are supposed to be adults?! I normally like Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon, but I just thought the script was really bland and completely unoriginal. The cancer thing has been done before...Terms of Endearment, One True Thing, and the list goes on and on. Maybe the writer just didn't have anything else for the character's to do, so he just let the mom have cancer. Another technical detail, Sarandon's character didn't even look like she had cancer. Maybe she was a little bit more pale, but still. Take for example one True Thing, the mother character actually looked like she had cancer. She lost her hair, had no eyebrows, lost a great deal of weight, etc. Overall, it's not a bad movie. It could have done a lot beter though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STEPMOM, to me, is a very touching, moving, tear-jerking, and hilarious film. I didn't laugh out loud, though. I laughed on the inside. The one person I really couldn't stand at times was Anna (Jena Malone). This was because of her attitude and the way she treated Isabel (Julia Roberts) most of the time. My favorite quotes of this movie are, "Anna! You do not run out on your mother!" and, "I never said I was June f***kin' Cleaver!" I was thoroughly moved when Jackie (Susan Sarandon) said, "Oh, sweetie, it's okay to miss me." Also, I thought everyone in the movie gave a very moving performance. In conclusion, I recommend this touching, moving, tear-jerking, and hilarious film to anyone who's a fan of Julia Roberts. When you see it, prepare for lots of laughter and tears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning : May contain spoilersYes, I did enjoy this film. But it wasn't all that great. Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts's performances were mediocre. Ed Harris is a good actor, but he didn't really have anything to work with in this movie. This is one of those movies that are supposed to make you cry all the way until the end. Not to say that it worked?not a drop fell from my eye (even though I never cry during movies). Are these characters supposed to be likeable? Susan Sarandon, who played the mother with cancer, was the exact replica of what I hope I never am. She is mean, rude, and selfish. She hates Isabel because she is jealous of her, and then makes her kids spiteful. Later in the movie we find out that she has cancer. Are we supposed to feel sorry for her? After seeing how bad her personality was, I felt no remorse for her at all. The thing that really made me mad was the thing with the Pearl Jam concert. That was completely unnecessary.I really didn't have anything against Julia's character. This was the kind of role that was made for Julia. She was trying her hardest and had more patience then I ever would. The only thing that made me mad about her was when Anna said `You're not my mother' and she said, `Thank god for that!' and then took it back. She knows she meant it?Anna is a spoiled little brat and exhibits all of the things that are wrong with America's teens today. She mouthed off and was completely rude and disrespectful. I even think so and I'm a teen myself. I wanted to smack Anna every seen that she was in. For instance?she is supposed to be watching Ben but she falls asleep. Then when Ben is missing it's all Isabel's fault? Don't think so. She's 12 and she's treated like she's 6! She has no responsibility whatsoever and can mouth off to her parents whenever she feels like it.Ben, played by Liam Aiken was very cute, but sometimes seemed self-absorbed. His whole magician act got old fast. How old was he like 8? And he still had his mommy reading him bedtime stories and running whenever the slightest thing happened? He was also a little brat, but he was only really doing what his mom said to and you could that that he really liked Isabel later on. So he grew on me.I found myself saying `how?' a lot in the movie. Lots of the stuff just didn't make any sense. When he fell off of the jungle gym, he fell on his back. So how was the cut on the top of his leg? And he was perfectly fine when he fell yet they took him to the emergency room for that little cut he had on his leg? His mom is filling out his insurance paperwork. They would never even emit him until his insurance paperwork was done. And then they have him lying on the hospital bed because he got 5 stitches. Now if you know like I know, emergency rooms are very busy places and they don't have time to just let patients take up their rooms because they got stitches.When Anna and Jackie go horseback riding early in the morning, Jackie says that she got a babysitter for Ben. How did she get a babysitter at 4 in the morning?And this is the one that really got me. If Jackie hasn't worked for 11 years, how can she afford all that she has. She has enough money to have a house to herself, have clothes and furniture for her kids that don't' even live there full time. She has enough money to pay for an operation, and medical treatment, and she has enough go horseback riding? How does she get all of this money? Either she has an enormous bank account or she is selling a little something on the side.This movie wasn't horrible, but it wasn't too good. It's a good movie to see with the whole family, especially around Christmas time. I give it 6 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Entertaining, but no Oscar winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts give excellent performances as the mother and stepmother of two highly likable kids. Ed Harris's performance is kind of flat, but I blame this more on the script than on his ability as an actor. The story is about how a family reacts to one divorced parent getting remarried, in this case Ed Harris and Julia Roberts move in together and it causes tensions for everyone. Sarandon and the kids start out hating Isobel (Roberts) to the point that Sarandon (I keep forgetting her character's name) doesn't even want Isobel to be alone with the children. The story is very real. I can only imagine how an ex-wife would feel when her husband moves in with another woman. I have personally lived the role of the children. My father got remarried to a beautiful, younger woman when I was growing up and I wasn't particularly thrilled. The children in the movie remain fiercely loyal to their mother and adopt her attitudes about Isobel. At one point the son says to Sarandon something like, "I can hate her (Isobel) if you want me to." What makes the movie so real is that while Sarandon and Isobel eventually become civil with one another, they never become best friends. If they had the film would have lost all credibility with me.(SPOILER ALERT, although this plotline is in all the reviews) Sarandon's character has cancer and as the films goes on we begin to understand that Isobel will end of being more than just a STEPmother. While her relationship starts out on a bad note with the kids, (especially the daughter) it's a no-brainer that as the movie goes on she'll win their hearts. But it's the way she wins their hearts that's very believable. It doesn't happen overnight. I did have a problem with Sarandon's bitchiness toward Isobel. She was relentless. In one scene Isobel asks Sarandon if she could take the daughter to a Pearl Jam concert on a school night, as a way to try and get closer to her. Sarandon says no. A few scenes later Sarandon whips out tickets to the concert right in front of Isobel and snottily says to her, "Thanks. It was a great idea." This kind of thing, while believable, didn't endear me to Sarandon, and at that point in the film if was time for her to change her attitude.All five actors give excellent performances and as I said, the plot is very believable. This film has everything: comedy, drama, romance, family values. I highly recommend it to anyone, but it will really hit home with people who've lived through a similar situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice acting from Sarandon and Roberts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the people who have seen this movie, say that it is very dramatic and at times, too dramatic. Some say that the acting was poor but some say that it was terrific. I have to say that this is one of the few movies that actually has a very moving cast.I probably have a lot of disagreements, but I thought that the whole cast was very drawn into their characters and acted them out in an exceptional way. Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon especially stood out as both of their characters went through tough times. Roberts at times could be a little annoying, but overall, she did a nice job. Sarandon was excellent and added the best dramatic parts to the movie. Ed Harris, who didn't have all that many lines, was still good. Jena Malone started out pretty bad as Ana, but she grew into her part as time went by. Maybe the reason I like her towards the end more is because she finally accepts Isabel, and her meanness towards her future stepmom fades away. Liam Aiken adds some comedy to the story line. (And believe me, it needed it at some times.) His character and himself as an actor were both enjoyable to watch. Together the cast seemed like a realistic and troubled family. Nice job.The plot and story line IS very un-original, but the writing and events that occur, make the story really good. Yes, it was kind of predictable as to what was going to happen at the end. And yes, we see a stereotypical, future stepmom. She is at times snobby towards the children and tries to get past the stepmom title. As easy as to predict how the ending would turn out, it was still very well put together.If I like the movie itself, than I must like the writing. I thought that the writing was terrific. One thing that I have a problem with in movies, is long and I mean long scenes. The scenes in this movie weren't awful but there were quite a few of them and they did drag on and on. Everybody says that this movie was very sad since it was a...drama! I don't think there was anything to heartbreaking in it. Jackie's diagnosis with cancer did bring a little shock, but it was nothing that I would shed tears over. Maybe if the crew would have eliminated some of the scenes between Jackie and Isabel, it might have been a little better because it seemed like this movie just would not end. That's not a bad thing but it did make me a little sleepy.Someone had made the comment that Jackie's life was very unbelievable. Since she hadn't had a job in how many years, yet she still lived in a huge house, afforded and endless wardrobe, had horses, etc. Yeah, that part was a little overdone, but we can get past that. The full cast, writing, plot, and theme were all excellent. If you want to watch a basic story with a few twists in it from some very talented actors, then watch Stepmom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though your candle shines on others, it does not shine less on you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best character studies I have ever seen. A film that handles the "divorce" subject without the cliche's, giving a seldom approached solution for healing a broken heart. Excellently brings out the emotional challenges a family has when the parents divorce.The husband is living with a younger woman. The 12 yr. old daughter senses her mother's pain &amp; rejects the girlfriend. The mother tries to control her bitterness for the sake of her children, but can't really get a grip. The father trying to keep peace between all of them. And then the younger woman (Julia Roberts) does all that she can to try and be a "part" and not the "other woman" that's destroying a family.Usually in such a film, you're cheering for the "dumped" partner, and "boo"ing the other one. But not in "Stepmom". You have the feeling like, "Hey, I can relate to everybody's point of view here." The actors also have to get the credit. They did a marvellous job of portraying their characters.The message? With a bit of time, patience and trying to understand, unselfish love can change any situation and heal any pain. It shows how forgiveness makes these changes possible &amp; shows the benefits you receive in recognizing the mistakes you yourself have made. To accept the outcome, to accept people's choices rather than fight against them. To put the happiness of those you say you love, first, and then joy replaces your misery.I don't know if there is such a thing as a "perfect" movie, but this one sure comes close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable weepie unfairly criticised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read so many bad reviews concerning this film, and that is a shame. The great thing about Hollywood, I think, is that it's not afraid to churn out such obvious popcorn fodder in genres such as action, horror and romance. Criticised for doing exactly this, Hollywood's view on the matter is that films are about escapism, and sometimes the viewer does not need the most realistic of scripts, stories and situations.STEPMOM is your classic tear-jerker, with every heartstring pulled mercilessly as the emotional plot churns onward. I feel the performances are actually very good, especially from Susan Sarandon. We sadly have to suffer Hollywood's awful stereotype of rich American kids, but the roles are well played by two talented performers. Ed Harris, although slightly stretching the imagination as Julia Roberts' other half, plays well. This is a 5-person show that relies on good performances from everybody, and luckily this is the case. The music also is lovely (what else could it have been from the pen of John Williams?), with some gorgeous chromatic harmonising of a sweeping guitar melody. I have read reviews that criticise the film for not completing the story of one of the main characters - this is unfair as th I believe the film would have become trite because of it.If you fancy a night in with a good weepie movie, this is the one for you. Don't expect too many production values, but do expect to be touched by this moving story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall a great movie, but has many flaws...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For starters the mother (Jackie Harrison played by Susan Sarandon) is just horridly mean to nearly everyone around her, I ended up completely hating the character and waiting for her to die already, which I would HOPE was not the intention of the film. She did soften up considerably at the end, but it was too little too late as far as I'm concerned. The daughter (Anna Harrison played by Jena Malone) was a snot-nosed brat who I wanted to strangle at times, but also cooled off and much better than her mother's character.Most of the background including the dad (Luke Harrison played by Ed Harris) seemed to disappear from the film completely as it started to center around the two women fighting for/over these two children. The rock and roll songs were nice (a bit repetetive but Im sure Sonny and Cher fans will like it) but the score was inappropriate and its better to just tune it out.All that being said this is STILL a great movie, an 8 or 9/10. Very touching story with good heart, even if it dosen't get its point across too well at times. The little boy (Ben Harrison played by Liam Aiken) is VERY cute and funny, a very promising young actor. But by far the best thing in this movie is Julia Roberts as Isabel Kelly. She has it all in this film and simply steals the show. If she performed this good all the time more people would take her seriously.If you ever feel the need to cry, smile, or simply hate a character and yell at the screen, give this move a chance. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Movie...Much Better Than I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was extremely cynical when I heard about "Stepmom" and extremely reluctant to go and see it. Upon seeing this excellent movie I was forced to reconsider my previous opinions and express my gratitude to everyone in the production for making this one of the best movies I have seen.I particularly liked the character of Jackie Harrison (played excellently by Susan Sarandon). Susan Sarandon has displayed her outstanding talent in many previous movies but this would have to rank as one of her best portrayals of a character. Sarandon effectively portrays Harrison as a single mother who is devoted to her two children while seething with resentment towards her husband's new lover. Sarandon makes the character of Jackie Harrison an extremely attractive one and I couldn't help wishing she was real.Julia Roberts is also outstanding as Isabel (Luke Harrison's new lover) and Ed Harris does a wonderful job depicting Luke. The combination of the three actors/actresses provides for an excellent movie. Also Luke and Jackie's son Ben helps liven up the movie brillianrly-I spot an up and coming actor.The movie and the twist in the movie is brilliant but I warn those who are attracted to the description of this movie as a comedy to be prepared for much much more...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ok ok i'm not a big fan of julia roberts formula movies and yet i did succumb to another 2 hours and 4 minutes of one. i don't know why---maybe just because it's $20 million/movie julia roberts. i do like her--- i think she is very talented and rightfully commands an audience but the scripts she's been reading recently are definatily second-class. case in point--- "stepmom" was an alright film. not great like you might expect from a fine director, chris columbus, ( "mrs. doubtfire", the "home alone" movies and my favorite, "adventures in babysitting"), and a great cast with roberts, susan sarandon, ed harris. it's wonderfully directed---i loved the way dad (harris) plays a minor role and shows up only when needed (after all ---the movie is "stepMOM" ) and allows the "moms" to figure things out themselves. that's a lot of leeway for the direction and the relationship of the principal characters. the acting is superb with both roberts and sarandon shining on cue, semi-reminiscent of "thelma and louise" with sarandon and geena davis only in a more adversarial way. their scenes together are a real treat. and you do even get to hate anna (jena malone)---the little brat !! the scene stealer in the movie, however, is ben (liam aiken)----the biggest smile this side of julia roberts herself. there's nothing really to harsh in this movie to bash too much except possibly the script itself. in a day and age when the extended family governs over half the population--there really wasn't anything most haven't seen or lived through themselves. the cliches, stereotypes, routine range of family situations and levels of acceptances. i give this movie a strong 6.5 based on great performances by roberts and sarandon and that worldly smile by aiken.</fullReview>

They are both wonderful actresses, but so different. They did a damn fine job. I wouldn't change a thing about this movie. It is a big statement about our lives. We need to put our kids in front of career and jealousy. We need to work together to love them and bring them up happy and healthy!

		<fullReview>This was one of the most ridiculously overwrought films I've ever had the patience (and lack of judgment) to sit through. I can see how it could have been a poignant, bittersweet and ultimately life-affirming film, but the overacting, insensitive use of music (not-so-subtle), and altogether cheesy lifestyles of these people cheapened the whole experience. Manipulative and unrealistic, typically Hollywood treatment. A puppy isn't just for Christmas - whatever happened to the dog?Most offensive about this film was that it insulted the intelligence. Okay, so not everyone in the audience may be adept at picking up subtle nuances of scripting, camera work and music, but hey - no need to worry about that - lucky for us, we were beaten about the head with them; every touching moment had every tear involuntarily squeezed out of it. Why would an audience come to any of its own conclusions about the serious matters of familial relationships and death, when they can be led, unquestioning, by the film's narrow-minded vision?Three words to describe this picture: tacky, tacky, tacky. No doubt it will make everyone concerned a huge amount of money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I could use one word to describe this movie, it would "Wow". Sarandon, Roberts, and Ed Harris, each deliver a powerful, and believable performance. The presentation of the film, and the way that it was filmed, was amazing.However, if I could use one color to describe the movie, it would be a brownish-yellow. The movie seemed glazed, and bland. Half-way through, I kept imagining a semi-rotten banana. I don't know if this was a universal flaw, or maybe my movie theatre just sucks, but in the final scene, the Christmas scene. When the boy is going upstairs, the film jumps a bit (poor editing) and the glaze and yellow is lost, it becomes a grainy washed out blue, with no glaze, or shimmer, it appears to just be raw unedited footage (Did anyone else notice this?).Other than that minor problem, I loved this movie. The makeup was fantastic, I spent nearly a half hour debating with myself, whether they used make-up in the beginning to make Sarandon look younger, or in the end to make her look older. I couldn't tell! I loved the interaction with the music, especially the sort of anthem to the movie. And the directing was amazing. The way Christopher Columbus had us debating every 5 minutes, over who was the better mother, and who was right and who was wrong.This movie sends a powerful message, although it's not for everyone. I definitely recommend this to parents! It teaches us all about how to really love, and care for somebody. Stepmom, is a phenomenal film!</fullReview>

The first half is fun because of the cat-fights between Julia and Susan but then the second half becomes too lovey-dovey.

		<fullReview>Although not out on video yet, 'Stepmom' is the best movie ever. I have seen it in the theatre 9 times, and look VERY forward to it coming out on video on April 27th. Susan Sarandon did a FABULOUS job on this movie. Her passion really let out on this one. Julia Roberts also did an incredible job, but I have to say Susan blew this one over the top. Liam Aiken was a sweetie, but Jena Malone I did not like. A good actress, but yet too bratty. (No offense) Ed Harris was great also, as he always is, such a great man. Crying all 9 times, this movie is a real tear jerker, and being 13 years old I don't cry that often. But this is very sad, be sure to bring tissues, you'll regret it if you don't. This is an incredible movie, and it should have been nominated for an Oscar, but unfortunately it didn't. This movie gets 10 stars and then some, and the 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' performance was so great that we are performing it in chorus at school. The best movie ever!</fullReview>

We got so much more than we expected, which was a few laughs and a feel good chick flick.One of the things that really touched me especially was Jena Malones heartfelt, touching and rather bratty preformance as the daughter. At first I just wanted to slap her as she pouted and whined. But then I realized that I was exactly like her just a couple of years ago. A confused adolescent girl.My mom had a scare with cancer when I was at that age. And it makes me cry to know if her cancer had turned into something fatal, that my life would be protrayed in this movie. Girls, go give your mom a hug and tell you love her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the movie. I was overwhelmed by the sensibility of Chris Columbus, and how this movie gave us so many messages for real life, such as a family relationship and education of kids. But the most important thing, is that leaves you with the question: How would you handle a terrible disease such as Cancer? I enjoyed it so much, I will buy it as soon as it gets out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to watching Stepmom which was being billed as a movie which takes a hard hitting look at divorce and re-marriage -- I was in the mood for a good cry. Almost everyone I know, including myself, has been divorced or had divorced parents. Going through a divorce (especially when you have kids) or watching your parents divorce can be a horrifying experience even in the most amicable cases.Stepmom turned out to be as insightful about the American divorce as Hogan's Heroes was about life in a German POW Camp in WWII. All the characters, who in real life would be at each other's throats, speak to each other with so much maturity and sensitivity you have to wonder who their psycho-pharmacologist is. Every conversation sounds like one of those role playing games you do in group therapy. We are supposed to feel that Susan Sarandon coming to forgive Julia Roberts and accepting her as a member of the family is such a great miracle of the human spirit and the power of forgiveness but they didn't seem to get along that badly to begin with CONSIDERING that one of them is marrying the other's ex-husband. The ugliest scene between them is when Susan Sarandon is horrified to discover that Julia Roberts has (gasp!) let her daughter wear lipstick. And the tension between Julia Roberts and the kids: if I had gotten along with each of my stepparents as "badly" I would have been dating them.About 90% of the tension is caused by various communication problems involving who is taking care of the kids or who is picking them up from school. Well, since Susan Sarandon's home includes a stable with three horses and Ed Harris and Julia Roberts' Tribeca loft looks like something priced at $3 million at least, I don't see why someone couldn't have hired a baby sitter and chilled out already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been a long time since a movie has hit me like Stepmom. I saw it opening weekend and here it is a month later and it still haunts me. I thought Julia Roberts and especially Susan Sarandon did a great job. The scene where Jackie is standing between both kids's bedrooms, watching them sleep, is one of the most tragic I've seen in some time. It probably takes a mother to appreciate that scene fully. Stepmom was not what I expected but I was not disappointed. It is a beautiful story of a mother's love.John Williams has written another beautiful score. I hope it is nominated for an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I very nearly left the cinema after an hour. The plot, such as it was, was predictable. There seemed to be five or six 'goodbye' scenes where one or maybe two would have done. It dragged, and dragged on, and on. I spent the last half hour of the film silently yelling 'just die and get it over with'. Good acting could not compensate and I was sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had grown accustomed to Julia Roberts starring in light, fluffy comedies such as My Best Friend's Wedding and Pretty Woman. "Stepmom" began in a similar light tone, but quickly developed into a thick drama. I thought that Julia Roberts pulled off the part extremely well. Susan Sarandon's portrayal as Jackie was excellent.The story was believable. The main characters of Isabel and Jackie were both developed indepth. The cruelty of Jackie and Anna towards Isabel could be discomforting at times!In the end, I had great respect for both characters for their remarkable abilities to overcome adversity, although in very different manners.Not to give it away, but Luke's technique of proposing marriage was extremely creative. Wish that I had thought of it first! I also enjoyed Jackie's Victorian style house.The drama became very thick and moving towards the end. I couldn't help but to shed a tear at the climactic Christmas giftgiving scene.Overall, I thought that the movie was very good, and would strongly recommend it. For those who've recently lost a loved one to cancer, I would recommend skipping this film as the subject matter is very serious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stepmom is now tied with Simon Birch for being my favorite movie of all time. Jena Malone (Anna) did a wonderful job playing a brat (no offense Jena). There were some scenes where I just wanted to step through the screen and smack her. Other scenes she just made my heart melt. The best character in the show, however, was Liam Aiken (Ben). He was ADORABLE! Liam should be casted in more movies like this one. In all, I think everyone in the show did the best job I've seen in a long time, but the kids were the greatest. Keep up the good work Jena and Liam. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My humble opinion...and I do have one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film was okay-nothing great about it but nothing horrible as well. It was predictable, a "chick flik," humorous, heart-wrenching, and sweet. Julia Roberts portrayal of a bitch was quite interesting to watch since I really haven't observed her in too many roles like that. Susan Sarandon was great as the children's mother and incredibly realistic in her love and protectiveness for her children. The children, especially the little boy, were adorable and made you want to reach out and protect them from all of harm's way. Ed Harris' role as father/ex-husband/fiance was good-natured and sweet but he disappears in the second half of the film. The film, halfway through, begins to develop the story between mother and stepmother and all the complications that go along with it. In the end, all doesn't fare well, but ends on a predictable note. But that's okay because we all just like to go to the movies to be entertained, right? I cried more in this film in the last 20 minutes than I did through the entire 3 hours of Titanic. They did a great job on pulling those heartstrings!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a stepdad, I can relate a little to Stepmom, but I write this on behalf of my wife who, as a doting mother, cried for at least half of this movie. Susan Sarandon's performance was her usual top notch best and she, as probably only a mother could, gave a performance of astonishing honesty. Ed Harris turned in another solid supporting performance and, even the toothy Julia Roberts lived up to at least some of her hype as the stepmom of the title. This is an enjoyable movie with plenty of heart and proves the old adage: You can choose your friends but you can't choose your family. I think now we can say that also includes STEPMOMS (and dads)!!!</fullReview>

If my dad dumped me with a stepmom all the time I would be pretty upset too. I understand he had to work, but the film never showed him spending time with the kids except to tell them bad news!!!!I wouldn't be handing out any awards to this film!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful unexpected drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went expecting a comedy of sorts, but found myself immersed in a heart-wrenching tear-jerker instead.Susan Sarandon is wonderfully expressive as the mother/ex-wife who's always been there for everyone. A woman who has sunk so deep into the role of supporter that she has trouble admitting to her family that she needs to be on the receiving end for once.I loved the relationship she had developed with her son - too often children in films are merely props, and there's rarely the depth and individuality expressed in this film.Julia Roberts was hilarious as the fiancee/career woman who is more used to last-minute creative solutions than planning ahead. I would like to have seen her character developed a little more outside of the family ties......Friends? Family? Interests other than photography?Ed Harris's role was a travesty......his influence was practically non-existent other than to explain why Sarandon &amp; Roberts couldn't get rid of each other. I was disappointed that his character was allowed to be so translucent. It takes a lot of courage and strength to create a strong friendship out of a failed marriage - the respect, love and character that must exist to hold that bond were only hinted at, and I wonder if his gentle masculine influence was eclipsed intentionally to give "strong female" roles more screen time.By the way - for those who were wondering about snowblowing......think Altoids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a tear-jerker in the "Beaches" mode, which is quite unexpected. All of the trailers I've seen seemed to imply this would be a light-hearted comedy. That being said, as a drama it purrs along nicely until the inevitable "good-bye" scenes at the end which bring this film to a predictable, screeching halt. Great cast, though, who really are stronger than the material they're given to work with. Ed Harris is strong (as usual) in his supporting role, but this is really Sarandon and Roberts' show, with a small bit of humor thrown in by the boy. A good parents flick, but not one I would think that would appeal to the "date" crowd, in spite of its generic "chick-flick" tag.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited a good three weeks after Stepmom premiered before I seen it. The previews made it seem a bit to sickeningly sweet. Well, after seeing the movie, I have to report that it is sickeningly sweet. But, I liked it anyway.The story predictably tugs at all the right heartstrings. Not only does it milk the stepmother situation for all it's worth, but it also throws in a terminal disease for good measure.What saves this movie from mediocrity are the characters and the performances.Everyone is appealing. Ed Harris does his typical class act job. Although for the most part, his job seems to be just staying out of the way of the two female leads. The two female leads do a wonderful job. Julia Roberts brings beauty and humor to her role. Susan Sarandon brings dignity and class to hers. They make a good match.The actors playing the kids are exceptional. Jena Malone, as the daughter/ step-daughter does a particularly wonderful job. There are moments in the movie where you'd like to slap her, and there are others where your heart really goes out to her.This type of movie is not generally the kind of movie I'd go for. Normally I like car chases and aliens. But, this sweet little movie was able to hold my interest and occasionally have me feel for the characters.A small winner. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am really at a loss of words. This is without a doubt one of the most touching movies I've ever seen. Better than "Terms of Endearment" and "Steel Magnolias", "Stepmom" promises tears (or for guys like me, a slight mist). Julia Roberts is my all-time favorite actress anyway; I would gladly pay the $6.00 to watch a movie in which she did nothing but sit on the floor and eat raisin bran. Then I would sing its praises and probably see it again when it became available at rentals. I will set aside my bias and say that Susan Sarandon deserves the Best Actress nom. because she was undoubtedly amazing, but people could identify more, I think, with Roberts whose performance as the stepmother-to-be was phenomenal. My dear Julia, however, is said to be without a nomination for either category, which makes me mad enough to spit nails; but that's neither here nor there. I wrote this to tell you to go see this excellent tearjerker ASAP, so get off your lazy as* and go see it. You can still catch the 10:15 if you hurry! A+</fullReview>

Julia Roberts proves how versatile of an actress she is. Not since Steel Magnolias has she taken such a dramatic role. Susan Sarandon is, well, let's face it, Susan. She is one of the best actresses Hollywood has to offer. She is well deserving of her Golden Globe nomination and is sure be nominated for an Oscar. Tremendous job, Susan! Ed Harris, in a very minor role, does a great job of playing Sarandon's ex-husband and Roberts' fiancee. All around this show is one of my favourites and not since Titanic have I cried so much. What do the critics know? Not as much as the audience. That's why I give this movie FOUR AND A HALF OUT OF FIVE STARS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stepmom is a real chick-flick, if I had been a guy, my comments on this movie would definitely have been different. It's true, towards the end you can predict almost every word, especially coming out of the mouth of Susan Sarandon. But being a real chick-flick lover I didn't really care.This movie had everything: comedy, romance, and drama, only the action was missing. Julia Roberts was a great stepmom, Susan Sarandon played a wonderful jealous and over-worried mom. But I have to say too, ... the kids, and in particular Liam Aiken (Ben), stole the show. The whole theatre was filled with "oooooooohh's" and "aaaaaaaah's" the moment the little boy came on the screen. I do not agree with the people who would rate Stepmom as 'awefull', though I wouldn't rate it excellent myself due to the predictions. Stepmom is just one of those movies you go and see on a Sunday afternoon, when there's nothing else to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen the previews, and wanted to see this film from the first one I saw. I heard all of the buzz and was curious about this movie. I LOVED IT! Though many thought that the film would be a romantic comedy, it is not. However, the story of this family made up for the confusion. I thought that Julia Roberts was wonderful as the younger fiance of Ed Harris, and Susan Sarandon (as usual) was marvelous. The most touching thing to me was the developing relationship between Julia's character "Isabel" and the daughter "Ann." I have a stepmother, and it was funny to see an almost replica of myself on the screen. Some people thought that their relationship was unreal, but I can vouch, it can happen like that. Anyway, I wasn't expecting to cry, but still I did because the story touched me so much. I think that all women should see this movie. The acting is brilliant, and the little boy will make you want to take him home with you. GO SEE IT!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall well done, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because all the actors/actresses are favorites of mine, I would have seen it anyway, but I was especially curious when I heard that 5 screenwriters were on the credits. I agree with the comments that the movie was a bit too long. However, my biggest complaint is that while I loved the houses, scenes locations, decorating, etc., I found it somewhat unrealistic that given the well known fact that most everyday ex-wives lifestyles tend to downslide after a divorce - especially if they aren't working - well, you get the picture. Other than that, the scenes near the end, didn't prevent me from crying. It was also refreshing that the MAN in front of me was wiping his eyes (for those who only think women cry in movies.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good drama with good acting by Sarandon and Roberts and the children. Wasn't prepared for it to be as sad as it was. As a mother myself, some of scenes were heart-wrenching to say the least! The only complaint I have is that the movie made a couple of stabs at working mothers that made me flinch a little. In one scene Jackie pretty much states that working mothers are too selfish to be good mothers; that 'good' mothers would stay home with the kids. Then, Isabel's boss accuses her of being unfocused, etc. indicating that a working mother can't focus on her work because she's worrying about her kids. Both scenes sort of made me feel like working mothers can't be good mothers OR good workers. Anyway, good drama, real tear-jerker, loved Jackie's house!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the movie although it did catch me off guard a little. Seeing the trailers didn't give any hint to what was coming. Julia Roberts was great and I was a little disappointed in the character Ed Harris played. Not his performance, but the character. I know it's just a movie, but to leave your kids with your girlfriend so that you could go to work. How tacky!!! Does anyone know what Julia Roberts was talking about when she told the daughter about Snowblowing??? Everyone I've talked to that has seen the movie wants to know if I know. I haven't a clue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ok script, good actors, great performance....satisfying movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the previews for Stepmom, I thought it looked like a great movie to go see. I read some reviews before I saw it and it said that the film was a tearjerker. But, since I NEVER cry in movies, I thought I'd be ok...... This movie was overall very well done. I liked the script, but I wish the focus was a little more on the father (Ed Harris) and the kids, than just the 2 women. Ed Harris was ok as the father, but it wasn't his best performance to date. Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon were awesome (at least one of them should receive an Oscar nomination). I also thought the 2 kids did very good jobs in their roles. I reluctantly admit, I did cry, because this movie is VERY sad near to the end. So, brace yourself! But I do recommend this movie, because it is a wonderful drama that is beautifully acted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is basically self-explanatory. If you've seen thepreview, you know what it's about. But, there's one thing thepreview doesn't state: this movie won't live up to yourexpectations. Although it may seem like a funny, entertaining,possibly even poignant movie, it is actually very predictableand cheesy. I expected more with a seemingly good cast, but thisfilm is definitely one of Julia Roberts' lows. The script isweak; almost all of the lines in the so-called "touching" scenesare over-used and cliché. The best thing about this movie is therather adorable little boy that plays the 6-year-old son ofSusan Sarandon. But don't pay seven dollars for him - rent themovie if you think it's really worth it. Some may find it sad,but most will see past</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to have my blood suger level checked after seeing this movie. It was so saccharine, syrupy sweet that I think I may have contracted diabetes. While the performances are noteworthy, the material was horribly bad. For example, when Susan Sarandon tells Ed Harris that she has cancer, and he sits there for a second and then says "It shoulda been me, instead a'you." C'mon! Did the directors and writers ruminate on this line before shooting it? Did Ed raise his hands and say "Uh, guys---could we try a different line here? Like one that has some literary value?" It was like a cliche machine. I could almost tell you what the characters were going to say.For example--I'll bet you can finish the sentence: Sarandon, old, dying mom, to Roberts, new, incoming mom:"I got to have their past, but, you get...." (fill in the blanks. The rest of the flick was the same way)Gotta run, time for my insulin shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The all-star cast of this movie makes it well worth a visit to the movie theater and the stock you'll have to buy in tissue companies. Susan Sarandon's performance is breathtaking - she is perhaps one of the best actresses of our time. Eschewing vanity for performance, her acting is enhanced by her lack of external adornment. She sparkles on her own, but with outstanding performances by Julia Roberts (perfect as the new stepmom) and Ed Harris (his face is so wonderfully expressive - "What will we do without you?"), the entire movie is made even better. The child actors in this film are fabulous. In a word, this movie is fine, MIGHTY fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most awful movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of Julia Roberts, for me she's one of the last remaining great Hollywood icons. However, this film is probably one of the most dreadful movies I've ever seen and it's really beyond me how she could every agree to act in this movie. Something that really made me hate the movie, is the completely uncritically displayed behaviour of the father. There is just one word for such a guy and that is 'jerk'. He does not take care of his sick ex-wife, he does not take care of his kids, and he destroys the most promising career of a young woman, just to replace his boring and wrinkled wife with a younger model. Of course the new girlfriend steps in when the Mum needs treatment and Daddy is absent again (wonder why he can afford two enormously expensive houses but no babysitter), sure she even looses her job over this, and sure she's the selfless angel that meets every insult and bad mouthed comment with a smile, that throws away a successful career for someone else's kids; just because of looove. What a terrible and outdated gender cliché, and I'm sure no one over 16 will buy this story.If you haven't already been nauseated by this plot, you surly will be by the tacky dialogues and scenes, which if it wasn't enough already, are sugarcoated with a non-stop layer of cheesy background music. This film leaves you with the feeling of sticky caramel between your teeth and of a disgusting overdose of sugary candy in your mental stomach. The cancer illness of the mother is portrayed so believably as if a 40 BMI person was dying of anorexia. Seems like dying of cancer is just a piece of cake and mostly a matter of lying elegantly in some chair wrapped in a shawl. This is probably the most pathetic part of the movie. Unless you are really into unrealistic, blimpish, and corny movies, save your time and watch something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stepmom Falls Short From Reaching Its Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Chris Columbus continues to explore the family turmoil of divorce in the tearjerker Stepmom, a story that pits the birth mother against the new mother.This comedy drama stars Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, and Ed Harris together with Jena Malone and Liam Aiken.Jackie, a one-time book editor, is now the consummate soccer mom juggling the schedules of her two kids in her New York ranch outside of Manhattan. Her ex-husband Luke, who gets weekend custody of the kids, is living in the city with a woman half his age named Isabel, a high- fashion photographer with a strong sense of style. Since Luke is always away at work, the burden of getting the kids ready for school when they are with their father falls on Isabel, and she just isn't the nurturing type. The story heats up, however, when Jackie learns that she has cancer. Facing the horrors of medical tests and chemotherapy, she realizes that, should something happen to her, her kids will be left with this irresponsible Isabel as their mother, especially after Luke proposes marriage to her. What ensues is part parenting lesson, part competitive parenting, but 100 percent family bonding, as Jackie must learn to allow Isabel to be part of her world and her family.The movie manages to touch on that chord because it shows how an ambitious woman might feel hampered by the responsibility of children just because she's fallen in love with their dad.It's an issue that haunts millions of second wives everywhere, and Julia Roberts portrays that role extremely well. Susan Sarandon's performance as a mom about to be replaced by her ex-husband's new girlfriend has a lot of bite, and it's a shame the script opted to marginalize and trivialize her plight in its final reel.The film tries to avoid complexities in the screenplay and it wimps out in the end, solving the problem by giving Sarandon a terminal illness. Instead of allowing Jackie and Isabel's relationship to unfold on something less than a high note, the movie has to quell its best thing with a false payoff because it doesn't know what to do with real life. That is the reason why this film falls short its potential to have been a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Comedy, it stunk. It had only a couple of funny moments that were shown in the trailers - no other funny parts...In actuality, it is a tear jerker. I don't know why they classify it as Comedy or why the trailers gave the impression of a Comedy. As a real stepmom, myself, I was hoping to see a lighter-side comedy about relationships that can be difficult and sometimes pretty tough and even heartbreaking; instead, it was about a relationship that was forced/forged through tragedy - not much to laugh about in the tragic second half of the movie.That being said, it was well written and well executed and as a Drama it was really good. The acting was superb and the writing was excellent. I was disappointed because I had been in the mood for a Comedy when I watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waw. This is a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a movie that highlights the warmth of a mother's heart and hug. A movie that keeps one question coming up constantly on your mind: why should we deal with so much pains? This movie is full with emotions that your heart is going to welcome deeply and embrace them with pain. The main character is Susan Sarandon for no other character in the movie was capable of approaching her brilliance and performance. Through Susan's character we see a woman who is still in love with her husband, has to accept a new woman in his life and this same woman is competing with her on the love of her children. Not only that, she later discovers that she has cancer! Then, all the emotions of love, loss, death expectations and friendship, rise to the top and stir your feelings crazily.There are two particular scenes in the movie that are brilliantly directed by Chirs Columbus and performed by Sarandon: 1) the scene when Sarandon wakes up her daughter and gives her a ride on the horse (brilliant acting and beautiful music) 2) the scene when Sarandon watches her children starting to love Julia Roberts and she plays feelings of contradiction in her eyes where she is jealous and at the same time they must have a replacement after she goes. This scene shows the great performer Susan Sarandon is.It is a very deep story that anyone who didn't like has really missed its meanings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another watchable but uninspired film by Chris Columbus! The pace is uneven and plot contrivances abound. In fact, there is a ridiculous (MINOR SPOILERS) tragedy late in the film that feels artificially manufactured to induce tears. The plot is full of clichés which tend to grate. The performances are good however, with Susan Sarandon specially rising above the material. Julia Roberts seems a little overshadowed. Ed Harris has a small role. The kids are fine but seem a little too much like 'movie kids'. A certain spontaneity is missing from their performances. A mediocre watch.Overall 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stepmom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire) this is a pretty good family film. Basically Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' Liam Aiken) Harrison have had to cope with the divorce of their parents Jackie (Golden Globe nominated Susan Sarandon) and Luke (Ed Harris), and also the new woman in Luke's life, successful photographer Isabel Kelly (Julia Roberts). She does her best to treat the kids in a good way, as the "Stepmom" she is, but the job she loves gets in the way, and she doesn't want to drop it. Also, Isbael and Jackie do not get on too well because Jackie regards Isabel's efforts to look after the kids not good enough. The conflict between them is deepened when Jackie is suddenly diagnosed with cancer, which devastates Isabel when she finds out, and the same will go for the kids when she knows her chemotherapy has failed to work. Towards the end, it gets quite emotional as the kids express their feelings for their dying mother, and seem to get on a bit better with Isabel, and they have a final Christmas and photo. Also starring Lynn Whitfield as Dr. P. Sweikert, Darrell Larson as Duncan Samuels and Mary Louise Wilson as Mrs. Franklin. The performances are all good, the family story is always good, not too much sentimentality to make it cutesy, and one or two quite emotional moments. Julia Roberts was number 29, and Susan Sarandon number 25 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie disappointing. The battle between the ex-wife/mom and the new, younger girlfriend could have been a good movie. I don't appreciate that cancer in the family brings people together and functions as a shortcut to resolving conflict. Susan Sarandon ends up passing the torch gracefully to her replacement mom, Julia Roberts. It just seems too morally perfect. I found it sappy. But, of course, how can they resent each other when Susan Sarandon is dying, right? Hopefully, in reality, people find reasons other than grave illness to treat each other with respect and move on from a conflict. There's something either very romantic or very cynical about the movie's implication that mortal illness brings out the best in someone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is kind of hard to watch, mainly because I hate Susan Sarandon's character. She's mean-spirited, self-righteous, and self-centered. She's mad at her ex-husband, so she takes it out on Julia Roberts' character. This is understandable, but she does it at the expense of her children's well-being. She basically makes her family dysfunctional. When she finally dies of cancer, I don't feel bad for her. I feel bad for her kids. They're okay, although the girl is sometimes extremely unlikable. What bothers me is, they act like everything is okay because Susan Sarandon's character is dying. That would not happen in real life. That said, the movie is overall good. It's not boring, and it's touching if you can forget what a horrible person the mother is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>even worse than I expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hilarious account of the tribulations of a middle American family in whig the father has gone off with Julia Roberts - leaving grouchy Susan Sarandon behind to do her patchwork (she's a Mom, you see) - in her magnificent Victorian house. Far from being happy to be left with her two "adorable" children, Sarandon complains constantly - though her ex-husband seemed perfectly non-descript - but of course he was very caring really! An eye-opener on how the upbringing of children is perceived in the USA - apparently they have to be consulted about anything the parents to - even dying! When a tearful Mom tells the kids she has cancer, the 12 year old daughter starts screaming, because Mom has lied by not revealing her illness earlier (!!!!!) Hard to believe, isn't it? Although I suppose it is really a transfer of anguish. Similarly, it is apparently quite usual for 12 year olds to have boyfriends at school!! The parents when they hear of the kids' love-life (i won't go into the tedious details) don't say "Perhpas you should be studying", but just give "helpful" advice. I was riveted by the whole thing; I think it is meant to be a three handkerchief weepy, but I mainly laughed at all the peculiar behavior. Sarandon's right eyebrow was working overtime throughout, Ed Harris looked (as well he might) pretty overcome, Julia Roberts seemed constantly to be trying not to laugh (or maybe I misread her face?) All in all highly recommended - for all the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admired the two A list Actresses here, who didn't do the Hollywood thing but gave their all to this movie. Sarandon (the mother we would all like to have) and Roberts (the bimbo one we wouldn't ) prove they have talent in their respective capacities. The themes are strong ; divorce,raising kids,relationships,mid-life crises,jealousy/envy, etc. These are approached with candour and life. Ed Harris(another brilliant actor) is convincing as the father who's run off with "a bit of skirt". Julia Roberts tries her hardest to win the kids (and us)over and is still trying at the end. Susan Sarandon however sweeps through this picture gracefully leaving us clutching for support at her passing, we feel her pain, her betrayal by her husband and life(for dealing her the incurable disease), we feel her grief when she cuddles up to her daughter and tries to hold her memories close forever. We admire her bravery in accepting it all and the new woman in her children's life and she shows this best in the final portrait which puts Roberts as her equal in the family circle.Brilliant acting which only a mother could have carried out.StepMom is a 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the average 'chick flick'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I usually don't like to put films (or anything else) into neat little categories, Hollywood was pretty clearly aiming at the female demographic with this one. Of course, there's nothing wrong with this, since movies are targeted as a matter of course... who do you think goes to see "Spiderman" or "Terminator 2?"The movie is effective at tearjerking, and (as usual) emotions are somewhat manipulated here... again, nothing any more wrong with it than triggering an adrenaline rush when Yoda stands up and waves his lightsabre. Many times, people go to movies to feel emotions and to get a cathartic release. I did find myself teary-eyed at the appropriate moments... the film has high production values and good acting, and I allowed myself to get involved in this one.I agree with previous viewers that Susan Sarandon's character is mostly annoying (although with occasional moments of brilliance). I'm pretty sure this is both intentional and scripted to be that way. I like Sarandon, and especially in the film "Dead Man Walking" (I thought she was superb). The script of "Stepmom" is very mainstream Hollywood, but not in a "bad way." It's certainly better than a soap opera (which gives nobody catharsis, only voyeuristic addiction to phony stories).Overall, an entertaining family film in the genre of others like "Ordinary People," "Table For Five" and others. The DVD transfer is (to my eyes and ears) excellent, razor sharp with good color and definition and sounds great. 7/10, a definite rental if you enjoy movies like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For about the first half-hour of so Stepmom holds great promise. A year after successful middle-aged lawyer (Harris) divorces wife (Sarandon) we find him sharing his two school age kids and living with much younger beauty (Roberts). The tension is palpable; between husband and ex-wife, between kids and girlfriend, and especially between ex-wife and girlfriend. I thought this was going to be great, just bring it on home.Then the wings fall off, and the movie craters into the ground. It's almost as if the writers and director were given the first half-hour of the movie, and told "now go finish the movie, but make it unwatchable". Because that is what happens; the remaining hour of the movie is a painful flogging.The plot and dialogue are unpredictable only in their unbelievability. Does this stuff really happen? Do divorced, unemployed single mothers live in mansions, drive high-end automobiles, and own horses? Do writers and directors feel the need to string out multiple confessional scenes so they take up the last third of the movie? Is this supposed to be entertaining? Enlightening? What is going on here? No, better yet, get me out of here!Pity the poor actors, they give it their best, but this movie is a depressing loser.</fullReview>

Susan Surandon is a beautiful actress, who i have loved since Thelma and Louise. She gives a heart-warming performance in this film. Ed Harris also does good as the father in the film. I wish he would have more starring roles instead always having supporting roles. The performance that takes the cake is Julia Robert's. She gives a terrific performance and have a new respect for her as a serious actress. **** out ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie! :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read most of the positive/negative critiques on this movie on the internet. I can't possibly see why people would dislike Stepmom. They must be cold-blooded &amp; heartless I guess. This movie is no Oscar winning movie, like Terms of Endearment or Love Story or Brian's Song, but it's a good movie. Julia Roberts surprised me, because Pretty Woman and Steel Magnolias were the ONLY 2 movies she acted good in, then she had bombers, but Stepmom is one of her best. Susan Sarandon is a great actress &amp; it didn't surprise me that she did an excellent job in this movie. Ed Harris is Ed Harris, he's one of my favorite actors, from Sweet Dreams to Apollo 13. He's good in Stepmom. The daughter, Anna, did a very good job, her acting was right on and her emotions were true to life. Sarandon's character son did a good job of being goofy, he was the center of most of the funny lines in the movie. The oldies music was awesome, the scenery was beautiful, like when Sarandon &amp; her daughter went horseback riding at night &amp; the moon was shining on the snow, very beautiful. This movie is a MUST SEE, do NOT listen to these wanna be critics like James Bernadelli that gave it 1 1/2 star, what a joke. Go see it for yourselves!p.s. Negative critics that hated Stepmom, please step forward so I can give you a real true heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally manipulative unrealistic use of wonderful Sarandon's time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven members of my family went to see this movie at Christmas, because of an admiration for the cast and because of a divorce/remarriage situation within our family. We left disappointed on both levels. Although Sarandon and Roberts are wonderful (Harris seems to be phoning it in) the movie is too thin and unrealistic to support these women. In summary, an ex-wife reluctantly accepts the role of her ex-husband's new fiancee in her children's lives, then learns to appreciate her when a crisis occurs. There is potential, but the answers provided are too easy and lack context. Particuarly disappointing was the lack of context for all of these people. Where were the grandparents, the siblings, the girlfriends? If they were such great women, they should certainly have had more people in their lives. Without any context, the relationship between the two women is completely unrealistic. The movie also goes inevitably for the melodrama and tears, without exploring elements of the changes in these people's lives which could have been more interesting. There are far too many tearful scenes with the children, and far too few that demonstrate real understanding of life's difficulties, and particularly the challenges that the children face. I wish there were better scripts out there for these women.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1998 gave audiences two major moms dying pictures, one of them "One True Thing" with Meryl Streep and Renee Zellweger and the other "Stepmom." Chris Columbus directed this. There, that's all you need to know. Filmed like a T.V. sitcom but with the content of a Hallmark movie, it's paint by numbers film-making that works overtime trying to wrench tears from its audience. That it does is only because it's about a subject that would make anyone with a half-way functioning heart cry, not because of any skill on Columbus's part.Julia Roberts and especially Susan Sarandon do a fair job of keeping the overly-abundant sentimentality at bay, but they have to fight Columbus every step of the way.Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy expansion and remake of "No Sad Songs For Me"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a great star is able to make a final screen appearance that his or her fans realize is fitting their stature. Spencer Tracy did it with his final screen speech to Katherine Hepburn and the cast of GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER about the lingering passions in his elderly frame towards the woman he actually did love. Paul Muni did it too in his last film, THE LAST ANGRY MAN, giving a performance as a true humanitarian doctor in his final days. Laird Cregar did it in those concluding, unforgettable shots of his mad musician in "Hell" in the burning conclusion of HANGOVER SQUARE. And Margaret O'Sullivan did it as the terminally ill mother and wife determined to have her family secured by a worthy second wife (Vivica Lindfors) in NO SAD SONGS FOR ME.O'Sullivan left a small output of films compared to her fellow female stars of the 1930s - 1940s, but they were mostly good performances in such films as THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, THE GOOD FAIRY, THREE COMRADES. and THE MORTAL STORM. She never won the Oscar, but she is recognized as one of the finest actresses of her age. The ultimate tragedy of her life - the emotional troubles that led to her suicide in 1960 - reinforce the sense of loss in her curtailed movie career as much as the death of James Dean does for him or the cancer that killed Judy Holliday a few years after O'Sullivan died.The film NO SAD SONGS FOR ME was remade in 1998 with a first rate cast and expanded. STEPMOM demonstrates how a remake can help redefine the characters of the original film and even make them more interesting. In NO SAD SONGS FOR ME, O'Sullivan moves silently for most of the film to manipulate husband Wendell Corey into seeing Lindfors as a worthy replacement for herself. But this is a little hard to believe (though the acting of O'Sullivan makes it acceptable). Instead the remake forces Susan Sarandon (in the O'Sullivan part) to make 180 degree reversal for the sake of her ex-husband and kids. Instead of a placid household disrupted by on-coming tragedy, Sarandon's household is disrupted initially by her husband (Ed Harris) two-timing her with his new love Julia Roberts. Harris wants a divorce, and being a successful professional man he can give Sarandon a lot of money. But Sarandon is furious at the slap in her face and in the opening of the film she confronts both Harris and Roberts about their adultery. Her anger also spills over into resentment by her children (Jena Malone and Liam Aiken) who fully side with Mom. It is after the divorce that she learns the truth about her health problems. But there are methods of handling the cancer in 1998 unavailable to Margaret O'Sullivan in 1950. Methods like chemotherapy. Sarandon (who is determined to beat back her illness) tries these methods, and leaves the scene to explore these treatments. Meanwhile Roberts finds she is trying to maintain her photography career and to somehow overcome the resentment of the two step-children.Now all this additional material enables the main thrust of the original story to make a trifle more sense. For after Sarandon finds all the treatments to be unworkable she returns to see what can be salvaged in her limited remaining time. This means making an alliance with the suspicious Roberts...one that eventually does soften into a close friendship as they both find each other's finer qualities. Not that Sarandon is really happy at what is going to happen to her. In one of the film's best scenes she vents to Roberts her total anger that she will not be alive to see her daughter get married. The venting actually helps break down the final walls between the two women.Slowly, as Harris, Malone, and Aiken become aware of the impending tragedy, the family unit expands to make room again for Sarandon as she makes sure she and her children spend as much time together as possible. And Roberts makes sure that Sarandon's intentions for the two children are carried out (which enables her to finally win their trust and affections). The best moment in this section of the film is Roberts making sure that Malone is avenged against an obnoxious ex-boyfriend at her high school, where (with Sarandon's approval) Roberts uses a male model she knows and some special dialog (regarding a disgusting sex act) to humiliate the boy before his friends.NO SAD SONGS FOR ME was a great conclusion to a fine actress's screen career. STEPMOM was a first rate remake and expansion of that film enabling two of our finest current leading actresses to share the screen in two equally memorable parts.</fullReview>

And each time it is, I hate it more.The only characters I didn't want to punch and stab were the little boy and the future step mom: the dad was nonexistent and couldn't even try to hold his own against his mega-bitch of an ex-wife; the daughter was a whiny, lying, rude brat who YET AGAIN perpetuates the "Daddy's little girl who HATES every attractive woman next to him because Mommy Said So" stereotype; and Susan Sarandon's mom chara was one of the most overbearing, spiteful, misogynistic mother charas I've ever seen, who spoils her babies rotten to the point of making them completely detached from reality while practically abusing the unfortunate girl who's gonna "replace" her when she's gone, just because she commits the sin of being prettier, younger and with a modern mindset. And I'm supposed to feel sorry for her when she finally kicks the bucket, after all she has made others go through?

		<shortDescription>Step parenting tearjerker with some bad messages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I admit that I enjoyed this bittersweet tearjerker of a movie. Get out the Kleenex for the ending. There is nothing sadder than a mother saying goodbye to her children. However, on reflection, I have a few problems with its messages.First the story...Jackie and Luke have separated, and Luke has a new woman in his life, a beautiful young photographer named Isabel. Their two children, a young boy and a teenage girl, are forced to adjust to this situation and understandably cause their new step mom, Isabel, a lot of grief. Also understandably, Jackie becomes petty and spiteful when her children begin spending time with this new woman. To add to all this, Jackie is suddenly diagnosed with terminal cancer and sadly, must 'hand over' her beloved children to another woman, the step mom, to raise as she realizes she will not survive to complete this task herself. Eventually, Jackie and Isabel form a touching bond as they learn to trust each other.Really, it is a moving tale with wonderful performances by both the female leads. Susan Sarandon is compelling, first as the devoted but possessive mother, then the bravely suffering and dying cancer victim, Jackie. Some have called her a 'nasty earth mother', but this threatening new step mom wouldn't bring out the best in anyone (albeit Jackie agreed to this separation, making her husband fair game). Quite possibly she was actually nice before this rival appeared. Julia Roberts, always endearing in every role, elicits unlimited viewer sympathy as the well intended 'wicked step mom' who constantly tries her best but cannot seem to do anything right. It paints a vivid portrait of a common challenge faced by step parents.The husband, Luke, portrayed by Ed Harris, has admittedly (as another also noted) zero chemistry with Isabel and is almost a minor character. It's all about the women. Anna, the 12 year old daughter, is spoiled, typically self absorbed, and in dire need of discipline. She is nasty as all get out to poor Isabel. But no wonder, what girl needs her family life upset at that critical age? Who can blame her, especially with her mom encouraging both her children to cause trouble for their dad's new love interest? In fact, these two children shouldn't have to cope with step people in the first place. They deserve ONE stable home with their two biological parents, Jackie and Luke, not shuffled to and fro in order to meet the self absorbed needs of the very adults who should be putting their children's interests first. These parents realize that their separation has upset the kids' lives, so they basically let Anna get away with murder. Frankly, sympathetic as Julia Roberts' portrayal is, this is a situation Isabel brought upon herself in her choice of a partner who has recently separated and has children.Of course Jackie is the older, strict, conservative mother, while Isabel is the young, trendy, fun one. Isabel's stunt in hiring a handsome 'boyfriend' for Anna may seem cool, make herself popular, and win over the difficult step daughter, but it isn't the right values to teach. No wonder Jackie becomes angry. Isabel would make a fabulous fun big sister, but not a mother. She'll try to be Anna's friend, take her to rock concerts, and shop with her for trendy clothes but be afraid to discipline lest she lose favor. Also, the relationship formed between Jackie and Isabel is probably pretty unrealistic, cancer or not. Core feelings of jealousy in ex marital situations are VERY difficult to overcome (other than on screen), even for a dying woman coming to grips with the best interests of her children. The unpleasant relationship between the two women early in the movie is alas, the norm.The film implies that Jackie is misguided in her original thinking, that Isabel with her career cannot possibly care for her children as competently as she can, as a full time homemaker. Sorry, but I think Jackie has something of a point. She has no choice since she's dying, but in truth, these children's interests would be better served if they were raised by their full time, obviously devoted biological mother, as opposed to their career oriented step mom. Isabel may be portrayed as the 'nicer' of the two women here, but realistically she will have her hands full with a new husband and two new step children (one a teenager), plus her photography career. Something's probably going to come up on the short end of the stick, let's hope it's her job rather than these kids.Nice, touching story, but I grow weary of the trivializing of full time motherhood, and of films that portray divorce scenarios all warm and fuzzy, as this one does in the end. The children are not 'resilient' at all, but generally the ongoing victims for years and years, dealing with two homes and various step people. Society doesn't need movies conveying that really, if everyone works hard at it, divorce ends up fine for the kids. All too often it doesn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, but badly overdrawn, psychologically inept writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this maudlin, melodramatic fantasy, we have five main characters: The stepmom Julia Roberts), the mom (Susan Sarandon), the dad (Ed Harris), and two kids. The stepmother's role is the only one of the male roles to emerge faintly from one dimension, to resemble a live person. The mom is a controlling, spiteful, know-it-all, who also somehow manages to muster immense, flawless tenderness with her kids. The dad is just good. The daughter resembles a person; the son, some narcissist's self-image of himself in childhood, remarkably charming and good-natured. As I watched it, I figured, "This was written by someone with a godawful, but dead, obsessive-compulsive mother to whom he was overly close in childhood, whom he feels bad about hating now, especially since he likes his stepmom so much." The performances are excellent, but the characters are so incredible that this is more cartoon than drama. Some parts were so predictable and mawkish I just fastforwarded through them.</fullReview>

Now don't get me wrong, like my girlfriend did, emotions are necessary for a movie to be good. I can't stand movies, and it seems to be either the French, if subtitles can be emotional, or Hollywood that make these movies, that are obviously trying to suck me in by squirting tears in my eye. The whole movie was a magnanimous fairy tale. I would have called it, "Trouble in Never-neverland." Everyone lived in a beautiful house, with beautiful things, with lots of money, being beautiful themselves, having cute kids, having cool jobs, and even the damned dog was cute. Blah!! If someone in Hollywood is listening, drop the budgets and raise the quality. It's a good thing movies have a loud song during the ending credits to wake people up.Look to the horizon.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie around 11:30 at night, not knowing anything about it except for its previews which mis-market the movie. The movie was not lighthearted or realistic. For one thing, somebody could not have so drastic changes of mind in the space of a couple months. Another is that the parents would normally have paid more attention to the boy than they did. Every time it was "Stay in the car," or "You get a babysitter" or he was never mentioned for stretches of the movie. It seemed to center around the females of the movie, having Ed Harris be a moot point connecting the two mothers. It was extremely sexist against men, almost saying that we have no troubles, or if we do, they are only brought in by women! Also, it was way too long. Two hours and twenty minutes with only one preview, so about 2:10 to 2:15 is way too long for a movie of this type. I was extremely bored, and to keep my attention I noticed its flaws. This is a total chick flick, and if they must drag men to it, they must. Personally, I cannot recommend it, but if they had cut about 20 to 30 minutes from it, I might have actually liked it. I do agree that part of the problem was its redundancy, but maybe it was just because nobody knew how to write an original script.P.S. The only good character was Susan Sarandon when she was hateful toward Julia Roberts. The ending was the worst for her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Would Scriptwriters Do Without Terminal Illness?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stepmom gets off to quite a promising start. Luke Harrison, a successful lawyer, is divorced, and the film depicts the bitterness between his former wife, Jackie, and his new girlfriend, Isabel, with Luke himself caught between the two women. (Rather surprisingly, the part of Luke is a relatively minor one; the film concentrates much more on the two women's relationship with each other). The two have quite different personalities. Jackie is a full-time mother and housewife(she has two young children by Luke), whereas Isabel (much the younger of the two)has a successful career as a photographer for an advertising agency. Jackie is rather conservative, Isabel more trendy. (Jackie, for example, likes classical music, while Isabel is a rock fan).What raises the film, in its opening scenes, above the ordinary, is the subtle way in which the two women are portrayed by Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts. Perhaps unusually for a film of this type, the thrusting career woman Isabel is the more sympathetic of the two. For all Jackie's "Earth Mother" pretensions, she comes across as a bitter and rather unpleasant character. Although Isabel was not the "other woman" in Luke and Jackie's divorce, Jackie nevertheless resents her presence in Luke's life, and uses her children as a weapon in her battle. The children, particularly the girl Anna, do not get on with Isabel, and Jackie never misses an opportunity to encourage them in their dislike.The film's turning-point comes when Luke proposes to Isabel and, at about the same time, Jackie is diagnosed with cancer. Jackie realises that Isabel will be playing a permanent role in her children's life and, as her own disease might prove fatal, that in future Isabel may possibly be the only mother the children will have. The rest of the film tells the story of how the two women come to terms with, and learn to respect, one another.Unfortunately, the film starts to decline from this turning-point onward. The pace becomes fatally slow, and a potentially interesting story of the tensions arising upon the break-up of a family unit descends into soap opera. I sometimes wonder what scriptwriters would do without terminal illness to rely on as a plot device. It is, however, a difficult device to use successfully; most films that rely upon it fall into the trap of maudlin sentimentality. Stepmom is perhaps better than some, but this is largely due to the skill of the three main leads, Roberts, Sarandon and Ed Harris as Luke. There is little in the script that would distinguish the film from the average "disease of the month" TV movie, except that a TV movie would perhaps move at a faster pace and would not draw out the agony to such an extent. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strictly a Hollywood Formula (TM) outing, heavy-handed, maudlin, and completely unoriginal. I read a review calling this the '90s version of "Kramer vs. Kramer," but at least KvK was at the time fairly original. The two lead actresses tried valiantly to keep the film upright, but with a script like this, the effort was in vain.I have to admit that I did enjoy counting the continuity errors in this one (does anyone have a final count on how many different "engagement" rings Roberts ended up wearing?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With two of my favorite actresses involved, I still found it to be a very disappointing movie. In the first part, Susan Sarandon was overbearing, demanding, and petty so it was difficult to feel an appropriate response of sympathy when it was called for: I found it difficult to try to care about what happened to her. Julia Roberts was whiney or in tears over every snide remark or slight. The only time I felt emotionally involved was when the two women finally sat down face to face and discussed their views of what a wedding day may bring. Ed Harris was believable as the man in the middle, the son was adorable and the daughter should have had so many time-outs she'd still be in the corner!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.When I stumble across a film like this, I wonder about the genre engineering that went into it. `Let's see,' I can imagine the discussion: `a standard sickness/death movie but this time the redemption will be tied to making piece with a divorce. That gives us a chance to do lots of minidramas involving the children and the father's new lover.'Nodding heads all around. But the one person in the room who thinks expresses concern that no one will come to such a film despite the attractive demographic engineering. This person suggests that the girlfriend be a parallel center of the film, that they get an endearing draw, like Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan. This way, the relentless drama can be balanced by cuteness and comedy. In due course, the group agrees on splitting the film, essentially divorcing the two threads: death and charm.The two kids have to be split too: one to be serious (with some minidrama in her own life) and one to be comic, pulling all sorts of enchanting pranks.We end up with a blended film from blended genres about a blended family. It works about as well as your average blended family.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first two thirds of the film are quite clearly stated by the sixty-second trailer. The big screen, unexpurgated, version serves only to make these loathsome and hateful people (well portrayed by Susan Sarandon and Jena Malone) more substantial and more tangible. The events of the last third of the film are intended, I assume, to turn around our perception of these characters and somehow make them more endearing. Well, for me, it just didn't work. Although the acting was at least competent, the apparent moral of the story of absolute forgiveness under adversity was just not plausible.If you are a staunch Julia Roberts fan you may appreciate her portrayal of the unquestioning Isabel but are not likely to enjoy the abuse her character must endure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and Luke (Ed Harris) are divorced with 2 kids Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken). He's been seeing Isabel (Julia Roberts) a top fashion photographer. Jackie and Isabel clash over mothering styles. It all comes crashing down when Jackie is diagnose with cancer.These characters seems too fake to me. I think it may be Julia Roberts' fault. I can't really picture her as this character. Maybe it's her star power, or maybe it's that she doesn't play the young trophy girlfriend that often. And I never could imagine Sarandon and Harris as parents to two little kids. There is something wrong with the family makeup that I can't quite put a finger on.Director Chris Columbus doesn't do a good job at making this a more compelling movie. It starts too light heartedly with too many joke attempts. I think it's a mistake to try for the comedic route. It's even worst since the attempts fail. Then comes the constant fighting, bickering, and incessant back biting which really put me off. Then comes the cancer.This is a miss for me. I just don't really feel it. Maybe people of divorces relate to this movie more. I think there's a great possible movie idea to dive deeply into the mother character. This one is trying too hard to see it through Isabel's eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really didn't like this movie. I felt Julia Roberts was completely miscast even though she acts so excellently as always. I didn't like that yellow hair - was it a wig? It made her look about 12 - seemed very inappropriate beside the very much middle aged adulterer who's her lover. His strenuous attempts to keep up with his young girlfriend are embarrassing as it is without her looking a teenager.I don't like this adultery theme anyway - although clearly it had to be in the story as developed. The relationship between Roberts and the adulterous husband doesn't work at all - heaven knows what she'd see in her old lover given she appears to be meant to be so young. Roberts certainly did her very best, but there's no spark at all between her and the actor who played her lover. Every time these two appeared together I hoped to see the Roberts character tell him she was dumping him for a more worthy and attractive and younger guy but she didn't. Inexplicably, she appeared to like being with him.So that was a bad start. And of course, given the theme, Roberts had to stay with the guy.This story's saving graces were the always attractive and watchable (in spite of the hair) Roberts doing her best with an unsympathetic part and Sarandon doing an excellent job as the dying mother/cheated wife. Whilst I didn't like the story, these two on screen together or apart were excellent. We didn't need the boring husband/lover at all except he happens to be father to his ex-wife's kids.Towards the end of the movie, as the mother was more and more sick, I simply gave up watching. I really wasn't into watching mother and mistress with selfish husband now having them both trapped together under the same roof and him able to live there too, whilst mother dies gradually on screen and the kids have to cope with this rather nauseating menage a trois. I guess it was worth a try making a movie with this theme and sometimes it works, sometimes not. Don't be put off by my comments if the theme interests you because the ladies act so well. You can much of the time ignore the male jerk in the middle.The mistress realises she is going to have to cope with her lover's kids after his wife is gone even though not wanting to have children herself. The kids play her up, and are clearly distressed in the early part of the movie by their father's to them hurtful and also embarrassing behaviour with this young woman. It was neat though very depressing to time the story so that the cheated wife has to live through watching her replacement taking over because she herself is dying, rather than the more conventional new wife turning up after mother's dead to take over rebellious miserable kids. It makes for a tear-jerker if this is your kind of movie. I turned the movie off about 15 mins before the end. I decided there wasn't going to be any kind of "surprise" and I'd had enough of the selfish "I want it all" husband and the poor dying woman.One of those movies I wish I hadn't bothered to watch. 7 stars for the acting of the kids and the ladies. For the story, 5 stars as it had some merits. Only two stars for the director. None at all for the husband.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional, like it's supposed to be, but that doesn't hide the flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During my first year and second semester of high school, I was forced to watch this movie in a class which involved various things, including lessons in family life and peers, so this movie fit. From what I remember, it certainly wasn't fun when I first watched it, but I didn't see it in what I thought to be a comfortable place. However, it's been six years since then, and I recently rented it to watch on my own free will. I think it was more pleasant watching it alone in my basement, and I certainly can't say I was bored for the most part, but I could still see some serious flaws.Jackie and Luke Harrison are a divorced couple who had two kids while they were together named Anna and Ben. Now that they are divorced, Luke is currently dating a significantly younger woman named Isabel Kelly, who is a professional photographer. When it comes to parenting, Isabel is highly inexperienced, so it's not easy for her to look after the kids when she is left to do so, and her job sometimes gets in the way. In addition to that, the kids don't like their step-mom, and Jackie is sometimes disgusted by Isabel's inability to look after the kids properly, despite how much she may try, so the two women don't tend to get along so well. However, when Jackie is diagnosed with cancer, which could mean she won't live much longer, she must try to work things out with Isabel and family.Playing the song, "Under Pressure", by Queen, while Isabel wakes up and has to rush the kids out of bed was a good way to start off the film. After that, I found quite a bit of tension in the film to keep me intrigued, but that didn't stop me from noticing some pretty lame moments. This includes some of the dialogue, and a poor attempt at comedy I can think of when Ben burps and Anna says, "Oh, I hate when you do that, I can smell your breakfast!" Isabel's advice for Anna on how to get back at her nasty ex-boyfriend is also rather poorly thought out. One of the things she suggests she says to him is, "I'm not going to waste my time on some loser who doesn't even know what snowblowing is." Now, it would have been worse if Isabel had actually told Anna what snowblowing is, and since this is not an R-rated film, it's obviously never mentioned what it means, but this part is still pretty stupid. Having a 12 year old character talk about snowblowing may have worked in a really raunchy comedy, but not in a drama! Lastly, there's not much to like about the characters, including Anna with her bitterness and insults, and Jackie, who does something pretty cruel to Isabel with that Pearl Jam concert!Now, like I said, I certainly can't say I was bored for the most part when I last watched this movie. I may have even gotten a lump in my throat towards the end, but due to certain problems with some of the characters and the writing, I feel I may have been cheated by the film. I didn't exactly feel it was all really worth it, even if some parts are done well. 5/10 just MIGHT be a BIT too low, but not by much. Some parts confused me, and sometimes even put a puzzled look on my face. It may have had a lot of potential that wasn't reached. I'm sure this movie has made many people cry, which I noticed in that high school class, and I don't hold anything against these people. I'm sure it would have made me cry if I were more emotional. However, that still doesn't change my opinion that "Stepmom" is a lacklustre drama which could move you, but could also possibly leave you wondering what for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of Susan Sarondon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Susan Sarondon makes an indelible mark in this movie like she always does. Though the movie seemingly captured the emotional difficulties of Julia's rather than Susan's character, I felt it was the emotional toughness of Susan that binds this entire movie together. The movie's centerpiece is the relationship between the two women, but Ed Harris's character could have been given little more prominence; I felt he went through the turmoil more than the two women combined. Julia is strong yet vulnerable; she shows her resolve to win over the children's hearts more than once, and she does.But ultimately, it is Susan who scores over. Every time Anna and Ben (her children) look up to her, she sets an example of how a mother should be. In the opening scene, when she says "I'll handle it from here", it becomes clear that she is going to handle the film as well. When she discloses her illness to her children, Anna goes wild that Susan didn't tell her earlier, but Susan knows that she'll eventually accept it. Despite all her toughness, she shows she is one among us by accepting her fear that her children might forget her. Finally she knows that her children are ready to accept Isabel (Julia), so she accepts her as well.I won't accept Susan's character any other way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good plot, terrible characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Stepmom' had the potential to be a good film, tackling such meaty issues like terminal illness, parental loss and step-parenting, but to actively engage the audience with such a plot you need to have interesting and likable characters. Sadly, this was an ingredient this film lacked.The film centres on divorced couple Jackie and Luke and their two children, twelve-year-old Anna and seven-year-old Ben. Luke is engaged to be married to vivacious, career-woman Isabel and neither his ex-wife nor his children are exactly pleased for him. But when Jackie is diagnose with terminal breast cancer, she forces herself to befriend Isabel and attempts to groom her to take over as 'mother' when she eventually dies.I think Susan Sarandon is an excellent actress but in this film, I just loathed her character of Jackie. I'm a female so I usually I can empathise with the female characters in films like this and how they must feel as if they are being cast aside by the father of their children to make way for a younger, bubblier woman. But Jackie is someone who I found very hard to identify with; she was just so brash, rude and indulged the children to the point where they were spoilt rotten. In one scene, Ben wanders off while in Isabel's care and when found instead of comforting him then scolding him for going off by himself, Jackie is too intent on placing full blame on Isabel when surely this child should be disciplined too. Jena Malone's Anna is, quite frankly, just a self-centred brat. She is obnoxious and desperately in need of a good shaking but it's no wonder she is like this given her parents let her away with murder. Then there is Ben, who is played by the adorable little Liam Aiken. However, cuteness aside, this child is startlingly egotistical that his precociousness is wearing after a while.Luke, played by Ed Harris, comes off slightly better although the character does seem weak and rather a push-over, never ready to stand up to Jackie or clamp down on the cocky madam that is Anna. In fact, it is Julia Roberts' Isabel who is the only really likable character in the film as she strives to not only help the children accept her but willingly agrees to Jackie's plan to step in as the maternal figure.That said, the final scenes are poignant as we see the children cope with their mother's inevitable death and how the unconventional family finally band together when times get tough. A bit more trouble could have been spared to actually make Susan Sarandon look terminally ill; in this film, she looked as healthy as an ox.As I said, the plot is intriguing but there are other films which have done it and done it better. Check them out before coming back to this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stepmom is a story that is very common for quite a few households in our quick-turnaround society today. Mom (Susan Sarandon) and Dad (Ed Harris) are divorced and Dad has a hot new honey (Julia Roberts). The kids from the marriage are having a difficult time adjusting to all the time that Isabel (Roberts) is spending with Luke (Harris). Through the beginning half of the movie we witness the normal struggles that one would expect in this type of relationship. The daughter rebels against Isabel since she feels she is replacing her mother. The son is a little more tame to Isabel to her face, but attempts to cast magical spells to her into a permanent sleep behind her back. Around the midway point comes the patented mid-point twist, that mom Jackie (Sarandon) has cancer and is losing her battle. This is meant to add some extra depth to the relationships. We'll talk later if it works. Jackie can't keep it secret forever as she grows weaker and weaker and eventually shares her secret with Dad, Hot New Honey and the kids. We watch as she withers up from her Chemo treatments. I hope I'm not blowing the big surprise for you in saying that in the end, Jackie passes to the great beyond, but before she goes, she passes the proverbial torch to Isabel to take care of her children and provide that mother role in her life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Waste!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one sees the names of Susan Sarandon, Ed Harris, and Julia Roberts listed as stars of a film, one expects at least a modicum of competence. But that is all you get with this disaster -- a modicum, a touch of the abilities, wasted here, of the three players. Each of this trio offers a moment or two of believable histrionics. Nonetheless, the utter misguided manipulations of the ridiculous script fail them at every turn. For sheer banality, Stepmom is the model. This film is the kind of work that turns off those that have been coaxed to see a 'soap opera'. All of this is quite disheartening, because this film indicates a waste of the 'time' that the three principals may have used for something a mite more tolerable. Of course, one understands the fiscal lures of the enterprise, but, for the moviegoer, the knowledge that Roberts-Sarandon-Harris were paid well does not negate the horror of the venture. (Note - the young boy in the film is its sole major virtue.) This remains a film where one can say that the camera-work was clear...and, then, search for something else that merits attention.</fullReview>

Roberts is okay, but you can't help wondering why she would want to be with Ed Harris who looks like he could be her dad. Gross. The only redeeming quality to the whole movie is Jena Malone who is a superb actress no matter what crap of a script she is given to work with. I think this movie put her on the map of faces to watch for. If you are looking for a good movie, look for one with Jena in it. Ugh. I got to watch this movie twice in succession on TBS while typing a paper and it didn't get better the second time.

		<fullReview>Upon this film's release, every woman that I knew told me, "That movie mad me cry." Although Stepmom wasn't my ideal movie choice, I figured that I'd give it a try considering that I have a soft spot for movies that can conjure up so much emotion in so many people. After the first two seconds of this movie I realized that it was going to suck, you know the feeling I'm talking about. Julia Roberts plays the hip new stepmom, while Susan Sarandon is the ugly old real mom who was divorced by Ed Harris. How does one go from Susan Sarandon to Julia Roberts? ...actually, what am I saying, that makes perfect sense. Julia Roberts looks good. However, her character tries so hard to make Ed Harris' children like her that she loses all integrity. The little boy in the movie did not add to the movie's cute story line. Speaking of story lines, this movie's story sucked! I was bored from the start to the finish, and did not even manage a single tear. In fact, I had to ask people what made them cry because I didn't see what was worth crying over. Supposedly it was the ending that got to them. If you like watching movies that make you want to puke, watch this one. However, if you sincerely enjoy heartwarming films with a tinge of heart ache (Oprah fans I'm talking to you!)- watch this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really did like this film, I do occasionally get sucked into things like this especially if the cast is good eg: Terms of Endearment, Steel Magnolias. The one problem I did have with this film (apart from Anna being the child from hell at times) was the fact that the children were looked after by Isabel so often. If the father had to be away on business for the weekend why on earth did the children still have to go and stay with Isabel? Isabel had to do a photo shoot in Central Park, which by the way was her job, while father of children, Luke was away, however she still got dumped with the kids. I found this aspect totally unbelievable. Having come from a family where access visits are normal, I know this would never have happened. If she was looking after them while Luke was there I could understand it, though it didn't happen like that. I did also think that Ed Harris was miss-cast, he was rather wooden and not really good looking enough to have landed someone like Isabel.On the whole I felt there was too much criticism directed at Isabel which was uncalled for, but due to the performance of Julia Roberts it was quite enjoyable to watch and yes it was a bit of a tear jerker, not to the extent of previous movies mentioned though.</fullReview>

Stepmom is a gripping hard core pron starring Susan Sarandon and Jeff Daniels. My favorite part was clearly when B-actor Jim Foley got mugged by a crew consisting of Vin Diesel, Seth Green and Barry Pepper. If you have seen Stepmom and do not agree with my review, go to hell.

		<shortDescription>"A real heart warmer"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stepmom is the usual senario of a divorced family with and "evil" stepmom. This is what the audience is meant to believe by the young teenage daughter caught in the middle . The movie tackles real life dramas, mixing in humour, sadness and heatwarming moments brought on by the concequences. It represents the hardship of a new person entering a family that has always been close knit and explores the new relationships taken on by the family. Anyone who is a fan of Julia Roberts will agree that this is one of her best, showing her motherly side and the way the relationships build with the new family as the movie progresses. To me Stepmom is a movie for all to enjoy, whether its a young teenager having to deal with the heartbreak of divorce, an older adult being pushed away from their children or a new comer to an already made family. If you are a person who likes feelgood and dramatic movies with a touch of humour to brush it of then Stepmom is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STEPMOM, to me, is a very touching, moving, tear-jerking, and hilarious film. I didn't laugh out loud, though. I laughed on the inside. The one person I really couldn't stand at times was Anna (Jena Malone). This was because of her attitude and the way she treated Isabel (Julia Roberts) most of the time. My favorite quotes of this movie are, "Anna! You do not run out on your mother," and, "I never said I was June f*****' Cleaver!" I was thoroughly moved when Jackie (Susan Sarandon) said, "Oh, sweetie, it's okay to miss me." Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, "I thought everyone involved in this movie did a superb job." Now, in conclusion, I recommend this touching, moving, tear-jerking, and hilarious film to anyone who's a fan of Julia Roberts. When you see it, prepare for lots of laughter and tears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is dull, it moves at a pace that would lose to sloths, and is stupidly manipulative. OK, Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon do decent jobs with the material but there's very little to like about this film. There are so surprises, no real tension or conflict (it is clear from the start where these two women are heading), and the children - while theoretically the centre of the film - become increasingly irrelevant to the goings-on. My vote 5/10 and all the points were for the cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film, despite many problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very enjoyable movie, which is no small feat considering there are two major flaws. The biggest problem is how formulaic this film is from start to finish. I'm sure that most viewers knew how the film would end (and how it would get there) about ten minutes into the picture. The other big problem is Susan Sarandon's character, a person who was easy to hate. However, even with these big mistakes and some other small ones, this is still a great movie. Julia Roberts was hugely appealing, Ed Harris and Sarandon were solid as always, and even the kids were quite effective. Plus, there were several humorous moments, and the sadder scenes were equally effective. I know that my review hardly reads like a glowing recommendation, but this really was an entertaining film, flaws and all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected a lot more out of this movie than I got out of it. Although the two actresses perform very well together, and I got special enjoyment of watching their considerable acting talents go head-to-head in their argument scenes, I was completely unable to lose myself in the movie. I found Sarandon's character to be completely cold, unlikable, and unsympathetic. I certainly understand in retrospect why she wasn't the most relaxed, upbeat character ever written, but the things she did to Roberts' character are so inexcusable that it completely erased any sympathy I had for her. It also struck me that some scenes could have used more explanation. For example, what was it that triggered Jackie's change of heart toward Isabel? Why was the scene at the children's play even included, implying a bond between the women, only to have them back to their conflicting selves in the next scene? Overall, I thought the film could have been a lot better. It was cliched (but without the typical cliched ending of a movie of this type), it did very little to make me care at all about the characters, and it just struck me as a weak attempt at a movie such as "Beaches" or "Terms of Endearment." I hope to see Roberts and Sarandon go head-to-head in a movie that is more deserving of their talents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>haven't hated a movie this much since...hmm, let me think...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a mess. What a horrible movieaccompanied by an overbearing soundtrack, hitting every Kleenex-sponsored cliche along the way. I can't remember a movie I've hated as much as I hated "Stepmom". Maybe "North"...no, even that was less offensive than "Stepmom".Who thought the audience would even begin to identify with these characters? The husband and girlfriend live in a multi-million-dollar Manhattan apartment, while the ex-wife lives on a palatial country estate. They take time off from their overpaid jobs to ferry the kids around in Range Rovers. What percentage of the audience identifies with these characters' "problems"?We see in the trailer how senselessly vicious the ex-wife is (the Pearl Jam tickets), but there's much, much more senseless meanness...and she's mean for almost the entire movie. Even after she learns about Her Terminal Illness (puh-leeze!), she continues spewing venom at the husband and girlfriend whenever she's on-screen. And always in front of the children, which may explain why they're so horrible as well.About these kids, the dislike I felt for them was on a par with what I felt for the daughter in "Hope Floats", or the slicked-back friend in "North", or any Macauley Culkin character. They started the movie horrible, and they stayed horrible throughout...oh, they behaved through the phony tear-jerking ending, but does anyone think these brats have suddenly turned into little angels?Ed Harris is the husband, and Julia Roberts is the girlfriend. They had about as much chemistry as...anyone remember the romance between Roberts and Nick Nolte in "I Love Trouble"? I recall reading a review that said when those two characters kissed, it was like two blocks of wood knocking together. The phrase applies here, too."Stepmom" is a horrible movie. It's not even funny in its awfulness. It's offensive to think that someone paid millions of dollars to get this film made...someone thinks the movie-watching public is so brain-dead that they'll pay to see phony, blatantly manipulative treacle like this. &gt; &gt;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I accept that I may have been a "victim" of a contrived story line. It tugs HARD at the heart strings. But, I didn't think it manipulated me. The reason is simple. Some stories deserve my emotional attachment. The most obvious story is real life. The second most obvious story is a story that is portrayed as close to real life as possible.How is that done? Very simple. Great acting - which this story had. Believable characters - which this story had. And, realistic situations - which this story had.Best of all, it revealed, unlike any other movie I have seen, the enormous emotional tension that happens between parents and step parents as well as the anger that it creates in the children. Everyone was at one time or another unlikeable, and lovable at the same time in this movie. They were all human beings dealing with a very difficult situation the best they could. Being a step parent, I understood exactly what the issues were and fully appreciated the dilemmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I said BUT. I'll get to but WHAT later."Stepmom" is indeed a tear-jerker, and many tears are jerked during the course of the movie. It is, after all, about a dying mother (Sarandon) making sure the torch is passed on for her ex-husband's (Harris) new wife (Roberts) to take care of her two children.That much we understand, and there are several scenes of adjustment between all parties, many serious questions dealt with (though most of the answers are about as deep as a Hallmark card) and tears shed on-screen about every 5 - 6 minutes or so. Not that this is a criticism; even though Columbus directed this as well as "Nine Months" and the first two "Home Alone" movies, I didn't go in expecting Robin Williams or Joe Pesci to pop up unannounced, bashing each other in the head. Maybe a little more gallows humor, perhaps? But that's just nit-picking: the tears are shed honestly here. My God, who wouldn't be bawling in this situation?Now, here comes the BUT.SPOILER...But here is what gets me. THE MOVIE ENDS BEFORE SARANDON DIES. No fancy funeral, no chance to see if or how Roberts adjusts on her own with the kids and Harris, and no angelic spirit of the departed Sarandon looking down and watching with an approving smile at her family as Roberts tends to them. Not that I'm being morbid but as the man said, if someone coughs in the first reel you expect to see them laid out for observation in the last. ...END OF SPOILERAs it is, it may be a "chick flick", but a very well-done "chick flick". Who better than Sarandon and Roberts as the respective wife and "Stepmom" of the title? If you're a fan of either, go check it out. You'll laugh a little, cry a lot.Seven stars. Maybe they're setting up for a sequel?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When watching this film I often laughed, but it is not like you think. This film was horrible. It is hard to believe it took five screen writers to make this film. The dialogue by itself was enough to make cringe. And as for the plot, it seems that Hollywood as developed a death equals tears theory. Writers, if they want audiences to cry, simply kill someone. The same technique was used in Patch Adams, another stinker. Frankly, I think it is crap. Films should be subtle and not force its tears on viewers like an used car salesmen.

		<shortDescription>Not so much a movie as a series of scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has some great scenes and wonderful acting, but unfortunately the whole does not add up to the sum of all the parts.Sarandon's Jackie had me pumped up and yelling at her right off the bat, but the hate she had for ex-husband Luke and his new love, Isabel, got old really fast, as did the daughter's anger about the divorce and decision to make Isabel's life miserable.Ed Harris's Luke was severely underdeveloped, seeming to only be there as a means of bringing Isabel into the picture. The proposal scene was brilliant, but that's about as good as it gets for Ed.The film could have done without Jackie's illness, especially considering the title. Isn't it just possible that Jackie could have reconciled her feelings about the divorce and Isabel without actually finding out she is dying?The film gets a 9 for some very nice, touching dialogue - such as Jackie's talks with her children at Christmas and the aforementioned proposal. However, it falls short as an actual movie. I guess the ending is supposed to confirm for us that Jackie has accepted Isabel into the family, which we knew she would - after all, it's Hollywood. What it really did was leave me cold.One more thing: forget the tagline. Isabel seems at least a little "there for" Jackie, but Jackie is never there for Isabel until she realizes she is more or less in need of someone to pass her torch onto. Otherwise, she is strictly against her and constantly looking for ways to cut her down or point out where Isabel messed up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the winter of the movie, and also the winter of her life, she begins to change....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julia Roberts( Pretty Women) plays a photographer, Isabel, who is dating a divorced man Luke, Ed Harris, (The Truman Show). She is extremely nice and patient and kind with his kids, Anna, Jena Malone, (For Love of the Game); and Ben, Liam Aiken (The Object of My Affection ). Jackie, is played by Oscar winner Susan Sarandon (Dead Man Walking) is a jealous woman and goes out of her way to be mean and harass Isabel. She is nasty! I am so glad that my husband and I both married for the first time and remain married after twenty-one years. I am not sure if I would nor could put up with Jackie's insults and two step kids, specially Anna. The interesting part in the movie is that in fairy tails the step mom is mean and the mom is the "nice to every person," in this movie, to the contrary, mom is nice to her kids, but wicked to everybody else around. It takes some doing to get that mean, I think. Unfortunately I have met people just like that! Unbelievable! The photography is nice! I like a movie that shows the changing of seasons! I just love the change of seasons. But when fall is coming in this movie, Jackie finds out that she has cancer. But in the winter of the movie, and also the winter of her life, she begins to change and has to accept the fact that she is leaving and Isabel will take her place. Then they become surrealistically close. Unheard of, but much dreamed of a type of situation I would imagine. The music is cool! The acting is good as Julia Roberts was nominated for and won the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for the favorite actress, Susan Sarandon, for Golden Globe and Blockbuster, the two kids Young Artist Award: Jena Malone Best Performance in a Feature Film; Young Actor Age Ten or Under: Liam Aiken. I have the tape and enjoy watching it. Especially after the first time when one can catch up with the characters. The more I watch it, the nastier mom gets. She gets really annoying. Susan is such a great actress! She is my favorite character in this movie because her nastiness is full of nuances. She is nasty in every way imaginable! Favorite Scenes: Horseback riding, the kids dramatization:: the map of America with all the kids dressing like immigrants. Kids and mom singing together.. When Luke asks Isabel to marry him. It is so creative!!! Lovely scenes! Favorite Quotes: Jackie says to Luke: " You are a great father! I never gave you a chance to find out". Jackie:" Winning without dignity or grace is not winning!"</fullReview>

Susan Sarandon as the ex-wife and Julia Roberts as dad's new love interest are excellent, as are Jena Malone and Liam Atkin as the children. Ed Harris as the husband has little to do but flash his pearly whites and dimples. Lynn Whitfield, a vastly underrated and beautiful actress, is wasted as Sarandon's doctor.On the other hand, I find it difficult to imagine two beautiful women such as Ms. Roberts and Ms. Sarandon fighting over Ed Harris.I also find it hard to believe that the average American family has two successful professionals earning high six figure(or more)salaries, an ex-wife jetting around the country for expensive cancer treatments that most of us couldn't afford, maintaining two large estates and driving two Land Rovers and a Mercedes.Having said all of that, I did give the movie a "7" based on the superior screenplay and acting of the four principals mentioned above.</fullReview>

Unlike theirs, Sarandon - Roberts competition was quite respectful though. And yet, from my point of view, Big screen was nevertheless rather a small spot for those two stars to settle on amicably and with anticipated triumph. Doubled power did advance the vehicle commercially however interior luxury wasn't that obvious. Original emotional potential still remained undisclosed after a last shot had vanished. It was supposed to be a drama but I failed to recognize anything but a duel. They should have followed a suit of their 'One true thing' colleagues and booked the sky for one star only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Susan Sarandon is one of the finest actresses working today. Why then, does she need to appear in an old fashioned manipulative tear jerker like Stepmom? I wish I knew.The sad thing is, Stepmom could easily have been a better movie. It takes a common problem facing many women today that Hollywood has never touched on: that of being a stepmother. The problem arises when the movie wants to be about the real mother almost as much and eventually much more. Julia Roberts, one of our most overrated actresses, starts out the film trying to deal with being a stepmother to her new boyfriend's (Ed Harris) two young children Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (). The movie shows her battles with 's icy ex-wife and uber-mom Jackie (Susan Sarandon).When it comes to being a mother, Jackie can do no wrong. She lives in a house that Martha Stewart would envy, has her children's schedules memorized and carries three copies of emergency phone numbers. It's actually scary. Sarandon is the perfect mom, never a hair out of place, never an untucked shirt. Roberts is a terrific photographer, although she only seems to work for 20 minutes a day. When will movies get realistic? Sure, we like to see people who are very stable, but Stepmom takes everything to the realm of fantasy. Even Ed Harris only appears when it seems necessary. His role is little more than a walk-on.Halfway through this picture perfect battle between Jackie and Julia, we learn that Jackie has cancer and the movie veers straight into tear jerker territory. A story about two women being mothers to the same family would have made a movie all its own as would a film about a mother dying who passes on her children to her ex-husband's new wife. But no, Hollywood wants us to have it both ways and what we get is two incomplete and unsatisfying halves that never quite come together. The only redeeming quality in this movie is the children who are played realistically. Without them, there wouldn't have been a story anyway. Full of annoying scenes where the characters always seem about to tear up, Stepmom is poor excuse for entertainment and a disappointment from the great Susan Sarandon.Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is happening to my beloved Columbia? The hallowed studio with the pretty lady logo once stood for quality--for well-crafted films and professionalism."Stepmom" is the latest in a string of horrible misjudgments ("Idle Hands", "Gloria", "8MM"), compounded by the fact that a lead role in the film was given to Susan Sarandon, an amateurish actor of questionable ability. There is not a single moment in this movie where Sarandon does not attempt to draw unnecessary attention to herself.As if one callous, whiny and completely-devoid-of-humanity character weren't enough, Sarandon's Jackie is joined by a daughter, played by Jena Malone. Malone's Anna becomes nauseating even more quickly than Jackie, if that's possible. (Just when I thought I was innoculated against the last batch of misandristic female characters, along comes a new strain.) The sad fact about what could have been an interesting film is that the entire plot is simplified to a Dick and Jane level. Anna and Jackie are portrayed as so cruel and unreasonable, it's impossible to see any value in them at all. Instead of a thoughtful exploration of the issues raised by divorce and remarriage, the film turns into a pep rally for the same old good little girl played by Julia Roberts. It's disheartening that Columbia could only evoke understanding for her character by making the other females cartoonish and stupid.The other disappointing aspect of "Stepmom" is its sexist double standard. It's strange how when female characters divorce their spouses and move on, they are usually presented in a heroic light ("Message in a Bottle", "The Good Mother", "First Wives' Club") but when a man decides to begin a new life after a divorce, he's portrayed as committing the unpardonable sin. Is Hollywood's case of estrogen poisoning that acute?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie with a good cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying just one thing. My parents divorced when I was 14, and my father was having an affair. I had to get used to my parents divorcing, and going to see my father with another woman. This movie hit home big time for me. Except that my mother did not get sick. But, this movie was very good, 30 minutes into it , I knew that it would be good. Susan Sarandon is one of my favorite actresses of all time, as Ed Harris is one of my favorite actors. Julia Roberts is fantastic in her best role since "My Best Friend's Wedding". Some of the things that they say to one another are pretty cold and mean, but that's part of the story. Great movie, highly recommend it!! Good job to everybody!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, hit me over the head one more time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stepmom" was not uniformly awful; there were some funny lines and touching moments. Unfortunately, they were, respectively, too scarce and too common.For example, the whole sequence where Sarandon's daughter, coached by Roberts, tells off the boy who dumped her and then waltzes over to a dazzling adolescent who is pretending to be her new boyfriend. "Didn't I see that boy naked in a Calvin Klein ad?" Sarandon asks Roberts. "No, Ralph Lauren, fully clothed." Very funny, but most of the rest of the dialogue is along the lines of Sarandon: "I have cancer." Harris: "It should have been me."Many of the scenes are utterly unbelievable. The one before the Calvin/Ralph exchange, for example, is complete fiction. No real boy would sit there so long and let a girl rag on him, especially in a speech that was obviously rehearsed by an adult. It would have been far more realistic if she had just walked by with the gorgeous creature and they laughed as she pointed at the old boyfriend.Whatever lack there may be of realism and humor, however, there is no shortage of awwwwww scenes. Over and over and over, we have to see Sarandon bonding with her kids. At one point, she wakes her daughter up in the middle of the night (I've got a babysitter for your brother, she says; tell me how she did that at about 1 a.m.) and they head out for a moonlight ride. It has nothing to do with the story, like a half-dozen other scenes, stretching the movie out to a mind-numbing 2 hours, 10 minutes.Many characters and questions are also inadequately realized. Sarandon apparently left Ed Harris because he was never around, and she appears to have been justified. He vanishes for two-thirds of the movie! There are no half-measures or compromises in this world; at one point, Julia Roberts blasely walks out of a photo shoot, knowing she will be fired, because she has to pick up Sarandon's kids. Is this what she's supposed to have learned? We're not talking about rescuing the kids from a burning building; they can wait a little while or Roberts could hire a babysitter to get them (Sarandon seems to hire a sitter often enough in the film). The film seems to be saying that the only proper, noble role for a woman is a full-time mother who drops absolutely everything to take care of her children, no matter what.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mild Weepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any film that stars Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris would tend to be pretty effective even in a paper cut out, Hollywood film like Stepmom.This is standard soapie/weepy fare. Jackie (Sarandon) and (Luke) Harris were married and have two children, teenager Anna (Jena Malone) and the younger Ben (Liam Aiken). But now Luke has dumped Jackie for the younger Isabel (Julie Roberts).Luke still shares the children with his wife and Isabel is trying to win the affection of the rug rats. Now that's sordid enough you'd think, although thinking is not a good idea at movies like this.But there's even more gloom on the horizon.In the true tradition of kitchen sink drama someone gets very ill, but still we have the creation of a remarkable stock scene; the one where someone who is mortally ill can still keep her looks and dance exuberantly about with children, to music, waving scarves.And then there's the scene where a young girl is taught how to humiliate a young boy at school; tasty, highly moral stuff at its best. And of course the whole lot of them live in American fantasy land, in fantastic houses and lofts. These sorts of films are nearly always about the love and death trials of fabulously rich Americans.Still Stepmom isn't all that bad. Susan Sarandon in particular shows again her considerable acting skills and also gets just about all of the good lines. The lines were written by five, yes five screenwriters for director Christopher Columbus (Nine Months, Mrs Doubtfire, Home Alone 1 and 2); one of the kings of formula film.It's scripted by committee and is suitably non offensive for the masses; unless you really consider the characters. Take the tissues even if the publicity doesn't give the appropriate hints. The little boy is cute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Stepmom is a tear-jerker. I enjoyed it and didn't feel embarrassed about the tears, but on analysis, there were a lot of problems with the plot. What was it that changed the main protagonists' attitudes toward each other? Why did Mom fess up to her secret when she did? Did Stepmom end up just being the surrogate babysitter, or did she continue her career?I think the acting, pacing and especially the music had a lot to do with the emotional impact of most scenes, especially in the second half of this film. So go, cry, and try to ignore all those little things that drive a picky, analytical person crazy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, so Sarandon does a pretty good job of her role. But overall, the movie is downright absurd. For eg, look at Ed Harris and Roberts. They made this absolutely pathetic couple. Their relationship had nothing - What did he see in her and vice versa? Oh yeah, the sex was good. I'd strongly advise against taking younger children to watch this. It's basically saying that it's ok to 'fall out of love'. And it's pathetic how the whole audience goes 'awwww' each time the little kid says or does something silly and gives his big grin. Columbus knows how to work the audience , and he does it well so I give him credit for that</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stepmom encourages polygamy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Stepmom" with my 11 year old son. Although the issues presented and discussed in the movie were important, the most important matter was glossed over--the issue of Ed Harris "falling out of love" with Susan Sarandon. In the movie it shows that he regrets his mistake of allowing "the string to break" with her, but he goes ahead and proposes anyway to Julia Roberts instead of going back to his wife. His actions thus reveal his lack of true repentance, because he's not willing to DO the right thing.....he's only willing to SAY the right thing. The movie pretty much ignores this matter by "changing the subject" to the care of the children. This is the same kind of "Kenneth Starr is bad" or "Mark Furman is bad" type defenses used by public figures to justify various criminal acts. Although the care of the children is important, the morality we impart to them is a more important component to that care than "being on time" to pick them up and such. I think the movie is meant to glorify the American form of "serial polygamy", but although the movie can't be blamed for what America's been doing for some time now, it IS meant to make us feel good about it.</fullReview>

I thought this movie combined a lot of amazing elements that actually go with families, blended and amalgamated. Susan Sarandon has not been given enough credit for this movie. She was amazing. Jena Malone was also very good, as well as the always-surprising Julia Roberts. All in all I can't wait to see it again, which I don't do very often (not even for Titanic) and it definitely deserves Oscar nominations, contrary to the belief of the critic for this site.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A well written piece about the adjustment of two young children when a much younger woman becomes their stepmother. Beautiful and well-written performances by Sarandon, Roberts and Harris make this an outstanding vehicle for all three. Jena Malone shines as a 12 year old girl going through the insecurity of her mom being replaced by a younger woman, and coping with growing up at the same time. Liam Aiken is adorable as the young mischievous Ben, too young to quite understand it all, yet still creating his share of havoc for Roberts' character. Roberts and Sarandon make worthy adversaries, with the mom always tring to sway the kids' opinion, while the Stepmom just tries to learn how to be a parent, even though she never planned to be.Although I'm not usually big on family drama type movies, this one's a winner. Many laughs, and a few sad scenes even pulled some tears. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

The drama came as a big shock as I was expecting something completely different. Be ready for tears, especially if you're a mom (which I'm not, but I saw the people around me). The movie, however, was preety good. The acting was really good, as could be expected by the two actresses and Ed Harris. The story was engaging and did manage to give the viewer a good insight into both of the main characters' minds. The little boy in it was cute and managed to give out a few laughs but I couldn't help but think that they were trying to recreate the little kid from Jerry Maguire. So it's not Oscar material (except for maybe the acting, Roberts was particularly surprising) but it's a good Drama and worth the watch. However, don't go as I did, expecting a lighthearted movie or you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and Unrealistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a stepmom, I have quite a few things to say about this film. I think this is one of the worst films the great Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts have ever been in. This is basically about a man who is divorced with 2 kids who has a new, much younger girlfriend. I don't want to explain everything about the movie, just a few annoying points. First of all, the biological mother played by Sarandon lives in an incredibly beautiful and expensive home in Connecticut. She also has lots of land and horses. Sarandon apparently does not work either. The father played by Harris lives in the city in another incredibly beautiful and expensive place and they all drive expensive cars. How is this possible? With the bio-mom receiving the house, the child support and alimony payments it's a wonder he is not living in a 1 bedroom apartment. According to the way everybody is living, he must be a multi millionaire. Of course the new girlfriend, Roberts, is a trendy fashion photographer. Uygh. It seems everybody has lots of money. That is what irks me, because along with all the drama involved in being part of a blended family, one major problem is money. Ex- wives taking their ex-husbands back to court for more support, etc.. The struggles of the second family to make ends meet because 30% of the fathers income is going to his ex-wife. Apparently this is not an issue here. Another thing is the ex-husband, Harris, meets his ex- wife, Sarandon for dinner to discuss the fact that he will be asking his girlfriend, Roberts, to marry him. Come on. I can understand telling the bio-mom before you tell the kids, but telling her before you give your girlfriend the ring? It was like he was asking permission from his ex-wife to ask his girlfriend to marry him. It's so nice that ex-spouses can get along so well. Detect sarcasm. Oooh, if I found out my fiancé did that he'd be in a world of trouble. Another thing that irked me was that Roberts received a call on the job to pick up her future stepson at school. Apparently, the mom and dad could not do it and nobody else was available. I believe you have to be on a list at the school to be allowed to remove children for the safety of the kids. How did the fathers girlfriend get on that list? Please. So she risks her job to pick up a child that she is not responsible for. She goes back to her photo shoot in the park with the kid, but he wanders off. He eventually gets found, but when the bio mom finds out she is furious, and files a restraining order against Roberts. Huh? How about reprimanding the kid for wandering off when he was specifically told not to, and then not allowing Roberts to take responsibility for the kids ever again? If Roberts lives with the kids father, a restraining order seems quite ridiculous. I have to say, that this film shows a fantasy that most stepmoms have when dealing with unreasonable, jealous ex-wives. That fantasy is the bio mom dying. Yes, Sarandon has cancer and is going to die. How wonderful that would be for so many non custodial stepmoms, no more alimony, child support payments, a hefty life insurance policy payout, and no more controlling ex-wife poisioning the kids against their father and stepmom. But this is a fantasy, not reality. This film ends up not about being a stepmom and having a successful family, but tying up loose ends and preparing the kids for having a replacement mom when the bio mom dies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plagiarised crowd-pleasing tear-jerker is emotional pornography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish there was a law against making these big-budget soppy pictures with nauseating children and syrupy music. I know there's a market for three-hanky flicks and Chris Columbus (his company name: 1492) is a Spielberg protégé out to make money not history, but give us a break. Do people really exchange snippets of cracker-barrel wisdom from morning until night? Evidently the half-dozen unknown writers who worked on this derivative script thought so, but I beg to differ.Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts ploughed some of their hugely-inflated earnings into this crowd-pleaser, but no amount of emoting by Sarandon can overcome the sad fact that her character looks about 15 years too old to have a seven year-old child. She resembles his grandma. Moreover, her character exists in limbo, with no friends, mother, or other rellies to hold her hand while her nightmarishly dick-headed and sanctimonious husband makes out with a lenser half his age. That's what you get for marrying a lawyer, I guess.What gives me the creeps about this film? It's the emotional pornography. Just as porno publicises acts of privacy, this movie probes into emotionally intimate moments, e.g. when a child asks innocently: "Are you dying?" In a truthful treatment, perhaps it would be tolerable, but in the glitzy context of a money-making vehicle, sorry, that's invasive and unpleasant.Significantly, the film-makers' slip of moral judgement concerns sex, when Julia Roberts's adulterous character spouts off-colour material at her 12 year-old putative step-daughter, and her misjudged words are endorsed and validated in the subsequent action. On the other hand, hypocritically, not the slightest whiff of the frenzied sexual activity that ostensibly drove this adultery appears in the film.I enjoyed the attitude of the 12 year-old daughter (Jena Malone) to her father's tart, and I cheered at every one of her well-aimed taunts, and those at her father as well (Ed Harris). Dad: "You don't walk out on your mother." Daughter: "No, that's your job." I never once believed the relationship depicted between the adulterous lawyer and his gormless young marriage-buster, and found his imposition of her on his suffering ex-wife to be spoiled and self-centred, although the movie thoroughly endorsed his behaviour.Of course the whole charade is an elaborate hoax. In the vast majority of such cases, when a father departs with a spring chicken, leaving the menopausal mother in the lurch, he is rarely or never seen again. The ones who cruelly attempt to bring mother and mistress together usually get egg all over their faces. This is largely phony trash, avoid carefully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Julia Roberts plays Julia Roberts. Susan Sarandon does a creditable job playing an unbelievably perfect mother. Ed Harris is around long enough to establish that he exists (with an unfortunate scene that's shot showing the top of his balding head as he and Julia-playing-Julia make out).The kids acting in this are some of the best child actors I've seen in a mainstream Hollywood picture. Too bad the movie is so...everything you'd expect.We start out knowing Sarandon's character is terminally ill. There would have been much more dramatic tension if we had followed Julia's path in finding out what was going on.But why talk plot? The only redeeming bits were a few choice bits of dialogue, Sarandon's acting, some eye candy on Julia's day job, and Jena Malone's perfect capturing of a tween's acting out. The rest was tedious bilge; no, "tedious" is too generous. Mostly just unaffecting. Easy to fast forward through. And the pious speech-making was totally over the top. Compare this plot development and dialogue with "The Family Stone," for instance (a similar Formula Film), and the latter shows how much more can be achieved with so much less.</fullReview>

The characters will some times get mad or upset at problems that aren't that big such as you made her miss her horseback lessons. LOL! I'll go now. Trust me you'll love this sad, funny, touching, and beautiful story!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do NOT watch this movie -- it is one of the WORST ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris are very good actors, but this movie is one of the sappiest pieces of $%&amp;* I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. There were several times where I had to yell out loud in pain from the sheer corniness of it, and I was watching it by myself. It is pure torture, I HATED it SO MUCH...it almost defies description. The story line is very sad in that typical tear-jerker kind of way, and Julia Roberts (who in some scenes looks like she is wearing a wig made of hay) is no great prize of an actress, in my opinion. I only rented this, despite my better judgement, because I thought there might be some redeeming aspect to it. Would that this were the case. It is a COLOSSAL waste of time. The actress playing the daughter does a reasonably good job also, but that is about all this thing has going for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sappy and Unrealistic (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I hadn't spent 2 hours of my day watching this film and did homework like I should have. Overall, the lack of realism killed this one for me. Susan Sarandon's character seemed overly mean in the beginning and overly sympathetic toward the end. She wasn't just a divorced woman trying to adjust to her ex-husband's new love interest being a part of her life. She has to resort to mean, under-handed tactics to communicate her discomfort, like implying that she'd steal her children away to the West Coast and ruining Julia Roberts' characters plans to attempt to foster a relationship with her daughter. She's not allowed to be angry yet rational at the same time, instead she has to be borderline evil.Then towards the end, she makes a choice to train Roberts to be "Mom Junior". I find it a little hard to believe that she would so readily thrust her family's entire future on someone who is still just a girlfriend. Yes, she understands that her children will need someone to look after them once she's gone, but her whole molding Julia into a "Mini-Me" is so horribly unrealistic. Them acting civilly is plausible, but them turning to best girlfriends is a bit of a stretch. The weepy moments are so horribly calculated and predictable that they barely have any effect once they're actually encountered.So, I guess I'll be staying up 2 hours earlier to make up for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies I have even seen. What were they thinking.? If the characters aren't arguing in the movie, they are crying. Then the writers have to add *spoiler* the whole cancer thing just to make the audience feel sorry and end up crying in the end. That's one thing I hate about movies is when they try to make you feel sad instead of using real emotions and situations to make real drama. It's just one big piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoying, very annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies are bad because in their making there is no talent involved, and there are others that are bad because they are dishonest and manipulative; movies of the first kind are often fun to watch, but those within the second are too annoying and insulting to be actually enjoyed. This one falls definitely in the second category. It begins interestingly enough, with a situation most of us know: a man, his children, his young new wife, his embittered ex-wife. But director Chris Columbus's only interest is to pump the saccharine in until the audience gags. So, the conflict is not solved in any ordinary fashion, but by the middle of the movie they get Jackie, the ex-wife, with cancer. Just asking, do you think the authors of this would have had a brain hemorrhage if they tried to find a solution that did not involve cancer? The way these Hollywood people hurl cancer about makes you think that they never had to see a loved person die of this horrible disease, otherwise they would show some respect. The makers of this movie also have a curious concept about cancer. They apparently believe that it is like hemorrhoids: if you don't tell people you have it, they will never notice. I don't just mean that cancer only makes Jackie look a trifle paler. I don't guess people would enjoy to see someone who really looks as if they had cancer in a Hollywood movie, but also, Jackie hides her disease from everyone in the family, apparently with success. We are even told that she had had a tumor operated a year ago, and nobody noticed! I mean, this is not the kind of operation you can walk home immediately afterwards. She had had to stay in the hospital for at least a couple of days, and, even after she was home, certainly she must have had to recover for several days. How did she explain that? That she was getting herself a complete liposuction job done? This kept me worried during the rest of the movie.They have also some curious concepts about women, too. They apparently believe that a professional woman who is good at her job just has to be hopelessly incompetent in most other areas. Also, we are to believe that Jackie is the perfect mom, just because she owns a Singer machine and because she can always remember her children's schedule, but she is also teaching her children to be rude and bitter, and she also keeps on pulling stunts like the one with the Pearl Jam tickets... now is that supposed to be adult behavior? Also, which is Jackie's source of income? Because she does not work, despises women who do and nevertheless she has a huge house with park and horses. Is she an heiress? Did she win the Lotto? Her husband pays her such an enormous alimony? Is she a closet drug-baroness? Another mystery to keep me worried for the rest of the movie.Another mystery is, of course, what were Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris thinking? From Julia Roberts I don't expect much, and in fact in this movie she comes across as a fantastically bad actress. On second thoughts, however, maybe this happens because she is saddled with some of the worst lines in movie history. My favorite has to be, when Jackie eventually confesses to Isabel that she has cancer, Isabel asks on the spot, very tactfully: "Are you going to die?" Anyway, this is not the kind of movie that I find moving. It is like watching a very clumsy magician who lets you see all his tricks. This movie manipulative mechanisms are far too obvious, like the scene in which the children open their Christmas gifts from Jackie, which has the children coming not together, but one after the other, in order to stretch out the scene for maximum tearjerking effect. Please...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I shut this pandering piece of tripe off after trying to hang on for thirty minutes. There are many ways to tell this story, (remains of the day comes to mind) but they have chosen to make a soap opera out of real life issues. Take my advice give it a pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look out! The PTA might complain about this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This poorly written film contains ridiculous exposition to link together the often contrived scenes. Here are some examples:#1 When Julia Roberts phones Harper Collins, a major New York publisher, a senior editor answers the phone. Hmm, I guess the receptionist was too busy editing the screenplay for Stepmom.#2 Later in the film, Julia Roberts discovers a personal letter written by a friend of Susan Sarandon on Harper Collins letterhead. Wow! It really doesn't appear that that Harper Collins is running a very tight ship!#3 After the 12 year old daughter in the film embarrasses an ex-boyfriend by pretending to date a high-school aged model, Susan Sarandon yells at Julia Roberts for allowing this incident to take place because she's "gonna have to deal with the numerous complaints at the PTA as a result of this incident". Huh? What?????#4 The 12 year old daughter (who was 4 during Pearl Jam's heyday) is giddy to see cynical grunge-rockers Pearl Jam WITH HER MOM.The only reason to cry during this movie is that the screenwriters who wrote it probably got paid more than each crying member of the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nasty!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't recommend this film to anyone. As others have commented, the acting is good, but the characters in this film are unforgivably nasty to one another.Don't take your young girls to see this. There is a miserably misguided scene of retaliation against a 12-year-old's ex-boyfriend that is really bad news.We could have used an intelligent film about the frequent stresses and infrequent joys of building a new kind of family, one that addressed the issues in a realistic way. Yeah, I cried because Susan Sarandon is such a marvelous actress and she is amazingly real. But I could also have cried for the sadness of these two powerful and intelligent women (Sarandon and Roberts) wasting their time and talents on this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manipulative star-vehicle which the talented stars cannot save...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Ed Harris and Susan Sarandon separate, he proposes to new girlfriend Julia Roberts, with Ed and Susan's confused kids forced into taking sides. Manipulative, "heartwarming" movie filled with adorable characters all hiding their collective wonderfulness under scowling masks of sarcasm. It represents the nadir of the notorious 'Ali MacGraw disease' (in this case, cancer) wherein someone gets to expire slowly, and lovingly, all the while glowing with strength, warmth and acceptance. Sarandon dances around the house with her children ("Sweatin' To The Oldies" without Richard Simmons?), Roberts orchestrates Sarandon's daughter's put-down of a middle school Lothario, and poor Harris disappears "at the office" whenever the script warrants a verbal cat fight between the two ladies. It's directed at the "Terms Of Endearment" crowd, but with dialogue such as, "Don't walk out on your mother!"..."No Dad, that's your job!", I would suspect smart viewers would take an early walk. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very touching, moving, tearjerking, and hilarious film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STEPMOM, to me, is a very touching, moving, tearjerking, and hilarious film. I didn't laugh out loud, though. I laughed on the inside. The one person I really couldn't stand at times was Anna (Jena Malone). This was because of her attitude and the way she treated Isabel (Julia Roberts) most of the time. My favorite quotes of this movie are, "Anna! You do not run out on your mother," and, "I never said I was June f*****' Cleaver!" I was thoroughly moved when Jackie (Susan Sarandon) said, "Oh, sweetie, it's okay to miss me." Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, that I thought everyone involved in this movie did a superb job. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this touching, moving, tear-jerking, and hilarious film to anyone who's a fan of Julia Roberts or anyone in the main cast. When you see it, prepare for lots of laughter and tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood's assault on traditional family values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood is determined to teach, rather than to entertain me. 'Stepmom' wishes to widen our traditional notion of 'family' while ignoring the selfish behavior of the husband. Doesn't Sarandon's character have enough to deal with, without having to deal with the selfishness of her husband? And aren't the children exposed to more than enough? And why did the husband not find Sarandon's character sufficient? When we 'fall out of love' is that excuse enough to toss our vows of marriage? Another Hollywood assault on simple decency and traditional family values.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't enjoy sitting thru any film where the "kids" rule the roost. I think too many people see this as instructions on how to be "parents" (let the kids rule), and how to be a "kids" (rule the adults). I think this is evident in the problems of society now. I think it's a big responsibility of film makers to start changing that image. Make movie kids behave the way real children SHOULD, not the way the bad ones "do". The spoiled obnoxious daughter in this film made me so angry I wanted to spank the actress!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing more than a daytime TV weepy soap opera, albeit with higher production values.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young fashion photographer Isabel is dating businessman Luke who has care of two children from his ex-wife Jackie. Neither Jackie or the children really like Isabel and deliberately make things hard for her. Isabel and Jackie's relationship is frosty at best with Jackie treating her with great distaste. However when she finds she has a potentially terminal illness she is forced to reevaluate her relationships and begins to develop a stronger bond with Isabel.With a famous cast this would never be shown outside of the afternoon soap slot on some cheap cable channel. However because of the cast we are made to think that this is somehow more than that. The story is straight forward ? 2 women hate each other, then something happens and they slowly start to hate each other less. Really it's just a soapy story about domestic strife, kids and death (potentially). The wailing and fighting is entertaining and the cast do manage to raise this to something more than a TVM weepy.However it's far from being really good. The relationship between the 2 women isn't convincing ? it doesn't develop at all! Instead it jumps from being friendly to fighting and back again, and then repeats the cycle. I assumed that the relationship would slowly turn to friendship and in a way it does, but the development is really poor. The screaming child hysteria makes the story feel more like a TV movie.The cast are OK and their quality almost manages to cover the weaknesses in the film. Roberts is quite good and is convincing. Susan Sarandon is good but her character is totally unlikable ? even when she's meant to have turned round. Her sickness is visible to all because she starts to sigh a lot, wears a blanket over her knees and coughs a few times! For someone for her quality this was a poor attempt at high-class soap opera acting. The always watchable Ed Harris is good in a small supporting role.Overall this ticks as many weepy movie boxes as it can ? feel good sing-songs, illness, bonding and children. However, despite an all-star cast this is nothing more than a daytime TV weepy soap opera, albeit with higher production values.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Stepmom on DVD because it came free with my player purchase. Although Roberts and Sarandon are good actresses, the bickering between the two women, and the kids' meanness made the first half of the movie hard to watch. And the second half was a bit "syrupy" for this 53-yr-old.Lightly recommended.</fullReview>
