		<shortDescription>Much more than a remake of High Sierra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years I did not care about seeing this film because I kept reading that it was a remake of High Sierra, and I did not feel like seeing High Sierra twice. I finally saw it and greatly enjoyed it from beginning to end. It does have some points in common in the story but it is a totally different film. I would place it among the best westerns ever made. Joel McCrea is ideal for the character he plays, a man who escapes from jail and wants to become honest, but everything goes against him. He meets Henry Hull and his daughter Dorothy Malone on a stagecoach and starts idealizing her as the perfect wife, but he really does not know her. When he meets Virginia Mayo who is together with the outlaws he does not care so much for her initially. Virginia is outstanding in this movie, totally different from the tomboy she played in "Along the Great Divide" also directed by Raoul Walsh and where she was also great. There is a very good sequence of a train robbery, also a beautiful cinematography in black and white. This film has been called pessimistic, probably because at the time it was made most westerns were meant to provide light entertainment, but seeing it nowadays I would not qualify it as that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable Forties Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the misnomer of a title Warner Bros."Colorado Territory" remains a well liked and memorable forties western. Produced for Warners in 1949 by Anthony Villiers and tightly directed by Raoul Walsh this was the vintage director's reworking of his own classic 1941 Bogart gangster hit "High Sierra" as a western. The result turned out to be an exciting and top notch outdoor western adventure. However its somewhat hoary and clichéd title does tend to give the picture a cheap and dismissive B picture status which is totally unwarranted. They could just as easily have called it simply "Colorado" which not only would have been a title of greater dramatic impact but would also have made reference to the character in the story Calorado Carson as played by Virginia Mayo. Written for the screen by John Twist it was based on W.R. Burnett's novel "High Sierra" and crisply photographed in glorious Black &amp; White by the great Sid Hickok.Outlaw Wes McQueen (Joel McCrea) is broken out of prison by an old accomplice and mentor (Basil Ruysdael) to plan and execute one last job - the robbery of $100,000 from the southbound Denver &amp; Rio Grande train. But Reno Blake and Duke Harris (John Archer/James Mitchel) the two others he has to work with are a couple of mistrustful and devious characters who resent McQueen arriving at the hideout and starting to give orders. Along with the two - for some female company - is an attractive half-breed dance hall girl Calorado Carson (Virginia Mayo) who immediately takes a fancy to McQueen because he treats her with some respect. Eventually thwarting a double cross by Reno and Duke during the actual robbery on the speeding train McQueen and Colorado escape with the money on horseback hotly pursued by the US Marshal (Morris Ankrum) and his posse. The picture ends tragically with a wounded McQueen being boldly defended by Colorado in a fierce gun battle as she tries in vain, with two six guns, to stop the advancing posse. Together, hand in hand, Wes and Colorado perish.The acting is generally good from all concerned. In a rare instance of playing an outlaw McCrea gives his usual laconic and appealing performance. But better is Virginia Mayo who is very striking as the hard bitten half-breed who falls in love with the gentle fugitive. And not forgetting the powerful image she created for the blistering finale. Standing daringly and with trenchant resolve and determination she blasts away with two six guns in defense of her wounded man before being brought down in a hail of gunfire. It is a great cinematic moment!Besides the marvellous monochrome cinematography of Sid Hickock, filmed in and around Gallup New Mexico, the picture is also buoyed by a terrific score by the ever underrated David Buttolph featuring a sweeping and arching main theme and some great action music especially for the train chase sequence.A good western "Colorado Territory" was never available on DVD before but now thanks to the Warner Archives label it has just been released in a clean and sharp transfer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional Raoul Walsh Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel McCrea stars as the outlaw Wes McQueen who makes one last train robbery in Raoul Walsh's exceptional and sprawling Western remake of his own "High Sierra." As many commentators have pointed out, "Colorado Territory" is a major improvement over "High Sierra", a better-than-average Bogart vehicle marred by John Huston' tepidly moralizing screenplay. Walsh's breathtaking use of the landscape (especially toward the end) in "Colorado Territory" makes it more fascinating and exciting work. Walsh's heroes are often characterized by adventure. McCrea's Wes McQueen recalls such Walsh protagonists as Eddie Bartlett, George Custer, Gentleman Jim, Capt. Nelson, and Jeb Rand. They have a way of going too far. They are really existentialist heroes. Walsh's depiction of McQueen and his loyal bad girl's (Virginia Mayo) final descent into self-destruction is truly grim and pessimistic. Although "Colorado Territory" is devoid of the psychoanalytic verve of Walsh's "Pursued"(arguably his greatest Western), it is nonetheless a brilliant and memorable film that needs more following and appreciation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walsh's reworking of his own High Sierra into western format works in every conceivable way. In the reweaving, he has created a western noir more lyrical and more resonant than his original gangster noir. The background is used magnificently, both in terms of the landscape and in terms of the native cultures. Morris Ankrum, best known as a judge in myriad Perry Mason episodes and a General in several science fiction cult classics, is a revelation as the Marshal hunting antihero McCrea down relentlessly. At first he seems easy to outwit, but turns out to be much more formidable. Henry Hull, Ian Wolfe, Jim Mitchell, John Archer, also give excellent supporting performances. But it is half-breed Virginia Mayo, tough as nails but as loyal a woman warrior as ever walked the Earth, who steals the film's acting honor's from her excellent co-star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`The sun goes west and so the opportunity'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colorado Territory is undoubtedly one of the best films directed by Raoul Walsh.In fact it's sort of a remake of a film Walsh directed 10 years before this one ? High Sierra with Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino. Colorado Territory's story revolves around a very sympathetic outlaw Wes McQueen (Joel McCrea) who is finally caught and put in jail but obviously not for a very long time, cause his former companions devise a plan to rob the train and are most certainly in need of him to be able to pull it off successfully. So they help him to escape. After Wes succeeds in doing so he finds a refuge in a distant abandoned village in the mountains where he meets his partners together with a spirited and beautiful woman Colorado (Virginia Mayo) who ends up falling in love with him not knowing that his heart already belongs to another very different woman Julie Ann (Dorothy Malone) who in her turn, doesn't know about Wes McQueen being one of the most sought after outlaws in the west. The question now is not who stays with the girl, but who stays with the guy in the most fateful and poignant film's ending. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harsher and more beautiful than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The commenters who called this "Western noir" are on the money. Just about everyone in this movie is a ratlike scheming double- or triple-crosser. Bad guys suffer fates not noticeably worse than the handful of schmo's who are honest (mostly in the relative, honor-among-thieves sense). It's all bleak for the ones who don't get out alive and also for the ones who do. The one aspect of this movie that may have lost its punch for 21st century viewers is the script's banal dialogue for the two key women characters. Virginia Mayo in particular is better than her lines and her costume, which is fashioned entirely from clichés about wanton women who aren't 100 percent Anglo. But the story arc treats the women just differently enough from the "classic" Western that it held my interest. The cast, top to bottom, is excellent. Joel McCrea does that thing he does so well *especially* well here. I'd like to see Peter Sarsgaard reprise a McCrea role some day, in either a Western or a Sturges classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>poetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the entire history of western movies, there have been very few shot through with poetic dialog. The Wild Bunch is one of them. The dialog is in fact so poetic that it is hard to miss, and more than once its quality has been noted by various well known film critics. Colorado Territory, pound for pound is easily its equal. And why? Not Walsh, not Mc Crae, not any of the usual reasons given. In fact if you look at Walsh's other western works, and they are numerous and fine, none of them come close to this one in it's poetry. So either you chalk it up to just sheer luck, or you have to look elsewhere. Yet before I point to that reason, let's look at some of the lines...which probably will be considered a spoiler so, if you don't to hear any of the talk find a review without spoilers, and here goes: we're a couple of fools in a dead village dreaming about something that'll never happen... or earlier Mc Crae is warning two of his outlaw companions about being careful not to double cross him, and tells them about two others that tried to, and says.....they're buried outside Lawrence Kansas. Prettiest little bone orchard you'd ever want to see. Little stone angels watching over them.........or later Mc Crae is telling Pluffner, the railroad detective that has double crossed him, and now Mc Crae has found him out....robbing the dead....and the detective turns and exclaims his innocence, that the man he is robbing his died naturally, that its all part of the game, Mc Crae comes back with.... .... not this game, there's been so much bottom dealing from this deck it's dog eared..................and proceeds to shoot the detective. Yet this was not the last time that western lovers would be treated to such wonderful stuff, except they would have to go to other directors, one being Stuart Heisler, and DALLAS.Or Andre De Toth and SPRINGFIELD RIFLE.The key ingredient in all this not being the director but a writer that heretofore has gone completely unnoticed by virtually any critic. Namely John Twist.John Twist along with Borden Chase were the two finest writers of western cinema, period. Chase was, is, of course well known. Twist has for some reason been invisible. However one day, some discerning crew with get together for a retrospective of his films and the charade will be over. But trust me, western lovers, see his name on any film and you can always count on some of the best dialog ever written for westerns. Colorado Territory being his best.As for the other comments here about the movie, they are pretty right on. This film is the equal overall of any of Mann's films, Boettichers, is better than most of Ford's, in fact only slightly below Red River and My Darling Clementine. The only flaw is a rather mawkish handling of the Dorothy Malone situation: the whole business with her slows things down a bit. But anytime Mc Crae is not around her the film is about as perfect as a western can get. Don't miss is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining '40's western from Raoul Walsh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Raoul Walsh was perhaps the most entertaining director of the '40's, with movies like "Objective, Burma!", "They Died with Their Boots On" and "Gentleman Jim" behind his name, plus he also made some good early westerns. Sounds like the perfect guy to direct a movie like this, especially since this movie is a western remake of his earlier directed movie classic "High Sierra", with Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino. This movie might not be as 'star-filled' as the original but it's just as entertaining, arousing and intriguing on its own.Westerns from the '40's were much different from the later spaghetti-westerns everybody knows. The early westerns from the '40's and the decades before that are a bit forgotten movies, probably mainly because they differ so much from the later westerns from the '60's and '70's that everybody from that- and later generations, basically grew up with. Westerns from the '40's were much darker and possibly less formulaic. This movie is basically more 'film-noir' than real western. It has all the basic film-noir ingredients in it; Backstabbing characters, treacherous woman, a criminal plot and mysterious unpredictable characters. It makes this movie also real perfect to watch for persons who don't like spaghetti-westerns.Leave it up to director Raoul Walsh to tell a story well and entertaining. The story of "Colorado Territory" really isn't the most spectacular story you could think of but the way it is told and brought to the screen all can be called spectacular. The movie is filled with some real good action sequences and spectacular looking stunts. But granted that the storytelling is not completely flawless. The movie is perhaps a bit too short and the love story of the movie also doesn't quite work out as good as it could had been. I don't know, for some reason it just doesn't feel right, or connects with the rest of the movie.The storytelling also makes sure that the movie remains for most part unpredictable, which also helps to make the film-noir elements work out. "Colorado Territory" is a rare both unpredictable and entertaining movie.The cast is solid. It isn't filled with the most known actors of its period. Perhaps Errol Flynn was expected to play a role in this, since he worked a lot with Raoul Walsh in the '40's but instead the main part is played by Joel McCrea, who was an expert at playing characters in westerns. He plays a good and convincing tough-guy who has a good heart. Perhaps a bit too much of a good heart to make the story entirely believable but that's just common and entirely fitting for '40's movie-making standards.An interesting to watch- and spectacular entertaining noir-western, that just like its original version "High Sierra", deserves to be seen.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty darned solid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally was able to view this semi-famous film (due mainly, I suspect, because of the Raoul Walsh/remake of HIGH SIERRA connection). Is it 'better' than HIGH SIERRA? A question, IMO, that doesn't need to be asked, much less answered. Both are pretty riveting pieces of entertainment for their respective genres (gangster &amp; western). I'll admit I had some innocent fun in comparing the similarities of both. The thing I was struck by was the darker, more devious Malone character in the role Joan Leslie had in HIGH SIERRA and also feeling that maybe Joel McCrea was miscast; his screen persona is the 'stalwart and true' type and not an out and out bandit. His only chance to fit into a criminal role would be when it's 'forced' on him and I don't recall that being the case in this one. But why quibble? Here we have the superior art direction and fast action (mostly in the second half, true) typical of WB at it's late 40's/early 50's peak. This sort of thing makes up for a lot of any kind of casting/scripting deficiencies in my book. And what an under-rated actress is Virginia Mayo! She can be fiery one moment and then quiet and subtle the next. Very desirable in this one. I mostly prefer my westerns in good color, but think perhaps this one was pessimistic and dark enough to warrant B&amp;W without decreasing the entertainment value (as in Walsh's PURSUED).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS A LOT OF SPOILERSµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµµUnlike the precedent user,I do think that "Colorado territory" is superior to the former "high sierra".Raoul Walsh was absolutely right to rework his screenplay and to turn it into a western.It's worth to make a comparison point by point between the two works.Humphrey Bogart is superior to Joel McCrea,who does not posess the intensity and the madness that his part demanded,and his partnership with Virginia Mayo who has shone since her first appearance in the deserted village is unbalanced.Bat all that remains outdoes the whole of "high sierra".The characters are more detailed than in the original story:Virginia Mayo's ("proof positive of Allah's existence" a sheik would have said)character has more substance than Ida Lupino's (it's not this excellent actress's fault though):a mixed-race girl,with Indian blood in her veins,she acts ,mainly in the last third as some kind of priestess of some pagan cult in this lost village whose secrets she seems to know intimately:about this subject,just compare the ominous Indian chants which are bad luck with the dog in the 1941 movie.Virginia Mayo radiates and recalls some of Jennifer Jones 's best parts (Vidor's"duel in the sun" which the ending recalls,and Powell's "gone to earth").Both are romantic actresses par excellence,but Mayo is more nervous,more rebellious (see her parts in Wyler's "best years of our lives" and chiefly Walsh's (again)"White heat")Although it's a "men" movie,it's easy to see that it's actually the female parts Walsh favors:Dorothy Malone's character is much more credible than the crippled girl of the first version who made "High sierra" verge on melodrama.Once again,admire the work of the scenarists:the equivalents are stunning;Bogarts pays for the crippled girl's surgery,McCrea saves Malone and her father's lives ,then gives them a lot of money to dig a well.Malone's character (she could be one of King Lear's daughters) will be more ungrateful than her predecessor,trying to play the obnoxious role of Judas so that she will get rich and marry a high society man -whom we never see-.The landscapes are used in a phenomenal way.The old town in ruin where MCQueen (McCrea) talks about Martha ,a dead woman he wanted to marry when he was young,where this girl,Colorado (Colorado territory!)feels from the start she won't escape anyway.Her fate is sealed:"you can escape from jail,she says,but you can't escape from yourself".These lovers are the stuff legends are made.And Walsh ,in his very last scene ,turns the tragedy in a faux happy end .The beaming monk rings the bells: the death of the couple brings life again in this silent place.'They were so happy" the monk says .People do not need to know if they still are.They became part of the legends the Indians tell by the moonlight.Try to see "high sierra" and "Colorado territory"in a row.The latter can appeal,in spite of his very clever dialogue,to the most demanding western buffs:the scenes on the train are filmed with mastery and the very first scene with the old lady,is,to quote her,"mischievous".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Western noir, Joel McCrea and Virginia Mayo at their best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel McCrea was the western counterpart to Humphrey Bogart. As a bad man he was confident against his adversaries, delivered his lines very directly, was suspicious of women, and always died with dignity. McCrea was in his 40s and already a veteran of over 60 movies when he made 'Colorado Territory'. Virginia Mayo as 'Colorado' and Dorothy Malone as 'Julie Ann' were both in their 20s.'Colorado Territory' is a western noir, and the story bears a strong similarity to the 1941 Bogart movie, 'High Sierra.' In both movies a career criminal is sprung from jail and expected to do a big heist, he gets involved with two other men plus a woman, he threatens to kill the two men if they don't straighten out, he at first dismisses the woman only to eventually fall in love with her, he gets seriously wounded, he is chased up a mountain by the law, he vows to never do jail time again, he holds them off with a rifle, a sniper gets to a higher position to try to capture him.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Set in the 1800s, Wes McQueen (McCrea) escapes the Missouri jail by sawing the bars with a 'gift' brought in by an old woman. By horse he heads to Colorado where he is expected to lead a big train robbery. Holes up in an abandoned town in ruins, his two accomplices are suspicious and incompetent. Their 'woman' is Colorado who they brought from an El Paso saloon. Meanwhile he also gets sweet on Julie Ann and gives her dad $900 to pay for a well he badly needs on his spread.The train heist is pulled, but the two accomplices try to cheat Wes by separating the money car from the engine, thinking Wes was guarding the engineers. But Wes is on top of the money car, cuffs the two men together and escapes with all the money. On the run he gets shot, Colorado operates and pulls the bullet out, Wes goes on the run again , she hides the money on top a confessional in a church, Wes is chased up a cliff, 'Colorado' shows up, gets the upper hand on the Marshall, heads to meet Wes with horses, but the sniper above shoots Wes. As about 20 to 30 men on horseback are charging them, 'Colorado' shots with both guns, and the horsemen gun down both Wes and Colorado, and they die holding hands.Meanwhile, the little mission church is doing fine, after finding all that money above the confessional!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just one, before our aging outlaw's final retirement and start of a new life.But there are complications--crafty colleagues, traitor accomplices and--women.One woman turns out to be helpful, the other merely selfish. But that's just the start of our antihero's problems.It's a Raoul Walsh film, and by golly, if any director knew how to make a movie move, it's Walsh. Made the same year as his classic, "White Heat," this western also ends with an "On Top o' the World" finale.Joel McCrea is an intriguing actor. A sort of neutral entity that could be cast in any kind of role and come off looking and sounding natural and acceptable. No one ever especially went to see, nor stayed away from a picture because of him. He was just there, always doing a dependable job. And what an array of fine directors used him.Likewise, Virginia Mayo is a solid pro, and this role allows her more opportunity than merely being decorative. Her character work is most convincing.Taking what could have been a routine script, Walsh turns it into a picture that, once one starts watching, one cannot stop till the end. It moves, surprises and stimulates. Some directors just have it, and Walsh is clearly strutting his stuff in "Colorado Territory."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outlaw Wes McQueen (Joel McCrea) gets sprung from a Missouri jail on the day before he is to be transported to Leavenworth by his old gang who need him for a big train robbery somewhere out in the Colorado Territory. The characters couldn't be more different. McCrae plays the part of an outlaw struggling with his own moral scruples while his partners Duke (James Mitchell) and Reno (John Archer) compete to see who the meanest one is. The presence of Virginia Mayo in this group doesn't make a lot of sense, but her part increases as the film moves along. One of the film's best plot lines is the jealousy that comes to the surface of Reno's character as Mayo's Colorado Carson is clearly taken with the cool McQueen played by McCrae. On the other side of the law is a ruthless and relentless US Marshall played by Morris Ankrum who leads an impressively sized posse out to catch up with and either shoot or hang McQueen. The film zeroes in on treachery and deceit at every opportunity. Dorothy Malone's character is especially memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Raoul Walsh's classic gangster film High Sierra, made in 1941, consolidated Humphrey Bogart's rising star after his breakthrough film The Maltese Falcon. Bogart's laconic but romantic portrayal of Roy Earle brought a particular poignancy to his tragic, flawed antihero who tries to go straight but is caught up in "one last job". Ida Lupino's vulnerable Marie provides a strong match for his powerhouse performance.Walsh remade High Sierra in 1949 as a western photographed like his previous outing in the genre (Pursued) in a distinct noir mood and style. If anything, Colorado Territory tops High Sierra in cumulative impact: McCrea and Mayo bring an intense, dark romanticism wholly befitting their rush to doom and Walsh's treatment of the landscapes that both dwarf them and swallow them up is outstanding. This has my vote as one of the genre's top 20.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Territorial Doom.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colorado Territory is directed by Raoul Walsh and adapted to screenplay by Edmund H. North and John Twist from the novel "High Sierra" written by W.R. Burnett. It stars Joel McCrea, Virginia Mayo, Dorothy Malone and Henry Hull. Music is by David Buttolph and cinematography by Sidney Hickox.Raoul Walsh remakes his own High Sierra from 1941 but supplants it into a western setting - with tremendous results. McCrea plays outlaw Wes McQueen who springs from prison and vows to go straight, but with a price on his head he is coerced into one last railroad robbery. If he can escape the law, he can make a go of it as a new man, with a new man, and comforted by a new found love of a good woman, Colorado Carson (Mayo). Can he escape the law and those who would sell him for money?A remake of a classic film noir, Colorado Territory is itself classic film noir. Whilst not reaching the dizzying star heights of Bogart's 41 version, this is a film of great strengths. Thematically it's noir gold dust, the great Walsh not pandering to anyone and ensuring the dark edges of Burnett's novel play out on screen, including the shattering finale. The photography is grade "A", both in chiaroscuro textures and sumptuous location framings. Cast can't be faulted either, McCrea a genuine horseman is firmly at home in a Western setting, Mayo and Malone positively light and sex up the screen, while classy performer Hull lends weighty support.High end Western staples are adhered to, with robbery actions, fights, stunts, villainous betrayals and back stabbers, these marry up to the noirish cement of a man unable to escape his fate, his past weighing heavy on his shoulders, there's a doom laden feel permeating the story.Rarely mentioned when talk turns to film noir Westerns, but it should be as it's one of the best. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of Bogarts High Sierra is a good film vehicle. Raoul Walsh is getting more and more respect as a fine film maker years after his efforts. This is a very good film for its era.There are scenes where things get a little choppy but overall the acting by the cast including Henry Hull is very good. Spoiler The ending is much better than most films of the period as the film is willing to kill it's main start at the end of the movie.Rather than ruin it for a new viewer, I'd recommend viewing this film &amp; I think viewers will be pleasantly surprised. The story works well &amp; the film is overall much better than you'd expect. It centers around a train robber (Joel McRae) who breaks out of jail, finds out the love of his life has died, &amp; then is enlisted in trying to make one more big score robbing a train.During this stretch he meets 2 women (Virginia Mayo &amp; Dorothy Malone)who make him forget his dead lover, and who both make different plays for him. I think I will leave it at that &amp; recommend highly this Warner Brothers film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got done viewing this excellent western drama - and truly it was a tear jerker in the very end.Not that I condone crime or to make heroes out of bank and train robbers.But to understand the character of a robber - you have to examine his childhood.But this movie was really great - in terms of the writing, the beautiful locations, and the terrific acting.I just hated to see the robber get killed in the end! I highly recommend this powerful movie to all classic movie buffs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a Western story not like the average picture we have seen over the years, it had a different message with an ending that is true to what life is all about, happiness and sadness! Joel McCrea(Wes McQueen),"Wichita Town",'59 TV Series, had his share of bad luck and wanted desperately to start a new life and forget the past and its bad memories. However, Wes got caught up in situations that tried to prevent him from becoming a happily married man with children. Virginia Mayo,(Colorado Carson),"The Girl From Jones Beach",'49, tried to give him affection along with Dorothy Malone,"Basic Instinct",'92,who offered him an entirely different life. The picture will keep you guessing just how Wes will eventually find a true HAPPINESS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Worth A Detour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is as superb western by a director who knows his stuff. Raoul Walsh hasn't received the credit he deserves and this film is all but forgotten. It doesn't have any big stars or overacting, agreed, and perhaps people are looking for Oscar material rather than a great film. It's their loss. The film covers much territory (no pun intended) but certainly not too much and the many surprises work quite well. The characters' motives unravel as the film progresses, the way they should work. There aren't any easy answers here and the clichés are nowhere to be found, unlike so many by-the-numbers westerns. This is an action film from the beginning and keeps things going until the very end. It should be much better known.Curtis Stotlar</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You can bust out of jail, but you can't bust out of who you are"(Colorado quote)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The familiar plot explores the problem of a mature man, ready to settle down after an outlaw youth, but the justice system won't let him. In some films, such as "The Tall Men" and "The Bend in the River", the man is able to escape the reach of the law and presumably accomplish his transformation. In others, such as this, he is doomed to die trying.Fugitive badman Wes McQueen(Joel McCrea) and feisty tomboyish femme fatal Colorado(Virginia Mayo) have high hopes of 'busting out' of his past baggage and making a new start together as ranchers in Mexico, hopefully out of reach of pursuing US lawmen. But, McQueen is contracted to lead one last train heist as a condition of help in his Missouri jail break, and to provide start up money for their future. This puts him on the radar as the #1 western badman, leading to the quick demise of both. Yep, it's presented as a tragic too late love story. McQueen seems like too nice a guy in most ways to fit his outlaw side. Clearly, Colorado is fatally infatuated by his combination of dangerousness and decency. Yep, he's her man and she will follow him to the grave.Although officially a remake of "High Sierra" in a western setting, McQueen seems loosely modeled on Jesse James, who reputedly was planning to give up his outlaw ways after one more robbery, when he was assassinated by a gang member. It also repeats some key features of the previous "Duel in the Sun". It lacks any substantial musical or humorous elements, being a hard-driving drama and love story. The photography is excellent, much of it in darkened settings, in crisp B&amp;W. In addition to the canyonland settings, the train robbery sequence was done with the Durango-Silverton railway in the SW Colorado mountains. It supposedly takes place when Colorado was a territory, from 1861-76.This is yet another western where the leading man(dare I claim hero?) gets involved with 2 new beautiful single women: one conventionally prim, often newly arrived from the East, and the other a 'bad' flamboyant extraordinary beauty. Probably, in most films, the leading man(who often has a tainted past himself) eventually ends up with the 'good' girl. In Anthony Man's "The Far Country", clearly the 'bad' woman is made for Jeff, but she dies defending him in a gun battle. Hence, he is left with the 'good' girl, whom he considers too young and naive. In the present film, the choice is made more complicated by the reversal of the characterization of the two women during the film. Thus, when Julie(Dorothy Malone) learns that the tall handsome man who earlier saved her from a stagecoach bandit holdup is actually a notorious escaped convict with a $20,000. reward for his capture, she tries to open the door and tell the posse that McQueen is inside, so she can collect the reward.(Jesse James's capture topped out at only $10,000. during the same era!). A cat fight ensues, as Colorado tries to keep her from informing the posse. Previous to this, Colorado expertly extracted a bullet lodged in McQueen's shoulder with doctor's tweezer's, as if she had performed many such operations(?), cauterizing the wound by lighting a bit of gunpowder!. Yes, this is a historically legitimate procedure, but has to be done expertly for a good result! Obviously, from this point on, Colorado is the woman McQueen can trust to back him up. Like Tracy, in "Harry Tracy, Desperado", McQueen tells his girl that he now has to go it alone, knowing that he will resist recapture to the death. Once McQueen is trapped by the posse in what clearly looks like the spectacular Canyon de Chelly(AZ)(which they ominously dub 'The Canyon of Death'), it's pretty obvious he's not coming out alive, especially since he can hold his rifle with only one arm. Unlike Tracy's girl, Colorado feels she must die taking a measure of revenge on the posse.Before they split, McQueen gives Colorado essentially all the stolen money. She stuffs some in the offering box in the old Spanish mission and hides the rest nearby, before praying at the alter. Presumably, this is what the friar meant in the closing scene when he said this backwater village was renewed by this happy couple who passed through. The posse has no idea where to look for the money, and the friars probably won't find the major part for some time.Although his past says he's a habitual desperado, McQueen comes across as one of the few characters we can trust, along with Julie's father(played by perennial scene stealer Henry Hull) and Colorado. Julie, McQueen's other partners in the holdup: Reno and Duke, as well as associates Pluthner and Wallace, clearly are untrustworthy backstabbers. Viginia Mayo is winsome as the knockout fancy-free badman's moll, with cat-like gleaming eyes. She would revisit her passionate tomboy persona in the later excellent Raoul Walsh western "Along the Great Divide", where she has another meaty role in trying to save her father from a lynching or court-ordered hanging as an alleged murderer, as well as rustler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never really bothered with the Western genre in film. Just like country and western music (as typified by those solo recording artists who are all rubbish and that includes the trendier singers such as the depressingly monotone Johnny Cash) it has always left me cold. For some reason, I do like Dolly Parton, though. However, I just can't seem to get enough of them at the moment and I think it is because I have been picking good ones to watch. Well, my trend for seeking out quality Westerns will continue after seeing this film.The story is essentially as follows - Joel McCrea (Wes) is sprung from jail to pull one last train robbery for mastermind Basil Ruysdael (Dave). Joel holes up in a deserted town with his gang that consists of thuggish John Archer (Reno), slimy intellectual James Mitchell (Duke) and initially not wanted saloon girl Virginia Mayo (Colorado). They bide their time until it's time to steal some loot. But, there are plenty of double crosses to come.Comparisons have regularly been made to the film High Sierra (1941), of which this is a re-make set as a Western. An easy comparison - this film is clearly the better offering in terms of action and scenery. It also has a much more credible thread with love interest Dorothy Malone (Julie Ann) and her father Henry Hull (Fred) taking the roles of Joan Leslie and Henry Travis who added nothing but boring sentimentality in the original. Yawn. And there is no blasted dog written into the script for poor plot contrivances. There is an overall higher satisfaction level with this film.The cast do well with a special mention for the 2 lead females. Virginia Mayo and Dorothy Malone both do justice to their roles and may not seem as they first appear. They also appeared together in "Flaxy Martin" in that year but with a role reversal on that occasion. In this film, they have some scenes together that are fraught with tension and there are many other memorable moments. A case in point is a shot of two men hanging from a train - certainly didn't expect that! Quite disturbing. This film also has great dialogue and captivating scenery and it makes for entertaining viewing with a happy ending. Of sorts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While there may be a few cracks in this movie, overall it is a magnificent work. Some of it could have been shot by Ansel Adams. Few of the situations are forced and the script flows without some of the interruptions of irrationality noted in many westerns. The acting is universally excellent and production values are superb,something characteristic of Warner Bros. About the only complaint one may have about the cast is that Virginia Mayo's beauty is not as evident as it should be, for she is, in my opinion, one of the GREAT beauties to ever grace the screen. The twists and turns in this movie keep you in suspense. If you are a fan of the westerns, this one should allow you to exit the theater "justified".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1871, notorious outlaw Joel McCrea (as Wesley "Wes" McQueen) breaks out of jail with a hacksaw, and heads for the western "Colorado Territory" where he hopes to go straight. Along the way, Mr. McCrea (now calling himself "Chet Rogers") defends a stagecoach from some even nastier outlaws. Thus, he becomes a hero saving fellow passenger Henry Hull (as Fred Winslow) and his shapely dark-haired daughter, Dorothy Malone (as Julie Ann). McCrae and Ms. Malone look romantically inclined, but she is promised to another. Then, McCrea makes the decision to join fellow thieves John Archer (as Reno Blake) and James Mitchell (as Duke Harris) in one last heist? If you think the last train robbery for McCrea goes without a hitch, you'd be wrong.First thing McCrea finds problematic is pretty "half-breed" Virginia Mayo (as Colorado Carson), who hangs out with the gang. McCrea orders Ms. Mayo back to El Paso, but she refuses to budge. Mayo hikes up her skirt, whenever possible, to show off her legs - she also wears her blouse pulled down over one shoulder, so it always looks like it's going to slip down and expose her bosom. It never does, but McCrea falls in love. "Colorado Territory" is an great-looking picture, with beautiful black-and-white photography by Sid Hickox. In this westernized version of "High Sierra" (1941), director Raoul Walsh corralling the cast and crew through a rollicking train robbery and aftermath.****** Colorado Territory (6/11/49) Raoul Walsh ~ Joel McCrea, Virginia Mayo, Dorothy Malone, James Mitchell</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scenic remake of gangster classic High Sierra. This time, it's cowboy Joel McCrea hooking up with no-account henchmen to rob a train carrying valuables. Along the way, he meets up with attractive good girl Dorothy Malone who stands for family and a stable farm life, but will that be enough to reform his outlaw side. Then too, add good-bad girl Virginia Mayo, the gang's moll, who's as morally unstable as McCrea and we've got another interesting conflict. We want McCrea to reform since he acts honorably even when his henchmen don't. Then too, no one was better at conveying quiet dignity and manliness than actor McCrea. As a Western hero, he was a natural. So, in effect, he's playing subtly against type.The massive rock monoliths of Arizona furnish a riveting backdrop and are nicely filmed, even in b&amp;w. They also work well for the final scene, which is rather eerie given the distances involved. Comparisons with the original are inevitable, and while this cowboy version doesn't manage the tragic poignancy of the original (mainly because Mayo lacks Lupino's soulful skills), it's still a good story, with well-staged action and lots to look at. And for a Western, that's a hard combination to beat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of a man's last stand. Joel McCrea is convincing as Wes McQueen, notorious outlaw. Just before his transfer to Leavenworth, he is sprung from prison by his aging crime boss patron who wants him for a big heist. He'd rather go straight, settle down, and marry his home town girl. Things have changed since he last went home, though, and he soon realizes that his only chance for a happy ending is to follow his fate and pull off one last job.On his way to the rendezvous, he thinks he sees a way out, by donning the white hat and playing the hero and protector to a naive greenhorn from back east and his lovely daughter. But to help them, he first has to put the black hat back on and rob the railroad. Unfortunately, his crew is inexperienced and the presence of Colorado, the "damaged" dance hall girl, just complicates matters. Compelled to press on, our hero senses trouble down the trail.It's a great story, first told in "High Sierra" (1941) as a film noir with gangster Humphrey Bogart in the lead role. "High Sierra" is a superior film, but this is still worth seeing. The old west setting suits the story. The landscape is a dramatic and desolate desert, dotted with blind canyons and abandoned missions. The lone outlaw knows this is one mission that can't be so easily abandoned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably Walsh's best movie ever, partly due to his wonderful guidance of the actors, partly due to the stunning screenplay full of excellent dialogs.The story get's a lot of power by neglecting nearly all western clichés: The "good" guy who we suppose to be innocent, is a bandit. He wants to change for good, but it just takes few moments and some money to get him back into the gang.When he seems to fall in love with the "good girl" we - and he - learn little by little, the girl he fell for is just a substitute for his dead fiancé.On the other hand the "good girl" (brunette) from the east (in other movies always protected by her father and finally taming the bad guy) is in the end just selling out while her father tries to convince her,&nbsp;the broken hero is the right man for her.The "bad girl" (blonde) on the other side is neither sloppy nor a fallen angel dreaming of house and home. She knows where she belongs to and finally makes her stand. And the hero picks not the good girl, but her, telling her "You are not aiming high".The criminal mastermind behind the hold-up is a likable, mortally ill old man, drinking himself to death while his job. And despite his obvious knowledge of human nature, he is deceived by one of his partners.One of the big traitors is a decent, nice old man, that fools the hero (and the audience) easily. And the "dumb" marshal turns out to be more witty than all others.Then there are the (real!) Indians with their chanting and rituals adding some dark, mysterious atmosphere to the story, always giving the hint: this land is old Indian land and the white people are just moving over its surface like ants without ever revealing its secrets.Finally the whole thing is finished with a brilliant musical score that is, like most of the other features of the movie, far ahead of its time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wes McQueen" (Joel McCrea) is an infamous outlaw who is in jail pending trial for numerous train robberies. With the help of an old partner named "Dave Rickard" (Basil Ruysdael) he manages to escape and meets up with a couple of Dave's new partners, "Duke Harris" (James Mitchell) and "Reno Blake" (John Archer) at an abandoned ghost town in Colorado. Along with these two outlaws is a sexy dance-hall girl from El Paso by the name of "Colorado Carson" (Virginia Mayo). Wes wants to go straight but Dave wants him to rob another train for his sake. Wes reluctantly agrees figuring he can help his old partner and at the same time start a new life with a young lady by the name of "Julie Ann Winslow" (Dorothy Malone). But first he has to overcome a number of double-crosses to accomplish this goal. At any rate, I thought both Joel McCrea and Virginia Mayo performed exceptionally well and I liked the idea of him having to choose between two totally opposite female personalities in Julie Ann and Colorado. Unfortunately, I thought the ending was more than a bit disappointing and I have rated this film accordingly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>W.R. Burnett's book "High Sierra", filmed in 1941 with Humphrey Bogart as a jewel thief, gets a rousing (and uncredited) western reworking here, with the main character's vocation changed to train robber. In 1871 Missouri, a criminal set for execution breaks out of prison and holes up in the valley with two of his cronies, where they plot another railroad heist. Director Raoul Walsh (who also helmed "High Sierra" for Warner Bros.) gets superlative usage out of the dusty, craggy locations, with cinematographer Sid Hickox capturing the mountain terrain and cloudy skies in gorgeously expressive black-and-white. Joel McCrea is surprisingly comfortable playing the semi-bad guy (though definitely one with a heart of mush...and a yen for marriage!), however some of the supporting characters are a bit of a stretch. Virgina Mayo (she of the glassy-eyed stare) does what she can in the insane role of an ex-dance hall girl, Dorothy Malone is completely lost in the underwritten part of a well digger's daughter who wants a better life, and John Archer and James Mitchell are two cardboard villains. The picture gets by on the strength of its considerable technical merits and by McCrea's performance; with his easy gait and benign personality, McCrea is likable even when he's shooting down the law (he's shrewd and sturdy, a good man to have around). However, the writing is overheated, and the nutty finale provokes unintended laughs. Story filmed yet again by recycle-happy Warner Bros. in 1955, entitled "I Died a Thousand Times". **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HIGH SIERRA was an exceptional Bogart film and it helped to make him a bonafied star. However, like Hollywood tended to do in the 30s and 40s, they remade this film less than a decade later! However, considering how good HIGH SIERRA was, Colorado TERRITORY can't help but come up a bit short even if it is still a good film.Joel McCrea gets the unenviable task of repeating Bogie's role, though in this case the film is set in the Old West. The plot is basically the same and everyone associated with the film did a fine job--but I still am asking why bother remaking such a good film? It's worth seeing, but unless you are a huge Western or McCrea fan, it's skip-able.By the way, in an unusual move, director Raoul Walsh was at the helm of the original AND this re-make.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who could have been a better choice for doing a western re-make of High Sierra than the original director of High Sierra, Raoul Walsh. He pretty well followed the plot line of High Sierra and had every character in there, but the dog who was an alleged jinx.It could have been a better film and the trouble is with the miscasting of Joel McCrea. McCrea in my opinion was the solidest of western heroes, at his best when he's playing straight as an arrow good guys. Wes McQueen is not a straightforward good guy at all here and McCrea just can't get a handle on the character. You want to see McCrea at his heroic best, look at stuff like Union Pacific, Four Faces West, or The Virginian to name a few. I think Randolph Scott or Dick Powell would have been better casting here.That being said it's not a bad film, but it could have been better. The women here are Virginia Mayo and Dorothy Malone playing the parts that Ida Lupino and Joan Leslie did in High Sierra. Mayo is the tough as nails broad in this just like Lupino. Malone's character is far from the innocent that Joan Leslie portrayed. It was another rung up the ladder for Malone to that Oscar she got for Written on the Wind.The rest of the cast is populated with such veterans as Henry Hull, Basil Ruysdael, Harry Woods, Monte Blue, John Archer, and James Mitchell, stalwarts one and all. Frank Puglia plays a Franciscan Friar who winds up the real "winner" in this film.The ending is different than High Sierra and I think Walsh took some inspiration from Duel in the Sun. I won't say more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>JOEL McCREA is the main reason for liking "Colorado Territory"--and the script is full of quotable lines that have a smart sting to them. But this remake takes the Humphrey Bogart/Ida Lupino/Joan Leslie original and transposes it to a vast western landscape with McCrea as a gunman on horseback planning his last heist with a corrupt gang of thieves.It's hampered by some odd miscasting. VIRGINIA MAYO wears heavy make-up as a girl with Pueblo blood who falls instantly in love with McCrea. She stands by her man, even when she learns that he's found a new sweetheart--DOROTHY MALONE in a terribly underwritten role that paints her as a good/bad girl whose loyalty is questionable when tempted by money.It's an okay western, routine in many ways, but fans of McCrea should enjoy his performance. JOHN ARCHER and JAMES MITCHELL are convincing as "heavies" who get their comeuppance in the end.Summing up: A less than honorable remake of a more gripping original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Raoul Walsh does his usual yeoman-like job of directing this mediocre Western with Joel McRae as an outlaw trying to make one last big haul by robbing a train, Dorothy Malone as the young woman he thinks he loves, and Virginia Mayo as the girl who is, as he finally realizes, made for him.Walsh also directed the original story, "High Sierra", with Humphrey Bogart, Joan Leslie, and Ida Lupino in the same roles. "Colorado Territory" absconds with the story but leaves John Huston's felicitous script behind as scraps.Walsh has never directed a dull film, and this isn't dull. What it is, is simple minded. All of the subtlety and ambiguity that made the original so fine, so artful, is discarded and instead the characters and their motives are simplified to the extent that any particularly aware third-grader can grasp them.What I mean is -- how should I put this? Maybe I can make the point by giving an example. In "High Sierra", Bogart meets a simple, kind old man with a crippled grand-daughter who needs an operation. That's the teen-aged Joan Leslie we're talking about, and, man, she looks good, though rendered sullen by her disability. Bogart comes into some loot and gives much of it to Joan Leslie's family so that she can have her operation. Meanwhile, he falls in with Ida Lupino, a whore who has been kicked around, loves Bogart, and will do anything for him. Before adopting Lupino, Bogart tells her that there's no place in his life for her. (He's thinking of settling down with Joan Leslie once she's fixed up.) Leslie's operation is a success and from her recovery bed she showers Bogart with gratitude -- but not love, as she explains to Grampa. On his next visit, Bogart finds her drinking and jitterbugging frenetically with a boyfriend. Leslie is still grateful to Bogart but she rejects his possessiveness, and he leaves her forever with Ida Lupino. Huston and Walsh fill these scenes with love, ambiguity, a frantic hope and a hopeless remorse.In the remake, the Joan Leslie figure, Dorothy Malone, has nothing wrong with her except that she is greedy and treacherous. Although McRae gives the family enough money to start their farm, Malone tries to alert the sheriff to MacRae's presence in order to collect the twenty-thousand-dollar reward. The Ida Lupino character, Virginia Mayo, actually has to have a physical fight with Malone to keep her from rushing out the door. There is no ambiguity, no sense of real life. Malone is not a nice, if slightly empty-headed girl, who wants to just enjoy her new freedom. She's a bad girl."Colorado Territory" is miscast, as well. Joel McRae is a good light comedian or light action star -- a nice guy. He's not the tough ex-con that Bogart was. And Virginia Mayo is supposed to be part Pueblo Indian, though she looks about as Indian as Jean Harlow, the heavy makeup notwithstanding. One of the most touching (because grounded) elements of the original is that Bogart had to give up the vivacious young Joan Leslie for the older, husky, used, and rather plain Ida Lupino. In the remake, the succulent Virginia Mayo of 1949 could give Dorothy Malone a run for her money any day. It's like a high-schooler having to give up his romance with the head of the girl's cheer-leading squad for the love of the Prom Queen. There's not much of a sense of loss.I've picked out just one set of relationships to compare, but any viewer could easily spot a dozen more in which the original is superior to the remake. (Humphrey Bogart, describing what a Tommy gun sounds like, taps his finger three times on the desk and says, "Tap tap tap. That's all." Nothing like that here.) Nice location shooting, but if you want to see a movie made for adult sensibilities, rent the original. This remake is pretty watered down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't see particular value of the lightly disguised remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a number of technical aspects about this film that are interesting. It is considered to be a remake of Humphrey Bogart's "High Sierra", and plot similarities are quite obvious (and both were directed by Raoul Walsh). According to Google, it was also the last film that premiered at a drive-in movie. It was filmed in the red rocks country of New Mexico and Arizona, which could have provided spectacular film locales...except that it is a black-and-white film.No, that there are interesting things about the film doesn't mean the film itself is that interesting. It's pretty much an average B western for the first two-thirds of the film, and with one big problem -- there's no character in the film that's very likable; no good guy...just different degrees of bad guys. The fact that Joel McCrae sort of wants to go straight...after just one more hold-up, doesn't make him a good guy. It just makes him a not so bad bad guy.McCrea is the only notable actor in the story. I always thought he was generally wasted in westerns, because he was a very good actor. But in westerns, he pretty much became just another B actor...successful though he may have been in the genre. Virginia Mayo is beautiful -- but not likable until toward the end of the film. Dorothy Malone is okay, but doesn't get much screen time. Henry Hull's character -- Mayo's father -- is a likable guy...not that it gets him very far.No, if I wanted to see the plot of "High Sierra", then I'd simply watch the incomparable Humphrey Bogart in "High Sierra". Of course, in "High Sierra", no one used the warning phrase of you'll be "dead meat"! And no one poured gun powder into a bullet wound. And, the last third of the film does get pretty exciting with lots of action. But still, unless you're really into old westerns, I'd let this one pass right by. Well, maybe it was worth watching...just once. But not one for your DVD shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A none too subtle remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild west baddie Wes McQueen consents to participate in just one more heist before reforming and settling down, but is double-crossed by his partners, and prospective girlfriend.Why Raoul Walsh thought he could go one better on his 1941 masterpiece 'High Sierra' is beyond me, and 'Colorado Territory' is a pretty poor Western remake of a great action movie, none too subtly disguised and most of the time just going through the motions. It has none of the original movie's vividness or whirling virtuosity.McCrea does well in a part that would become second nature to him through the 1950s, but all in all the movie is a huge disappointment for fans of Raoul Walsh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>film noir western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Mccrea was a popular leading man who had starred in some of the biggest western hits of the time i.e. Wells Fargo, Union Pacific, Buffalo Bill and the 1946 version of The Virginian. Following the success of the noir-western Pursued, the formula here was to take an old noir movie, High Sierra, which Raoul Walsh also directed and rework it as a western. There are enough alterations to make the story different but the results are uneven. Now, the movie: Joel Mccrea and Virginia Mayo are miscast. The first hour, I found slow and uninvolving. The second half picks up and has a solid if cliched denouement. The study of a man on the end of his road is much more explored here than it was in High Sierra, but Mccrea never nails it. Interesting character study but a flawed and largely uninvolving movie.</fullReview>
