		<shortDescription>We've really lost something nowadays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't want to be one of those "they don't make 'em like they used to" people, but I just can't help it when it comes to comedy. We've lost that talent completely, it seems. I can't think of any really great comedies of the past ten years. The golden age for film comedy was the mid 1930s to the mid 1940s (at least for the talkies; silent comedies were a totally different art form). This is also the period of the screwball comedy. My Man Godfrey was one of the first screwball comedies. Films such as Bringing Up Baby and The Lady Eve perfected the form, but My Man Godfrey is nearly as perfect. It isn't quite as funny as Bringing Up Baby nor is it as emotionally resonant as The Lady Eve, but it is funny, it has depression era social commentary (its main theme is identical to Preston Sturges' Sullivan's Travels, beating it by 6 years), and the script is marvelous. The finale is as good as any other comic finale, including the last scene of Some Like it Hot.The actors are also in top form. William Powell is the straight man, and he plays it very well. All the rest are as nutty as ever. Carole Lombard probably gives her greatest performance here (I suppose I shouldn't say that since I've only seen her in one other film; I can only guess at this since it is one of the funniest performances of film history). Gail Patrick is perfectly devious as Lombard's conniving sister. Eugene Pallette is great as their father. Alice Brady, though, steals the show as their mother, a total fruit cake whose protoge, Carlo (Mischa Auer) does nothing but eat the household's food and pound the same couple of notes on their piano. And look for cameos by MGM regulars Franklin Pangborn and Grady Sutton. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I was the sort of person who scrutinised every frame of my viewings looking for flaws, then I still wouldn't have issue here because My Man Godfrey has no cracks in its make up. It is perfect cinema from a golden age that we rarely see in this day and age. During a rich peoples socialite scavenger hunt, air head Irene Bullock wins the contest to see who can find a forgotten man, a hobo, and showcase him at the toffs party. She falls for the charisma of down and out Godfrey Parke and gives him the job of Butler to the family Bullock, this of course bemuses the family, even more so when Godfrey turns out to be far more than they originally thought.My Man Godfrey is one of those old classic comedies that has satire at its heart, here the rich are firmly in the target sights of the makers, for it's they who come across as bumbling buffoons, whilst Godfrey the hobo is the one with tact and grace, he is the one they all should take their markers from. Yet as important as the social message is here, it's the brilliant comedy that comes to the fore, this is an electric script benefiting from great work from all involved. William Powell is Godfrey, it's a perfect performance as he is never flustered yet delivering funny lines with caustic impact. Carole Lombard is just precious as the dopey love sick Irene, her interplay with Powell is comedy gold. My favourite of the bunch tho is Eugene Palette as Alexander, the father of this bizarro family, every mannerism and every line out of his mouth had me in stitches. I must also mention that of the 6 Oscars the film was nominated for, I'm stunned there wasn't one for Gail Patrick as Cornelia, it's devilishly icy and weasel like, and she impacted hard on me to the point that I wanted to strangle her, a great performance from her.Truth is, they are all great, from the actors to the director, from the editor to the writer, My Man Godfrey is a truly brilliant film that easily entered my top 100 greatest films list today. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Screwball Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a classic ensemble film with Carole Lombard and William Powell at the helm. The comedic timing is nearly perfect and the script is a winner. Character actors Eugene Palette and Mischa Auer absolutely shine. Lombard defined screwball with her on and off screen antics. Her portrayal of the rich and flighty (yet ultimately wise) Irene Bullock is one of her best performances. Powell's Godfrey matches her step for step, and Powell does one better by showing us depth in his character rather than play straight man to her every madcap move.The movie is fast-paced and defines the word zany. What is worth noting though is that in many ways it is a commentary of the times by comparing the 'haves' and 'have nots'. I would encourage everyone to watch with more than a comedic eye. Through Godfrey, director Gregory La Cava's film speaks volumes about the conditions of the 1930s. The U.S. was plunged in a depression that forced thousands to the breadlines. The film opens with a treasure hunt and one of the items to find is a forgotten man. The rich set out to the city dump to locate him with no regard for his plight or his dignity. The man they bring back as the prize is Godfrey, who soon is employed by the Bullock family as their butler. Powell and Gail Patrick as Irene's snooty sister, Cornelia, are the antithesis of each other and some of the best social barbs are exchanged between them. Keeping their esteemed place in society is paramount to the Bullock family, and only the father (Pallette) ever seems to worry about money. However, La Cava does not allow the film to wallow in pity for those less fortunate. The film amuses throughout but it is a real art to weave social commentary into a comedy without banging you over the head. La Cava pulls it off beautifully.La Cava, Lombard, Powell, Auer, and Alice Brady all deservedly earned Academy Award nominations. This movie will make you laugh and it should. It is very, very funny. It should also make you think. I suspect if you do both, Mr. La Cava and his wonderful cast will have done their jobs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scavenger hunt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great depression of the 30s, in a way, created inequality in this country. On the one hand, great fortunes were made and many more were lost. In those days Hollywood's idea for escapism was the screwball comedy, with an emphasis in presenting how the privileged classes lived. This was in sharp contrast with what the majority of regular citizens were experiencing.With that background, Gregory La Cava, a man who knew how to entertain an audience, took the direction of "My Man Godfrey". In the film we are given, on the one hand, what appears to be a city dump near to Sutton Place, one of the richest areas in Manhattan. We are shown a destitute man, Godfrey, who comes in contact with a couple of rich girls out on a scavenger hunt. Godfrey will change their lives forever."My Man Godfrey" gathered a distinguished cast. William Powell and Carole Lombard were at the pinnacle of their popularity. Both actors exuded charisma in any film they graced with their charming presence. They both left a mark of distinction in this comedy. Both are elegant and sophisticated, and they make us care about the characters they are playing.The best thing about those 30s comedies were the marvelous ensemble casts assembled to support the stars. Thus, one is treated to delicious performances by Gail Patrick, Eugene Palette, Alice Brady, Micha Auer, Jean Dixon and Alan Mowbray.This is a classic film that will live forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an amazing film..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey" is truly one of the greatest films of the 20th century. Between comedy and romance, a great moral and wise words are nestled. The film's theme can best be stated by Godfrey's own words: "The only difference between a man and a derelict is a job.." The movie really hits home the fact that men are men, job or not. William Powell does a magnificent job at portraying Godfrey, the butler who humanizes derelicts everywhere. The cast is just as fantastic as the story. Carole Lombard does an amazing job at portraying Irene Bullock, the histrionic and comedic daughter of Alexander and Angelica Bullock, played by Eugene Palette and Alice Brady, both of whom do an amazing job as well. Gail Patrick also does great work as Cornelia Bullock,the uptight and bratty sister of Irene. Jean Dixon and Mischa Auer absolutely steal the show as the Bullocks' hysterical maid and protégé (respectively). The film is definitely a 10...rent it today!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 1st movie Oscar nominated in all 4 acting category.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why it did not receive a Best Picture nomination is a mystery to me. This is an excellent screwball comedy with a sane &amp; socially conscious message. Although the whole cast is flawless, I would give a slight edge to Alice Brady. She did not win the Oscar in 36, but did win in 37 for "In Old Chicago". She had one of the best lines in the movie when speaking to one of her daughters 'It took me all these years to realize insanity runs on your father's side'. Eugene Pallete is excellent as the father &amp; should also have been nominated. This is the only movie I can remember watching with Carole Lombard &amp; she illuminates the screen in every scence. A must! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Set Firmly In The Depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For his second Academy Award nomination for Best Actor William Powell was loaned to Universal for My Man Godfrey. At the time this film was made there was a lot of buzz about Powell working with Carole Lombard who only a few years earlier he had been married to. They needn't have worried. The split was an amicable one and Powell and Lombard got along great on the set and created along with Director Gregory LaCava one of the classic screwball comedies of the Thirties.In fact My Man Godfrey got a whole host of nominations, for LaCava for Best Director, for Carole Lombard, for Mischa Auer for Best Supporting Actor and Alice Brady for Best Supporting Actress. In the very first year of the Supporting categories, My Man Godfrey had nominees in all the acting categories, but failed to win any awards. Curiously enough, it wasn't nominated for Best Picture.The Bulloch sisters Carole Lombard and Gail Patrick a pair of ditzy society girls are on a scavenger hunt which takes them to the city dump where they are to find a forgotten man. The expression is taken from Franklin D. Roosevelt who called those who were out of work and without hope forgotten men. The phrase had a lot of currency back in the day.In fact My Man Godfrey's origins are rooted in the Depression Years. When Powell turns down Patrick's invitation to be her trophy in the scavenger hunt, he accepts Lombard's. It turns out he's no ordinary forgotten man, he is the heir to a large estate held by a prominent Boston WASP family. But that's a fact he conceals from the Bulloch sisters when he's hired as their butler.His time with the Bulloch family is a learning experience indeed for both of them. The Depression hasn't hit these two girls, but it almost does save for Powell's financial acumen. As I said the film is firmly ground in those years of the Depression and the New Deal. It's hard to fathom, but when FDR took office on March 4, 1933, twenty five percent of the workforce was unemployed. Today if the number reaches above five percent the doomsayers are calling it a depression. I remember an uncle of mine telling me that when he graduated high school in 1937 a year after My Man Godfrey he could not get work for over 2 years until America went on a war footing before Pearl Harbor. After that he got drafted and didn't have to worry about a job for a few years. He might have been living just like the men in the city dump, but for the fact my grandparents had jobs and kept a roof over everyone's head.Mischa Auer plays Carlo, a kind of permanent houseguest of Alice Brady as Mrs. Bulloch. In today's world long after the Code has been repealed, Auer might well have been more explicitly gay. Eugene Palette is Mr. Bulloch who freely admits he lives in a house of scatterbrains. Though he got no nominations his playing of the Bulloch patriarch set a standard for him in playing a host of put upon fathers. In 1957 My Man Godfrey was remade with David Niven and June Allyson co-starring. Neither of the leads lacked for the charm needed to put over the story, but instead of The Great Depression, David Niven is an illegal alien looking to get a visa. You don't quite feel for him as you do for the jobless and hopeless William Powell.If My Man Godfrey is ever remade in the modern era, let's hope they keep the economic underpinnings of this classic screwball comedy, even if they don't take it back to the Depression Years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this comedy many times and never get tired of it. Saw it again today on TCM TV, and still get a kick out of it. The spoiled brats of wealthy family man, played by Eugene Pallette, have hired Mr Godfrey as their butler. Carole Lombard and Gail Patrick are the jealous sisters who contrive to win his affections. There is much clutter and romping and confusion, but it all comes out at the end. Mischa Auer plays his usually outrageously funny character. I remember what a hit it was in 1936, and heartily recommend it today!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What we are missing in today's cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is my champion for the golden age of movies versus today's cinema. "Godfrey" has pratfalls and funny situations, yes, but, it values a sly remark and character development over the cheaply-gotten laughs which seem to inundate modern comedies.A case in point is Carlo, the "protege" of the flighty matron of the family. Every time he is attacked by the gruff patriarch, who is rightfully angry at him for leaching off the family's good will, not to mention its money, Carlo utters a sigh so heavy and heavily-acted, that you'd think his dog had died. The mother of the family comes to his defense, admonishing the father 'You must remember that Carlo is sensitive.' Hilarious stuff!The performance of the character actors in "Godfrey" alone merit several viewings, but the movie also sports "Mr. Urbanity", William Powell. Though I think he is wonderful as "The Thin Man," I often wish he had not done so many sequels, saving his talent for well-written comedies like this one. (By the way, another wonderful comedy of this ilk is "Libeled Lady" with Myrna Loy, who, in my humble opinion is the epitomy of class; these two together make a dazzling combo).Powell is glorious in this role. Much of the comedy comes from the fact that he is a butler serving those in a social class to which he used to belong (before the stock market crash). They hire him almost as a joke, thinking him beneath the job, when, in reality, he is highly educated, and, from a family equal or higher than they in social status.Carole Lombard is adorable in her role of the ditzy younger sister who falls for Godfrey and goes to outrageous lengths to win his heart. Much of what she says makes no sense at all, but she is so precious, you can't help loving her anyway.The actress playing the older sister is great as well as the sophisticated but snobbish socialite who will stop at nothing to get what she wants, and then rationalize that she deserves it just because she was born into high society. She develops a crush on Godfrey as well which makes for interesting conflict in the film.But, once again, the unsung stars of this film are the writers and director. There is so much humor packed into a single word or even a well-placed pause. All concerned have created an amazing piece of entertainment.I long for the day when good writing will come back to comedy, but while wading through the drivel that is another inevitable and interminable Jim Carey/Adam Sandler/Chris Farley (they are all inter-changeable to my mind) debacle, I revel in the thought that movies like "Godfrey" have been made in the past, and just might be made again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The butler did it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey" successfully blends the two most prominent schools of film comedy from the 1930's: `sophistication' and `screwball.' It smears the conservative upper-crust milieu with the keen eye of `Dinner at Eight' and the pie-in-your-face irreverence of `You Can't Take It with You,' with as many witticisms as either and probably more sexual innuendos. Occasional predictability keeps it from being on par with "It Happened One Night" or "Trouble in Paradise," but it is still one of the most emblematic films of its era.William Powell is pitch perfect as Godfrey Parke, the hobo-turned-butler, breezing effortlessly through every scene. Carole Lombard also turns in one of her most cherished performances as Irene Bullock, the spoiled socialite who pretends to enjoy her wealth but really just wants to be around someone human. As their relationship progresses, Godfrey's humility rubs off on Irene and ultimately frees her from her elite family, which offered her security but only made her unstable. `My Man Godfrey' has no mercy on the aristocracy of the ?30's, skewing it as socially incompetent and morally bankrupt. `All you need to start an asylum is an empty room and the right kind of people.' How terribly true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Purely Escapist Screwball.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank God for the Thirties and the Depression Era. Even though by today's standards many of the movies released in this time sound somewhat irritating and tinny and have what is considered mannered performances, there's no denying that many of the best comedies were produced in this time, Code or no Code.MY MAN GODFREY hasn't a serious bone to its celluloid body and any deep analysis about character motivation or deep direction is really just being pretentious. All of the performances are uniformly good, and while not the lead, Gail Patrick steals her scenes from the rest of the cast with well-written lines, poise, and a good deadpan sarcasm. Fun, witty, silly, with plot holes that can be seen from space, but ultimately a comedic fantasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of these days I'm going to go gorilla hunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "screwball" comedies of the 1930s was an attempt to try to lift the depressed feelings of millions of Americans who were out of work and facing near starvation - and a collapse of optimism and belief in the American Dream. Frequently they showed the wealthy were eccentrics who were facing bankruptcy (THREE CORNERED MOON) or bored and looking for excitement by solving crimes (THE MAD MISS MANTON, or THE THIN MAN), or trapped by their public persona into nearly ruinous scandals (EASY LIVING). These comedies, at their best, remain very enjoyable. Of course there were clinkers (for example, HE MARRIED HIS WIFE), but I always find pleasure in the best ones.MY MAN GODFREY is among the best, and curiously thoughtful. One person I know, listening to it, called it a "morality" play. William Powell is a hobo named Godfrey who is living in a "Hooverville" on Manhattan Island. There is a scavenger hunt going on for a charity, and a woman named Cordelia Bullock (Gail Patrick) and her boyfriend show up - they need a "forgotten man" to win the contest. Powell dislikes Patrick's snobby demanding nature and rejects her offer. Shortly her sister Irene Bullock (Carole Lombard) shows up, and Powell willingly goes with her (she's a feather-head, but a nice one). After he goes to the hotel which is the center of the contest, he accepts a job offer from her. The Bullocks are a wealthy family on Fifth Avenue. Eugene Palette and Alice Brady are the parents. Since Brady has a protégé (Mischa Auer as "Carlo"), Lombard feels that she should make Powell her protégé too. Powell finds that working for the Bullocks is difficult for three reasons. Lombard is falling for him, and he knows that socially a butler is not supposed to be the lover of an heiress (sort of the reverse of the plot of SABRINA). Secondly Patrick is gunning for him, unwilling to forgive his snubbing her offer - and she is treacherous. Finally there is a background matter that might turn up: Godfrey is not poor by fate but by his choice - he's from a wealthy Boston family, but he is trying to prove himself as a worthy person and not a spoiled brat.There are great set pieces throughout the film: Auer's performance of what he does best - which is why Brady patronizes him - acting as a gorilla. Palette is pretty sensible, and he dislikes this leech. His comment about what he'd like to do to Carlo is in the "Summary Line". There is also the mystery of the missing jewelry, and how it blows up in Patrick's conniving face. There is the business of how Powell's college roommate (Alan Mowbray) has to lie to explain how he lost "Godfrey's" services as a butler after a serious tiff (except we never understand how the tiff developed to become serious!). There is Grady Sutton's amazement to hear he has just proposed to Lombard. And there is Palette's friendly willingness to show Powell (before he realizes he is the new butler) his boxing abilities.A fable on materialist failures and proper use of wealth in a national crisis, MY MAN GODFREY may be set in the Depression, but it's meaning has never faded out of fashion. It remains a fine example of first rate movie making from the 1930s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful! Extremely well made and acted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey" is truly a wonderful film! I was shown "My Man Godfrey" when I was in a highschool class on film. I resisted the idea of enjoying "such an old film" the same way Godfrey resists Irene, but in the end the film won me over with its comedy and charms. I have been enjoying it ever since, and the comedy still holds up very well. "My Man Godfrey" is about a poor, out of work man (William Powell) who lives at a New York City dump. Soon his quiet world is made a bit chaotic by the introduction of two sisters on a scavenger hunt. Godfrey has an angry run-in with sister Cornelia (Gail Patrick), but is soon offered the job of a butler by sister Irene (Carole Lombard.) The next day Godfrey shows up to start his job as a butler in the Bullock household. He makes friends with the sharp and snappy maid (Jean Dixon), and learns the personalities of The Bullocks. Irene is flighty, impulsive, and quirky, and soon develops feelings for Godfrey. Cornelia continues to have an attitude toward Godfrey due to the angry run-in that happened on the night they met. Mrs. Bullock (Alice Brady) is very polite, but also very giddy. Mrs. Bullock's protoge, Carlo (Mischa Auer), feels he is one of the family as he continually stuffs his face with food. Mr. Bullock (Eugene Pallette) seems to be the only level-headed person in the household, but is facing financial difficulties. Through the course of the film it becomes clear Godfrey has more of a background than just a poor man who lived on a city dump. Also during the film Godfrey tries to resist Irene's advances, Cornelia's revenge, and tries to help Mr. Bullock recover financially as Godfrey prepares to advance his life beyond being a butler. The plot and situations in "My Man Godfrey" offer a lot of comedy! --The humor ranges from flighty and giddy to clever and sophisticated. There's also dry sarcastic humor, puns, and some light physical comedy. Such a wide range of humor helps the film be a total delight! The characters themselves have their charms and interesting points, and were well written. The plot was also well written. "My Man Godfrey" was directed by Gregory La Cava, and it seems he and the rest of the production team put in great effort to make this a well made film. The sets, props, and costumes are all very interesting. The film is extremely well acted by the entire cast, and their timing and facial expressions are perfect. "My Man Godfrey" is simply one of the best comedies I have ever seen. Sadly, it seems Universal Pictures did not keep up with the film's copyright, and the film can now be found on video and DVD by several different companies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightfully Naive and Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York post-Great Depression, the spoiled socialites Irene Bullock (Carole Lombard) and her sister Cornelia Bullock (Gail Patrick) are disputing a scavenger hunt where the winner is the one who brings a "forgotten man" first. They go to the city dump and Cornelia offers five dollars to the derelict Godfrey Smith (William Powell) to go with her and her companion to the Wardolf Hotel. The man pushes her in the garbage and Cornelia leaves the landfill with her companion. However, Irene talks to Godfrey that she wanted to beat Cornelia to it and he accepts to go with her to win the prize. Irene offers the position of butler to Godfrey and tells her parents Alexander (Eugene Palette) and Angelica Bullock (Alice Brady) that she has hired Godfrey to work for their dysfunctional family in their mansion. Irene has an infatuation on Godfrey and protects him while Cornelia hates him and wants to harm him. During a party in the Bullock's house, the Harvard graduated investor Tommy Gray (Alan Mowbray) recognizes Godfrey and salutes him. But the butler asks him to keep the secret of his past and schedules an encounter in the restaurant to explain what is happening. "My Man Godfrey" is a delightfully naive and funny romantic comedy with magnificent performances of William Powell and Carole Lombard, who is wonderful in the role of a spoiled and reckless woman. The dialogs have great moments and one of the best quotes is when Godfrey Parker tells to Tommy Gray that "the only difference between a derelict and a man is a job". "My Man Godfrey" had six nominations to the Oscar in 1937 (Best Actor in a Leading Role: William Powell; Best Actor in a Supporting Role: Mischa Auer; Best Actress in a Leading Role: Carole Lombard; Best Actress in a Supporting Role: Alice Brady; Best Director: Gregory La Cava; and Best Writing, Screenplay: Eric Hatch and Morrie Ryskind). My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Irene, a Teimosa" ("Irene, the Stubborn")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powell and Lombard spark off a great screwball comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Powell is the Godfrey of the film's title, at the beginning of the film apparently an unshaven bum living at the city dump. His peace is suddenly disrupted one fateful night by the Bullock sisters, Irene (Carole Lombard) and Cornelia (Gail Patrick), who each need a 'forgotten man' to win their scavenger hunt. Cornelia, haughty and rude, annoys Godfrey, and he volunteers to help the decidely loopy Irene beat her sister for once. Before long, Irene wants Godfrey as her 'protege', following in the footsteps of her zany mother Angelica (Alice Brady) who seems to have adopted the odd little Russian man Carlo (Mischa Auer). It isn't long, either, before Irene falls hard for Godfrey and tries her best, from faking engagements to faking fainting spells, to win him over. But Godfrey has his own secrets and reasons for working at the Bullock household. (As gleefully pointed out by Molly the maid, played by Jean Dixon, no *ordinary* butler lasts beyond their first encounter with the extremely eccentric female Bullocks.) It is through Godfrey's reevaluation of his own true identity, and the Bullocks' subsequent discovery of this identity, that every character in the film learns a little something about themselves and about life.MY MAN GODFREY has just about as screwball a cast of characters as it can get: after all, the Bullock girls (consisting of a ditzy matriach who sees pixies when she has a hangover and a daughter who rides horses up the front steps and parks them in the library!) certainly do their very best to keep one constantly bemused. The actresses all do very well in their roles--Brady tosses off manic giggles as Madame Bullock so convincingly you wonder if she really *is* like that in real life. She handles the character's blithe irrelevance expertly, even as Mrs Bullock sees hangover-induced pixies, asks her pet Carlo to play gorilla to cheer her daughter up, and spouts non sequiturs like she was born to do so. Gail Patrick is also worthy of mention as the spoilt brat Cornelia, who sets out to make Godfrey's life as difficult as she can because he pushed her into an ash pile when they first met, and even as butler, he still refuses to pander to her every whim. Patrick really does a grand job playing the bitch (see STAGE DOOR for another example), but doesn't completely alienate the audience--quite a feat considering what she does with her pearl necklace in order to get Godfrey fired...!The leads are on top form as well. In approaching the role of Irene with no reservations whatsoever, Carole Lombard gives an excellent portrayal of this kooky heiress who not only doggedly pursues Godfrey once she discovers he's actually single and *doesn't* have five children, but also drifts around striking tragic poses learnt at drama school to get Godfrey's attention when she *thinks* he's married with kids. Lombard doesn't try to live up to any kind of glamorous image; she just *goes* for it all, crying, fainting, jumping around the room and all over the bed because Godfrey sticking her in the shower somehow proves he 'loves' her... She has no problem with either looking or acting foolish, and this works entirely in her favour, as well as that of her character's. Good as she is, however, she can't quite stop MY MAN GODFREY from being a consummate William Powell film. Powell is absolutely fantastic: even though he doesn't quite carry off the street bum look (his natural elegance struggles through, and even that's probably part of the role since Godfrey isn't really who he appears to be), his Godfrey is wry, charming and witty. No one plays the lucid drunk better than Powell, and this film, along with THE THIN MAN series, acts as the best evidence of that. He handles his character's self-imposed detachment from the Lombard character with aplomb, playing Godfrey as simultaneously bemused and charmed. Small wonder that the film picked up acting nominations in all four categories (male and female lead and supporting) at the Academy Awards--the cast of MY MAN GODFREY is really excellent, and they're ably supported by the script and assured direction of Gregory La Cava. All in all, it's a great film: certainly one of the best romantic comedies I've seen, though possibly not the best screwball (that honour still belongs to BRINGING UP BABY, which certainly recognises its debt to MY MAN GODFREY, at least insofar as Katharine Hepburn brings a lot of Lombard's inflection and lilt into her own performance). It's the kind of film you won't see emerging from Hollywood anymore, unless it's a remake (heaven forbid), and definitely one whose characters really need to be seen to be believed. The ending of the film is a bit rushed (though bizarrely appropriate!), and it certainly isn't perfect, but other than that, MY MAN GODFREY is first-class film-making with classy performances... and that's as good a reason as any to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film to watch and re-watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't add much to what others have said, but this is a wonderful film. From the very beginning (the credits are done extremely well, especially considering it was made about 70 years ago!) to the end, this is one funny/sad/satirical movie. The sets are obviously from the 30's, but the dialogue is still relevant. We have watched it four times and still catch new things. Don't miss 'minor' characters during the show--check out their facial expressions and their actions (especially Carlo).Some versions have outtakes and other features. The outtakes aren't G-rated, so this isn't for children (who have probably heard much worse anyway, unfortunately)--but most kids might not be able to keep up with the fast-paced dialogue anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical Lombard Plus Dapper Powell Sparkle in Comedy Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During Hollywood's golden era, Carole Lombard was probably the most strikingly beautiful actress of her generation and arguably the most talented comedienne. She managed to be both hilariously free-wheeling and uninhibitedly down-to-earth, even as she plays the flightiest of madcap heiresses. One can only speculate what brilliant career lay ahead of her had she not died tragically early in a 1942 plane crash. Fortunately, we have this 1936 screwball classic, likely her most famous film, as a reminder of her beauty, charisma and sheer likability. Her character Irene Bullock feels like a first cousin to Katharine Hepburn's Susan Vance in "Bringing Up Baby", a scatterbrained, motor-mouthed, persistent-beyond-reason socialite living with her equally eccentric family on Park Avenue. If not for Lombard, this character would try anyone's patience with her impetuous behavior and the childish competitiveness she displays with her sister.What makes this movie different though is its social consciousness about the thoughtless rich and the put-upon downtrodden, the contrast of which made this particularly apt during the Great Depression. But the grand statements one would expect from a Capra never seem leaden in this comedy as directed by the underrated Gregory LaCava. Instead, they are fully integrated into a story that starts with a society "scavenger hunt" for a "forgotten man". In the city dump, the Bullock daughters find one in the form of Godfrey, portrayed with typically dapper élan by William Powell. Godfrey is an erudite hobo with whom Irene becomes quickly enamored, and in short order, she convinces him to become the family butler. As it turns out, of course, he turns out to be the scion of a wealthy Boston family who decided to shuck it all once he was betrayed by love. He becomes the catalyst for improving the lives and characters of the Bullocks, all the while ensuring he takes care of his hobo friends on the riverfront. Only Powell could play a character that moves so fluidly between bum and butler, though he does falter slightly in his drunken scenes which seem really to come out of nowhere to move the plot along. Powell and Lombard were previously married and divorced prior to this film, and there is a subtle familiarity in their burgeoning relationship that makes their rapport sparkle (ironically, off-screen, he was in love with Jean Harlow at the time, she just beginning with Gable).The supporting cast is impeccable in characteristic roles for the actors - Eugene Palette in typical comic, fog-horned bluster as the frustrated patriarch (though actually more restrained here than his other similar roles of the period); Alice Brady in full daffy flightiness as the arts-loving mother with her own live-in protégé in Mischa Auer, who plays Carlo as the high-maintenance leech he is (his chimpanzee impersonation scene is priceless thanks to his manic agility); Jean Dixon as the smart-mouthed maid Molly who develops her own crush on Godfrey (though the script gives her short shrift in this development); and best of all, Gail Patrick, who epitomizes the upper-crust bitch-princess as the talon-bearing sister Cornelia (of course, she and Lombard do not look remotely like sisters). It all wraps up nicely though rather fancifully, for instance, Cornelia does an about-face only a Hollywood producer would find credible. And one could argue that the portrayal of Godfrey's hobo brethren is on the sanctimonious side. But it doesn't matter, as the movie glides over the heavier implications of wealth, class distinctions and social injustice with a velvet glove. A true and deserved classic.I am generally not a fan of colorization, though I have to admit the digital technology seems to be improving as the new discount-priced DVD provides a surprisingly nice transfer with soft, pastel colors except for some of the more elaborate evening gowns at the beginning. The package includes the original black-and-white version for purists and a colorized trailer as well. This is a good alternative to the Criterion Collection DVD priced at nearly four times the price (granted with additional features.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything You Could Ask For In a Screwball Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has just about everything you could ask for in a screwball comedy: a family of eccentrics, the rich versus poor theme, far-fetched but enjoyable plot developments, and more. William Powell is right at home, Carole Lombard is lively and sympathetic, and the supporting cast pitches in with some fine performances of their own.The opening sequence, with Lombard and Gail Patrick (as her sister) meeting Powell while on their scavenger hunt, is unusual and keeps you a little off-balance, and yet it sets up the main part of the story rather well. Besides introducing the characters and initiating the action, it also presents some interesting themes that are later developed more fully.As "My Man Godfrey", Powell's dry wit and charisma work perfectly, and he plays well off of Lombard's more bubbly performance. Patrick fits well into the role of the spiteful sister, Eugene Palette is very amusing as the harassed father, and Mischa Auer has a couple of good scenes that fit his talents well. Jean Dixon and Alice Brady also have some good moments when they get the opportunity.The fine cast and director Gregory La Cava's careful touch keep things on-track even through the silliest developments, making it an enjoyable and sometimes thoughtful picture.</fullReview>

I actually expected Godfrey (William Powell was good!) to end up w/ the gutsy sister Cornelia. They had much more chemistry and it would have been much more interesting. It would also have added to the social critique that was unevenly spread through the film. The ending was lame - both the interaction with the family, Cornelia's uncharacteristic &amp; sudden reversal/reaction AND the horrifying final conclusion between Godfrey &amp; Carol Lombard's character..... Where did that come from? Would it really happen? Is she totally insane? Did I blink &amp; miss the instance in which he actually indicated the slightest interest? He seemed more interested in the maid, I thought. Stick to the Thin Man movies that William Powell did. Much better &amp; with more realistic women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not screwball comedy at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this movie last night and was sorely disappointed. I had just seen and enjoyed "I Love You Again" starring William Powell and Myrna Loy and wanted to see more of Powell's work. Well, he's great, and has a pretty well-written character in "My Man Godfrey," but, as someone else has pointed out here, the women's characters are two-dimensional. What a waste of female talent!When I think of the screwball comedies that are really good, I think of "Bringing Up Baby," a film where both the male *and* the female leads had snappy dialogue and wonderfully written characters that had a native intelligence, not simply a childish persistence, such as Carole Lombard's Irene had in "My Man Godfrey."And the dialogue ain't all that great, either. A lot of the laugh lines seemed to be Powell's sarcastic remarks which were too obvious and too many. The actors make the most of it that they can, but the lines just aren't good enough.The plot also had holes in it, loose ends, and an unconvincing emotional throughline.As for the social commentary on "the forgotten men," please. Actually it started out quite well with the uncomfortable scene in the city dump, but after that it seemed as if the writer wanted to take care of that issue with lip service. Why bring it up if you're not going to do it justice? Preston Sturgess managed to solidly and economically show us the dark side of human nature, yet still expertly weave in the nutty characters and big laffs.I'm not one of those viewers who loves modern comedies like Adam Sandler stuff. I've been seeing these old films for decades. So don't consider this the commentary of someone who just doesn't "get it."I'd advise people who want to see Powell to see him in "The Thin Man" or "I Love You Again" (and I'm sure there are more), and to get the best screwball comedy by checking out some of Katherine Hepburn's and Cary Grant's films, something with George S. Kaufman's name on it, or a Preston Sturgess film. I'm sure there are many more, and would love to see a comprehensive list of *really* good comedies of this genre someplace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A celebration of the shared humanity of the rich and the poor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey, one of the key examples of the screwball comedy genre that dominated Hollywood comedy scene during the late 1930s and early 1940s, sums up it's key concept within it's opening shot, as the waste of the rich is deposited into the city dump in which Godfrey (William Powell) calls home. The idea of the interaction between the two separate poles of modern America, the rich and the poor, runs throughout the film. The first time we see Godfrey (above, with Irene) he is disheveled, replete with scruffy beard and dirty coat. He is approached by socialite Cornelia Bullock (Gail Patrick) who needs a "forgotten man" to win the scavenger hunt taking place in the swanky hotel which overlooks the city dump (another illusion to the thin line between the have and the have-nots, particularly relevant in Depression-era America). Her attitude to him prompts him to push her into a pile of ash, much to the amusement of her scatter brained, but pure hearted, sister Irena (Carole Lombard). Intrigued by Irena's ways, Godfrey agrees to be her "forgotten man", helping Irena to win the scavenger hunt. As thanks, Irena, obviously quite taken by Godfrey, offers him a position as the family butler, which he accepts.Initially, My Man Godfrey comes across as quite radical for its time: the down-and-out Butler comes in and is more educated, refined and human than those he serves, a timely commentary on the nature of the bourgeoisie and how wealth does not necessarily correlate with a person's inherent qualities. Whilst it certainly does contain inference to these ideals (the Bullock family, who are scatterbrained (Irena), pompous (Cornelia), downright stupid (the mother) and world-weary and defeated (the father), all characteristics associated with the rich in more modern art, whilst the servants Godfrey and Molly are erudite, intelligent and aware) it does not state them openly. However, halfway through the film this bubbling undercurrent of class insurrection is dissipated by the discovery that Godfrey is actually himself from the privileged set and had fled polite society after a bitter love affair. Whilst a 'forgotten man' the optimistic, undaunted attitude of the homeless ("Success is just around the corner!" "Which corner?" being a recurring gag amongst the set) helped re-stir his passion for life and ultimately helps him escape, as he uses his wages to invest wisely, eventually making enough money to save the Bullock family from bankruptcy (a much under utilised b-story) and build a fashionable nightspot on the city dump, giving the forgotten men somewhere to work in the summer and somewhere to live and eat in the winter, an analogy for America's prosperity being built upon the poor.Made during the Depression, a time when the nature of wealth in capitalist civilisations first became a prominent concern, My Man Godfrey is primarily about redemption. Whether the viewer wants to correlate this to personnel redemption or as an analogy of financial redemption (or both) is up to them. The film is a celebration of the shared humanity of the rich and the poor, and a clear statement that the line between the two realms was becoming so thin in contemporary America that one could so readily become mistaken for the other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey was a classic screwball comedy from the golden era. Right away the film draws you in with entertainment and humor. Every word and mannerism that comes from Godfrey is hilarious. Especially the part where Irene asked why he lived in the town dump, and his reply was that his real estate agent suggested the altitude would be good for his asthma.As the film goes on, there are new and exciting factors that keep the viewer wanting more. When the Bullock family begins to find out that Godfrey is more than they thought he was. As Irene falls in love with him, her over dramatic behavior had me laughing the entire time.The camera work was great for the time the film was made. The camera followed the actors up the stairs, making the viewer feel like they were standing in the room watching people move.The setting and environment in each scene clearly showed the economic status of the characters, except for Godfrey. It's obvious that Irene and Cornelia were from a very wealthy family; having an event at the Ritz, and wearing fur coats. My favorite aspect of the film, was that Godfrey's identity was kept under-wraps for most of the film. Also, it seemed that he was more wholesome than the Bullock family, even though he was supposed to be the forgotten man, but he seemed to have a better hold on society.I thought My Man Godfrey was much better than most films today, the whole composition of the film, the script, the acting, just everything. I loved every moment of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perspective From 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't bore the reader with my sage observations about the quality of the cast / script / direction. I just want to say two things about this film.The first thing is that the subject has particular relevance today, 75 years after the movie was issued. Near the beginning of the film, a character jokes that "Prosperity is just around the corner." Another character wants to know which corner. So much for setting the tone. It seems that the problems so elegantly addressed in the script - social and fiscal, by such an elegant cast - are still some of the most pressing problems of today. Where are the gifted creative team members to bring the message to modern audiences?My second point is that, although I've seen this movie several times, each viewing makes me think of it less as a comedy, let alone a screwball comedy, and more as a powerful film with a very serious tone. I realize that Godfrey really is grateful to the Bullock family and his farewell is far more than a clever way to move the action along to the final scene. Did I say "less" comedic? All of this simply makes the comedy more delicious and the film more satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as close to perfect a light comedy as you'll find from the 30s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a marvelous film and is a perfect example of light comedy from the 1930s. The writing and acting by the wonderful ensemble cast is absolutely dynamite and hard to beat.William Powell plays Godfrey, a hobo brought home as part of a scavenger hunt. One of the girls in the family, ultra-dippy Carole Lombard, arranges for him to become their new butler and he is absolutely perfect at his job in every way and does a lot to get this rich but totally flighty family to function well, as when the movie starts it is like a madhouse instead of a family home. The zaniness going on is a lot of fun to watch, but you really have to feel for the father (Eugene Palette) having to put up with freeloaders like Mischa Auer, a stupid wife, one even stupider daughter and another who is a cold little thing. And, on top of everything else, the family is spending him into oblivion.Where the film goes I don't want to tell as it would ruin it. However, be prepared for some of the funniest characters and dialog you've seen in a long time. This film is a wonderful example to young whipper-snappers that they DID make terrific movies in the olden days!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brother, can you spare a dime?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not unusual to find madcap rich people in '30s films, more specifically, madcap heiresses. They abound. Meet the Bullocks in "My Man Godfrey," about as mad a family as you'll ever meet, complete with a madcap daughter who will someday become an heiress, played by Carole Lombard. William Powell is Godfrey, one of the Depression's forgotten men, whom Lombard decides to remember after he agrees to be the prize find in a scavenger hunt. She hires him as the family butler.As Irene, Lombard wanders around with her hair in her face looking as though she's having trouble seeing, while her sister, the beautifully put together, bitchy Cornelia (Gail Patrick) tries to frame Godfrey for stealing her necklace in between cocktail parties, and her mother (Alice Brady) talks baby talk to her dog, and her protégée Carlos practices his art by nearly eating the family into poverty. The head of the house, Eugene Palette, understandably has trouble coping. Godfrey sails effortlessly through it all.This is a wonderful film that manages to show the sadness and rough times brought on by the depression as well as plenty of comedy. Lombard is one actress whose voice, for some reason, never mixed well with the old-fashioned studio sound system, so sometimes her crying and high-pitched protests are grating, though she is certainly very likable in the role of a kind-hearted, sensitive woman. Gail Patrick gives a multilayered performance as the glamorous Cornelia, making the most of a supporting part. Alice Brady and Eugene Palette are wonderful as the parents. Jean Dixon, as the dry-humored maid, nearly steals the movie with her deadpan comments.William Powell is sheer perfection. Nothing new there. He is in the beginning a dignified, serious bum who is down on his luck, and then turns into a smooth, efficient butler who carries with him a touch of sadness and irony. Like all of Powell's performances, it looks effortless, but it's brilliant.Certainly a well-remembered and loved film, with good reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the films that have evaded me for forty-five years of obsessive film-watching. I finally bought the DVD and had a very enjoyable couple of hours. I am a great admirer of Preston Sturges and this looks for all the world like one of the great progenitors of his masterpiece 'Sullivan's Travels'. As in that film, here there is a stark comparison between rich and poor and we are left to draw our own conclusions. What is splendid is the script which shows the vagrant butler gradually becoming totally vital to the semi-functioning of a nightmarish family. (There are shades of 'The Admirable Crichton' here.) What let the film down, for me, was the unexpectedly silly performance from Carole Lombard. This wonderful actress seems a natural for the dizzy daughter, but she is allowed to ham it up to the detriment of the psychological realism of the whole. So, regrettably, what could have been a 9 became an 8, and is actually more like an upper-7. (Of course, it will probably improve substantially in the cinema where it belongs...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bright, uplifting comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a delightful comedy that serves up some tough questions regarding the worth of the individual and the layered perspectives in society. Many of the film's scenes are quite long. Although length and development seem to stretch from time to time, each segment is purposeful. La Cava directed in a time when films cautiously strayed from distracting the audience. Many of our contemporary pictures have a great deal of ?fluff' to administer different effects. By devoting more time to development, the script yields humorous moments more frequently. I was most surprised with the clarity and focus of the film from a technical standpoint. For 1939 this is a beautiful picture that utilizes many distinct locations, but never falters in sharp imagery or detail. The wide open house serves as a great opportunity to use dolly and tracking shots. Since humor is the main objective, it is imperative to exploit moments that use physical humor. When Godfrey comes home drunk and serves the women drinks, he follows a routine serving pattern while the camera tracks him around the circle of chairs. The humor in this instance can be found in the sways and sluggish stepping of Godfrey. He seems to progressively get ?worse' after each lady is served before he must retire to the kitchen. Although there is a certain amount of social commentary in My Man Godfrey, I think that the comedic element of this film tends to drown out the seriousness of depression and worthiness. Though the story excels at sending a moral message about prejudice, any attempt to dignify the casualties suffered (at the time) flails in the warm blanket of romantic comedy.A solid, depression-era flick.*** (of ****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carole Lombard and William Powell are a hoot in this 1936 screwball comedy classic. With one of the finest supporting casts assembled for a film ever, one of the sharpest scripts you'll see and one of the most deftest, original set-ups, 'My Man Godfrey' never disappoints.This is another one of those Depression-era comedies that send-up the idle rich, and make heroes of the underdog. Carole Lombard is excellent as Irene Bullock, the spoiled society girl. This was Lombard's only Best Actress nomination (Why?), and she's terrific in every scene. Irene is competing with her snotty sister Cornelia at a society scavenger hunt, one of the rich people's favourite 'pastimes'. One of the things on the list required is a 'Forgotten Man'. It's almost implausible that anyone could ever forget the delightful William Powell, but his Godfrey has been forgotten, and is currently residing at the dump. Powell of course is too suave to be a derelict, but let's let that minor flaw pass by, shall we? Cornelia spots him first, but her snobby demeanor and bossiness instantly off-put Godfrey, who ends the encounter by pushing her in a dust-pile. Irene is next on the scene, and finds the whole situation terribly funny (Love the trademark Lombard cackle!). Still, she'd love to beat Cornelia, and Godfrey finds her inherently charming, so she takes him along to the Scavenger hunt. She wins, and insists he be the new family butler. And that's where the havoc begins.Irene has obviously fallen head-over-heels for the tramp/butler, and makes no secret of it in her outlandish, yet lovable antics. Her sister finds the whole set-up revolting. Their henpecked father doesn't really care either way as he is having too much trouble controlling the females of the family to worry about the new butler. The mother (delightful Alice Brady) finds Godfrey a great help, but it rather tied-up with her interest in 'sponsored' protégé (really, a toy boy!) Carlo (a wickedly funny scene-stealing performance from Mischa Auer).We should really hate Lombard's character, spoiled little society brat that she is, but we love her! She's not a snob like her sister, and Lombard fills her with that spontaneous charm that makes her so difficult to dislike. She throws tantrums, yes, but she never really means to hurt anyone, apart from getting back at her sister. Lombard was a comedienne never afraid to have a laugh at herself. Here she gets put in the shower by Powell, bawls hysterically and even fakes a turn in order to kiss the butler! She's great, and I absolutely adore Lombard because of this performance.Powell is the sane one in this zany family. He's our hero, the calm onlooker who manages to bring order to the Bullock household. In their interaction with Godfrey, eventually the members of the idle rich take a good hard look at themselves. It's got that Capra feel to it, but this is a Gregory La Cava production. It's classic screwball comedy, and along with 'Bringing Up Baby', may just be the best one ever produced by Hollywood.</fullReview>

Lombard also manages to be charming and entrancingly beautiful in this movie. You'll laugh at her antics and fall in love with her at the same time. William Powell is the picture of genuine elegance and charm as the "forgotten man," or tramp discovered by the ditsy Irene and the calculating Cornelia on a scavenger hunt, and asked by the smitten Irene to be their butler.

So, I had high hopes for "My Man Godfrey"But I was definitely disappointed. I just found very little of this movie to be funny. I know I'm swimming up-river by saying this, but to me it felt like bad imitative screwball --- like someone was trying to make a screwball comedy but didn't really understand what makes screwball work. The "madcap heiress" part isn't really charming-annoying as she should be, just immature and annoying. The "all-American common-sense hero" is actually a snide, Harvard-educated member of the upper-class himself. The family members who should be nutty and oblivious come across instead as just just self-involved and unaware. For me the dialog didn't sparkle -- it was as if the director had decided that having everyone speak fast and loud was the same think as having them be clever and effervescent. Sadly, though it's a short movie, I found myself watching the clock and waiting for it to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screwball comedy with a Depression era message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was Universal's first endeavor at the "screwball comedy" genre which up to that time included films such as "The Front Page" and "Dinner at Eight". The bread and butter of Universal in the 30's was classic horror, so this film does well not only as Universal's first film of this type in the talking era, it is just a great film, period. What makes it work so well is William Powell in the starring role. He was at the peak of his acting prowess in 1936, and a master at playing the wily sophisticate. Here he plays Godfrey Smith, a man living in the New York City dump when a couple of wealthy sisters approach him one night and offer him five dollars to accompany them to a scavenger hunt. He quickly rebuffs Cornelia Bullock when she treats him like a broken vase, and sends her packing. However, her sister Irene is genuinely interested in why Godfrey is living in the dump, as though this is a personal choice for the men living here in the depth of the Great Depression, and Godfrey becomes intrigued with her sincerity and the situation in general. Thus, he agrees to accompany Irene and enables her to win first prize and beat her sister. Out of gratitude and a budding romantic interest, Irene offers Godfrey the job of family butler - a job in which nobody seems to last very long, and when you meet the Bullocks at home you find out why. They are truly a self-involved and high maintenance bunch. The mother is a kind soul a bit taken to drink. Cornelia is ever bit the lizard on two legs that she seemed on her and Godfrey's first meeting, and Irene, like her mother, is a kind soul, but taken to episodes of the dramatic. Eugene Palette, with his trademark frog voice, plays the long-suffering Mr. Bullock who spends most of his time paying for the damages caused by the exploits of his idle rich daughters and for the food bill of his wife's artistic protégé Carlo.Godfrey goes the distance as butler, though, navigating touchy situations with the skill of someone who seems to have an intimate knowledge of the world in which the Bullocks live. It soon becomes clear why Godfrey is so patient and wise with his charges, and his own story enables a happy ending for all concerned - for the Bullocks when Mr. Bullock plays the market and loses everything that belongs to him and some that doesn't thanks to a little hopeful embezzling on his part, and also for Godfrey's comrades at the dump when Godfrey is able to find employment for all of them and lift them out of poverty. Of course, the not too subtle yet not heavy-handed message of this Depression era film is that while the idle rich look for ways to occupy their time such as giftless protégés and pointless games, there are real problems that need solving with human lives in the balance.Lombard is great as Irene. Rather than just play the part as a dizzy blonde, she gives the part wit, and strangely enough, manages to give depth to a rather shallow character. Without that wit and depth, Irene would have been just one more inmate in the Bullock asylum, and it would be a real stretch to believe Godfrey would find her interesting. The only thing that seemed a little forced and pat was the ending. Although I could easily believe that Irene was in love with Godfrey, Godfrey seems very formal with Irene and only lets down his facade when he is dealing with her as one deals with a spoiled child when she gets over-dramatic with him. I never felt he was returning her romantic sentiments at all. However, this is a minor criticism in a film with a terrific cast that is one of the great witty comedies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godfrey was a hilarious movie, hands down. The variety of personalities that the main character had to interact with, was a wonderful experience. You at first think that the movie is probably about Godfey and Cornelia, but then the sudden focus of Irene comes into play, then she becomes a major important plot of the movie. Irene's hilariously dramatic scenes (mostly when she tries to pursue Godfrey) are well done, along with getting to know the other family members. One thing that got me especially, was when Godfrey and Cornelia have a heart to heart. The person who was probably disliked the most, getting a taste of sympathy through a small understanding? Very good, very good. The movie had the characters down, for sure but that wasn't just the main focus here. The point of the film was that despite going through The Depression, it is possible to get back on your feet, and Godfrey demonstrated this perfectly. A man who started out with nothing at the beginning of the movie, ends with having so much and splitting it with the very dysfunctional family who helped him. It's a wonderful screwball comedy of it's time, and with the hint of seriousness that surrounds it, that's what makes it perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is both a hard-hitting and hilarious story that is put together flawlessly by director Gregory La Cava. The focus he places on camera angels and timing are tremendous especially the camera that follows Godfrey up and down the stairs continuously while he tends to the bullock family. The dialog is fast-paced and incredibly witty adding to the quirky personalities of the characters that are played very well. William Powell is an amazing actor who captures the essence of Godfreys troubled pass perfectly; He is both distant yet incredibly aware at the same time. Irene, who is played by actress Carole Lombard, does very well at playing the ditzy, head over heels in love character who is sometimes painfully unaware but has a heart of gold. The film was very well scored with appropriate music at the right times and the lighting was also effective. The final scene was ridiculously funny and brought the story to a light-hearted end. Overall the film was technically well done and enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed My Man Godfrey a lot. The continuous shots from when Godfrey was the butler for the first time was really sophisticated and opened my eyes to the genius behind the film. I also enjoyed the fast paced speech as well as how one thing happened right after the other. It was every comedic and everyone worked seamlessly together. The cast was perfect and my favorite character was the dramatic Carlo. How outrageous he was had me in stitches. The other neat thing about the movie was how the low cast people or "Extras" had little one liners in the movie was where just as funny as the main cast. That is how to know a true slapstick is when you laugh at every character in the movie. Very well put together, with the soundtrack and witty writing. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh.</fullReview>

The way that the characters interact with each other works well with throwing around punch lines and putting the story together. The story is fast paced gets you from scene to scene. It doesn't miss a beat and you feel like you're the one that just found Godfrey. The actors in this movie are spot on with their emotions and facial expressions and jump right into the punch line. They're all hysterical and have you laughing every minute. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good comedy. It's one of the best screwball comedies of its time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey has a number of elements that help make it into a timeless comedy. Despite the fact that it was released in the 1930's, the film's humor still holds up. The majority of the comedy in the film is character driven, meaning that it can be appreciated no matter when it is viewed. The characters are charming and empathetic. Underneath the films comedic exterior there is also a valuable message that is conveyed throughout the film about friendship and compassion that adds to the films value. I was surprised by the nature of this film, as I was expecting the humor to feel dated and out of place in modern times, only to find the opposite to be true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film, My Man Godfrey, was all around a good watch. Cinematic-ally, for it's time, it captivated the audience. This film did a great job at balancing the sometimes ridiculous nature of a slapstick movie, with a real entertaining story-line that makes you think about more than what is just going on in the film itself. This film made me think about what it is that makes a person, just like it wasn't the fact that Godfrey lived in a literal dump in the beginning of the movie, as a forgotten man, that was important to his character. In the end, we find out that he in fact came from a wealthy family, yet acted in a manner that was completely different than Cornelia. It is this fact that makes you think about what makes a person a good person, not the money that they have or where they live, yet the content of their character. And, My Man Godfrey does a wonderful job at touching up on this while at the same time entertaining the audience and not making it seem as though we were watching a cheesy hour and a half PSA announcement.</fullReview>

This is one of the movies strongest parts is the story, it keeps you invested. Along with this are the cast of characters along the movie, some you like in dislike at parts but towards the end you feel attached to all of them in a way and care what happens to all of them. That is what makes a great movie if you have both of those things you are set and Godfrey does and it shows in the final product of a great comedy with laughs and heart. Overall, this is one of my favorites from this era and enjoyed it through and through, that is why it gets a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Depression opened up an Opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey film takes place during the great depression and takes you back to those times of how it effected people. It also gives you a broad overview of how different peoples lives were still back then. From the beginning of the movie it was a little sad being that the rich sought out the poor for their enjoyment of winning a trophy. Causing humiliation of others for enjoyment gave you a sense of how people were portrayed by others during this time.The humor of the film and how it was used within the film was absolutely brilliant. I enjoy the parts of the film where the humor was used to portray love, jealousy and betrayal. It kind of broke it up a little bit from the depression era of the film.Seeing the characters change within the film due to circumstances was a warming feeling. Knowing that the main character Godfrey was more than just a homeless man kept your interest because you really didn't know exactly who he was until later on in the film.The one part of the film that had me baffled was the disappearing of the necklace, I honestly thought it was the other sister that had it but in all it turned out to be Godfrey.All the main characters played a valuable role within the film and it was a delight to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey The film "My Man Godfrey" was hilarious. I found myself laughing throughout the whole movie. The casting was brilliant. The movie starts out with two upper class individuals Cornelia and Irene Bullock, who are competing against one another in a scavenger game. They are on the lookout for a "Forgotten Man" to be used as an item in their silly game. This is where they run into Godfrey Parks (Forgotten Man). Godfrey is whisked away to the hotel where the game is being played out; only to be offered a job working as the new butler for the Bullock Family.On the first day as a butler, Godfrey seems a little taken back, unsure of what to make of the Bullock family. Despite his hesitation, he continues his role as the Butler. You'll see throughout the movie, the little spats Godfrey has with Cornelia and how she tries to frame him for stealing a necklace. You'll learn that Irene falls in love with Godfrey and tries to express her feelings to him, but in return he show's no affection towards her. In the end the family learns a secret about Godfrey and you'll soon see if he actually gets the girl, or the girl gets the boy?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey was a verrry funny film. I loved the overall message of the movie, "prosperity is all around the corner." The script was very smartly written. The beginning of the movie when Godfrey was first meets Irene, it was suspected that maybe Godfrey wasn't a really a bum because of his grand vocabulary. I liked the part of the film when Irene's dad was struggling with his business and Godfrey offered his two cents, but was quickly shut down. Godfrey was considered to be just the butler. He was never respected as anything other than that. They even tried to accuse him of taking a pearl necklace from Cornelia, Irene's sister. That was until the end when Irene's dad's business went down the drain and Godfrey stepped up and gave him the stocks that he invested in on his behalf. The end of the film was just perfect. I loved that Irene followed Godfrey to his new home and surprised him with marriage! It was the perfect ending to a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a classic one i really liked it it is full of ambiances and well developed characters. They had the abilities to talk and act naturally it felt like they did not even use a script! The comedic timing is perfect and it was very funny. Especially when the woman carried a goat with her and kept on saying " I have a goat, i have a little baby goat" I thought that scene was hilarious. Another thing that caught my attention in this movie is how Women were being treated by men, somehow it felt like men back in 20th century had more respect for women than us nowadays. I do not remember the characters name but in a scene they show us how the guy cared about the lady when he ripped off the lady robe he tried to protect her. Men nowadays would just let her go and make fun of her. Overall this Movie is truly one of the funniest film of the 20th century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the most part, a very funny movie. Its principal joy is the ensemble playing of a first-rate bunch of character actors, led by Mr Powell and Ms Lombard. The latter is very clever, somehow channelling Alice Brady's bravura performance as her mother so that you can see the chip of the old block.The script is full of wise-cracks and put-downs delivered at the breakneck speed that characterised screwball comedies. The last reel loses a little energy as it moves towards its convenient conclusion, but otherwise it's a near-perfect example of the genre.To get matters off to a good start, there is a brilliant cameo from Franklin Pangbourn officiating at the scavenger hunt which sets the story in motion. And watch out for excellent work from Jean Dixon as the family maid and Mischa Auer as the family parasite</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Man Godfrey (1936)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a robust film with its witty dialogue and excellently-produced characters who play off each other in an engaging social commentary ever present in 1930s comedy.Godfrey is living as a 'forgotten man' in the City Dump when he enters Cornelia and Irene, young rich sisters participating in a scavenger hunt attempting to gain a 'forgotten man'. Disgusted by Cornelia's snobbishness yet intrigued by Irene's youthful zest who is an exception amongst her class, she and Godfrey start a relationship filled with comedy and realism when he accepts a position as her families' butler. Their relationship mostly consisted of comedical exchanges as Irene desperately tried to make Godfrey fall for her with whimsical results. They became a comic duo with Godfrey being the witty introvert with his smart comments whilst Irene was very extroverted with her eccentric behaviour and delightful charm. It results in hilarious moments between them emphasising My Man Godfrey's perfection in its comic characterisation. Yet their relationship does come at a price. Irene hiring Godfrey as the family butler puts him at odds with Cornelia, who treats Godfrey with contempt. Their conflict is filled with venomous exchanges underlining My Man Godfrey's social commentary. Cornelia as a rich snob is self-adsorbed in her wealthy world thinking she's too good for Godfrey, a 'forgotten man' whose has fought for a living.The conflict between Cornelia and Godfrey was the pinnacle towards My Man Godfrey's rich/poor theme. Godfrey having previously lived in rough conditions had an understanding of social problems regarding distribution of wealth. It was a prominent problem in 1930s America which My Man Godfrey treated with poignancy. As a result Cornelia &amp; Irene's family where targets for humor. Mrs Bollock getting drunk and seeing pixies and Cornelia wrecking property was meant to be laughed at whilst mocking their idiocy as affects of their excessive living. Even Mr Bollock realised the ridiculousness of his family emphasising Godfrey's "empty-headed nitwits" comment. The perfectly balanced mixture of comedy and social commentary justifies the claim of My Man Godfrey as a robust film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What makes a screwball comedy a legend most?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world of screwball comedy exploded in 1936 with such memorable entries as "Libeled Lady", "Theodora Goes Wild" and "My Man Godfrey", having been launched several years before with such classics as "Twentieth Century", "It Happened One Night" and "The Thin Man". Certain stars became synonymous with screwball comedy, and two of the most popular were William Powell and Carole Lombard. Once married, these two geniuses remained close friends, and so when the opportunity came for them to work together again in "My Man Godfrey", they jumped at the chance. Even if they had hated each other, looking at the script might have changed their mind in turning it down.When snooty socialite Gail Patrick tries to get "forgotten man" William Powell to come back to a Park Avenue shindig with her to help her win first prize, he retaliates by pushing her in an ash pile. Witness Carole Lombard (Patrick's daffy sister) convinces Powell to help her win, and before you know it, Powell has been hired as the eccentric family's new butler. He has no idea of what he's gotten himself into, between mother Alice Brady's vision of "pixies" ("Don't step on the little things", she insists), father Eugene Palette's constant grumbling over increasing expenses and dwindling profits, Patrick's temper tantrums and Lombard's extreme attempts to win Powell's affection. Then, there's Brady's "protegee", Mischa Auer, a stupid man with little human value whose one talent is imitating a gorilla, the wise-cracking maid (Jean Dixon) and a visiting millionaire (Alan Mowbray) who knows certain truths about Powell which threatens to blow his real identity out of the Fifth Avenue mansion.Excellent from start to finish, "My Man Godfrey" is sure to be on everybody's top five list of the best screwball comedies ever made and in the top 25 of the funniest films ever made. The New York social scene of the 1930's is shown as ridiculous and spoiled, with the scavenger hunt one of the funniest crowd scenes in films. Franklin Pangborn is outrageous as the frazzled host, perplexed one minute then delighted another with the odd objects these silly and basically worthless wealthy people bring in. There's a lesson to be told here, that money doesn't buy happiness (or even rent it for that matter), that spoiled people won't always get what they want, and that lazy hangers-on will get the heave-ho when it's time to go. Everybody here has a chance to shine in a screenplay that is a gem from start to finish. Lombard is one of the few 1930's actresses who seems totally modern, as if she was Drew Barrymore transplanted back in time to stand out among the typical 30's Hollywood glamour. No matter how silly or serious the characters she played, she is someone that few people could find any reason to dislike. Powell went from villain to romantic leading man to comic gem, and in a few moments here, he truly can break your heart. Alice Brady plays a character truly blinded by her dimwiteddness, someone who truly thinks she's smart but is obviously fooling herself. Palette has a memorable explosion at his no-good family, while Patrick particularly stands out in a scene where she suddenly wakes up and sees the truth. This is the type of film that makes you long for those good old days of Hollywood glamour where intelligent writing, strong direction, lavish production values and brilliant acting all come together in one neat package. There is a reason why some films stand the test of time more than others, and "My Man Godfrey" is a prime example of one of those films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey has significances that are prevalent in both film and real life. Godfrey is a depression era homeless man hired by a socialites daughter to be the new family butler. Godfrey is a good worker who is praised by the head of the family, that being the father. Of the two daughters the younger, ditzy childish, one who hires Godfrey falls in love with him. The older daughter, suspicious and unwelcoming, dislikes Godfrey and even plots to have him arrested. Although the family is led to believe Godfrey is a bottom-class nobody who luckily become there butler they are proved wrong. It turns out Godfrey hails from a very wealthy family in Boston, he was trying to prove himself as a worthy individual rather than a brat from a rich family after he was betrayed by love. The significance here is that we never really know who someone is even if we think we do. People hold dear to them secrets about their past and they often do not come out until we have known them for sometime. What Godfrey appeared to be was in fact the exact opposite of what he really was. Furthermore, the family also is not what they appear to be. In the end the father is informed that because of excessive spending by his family they are now broke. Godfrey then reveals he invested the money he was paid wisely and is going to save the family from bankruptcy. In addition he also develops the dump he once lived in into a high-saluting restaurant/hang out for the high class. In further generosity he assures all his once homeless friends now have jobs. The significance here is that using your good fortune to help others, instead of only yourself, will truly make you feel wealthy and fulfilled. Instead of just being a rich heir in boston Godfrey sets out to make a name for himself and is not only able to do so but also help others in the process. In the conclusion we see Godfrey has found true bliss and happiness as he sits in his office and the women he loves comes to marry him. Essentially, this illustrates that good things happen to good people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was excited when I heard we would be seeing this movie in my film class a couple of months ago because it was one of the first comedies we had seen in the class so far. I am a big fan of comedies and dramas more than any other type of movie. And I liked it. I thought that Godfrey was a great character, who carried a lot of wit and morality with him, and that he was, in general, a very cool character. My only criticism was that it did not have as much humor as I had expected, but, I still got a few good laughs out of it. My favorite being when Irene was asked what she had wanted to eat, and, feeling very down, promptly dramatically replied, "What is food?" I know that I can be pretty dramatic at times, but, I don't know if I have ever been as dramatic as Irene in that scene. Either way, I did enjoy the movie in the end, and wouldn't mind watching it again, even if only to admire Godfrey's character himself.</fullReview>

The film is funny which is important for a comedy.Irene's family is also wacky and eccentric which adds to the humor of the film. The film is highly enjoyable, and the plot line is clear and pretty straightforward. What makes it interesting is watching the interactions between the characters. Later on a love triangle develops between the characters, which adds to the humor. Overall, My Man Godfrey (1936) is a solid 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahhh!! This is another great movie by William Powell and cast. Unlike the "Thin Man" series of movies where Powell is married to a rich wife and solves crimes, in this one he is a derelict living at the city dump. He actually comes from an upper class Boston family but has hit the skids. Hired by a very flighty rich girl as a butler while she is on a scavenger hunt. He appears the next day all cleaned up and dressed in a rental tux. Her sister is almost instantly hostile to him because he tells it like it is. I mean how much of a threat is it to return a derelict to where he came from? He has already hit bottom. As the movie progresses the father goes from a rich man to a bankrupt one but Godfrey has used a pearl necklace that the evil sister had placed in his room in an attempt to get him fired to do some investing and such. He not only gives the father back all the stock he had sold but the necklace too. He even has enough left over to open a night club fittingly enough called "The Dump". It is even built on top of the dump where all the employees come from. As the film winds down he is kind of forced to marry the sister who first found him. She just comes into the club, grabs a judge and they get married.</fullReview>

Irene's obsession with Godfrey had you hooked because, the whole time you're wondering if they're going to be together or not. The film was made during the time of the Great Depression, where there was a lot of people who became homeless and jobless. Godfrey was a homeless man but he was educated and witty, most people who were naive didn't think that homeless people could posses these quality. During the end of the film, you see how the luck of Godfrey,and Irene's family change.

		<fullReview>Before My Man Godfrey, I hardly even knew what a screwball comedy was, what it does, or if they're even enjoyable. What My Man Godfrey did, was educate me. It taught me exactly what a perfect screwball comedy is, and more importantly, that screwball comedies are FANTASTIC. My Man Godfrey is everything to make a superb screwball film. It has over-the-top everything and satire/comedy at its core. The character personalities are drastically different from each other and still well developed. The rich Bullocks, always at the peak of insanity with William Powell as Godfrey, the lovable "hobo" turned butler down on his luck, to bring them all together. The dialog is perfect, almost every line is a joke in some form, but at the same time it isn't overbearing. It isn't shoved down your throat like any of the Scary Movies or anything coming out of comedy central these days, it's natural comedy, not forced. There isn't a single aspect of this film that seems out of place, ironic, considering it's the epitome of chaotic and abnormal behavior. Everything in My Man Godfrey is well assembled and clean. Good shots, great actors, and superb dialog all work together to make My Man Godfrey simply phenomenal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Man Godfrey (1936)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic film. Simply put, "My Man Godfrey" (1936) is a great screwball comedy. Filled with a great cast and tons of laughter, "My Man Godfrey" is a must see movie. A mix of comedy and history, "My Man Godfrey" explored life after the Depression and how it both affected and did not affect certain people. William Powell as Godfrey was simply amazing. Despite being such an early movie, the acting was incredible. The plot, as well, was very well done. It was very entertaining and always kept you on the edge of your seat in either laughter, excitement, or both. A thoroughly enjoyable film, "My Man Godfrey is a timeless classic that rivals even some of the best films today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Classical Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the content of this film was good. It was played out very well by all of the actors. I also thought each actor really committed to and became their characters. It is clear that a great deal of time and effort was put in during the casting of the film. The movie was very engaging and the level of invisibility was phenomenal and I really felt I could have been Godfrey.The director, George La Cava, really made all the scenes come to life. By not directing it through Godfrey's point of view alone, I felt as though I became part of the movie. What I mean by this is I could almost see my self sitting in their living room watching the events of an evening unfold or with the people in the dump watching these rich girls run down a pile of garbage completely oblivious to the suffering around them.Overall I thought it was excellent and I remain stuck on the fact that if as much care went into casting any film now a days as was put into this film it would be very refreshing and cinema would really take its next step forward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi my name is Nick Altomare. Recently I watched My Man Godfrey in my history of American cinema class. I liked this movie a lot. I enjoyed this movie because of the different views it depicts in the life of people who live in the city in this time period. I feel that the production and quality of this movie is very high and elaborate. Also it was a very dynamic movie and incorporated lots of funny and interesting scenes. The family who brings in Godfrey shows how money can't solve everything because of their dysfunctional lifestyle. Godfrey is a great film and displays elements of cinematography. I think this mixture of high comedy and social status produces a great screwball comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This witty screwball comedy will serve you plenty of puns, laughter, and downright honesty in My Man Godfrey. While the story plays off lots of jokes made for the era, the lust and comedic enjoyment seem to stay consistent even in this modern era. This is not some film you can simply pass up because of the time it was made. If this film were to come out in today's society as a brand new movie I think it would have just as much success (if not more) than when it originally came out. The characters are marvelous and all exhibit vital traits to help fuel the comedy and guide the plot in directions that you honestly will not see coming. The unpredictability of the plot is one of the most interesting things I've seen, in most early films It is apparent what will happen next. This is one of the first early films that does NOT do this. Instead they fill you in with overriding plots, secrets being made, and good old family feuds. The character Godfrey is a marvelous one, His round traits help guide the story in an exciting and optimistic way through the entire story. Never once do you doubt Godfrey or his abilities of a man as we learn more about his history, and his future. Most definitely a film to see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my favorite movie that we have watched in my History of American Cinema class so far. Everything about this movie was excellent. The addition of the Great Depression and how it affected people and how it also didn't affect everyone was a perfect touch in this film. The acting was superb. Godfrey was played very well as the butler and as also as the poor man living down by the river. My favorite character was probably the father who was played very well. The whole story was fantastic and was considered at screw ball comedy. It was every bit of a comedy with many funny parts. But also if you look past that like I said it embraces both sides of the depression in the 1930's very well. I would recommend this movie to everyone not just for the comical relief but also the historical context as well. Well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time for a screwball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you didn't know this is a screwball comedy it is just look at the year this film was created. Just because it has screwball in the genre of comedy it is doesn't mean it is bad. In fact I found this movie much funnier than most comedies today. After watching this screwball comedy I started to search through all the other screwball comedies made at the time just because of this one.This film holds many good qualities of a comedy. The story itself starts out with a woman taking a poor man off the street and making him a butler after some other events leading to that. She herself though falls in love with the man she barely knows and yet he rejects her she isn't giving up easy. Even though he told her of his position as a butler and that he had no interest in a relationship with her she still keeps him close by. In some ways she will put in a quick kiss that really is like less than a second. That is one thing that sticks out in this movie is that there was no high emotions of love towards the two characters.The camera work and lighting during the film are as a good as the story. The bulk of the film is in a huge house that the family lives in and where the butler works. The house is large and needs a lot of light but is kept well lit through the whole film. Even showing the life on the streets has so much detail to make you believe you did fall right in the dump. With such good acting as a gentleman from William Powell keeps the entire atmosphere of the film in a positive out look of life. As he first was poor is now working and getting income as a butler, this makes you cheer for the poor man to continue his dream as being successful.All and all this was just a great movie that made me watching closely until the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey (1936) by Gregory La Cava, is a charming screwball comedy. The film is full of so my brilliant jokes, it is hard to catch some of them. It is astonishing how the comedy of the time carries over into the modern world. The film was made during the great depression and reflects the time. Many of the themes carry the same comedic weight as films of today. Some of the best jokes come when Irene Bullock falls madly in love with Godfrey, the lines she delivers in this state are hilarious. The camera techniques are as fluid as any modern film. The characters move through multiple rooms. This is executed flawlessly with no sketchy cuts and all the actors hit their mark.</fullReview>

The story is a rich young woman takes in a homeless man and offers him employment as repayment for him helping her best her sister at a party game. What develops is a wonderful friendship (and some unrequited feelings) that really make the story shine. I real testament to the ability for a film to withstand the test of time as the humor was spitfire and still relevant.

		<fullReview>This movie, is a personal favorite of mine now. With charming and witty humor, fused with a moral lesson, and top notch acting, it certainly is a movie that deserves the title "timeless classic". The entire story of the movie is historically relevant to the socioeconomic time period in which the movie both takes place and was released. It addressed the issue of the impact of the Great Depression on middle class working Americans and brought the issue front and center to the cinemas where mass amounts of people could become more aware of what was happening to the country at the time. Some of the humor that is used in the movie is subtle, because it is a witty humor, that one would have to think about for a while to understand, much unlike today's humor which is very blatant and in your face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a really funny screwball comedy film, not only for the public, but also for me. I found a lot of things funny with this film, like the part where Godfrey puts Irene in the shower and turns it on after she fainted. What I also like about this movie is that Irene can be very funny at times. During that shower scene, after she got sprayed on, she called to her mother, "He loves me!" It was so funny that I laughed so hard from the moment she said it. Overall, this film is really nice with a lot of memorable characters, fantastic writing, and a very funny setup. It really shines as one of the best comedy films out there. I figure that it's one of the best films that I have ever seen!</fullReview>

The quick and witty humor that was throughout the film captured my attention and didn't let it go until the credits rolled. The cinematography in this film was also very wonderful. The composition of every scene was set up in a beautiful way, and although it was black and white, you could still see many different tones. I think that this film is a perfect example of one that is better in black and white. If it were to be in color, than you would lose the feeling you get while you watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the first screwball comedy I have seen, and was such a delight. I never thought I would enjoy an old film like this, and if I was watching TV I would naturally just skip over it. However after seeing My Man Godfrey I have a new awareness for films like this. I would compare this film to todays current romantic comedy, and I'm a sucker for a good rom-com, which is probably why I liked this so much, screwball comedy's were the original rom-coms! My Man Godfrey surrounds a zany family and their new butler, Godfrey. It's a film full of laughs with out being crude, unlike a lot of comedies today. It made its audience laugh through its characters interactions with each others, like Irene's undeniable love for Godfrey. She did anything to catch his attention to getting engaged to fainting in his arms (all an act of course). Not only was this a funny film but also delivered a good message, addressing the social classes during the great depression, a story that brought hope and self worth to its audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performances in a Screwball Comedy with Serious Subtext</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first movie ever to win 4 Oscar nominations for all 4 acting categories (even though not actually winning any of the Oscars), and the actors' performances are, indeed, the strongest part in _My Man Godfrey_. I for one admired Eugene Palette most -- if anyone can be obese and virile at the same time, he certainly could. Especially, Eugene Palette's character perfectly illustrates the typology of the movie that _My Man Godfrey_ is: on the surface, it's a ridiculous romp; but underneath that, there is seriousness, and a struggle with real-life problems. Despite nearly everyone in _My Man Godfrey_ behaving like lunatics, the movie is surprisingly realistic in depicting the mood and milieu of the 1930s Great Depression in the US. Mischa Auer was very good as a Russian immigrant, but to me, not quite as impressive as Palette (who ends up not only figuratively but literally "bouncing Auer off the stage"). Also, in a thoroughly ridiculous (and therefore very difficult to play) role as Palette's wife, Alice Brady gives a fantastic performance. Her voice acrobatics, the brilliance of her silly laughs, cannot be praised enough; and she indeed looks great for a lady in her 40s; yet in the midst of all that hysteria, she was always able to insert a pause so she could voice her dismay, doubts, fears, pleasure, etc. And *that* makes her character a real human being -- despite all the ridiculousness. In this, she reminded me of the Czech actress Iva Jan?urová, who has likewise made a career out of her hysterical, silly laughs, combined with smartness. The two leads, William Powell and Carole Lombard, also give superb performances, especially Powell. It's a genuine accomplishment to come across as always suave and elegant in the midst of all the tomfoolery of a screwball comedy; yet this seems effortless for Powell. His delivery of the lines of dialogues seems spot-on every time; he was a true master of his voice as a crucial actor's instrument. The screenplay and dialogues in _My Man Godfrey_ are super-smart and witty, and coming fast at you (especially in Lombard's famous rapid-fire delivery); you'll be able to rewind and replay certain scenes a number of times, without getting bored. Also, the psychology of the characters, no matter how far-fetched at first superficial glance, manages to be convincing in the end; an unforgettable scene has Lombard deduce Powell's "love" for her by arguing that if he hadn't loved her, he wouldn't have bothered to put her under a cold shower! All in all, an excellent, smart, non-shallow comedy, though hardly a pinnacle in the art of cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great changes come from the most unlikely sources</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Screwball comedies focus on the comedy inherent in all relationships and I'm one of the many who count My Man Godfrey as a quintessential example of its kind. I do believe that the 1936 film is one of the most cleverly made comedies I've seen in a long time. It all starts off with a well put together opening sequence showing a glamorous look on New York City with cast titles lit up in the way many people picture it, but then surprisingly transits to a miserable slum section of the town, showing the underside of city life during the Great Depression. Afterwards we are introduced to Godfrey of City Dump #32, East River, Sutton Place, who finds himself confronted by a group of the wealthy upper class snobs on a scavenger hunt for a "Forgotten Man". After some coaxing from one of their number Irene, Godfrey agrees to play along, and wins her the prize. Wanting to repay the favor, Irene offers Godfrey work, and he becomes the Bullock family's new butler. He soon finds out that the job is not what its cracked up to be. Godfrey may be one of the best characters portrayed in cinema. He's intelligent and headstrong; comes off as bitter at times but in truth has a heart of gold. He is unafraid to express his honesty and upholds his unique nature. When he's asked to be the "Forgotten Man", it gives viewers a glimpse of how poorly the lower class folk were treated by the upper class. The movie goes out of its way to make a mockery of the wealthy, portraying them as having a ridiculously exaggerated sense of fashion, a desire to impress everyone with their money, and completely spoiled, thanks to a life without risk or struggle. I would wholeheartedly agree with one of the backdrop characters who calls a gathering of the rich at the Ritz Hotel "akin to a insane asylum". Godfrey couldn't be more accurate in calling them all "nitwits". For him experience was the best education. It quickly becomes apparent to Godfrey why the Bullock family has had difficulty keeping a butler, given the family's constant disputes with each other and their ridiculous interactions. The priceless expressions on Godfrey's face tell us "What have I gotten myself into?" and I can't say I blame him. Godfrey also experiences the worst luck with women. Irene becomes infatuated with him as her "protégé" but Godfrey denies her, believing it to be for everyone's best interests. Meanwhile her scheming sister Cornelia plots Godfrey's downfall, but ultimately Godfrey uses her tactics against her. His decency never falters. In spite the family's mistreatment, Godfrey saves them from financial collapse and makes the errors of their ways clear. Godfrey also transforms the City Dump where he came from into a nightclub, providing nourishment, shelter, and employment for the once "forgotten men". In the time of struggle and desperation that was the Great Depression, people deserved to be given a hopeful outlook on their lives, and a positive role model to look to. Godfrey had a great impact on the Bullock family and in the end even he gained something from the "nitwit" wealthy folks, including patience, amusement, and humility. Us viewers are left with the possibility that by finding the best in one another, no matter how different we may be, we can make the future brighter together.</fullReview>

A screwball comedy- and done of my very favorites at that- that focuses on a wealthy family who takes in a homeless man to be their butler. The mother and her two daughters are out of control with the dramatics: one daughter always the superior, Angelica, and the other, Cornelia, a ditsy drama queen who is head over heels in love with Godfrey. The entire family except for Cornelia feels that they are superior to Godfrey, until the family goes bankrupt and they find out that Godfrey is actually a very educated man who may even know more about the aristocratic life than they do. Godfrey is a sweet man with a a good heart and they whole family could benefit to learn a thing or two from him.</fullReview>

Makes you wonder what had happened to comedy today. "Only difference between a derelict and a man is a job", really shows you the obstacles during the Great Depression. The significance throughout the whole film is how closely different people could come together, like Godfrey and his employers. This film keeps you interested because if the story and the actors that make it come alive with their impeccable acting towards each other. It's crazy how one family can catch your attention with their comical behaviors in life. Overall well made movie and one to watch.</fullReview>

Godfrey's almost snobbish intelligence, Irene's air-headed and naive insanity, Angelica's cruelty, Cornelia's foolish demanding desires, and Alexander's poor attempts to reign the whole team in. Each brings together an essential piece of the film. The whole film just goes over the top in a way that just constantly throws well... a screwball at you. Yet behind the crazy antics is a social message and a back story that brings a sharp reality to an insanely fantasized film and shows a depth that one would not expect from such a film.</fullReview>

The acting is perfect and the message is powerful enough to be effective, yet still possess a great deal of humor. The humor is a wonderful refresher to the stereotypical humor found in many of today's comedies and could still be appreciated by many people today. One of my favorite elements of the movie is how despite Godfrey's clear refusals, Irene Bullock continues to pursue him. The movie itself takes many stabs at the lavish and excessive rich who sit around and blow their money, while the poor and hungry are ignored. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys some good natured comedy that feels fresh and different.</fullReview>

The quirky family was flawless and they complemented each other beautifully. Godfrey was handsome and intelligent but humble in a wonderful way. I found myself falling in love with every single cast member. Cornelia played the spoiled white-collar brat seamlessly and Irene was believably nutty. I honestly feel like movies just aren't made this well anymore. I did not see the twist coming and it made it that much more enjoyable. The idea of a man taken off the street and treated like an imbecile by people that were (or so they thought) much more well off than him and then him saving them financially when they start to face trouble with their money is just fantastic. Everyone can enjoy that. My favorite quote from the film was when Godfrey said that from his experiment he had learned that "the only thing that separates a derelict from a gentleman is a job".</fullReview>

William Powell plays Godfrey' a man with nothing, a man who has been forgotten by society and lives on the very fringes of it. Carole Lombard is Irene, the socialite daughter of the wealthy Bullock family, an enigmatic girl. The chemistry between the two becomes fairly evident early on. Godfrey's seriousness plays counter to Irene's playfulness and impishness. The movie has great scenes involving multiple long takes up and down grand staircases.

I thought the actor that played Godfrey shouldv've won an Emmy!! I didn;t find too many things that i didn't like about the movie. There was a great plot leading up to a creative and well thought out ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOVED this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my first screwball comedy and I absolutely loved every part of it. Pairing the talent of William Powell and Carole Lombard was a brilliant decision. You could tell the two were feeding off each others energy and the chemistry between the two was present throughout the film. The actors in this film offered an endless amount of personality and humor. Whether is was Cornelia's vindictive behavior, Angelica's looniness, or just Carlo and his hilarious one-liners, I was always highly entertained. It really helped put into perspective how certain social classes view one another. The story kept me on my feet. Although it may have been only made for entertainment, the story was very interesting. At the beginning, I was expecting this film to be a typical 'rich girl falls for poor guy/butler, the fall in love...', but it ended up being so much more. We really got to see the subtle relationship develop between the two. The plot twist at the end really threw me for a whirl though, I was not expecting Godfrey to be saving up and having all this happening all while he was working for the Bullocks. I thought that turn in events was really fantastic and I almost felt a bit of joy for Godfrey giving back to the place where he once was.I really, really enjoyed this film and I can not wait to watch more screwball comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Man Godfrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was positively stunning. The acting was very well done, and kept me laughing the entire time. Carole Lombard was absolutely hilarious in "My Man Godfrey" with her constant banter and mood swings. This film really dove into the lives of wealthy people and how the rest of society viewed them, as "ditzy"and concerned with themselves. Irene really did not care about social class though, she was in love with Godfrey regardless of his social standing, and that really says something. The plot of this movie was paced smoothly and the dialogue ran smoothly as well. The main theme of this movie seems to be that anyone can fall in love, no matter what their social class is. This movie was truly phenomenal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powell &amp; Lombard - great team in this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'My Man Godfrey' is a screwball comedy film (1936) directed by Gregory La Cava. The movie is set during the great depression with the opening scene in a trash dump under the Brooklyn Bridge. A group of homeless men our scouring the rubbish for food. Among this group is Godfrey (William Powell), a rather cerebral and philosophical bum. Two socialite sisters interrupt Godfrey's quest with an offer to be the prized object of a scavenger hunt ? a 'forgotten' man. It is here that the younger sister, Irene Bullock (Carole Lombard), convinces Godfrey to join her at the scavenger hunt party. By the end of the party, Godfrey is offered the position of butler in the Bullock household. Now the laughter begins as one observes the role reversal of the rich-poor dichotomy in this film.Powell and Lombard is a perfect pairing. Powell delivers his lines sardonically within the story, observing the petty squabbling and snobbery constantly exhibited by the Bullock family. Lombard is the na?ve young woman whose sincerity begins to charm Godfrey. While in real life their divorce was years past, Powell and Lombard work well together in their dialog and interaction, making the movie delightful and entertaining to watch. The movie does challenge our stereotyping of the socio-economic caste, but the audience is in for an amusing surprise. Is Godfrey really a forgotten man? 'My Man Godfrey' received six academy award nominations, including the top acting awards. With a runtime of 94 minutes, the action and dialogue is fast paced, presenting a memorable classic comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has so much meaning in a way and it kind of reminds me of what i'm going through in life. some people are born rich and don't know how to control themselves with money and the ones that are brought up poor and striving to make a living have more common sense and also a different perspective on life. this movie teaches to be kind to one other no matter what economic background and also to be humble and that what goes around comes around. plus in the terms of love and fate usually sometimes what you're looking can be right in front of you. i love the character Godfrey. he's kind of like my hero. he has a certain "swag" to him and he's most nicest man you would probably ever meet in life. i got swapped away by him. and the girl Irene. she never gave up on him because she knew he was for her. hopefully my Godfrey will come around someday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first screwball comedy?I loved it, bring 'em on!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admittedly did not know what to expect when the topic for the week in my cinema class was "screwball comedies," but if they are generally similar to "My Man Godfrey" I want to see many more! I was laughing through the whole thing, whether it was the outrageousness of the elite and their scavenger hunt, Irene's jumping around like a child, or Godfrey's subtle expressions, I cracked up at least once every five minutes. Thinking of the ostentatiousness presented in the film it might seem like it would have alienated those struggling through the Great Depression, but "My Man Godfrey" does just the opposite. It also shows "good men, fighting along and not complaining," Godfrey's friends from the city dump. Moments with these characters are light- hearted and sweet, though I usually find it depressing to watch those struggling in life. This really minimized the differences between the classes, even making caricatures out of the upper class to show they're not all it may have been cracked up to be, so it makes sense that it was a big hit and still remains a favorite to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screwball doesn't even begin to cover it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was definitely a screwball comedy, the characters were hysterical but yet the plot had an overall meaning and a moral to the story which made it a great film to watch. It almost seemed as if it were making fun of the rich depicting the family as dramatic and dim witted but the movie also showed a class struggle and the morals to overcome it. Godfrey was just a poor man living in a dump and would not even catch a second glance from a wealthier person because it was "beneath them" to talk to him, that's why after Irene brought Godfrey to the scavenger hunt her mother insisted that she send him away as if he were some mongrel not worth anyone's time. However Irene demonstrated kindness and politeness towards Godfrey by giving him a job as their family butler which depicts the overall moral of the story that everyone, no matter who they are or where they come from, deserves the same amount of respect as any higher class citizen in society. Once hired Godfrey went through hell and back with the families crazy antics but he still demonstrated respect towards the family and gratefulness for giving him a temporary home and a job, he pays back his respects by giving the father of the family his stock back so they would not go bankrupt and have to live on the streets themselves. This demonstrates the same basic respects that everyone should owe to everyone. Godfrey even shows his respects towards the other gentlemen living in the dump by helping them towards the end, which I will not give away. Overall this movie demonstrated a form of comedy which was very enjoyable and made me laugh throughout the whole thing but also showed a main point or moral to the story. Another thing that I found interesting regarding the camera work was that while Godfrey was walking up the steps to give everyone their morning breakfast the camera slowly moved up with him to show a smooth transition to the next scene rather than simply cutting out then cutting back in. There were also quite a few moments where it faded out and faded back in which made it feel like time had elapsed and that we fast forwarded into the future a little bit, perhaps the next day or a few days later. Overall this was a great movie that I enjoyed and would not hesitate to watch again, I'd actually like to watch more screwball comedies like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was full of dry humor. It was part of the screwball comedy genre of movies from the 1930s. This film had an interesting plot. You could tell there was something sketchy and off about the new butler that was hired, but you weren't exactly sure what. I found all the characters except Godfrey to be quite annoying and hard to watch. The older sister was rude and had her nose in the air. The mother was a drunk and also tended to have her nose in the air. The younger daughter, who falls for Godfrey, comes off as very ditzy and just looking for attention. And I felt that the father just let his family run wild and crazy. Although, I think this is the way the director wanted the characters to come off as, therefore I think the acting was a job well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for My Man Godfrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing a brief summary of My Man Godfrey I thought oh here we go another typical love story where the girl falls for the wrong guy and they obviously end up together in the end. Even though that is the gist of the story, there is so much more to it. The characters were anything but typical; they were crazy, hilarious, and incredibly ignorant, which is what makes this considered to be a "screw ball comedy". Even though the behavior of the characters was outrageous the film had a great sense of verisimilitude by having Godfrey balance everything out. As he transforms from "unwanted man" to butler to a person with secretly wealthy family and finally to an independent and successful business man it portrays the idea of how many different shades people can be, and we should not "judge a book by its cover". Gregory La Cava supports this idea by illustrating a popular stereotype about people with wealth by casting the family with personality traits such as arrogant, selfish, and flat out stupid. Some people disagreed with how the women were portrayed in this movie, but I completely disagree and believe it is one of the strong points of the movie and better help La Cava get his point a crossed to the audience. This is the first movie that I have truly appreciated in class and can honestly say I followed from beginning to end and enjoyed every moment of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but perhaps a tad overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps it's that we're too far away from the Great Depression, but I don't quite get it. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the film. I did. I enjoy any film with William Powell...I've never figured out exactly what it is about Powell that fascinates me...but I love him here just as I love him in any film. And, this is a rare film in which I liked Carole Lombard. But somehow, there's just something missing, although I often find that's true with scripts from this era. Like the writers didn't quite pull everything together...almost, just not quite.The story's an interesting one. Some rich society girls discover hobos, one of the girls (Lombard) takes one (Powell) under her wing, making her the family butler. It's a nutty family, with a great performance by the father (gravelly voiced Eugene Palette in what may be his best role). The other sister is well played by Gail Patrick, who often played the other woman, but here played a slightly devious sibling that isn't totally unlikable. In the end, Lombard gets Powell, although the ending seems just a bit hurried...I would have liked to savor it a bit longer.It's a very good screwball comedy, but I don't rate it quite as highly as many of the other reviewers here. But very watchable, and a sure shot to end up on many DVD shelves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Professionalism Prevails in My Man Godfrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey serves three purposes: to alert audiences to the conditions of the homeless during the Great Depression, to demonstrate the often undeserved, elite status of the upper class, and to be completely hilarious. The chemistry between leading actors William Powell and Carole Lombard is clear, and the fact that they were somewhat recently divorced during the making of this film says a lot about the pair's character. The dialogue in My Man Godfrey is easily my favorite component of the film. It contains the quick witted conversation, off-handed remarks, and general storyline associated with all of the Screwball Comedy genre. Unlike some of the film's peers, My Man Godfrey succeeds in making a point, however cliché that point has become: Don't judge a book by its' cover, and certainly don't consider yourself superior to someone you barely know. While William Powell's performance in the movie is fantastic, I cannot overlook that of the other actors. Each characters acting (and frequent overacting) adds to the piece's emotion and hilarity. My Man Godfrey is a must-see for anyone who enjoys laughing, and a maybe-see for anyone who doesn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loud and Hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This screwball comedy is one of the funniest movies of it's time. WIth Godfrey starting out as just a regular old hobo and then being transformed into a butler by a rich woman named Irene Bullock, we begin to wonder what Godfrey is really made of. Halfway through the movie we find out he actually belongs to a rich family from Boston and was burned by love. This twist in the scenario sets up for a number of more surprises. The Bullock family household is a bunch of lunatics under one roof and causes for loud obnoxious pranks and hysteria. This movie is more than what meets the eye. It is just one hilarious ironic package. In the end, Irene again transforms Godfrey into, ironically, her husband which is yet another surprise in this screwball. Godfrey pulls the Bullocks out of a financial hardship during the Great Depression, which is ideal for it's time of production. The only weakness that I had discovered is that it is, at times, a bit annoying and ear piercing (Mrs. Bullock). Other than that this film is a must see and is guaranteed to have you both laughing and wondering!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Focus on Eugene Palette: his greatest performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are almost 200 reviews of this movie, so I will take a different tack then usual; I wish to focus on the performance of Eugene Palette. If you don't know his name, you know his face, his body, and his voice: he is that ubiquitous character actor with the body, neck and head of a bull, and the voice of a bullfrog with a sore throat. And here, in My Man Godfrey, he plays the long suffering Alexander Bullock, husband of Angelica (played by Alice Brady), possibly the most demented and wackiest wife in the history of movies, and father of Irene and Cornelia, two of the most difficult children ever presented in a comedy.In short, this may be Eugene Palette's finest performance. He is actually sympathetic as the distraught businessman slowly going broke. He treats William Powell's butler with respect (the only family member to do so), even if he never quite understands how Powell got there, and we cheer him on as he mocks, criticizes, and finally disposes of the family leach Carlo.But the absolute highlight is the next to final scene in which Palette believes that his business, despite all his efforts, has gone broke, and he is headed for ruin, and possibly jail. At this key moment, the butler Godfrey (Powell) steps in, and kindly lets Palette know that he has worked behind the scenes not only to save Palette's stock, but has signed all that stock back to Palette. As the realization hits Palette that Godfrey has done this for him, expecting absolutely nothing in return - well, the moment is a beautiful one. Palette's humility is reflected magnificently in his face and gestures. It is an absolutely lovely scene, one that I can watch over and over again.As I said, Palette's finest moment on film.This movie is great. The dialogue is fast and funny, and William Powell may have, in his role as Godfrey, played the most sophisticated man ever to appear on film. This film is an absolute must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautifully done, from a wonderfully creative opening credit sequence, to a strong social message, this film is as successful as its main character. The crazy and eccentric Bullock family adds wonderful color and range to the film, while also creating hilarity at every turn. Godfrey is immediately brought into the mind of the viewer as a noble and educated individual, while his opposite, Irene, is shown to be an immature and simple character. The two form a wonderfully odd couple, the likes of which I didn't want to see together but couldn't help rooting for. The social message in the film is hard hitting. One of charity and morality for those hit hard by the depression , is beautifully explained in the film by Godfrey himself, who is the linchpin for all the good in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely and sparkling social satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this on some bargain-bucket DVD; and beneath the veneer of "1930s screwball comedy" - mixed feelings about those kinds of films ? was a lovely and charming film. I'm pretty sure "Down and Out in Beverly Hills" owes a lot to this film, in addition to the French play ("Boudu sauvé des eaux") it more obviously imitates. It's so interesting a premise: Godfrey is a "forgotten man", a down and out victim during the Depression. But he 'forgot' himself, as it were: we later find out that he's intelligent, from a "good" (i.e. both rich and old) family, but before that, the film opens with Godfrey, living in highly dignified squalor on and off the New York City dump. His 'rescue' is effected by the comically idle and frivolous Bullock family, and he becomes the family butler. With his very eloquent eyes, trim moustache, mellifluous voice and urbane delivery, he negotiates a family with more than its share of flaws, the object of spiteful retribution and adoring love respectively from its two daughters. From his unusual position, he treads the space between the very poorest and the very richest, spreading wisdom, elegance, grace and understanding as he goes. He even finds a way to give something back to the place that nurtured him. It's funny, satirical, bitter and sweet in turn, lovely to watch. (It's always lovely to watch the homes and outfits of the rich.)I'd have to say I found Carole Lombard's performance very much slapstick to William Powell's understated satire; which jarred sometimes. As a modern viewer, I also looked hard for the sexual tension between Godfrey and Irene ? and found it instead between Godfrey and spiteful Cornelia in classic love-hate form. In a modern version of the film the attraction between him and Cornelia would have been put more to the test - but it's an equation that doesn't work in this film. In one great scene he puts Cornelia down so effectively, and so completely, that it really doesn't leave any room for sexual frisson. The problem then, is that the lack of tension between him and Irene left me a little baffled at his profession that he was "getting that feeling again" in relation to Irene ? it certainly didn't show. But then this is fundamentally Jane Austen for Depression-era talkies; the love is in the head as much as the heart. You never got any close ups of her, perhaps because she was playing younger than her age? Perhaps also this explains the sometimes manic laughter and infuriating giggling. I know, I know, it's best not to look too hard. The verve and gusto, the witty dialogue, the social satire, the costumes, the lighting and above all, William Powell's wonderful performance, make up for anything lacking. I think I'm in love?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie Godfrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey" is a good movie for many reasons. I particularly liked the obvious--how it was a commentary on the Great Depression. The movie starts out with a painful contrast between the filthy rich and "the forgotten men". The "forgotten men" are dirty dump-dwellers who are disturbed by fur-coated socialites, becoming objects in a sort of scavenger hunt. Godfrey is 'found' and he is thrown into a world that is a complete foil of City Dump #32. The film uses lighting to show this socioeconomic divide. In the dump, the lighting is dark, casting shadows everywhere. When Godfrey enters the world of the elite, the room is filled with light, showing the grandeur of the huge great marble hall.The real screwball comedy aspect kicks in after Godfrey is hired as a butler for the most prominent family in New York--the Bullocks. Irene tries to seduce Godfrey in every way possible. Irene is truly crazy. She is like the red head from "Wedding Crashers" when it comes to her pursuit of the butler. She is on a whirlwind emotional roller-coaster. The real character to watch though is Irene's conniving sister Cornelia.The characters make the movie entertaining to watch. Their eccentricity make this screwball comedy enjoyable for the most part. However, the movie is SLOW MOVING, making this 94 minute film drag on and on and on and on. By the time you got to the end, you don't care what happens as long as it happens fast.Overall, the message of this movie stays with the viewer. Godfrey says, "The only difference between a derelict and a man is a job." How different are the rich really from the homeless? Something to think about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The comedy about the Great Dpression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the depression era of the 1930's there was an obvious inequality between the citizens of the United States, this film gives a comedic look at this divide. The scavenger hunt at the start of the film troubled me a bit but as the film progressed I began to appreciate the point of view it was trying to portray. Carole Lombard's character, Irene was lovable as the ditsy high society girl. At times her overreactions were a bit too much to handle. This same manic personality was seen in many of the characters of the film like Irene's mother. This was a lot to take in at times. However, Godfrey, played by William Powell, played a good balance between the antics of the upper class. The sets used on the film were quite elaborate for that time period and scenes changed flawlessly from one to the next. Although much of the story takes place in the Bullock household the filmmakers did a great job showing the extravagance of the upper class and the poverty that the "forgetten men" lived in. Overall this film was entertaining, although the acting was a bit much at times and it seemed as if the actors were trying too hard at certain points. The film did do a good job of putting a comic spin on the sadness of the depression and the ridiculousness of the upper class at that time.</fullReview>

It showed the ignorance and downright arrogance of the upper class in that era. The fact that the rich did stupid treasure hunts that involved bringing in "Forgotten Men" was ignorant and i'm glad LaCava points that out. I believe the director did a fine job of selecting a cast that simulated a rich family and a humbled rich "Parkes of Boston" played by William Powell who was nominated for an Academy award for his portrayal of Godfrey Smith. His peer wit and superior acting leaped off the screen and led to an enjoyable,lovable comedy for the ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as screwball comedy's go My Man Godfrey set the bar high. The dynamic plot along with the outrageous crazy and funny characters of Angelica Bullock and her two daughters makes for a hilarious screwball comedy. The movies starts in the current home of Godfey; the city dump. This scene is shot very dark with fires burning and garbage all around. The next scene where Godfrey is brought to the hotel lobby is very bright in a high class hotel where everyone is wearing extravagant outfits. This really captures the whole theme of the movie which is the difference between the rich in the poor. Irene and Godfrey have a very unusual relationship that seems to progress though the movie. Cornelia has almost an evil role though the movie always trying to bring down Godfrey. I believe that she was jealous of his happiness, he was a poor man who wouldn't degrade himself for money and seemed to be happy without it. I didn't really understand the point of Carlo character he was very unusual and creepy to me in an unfunny way, I think he character was important to show why Irene had taken in Godfrey but should have been less involved in the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film seems to be blatantly apeing Lubitsch's parody of the upper-classes that really is thinly-disguised idolatry - as in so many other Hollywood films, the person we take for lower class here turns out to be safely well off. The script is sharp enough but the eccentric family immediately tiresome. Everyone's temperament is chained to their class. We ridicule the Bullocks, not on account of their oddity, but because of their nouveau riche crassness. And so the wicked social comedy here is chimerical, this is actually this is a paean to genuine high society, the true doyens of fine behaviour and entrepreneurship to boot. Godfrey turns out to be not only well off but of the Boston Parkes of the Mayflower set, and as proof of this exalted status, he has both humility and the magical ability to bend the stockmarket to his will - both things which elude the Bullocks. The romance between Lombard and Powell is no more convincing than their real-life marriage. Lombard has a likable dreamy manner but it dissolves into annoying hysterics several times too often. Powell's urbanity is even more unnatural than the eccentricity of the others. As to the 'forgotten men' that the film purports to champion - they end up as flunkies in monkey suits and presumably must consider themselves lucky. All this leaves more than a nasty taste in the mouth. Only the sensitive artist-protégé Carlo is free of all this sub-texting and is therefore funniest, but this is really Wildean stuff several decades beyond its sell-by date and far too disingenuous for its own good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the company of His Girl Friday, Bringing Up Baby, and The Thin Man...great great stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey (1936)From the depths of the Great Depression, as Roosevelt is running for his second term, comes this utterly brilliant, funny, and socially astute movie from a lesser known director, Gregory La Cava. Carole Lombard might overplay her part at times, but more important and more prominent is William Powell, who plays the bum/butler/social reject beautifully, perfectly. For him alone, this movie needs to be seen, eyes wide in wonder.But don't let the acting, or the clever, fast, and smart plot be enough for you. Demand great photography and you'll get that, too (watch the first scene where Godfrey, played by Powell, goes up the stairs, and so does the camera, up and down and up and over). There is brilliant secondary role at work here, beyond the screwball comedy, and with it the movie creates a wonderful feeling for the times. Yes, this story focuses on the rich, as so many Depression films do, but here it actually critiques them, and brings a social message to the front of things. Is it heavy handed? Not a chance, not from Powell's lips. He gives what amounts to a speech well into the film, about the difference between different kinds of men (bums and businessmen). It's a great piece of writing.Where did the writing come from? A little known novel and some crack screen writing by Morrie Ryskind (who did a lot work for the Marx Brothers). The camera-work is under one of the studio greats, Ted Tetzlaff (more famous for his last film, Hitchcock's Notorious, a decade later). La Cava himself has a long resume but few major successes (Stage Door is the other often mentioned, also brilliant) but he outdoes himself here. There is no sense that we have a second rate movie from a minor studio (Universal) in any sense. Watch and let the screwball aspects make you laugh, of course. But watch from some more subtle, really slick production take you away, even from the first seconds as the beautiful credits unroll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a romantic screwball comedy from 1936 directed by Gregory La Cava.There William Powell plays Godfrey, a homeless man.He becomes a butler of an eccentric family.That's all because of the good-natured daughter Irene Bullock, played by Carole Lombard.He becomes her protegé and also her love interest.My Man Godfrey offers an enjoyable comedy.William Powell and Carole Lombard are great, just marvelous in the starring roles.Other family members of the Bullock family are elegantly performed by Alice Brady as Angelica, Gail Patrick as Cornelia and Eugene Palette as Alexander.Alan Mowbray does great work as Tommy Gray, Jean Dixon is fantastic as Molly.Mischa Auer is hilarious as Carlo.I must also mention Grady Sutton, who's there as Charlie Van Rumple.Also Jane Wyman, the temporary wife of Ronald Reagan makes a brief visit as a party guest.So the cast is excellent.This is often funny, like when Godfrey puts Irene in a shower (with her clothes on).She starts bouncing on a bed like only a woman in love would do.So come on and watch this funny piece of history!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must have seen this more than 10 times over the decades now and still enjoy it just as much as the first time. This is William Powell's film (as Godfrey), no matter what the family he buttles for throw at him, it would not have worked with anyone else in the part. It's always a delight to listen to his diction, his wit was never less than sophisticated. Especially in MMG ? even some of the ordinary words and sentences he uses in here stick in the mind afterwards; after they made him they broke the mould.Crazy socialite family Bullock enrol Godfrey as butler ? they and he have their secrets. Carole Lombard as vivacious melodramatic Irene fancies him to bits whilst Gail Patrick as vicious enigmatic sister Cornelia is smitten with jealousy. Eugene Palette as the long-suffering Dad has some of the best despairing lines of his career, and Alice Brady as his wife is a perfect empty-headed foil for everyone. Mischa Auer also has his best role in Carlo the hungry protégé, although Dad would definitely not agree! A serious social message peeps round the Corners occasionally, and there are many implausibilities or pure corn here and there but ultimately enjoy the roller-coaster ride as not to be taken too seriously.It's a brilliant screwball comedy classic, of course the insipid to-be-avoided 1957 remake gets more showings on UK TV simply because it's in colour and not because the schedulers have ever watched either version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Screwiest of Screwball Comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>O.k., so maybe the absolute screwiest screwball comedy would be "Bringing Up Baby" from two years later, but "Godfrey" certainly runs a close second.If someone who didn't know what was meant by the term screwball comedy came to me and asked me to show them an example, I would pick either this film or "Baby." "My Man Godfrey" is an example of what happened when all of the elements of 30s film comedy came together perfectly. It's a bit like "It Happened One Night" in that way; much of the success of "Godfrey," like Capra's earlier film, rests on bringing together the perfect ensemble with buckets of chemistry, but "Godfrey" one ups "Night" (actually, soars right on past it) on the zany meter.William Powell is flawless as the tramp taken in by the society ditz and "reformed." Carole Lombard is adorable as said ditz, and her performance here is a sad reminder that her career was cut all too short by an early and accidental death. It seems like every comedy from this time period had to have a stock society matron character played by one from a pool of character actresses, and Alice Brady gets the honors here. Powell, Lombard and Brady were all nominated for Oscars, as was Mischa Auer in the first year the Academy gave awards in the supporting acting categories. It's a shame the Academy has forgotten that it once recognized excellence in screen comedy, and "My Man Godfrey" is about as excellent as screen comedy gets.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original "Screwball" Satire; Great Lines and an Unusually-Strong Cast;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey" was well-liked by critics, Academy Award evaluators and moviegoers alike. It was perhaps the original "screwball" influenced satirical comedy'; it gave William Powell and Carole Lombard fine leading roles; and its writers unobtrusively contrasted the irresponsible behavior of the US elite classes with that of the poor, suffering from the Republican-policies-caused economic 'Depression' of 1929-1941. The film opens with a look at a place where the displaced are living, and a scavenger hunt, including two participants, daughters of a corporation owner, looking for "a forgotten man" to bring back to a party. William Powell, the eponymous Godfrey, is found first by Gail Patrick (Cornelia Bullock), but he rejects her on attitude, frightening her into sitting backward onto a heap of ashes at the dump where he and other displaced impoverished types are surviving. Then he agrees to be collected by her giddy but likable sister, Irene, played by Carol Lombard. Once he has told the truth to those assembled at the party, about themselves, Irene engages him as a butler. We see him thereafter interacting with the Bullocks, including father Eugemn Palette as Alexander Bullock and Alice Brady as Angelica, his wife. Others in the household include Mischa Auer as Carlo, Angelica's protégé, Jean Dixon as Molly the long-suffering maid, and Robert Light as Cornelia's boyfriend. In a series of encounters, we find out that flighty-but-nice person Irene has always had everything spoiled by lovely-but- unscrupulous Cornelia; much of the screwball behavior not emanating from rich and out-of-the-mental-mainstream Angelica is committed by the two sisters in their daily rivalries. Irene falls in love with Godfrey; she even gets engaged to someone to get a rise out of him. Then she and her sister are sent to Europe. Cornelia likes Godfrey too; but her affection upon her return takes the form of trying to belittle or to dominate him. Highlights of the film's thoughtful and allegorical hijinks include Godfrey carrying Irene up the stairs to bed, Cornelia calling the police and accusing Godfrey of having stolen her pearl necklace, which she planted under his mattress, a nightclub scene, Alexander trying to explain impatiently to his family that they have to behave, and the climax--which brings all the elements together--the necklace, Godfrey's mysterious past, his friend Tony (Alan Mowbray), his analysis of the two girls' character, and his effect on both the parents. There are classic and very memorable lines I suggest in the film, an undertone of ethical attitude that serves its obviously strong storyline well, and a surface of misbehaviors and "screwball" actions that swirl about Godfrey, who is the centerpiece of almost every scene even when he is not present. The film is unarguably well-made in general, owing to the creative efforts of costumer Travius Banton, cinematographer Ted Tetzlaff (a fine future director), expert director Gregory La Cava (from whom I took a class) and writers Eric Hatch (author of the original novel), Morrie Ryskind and director La Cava. Besides the principals, in the cast one can note Jane Wyman, Jean Rogers, Franklin Pangborn,Gracie Fields, Bess Flowers, Charlie Van Rumple and Edward Gargan. Director La Cava and Charles Rogers produced with music provided by Charles Previn. By my lights, this is an interesting story centered about an ethical and intelligent central character; its only loss of power I suggest happens due to his impoverished status, which prevents him from directly trying to accomplish his categorical-level value goal of helping forgotten men, whose courage in the face of adversity inspired him not to be a quitter either. It is a film that is imperfect, very-much-imitated in its screwball aspects, and hard not to admire or like. Among the cast, Eugene Palette and Gail Patrick have perhaps their most memorable roles, Mischa Auer and Alice Brady are very good, and Lombard and Powell make a delightful pair of seeming opposites. Artistically very good and memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>La Cava -- A Gifted Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He may not be as well known as some directors, but Gregory La Cava stands as a talented director of a number of delightful and fascinating films. His career was long and varied, and he turned out many memorable comedies, dramas, and fantasies. "Stage Door" (1937) and "My Man Godfrey" (1936) are his best known; with "Gabriel Over the White House" (1933) and "What Every Woman Knows" (1934) also very fine. His direction was so smooth that it doesn't call attention to itself, yet the timing, group composition and movement, pace, and rhythm are all skillfully conceived and executed. In "Godfrey" La Cava is blessed with a top notch cast, headed by William Powell. A most enjoyable film with worthy ideas to ponder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems superfluous to add yet another five-star review to those already published, but "My Man Godfrey" is a movie that grows on you. I didn't like it all that much when I first viewed it. In fact, I felt that the movie was showing its age and did not shine as brightly as on its first release. "In fact," I wrote, "the pacing is often rather slow, especially in Lombard and Powell's later scenes, most of them shot by producer/director La Cava in sustained, boring takes. In fact, Gail Patrick survives better than Lombard. True, the movie opens very promisingly and the acting throughout is very capable, although it's worth noting that comedians Palette and Mowbray are used as straight men to feed witty comebacks to Powell. The sets and costumes are delightful, the photography superb!" As the copyright has expired, the movie is now available on many DVDs. For some odd reason, the cheapest ones are often superior in quality to the more expensive!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. It was funny and light hearted which i really love in a movie. It had some more serious social implications within it which is key to making a good movie but it didn't let it slow down the comedy, it used it to its advantage. It really makes fun of the dramatic upper class women of the time. I love the female leads, they are especially hysterical. What makes this movie great is a grounded story with a social note but a focus on great characters with fun personalities. The fast pace keeps the movie flowing and always entertaining even up till the end as things get more serious. Overall this is a great movie that is funny and goofy to no end, I would recommend.</fullReview>

I loved the character interactions and personality's throughout the whole film. Godfrey himself was of course my favorite character in the film because of how funny he was and how many layers he has. In the beginning he just seems like a poor man found by a rich family but he ends up being the son from a rich family that wanted to live a humble life away from his family. This is a all around great movie that really doesn't have any problems that I can think of. I have always been a fan of romantic comedy and this one did not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey was a great romantic screwball comedy from the 1930's. It had light humor but was still a very funny movie. And had a great storyline of a man who came from nothing, became a butler for a rich family and got himself all cleaned up and worked very hard for the family and saved up money for him to better himself and own a restaurant and even helps the family out of their debt, because they have helped him so much. Even though one of the ladies of the house kept trying to bring him down, after seeing what a good guy, Godfrey is, she feels bad for it and starts really like him just as much as everyone else. I thought it was really funny that in the end Godfrey ends up basically being forced to marry the woman who helped him become this great success, but who he could not really stand to be with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MY MAN GODFREY in my opinion is not slapstick. Certainly a good comedy with a targeted theme. I think it is the former audience, considering the consequences of "the Great Depression", this issue really done good. Funny story in a relaxed and a great atmosphere is certainly a big hit.Moral and class are the two pillars that created the story. In the heart of the story to put ?forgotten men" who in fact are not. Crazy and strange wealthy family that was not as bad as at first appears. The change in man is perhaps the essence. All are changing for the better. It seems to realize the true value. The cinematography is excellent, and in many ways we capture the high society.William Powell dominated as a butler Godfrey. It is very interesting that this character in the film has not been determined. Godfrey is certainly not the butler, much less the homeless, and the nearest is a rich man. I am delighted with his performance.Carole Lombard as Irene Bullock was loud and crazy. Lombard is his performance probably divided the audience. At times really irritating. She is a spoiled brat that knowledge has value. Goodness, love and perseverance are not bad qualities.Powell and Lombard! Marriage before the film, the chemistry in the movie .... profession. Divorce!?There are so many interesting characters and good performances in the film. Gail Patrick (Cornelia Bullock) It is very interesting naughty sister that in fact it is not. Eugene Palette (Alexander Bullock) He is the voice of reason that no one is listening. It's great.Interestingly, the climax of the film was eventually extended until the end after which the movie abruptly ends. This is how it should look like a complete movie. A crazy comedy with which everyone will laugh out loud and listen to reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film carries on the moral of "Do onto others as you would have them do onto you", at first comically when Godfrey literally says this when he bring the tomato juice for the hungover mother of the house. When he is brought in by Irene to work as the family butler, she saves him from the streets and remaining a forgotten man. However later on in the film, when the family faces financial ruin due to some bad investments, Godfrey is able to help them cover their debt. As he worked as their butler, he took the opportunity to better his life overall by educating himself and investing. And despite the cruel Cornelia, he doesn't allow himself to be stepped on by her, he stands up for himself when she tries to frame him, but in the end tells her face to face when he has his leaving talk with the family before he helps to bail him out that even she helped teach him a lesson that will and has helped better him as a man. Not to say that tho family he is working for isn't completely crazy. They are. They're make this a screwball. As Godfrey tries to complete his work and remain the sole sane head in this house that is very easy, I would imagine, to lose all your marbles. This films touches on many of the Hayes Code rules, such as the drug rule, and the man and woman rules. If I delved into all of this, I would be writing 2 pages worth of material at least!! That's how chock full of good Screwball, skirting around the Hayes Code, humor this film contains!!</fullReview>

Although I did not always understand the references that they made, I would expect nothing less as I did not grow up in the time period of which the movie is set. I would imagine that the set and the props are very realistic for the time period although I did not live during that time and therefore wouldn't know for sure that the inside of a house looked like that in the 1930's. The characters also had a very good on air personality and developed very realistic relationships with their co-stars which only added to the hilariousness of the film and made for a very pleasant viewing experience.</fullReview>

Before watching, I was well aware of how everything in these films was meant to be over the top, but between Irene and her mother, I wanted to do nothing more than wear earplugs the entire time they spoke. However, due to Godfrey's amazing wit and sarcasm, I was able to deal with their hysterics a lot more. It was nice to have a good laugh while watching a movie that was primarily about coming up from having nothing, and knowing what it's like to truly struggle, while others around could have the entire world handed to them on a silver platter.</fullReview>

One of the daughters has a love interest in Godfrey, and his attempts to keep things professional when she is doing everything in her power to get his attention. Most of the characters are not really taken seriously, though they do have depth. They seem to be more or less parodies of certain types of people of the time.

While this being a screwball, it has underlining meanings that could be missed if not paid attention too fully. As this being a post depression film, it shows off the lavish lifestyle, by the way Irene Bullocks character is living. For all the positives this film brings onto the comedy side of the entertainment business. The meanings behind all the lessons learned are far fetched from half-baked.

The plot that Godfrey intentions are to help both his homeless friends and the declining Bullock family even though he is their butler. My favorite character was Godfrey due to his many traits and cunning and witty personality. He always seemed to be ahead of the game and this showed when Angelica tried to frame him by planting her pearls underneath his bed. This screwball comedy was entertaining and kept my attention throughout the movie. The wacky comedy started when Godfrey was picked to be the winning element of the scavenger hunt. This type of comedy continues throughout the movie. My favorite scene of this is the multiple times that Irene faked fainting to get Godfrey to pay attention to her, her acting of regaining consciousness to not being conscious.</fullReview>

Everything she said and did just made me want to smack her, and I don't think he character was intended to be that annoying. Needy maybe but certainly not annoying.

The acting by William Powell is outstanding, he makes Godfrey a very charming and lovable character from start to finish. The supporting cast did a very good job as well. They made the movie very funny and brought their own wit and craziness to the table. I loved how the comedic moments were all random and seemingly crazy but that added to its overall comedic value. It also had a very strong social message in that it spoke out against how the poor are exploited by the upper classes. It gave the audience proper insight on how people are people regardless of their economic situation so it's never right to mistreat someone based on that. Overall the film was shot beautifully and the sets and costumes were very eye catching and bright, so this helped to set the tone very nicely.

		<fullReview>With the institution of the Hays Code in the 1930s, came the birth of the Screwball comedy. My Man Godfrey blatantly challenges the Hays Code without stepping outside of its boundaries.Godfrey played by William Powell, and Irene played by Carole Lombard appear in many situations that the Hays Code may not approve of for an unmarried couple. For example, there are periods of time when both characters are face to face and very close to one another and appear if they might kiss. Also, both characters appear alone in a bedroom together multiple times, and in one scene both sit in the bed together.The film does a masterful job of keeping the viewer entertained. In true screwball comedy fashion, there is little to no downtime in the movie. The constant and rapid pace of the movie contributes greatly to the comedy and entertainment.</fullReview>

The over the top scenes were meant to be over the top but i didn't find them as humorous as others might. I also found some of the characters to fall a bit flat and uninteresting whereas Godfrey was a quality and likable character.

The plot was interesting but somewhat cliché and unbelievable; however, i enjoyed this movie's plot and many who enjoy this genre would as well. The ending, without giving anything away, was a high point for me i found it captivating and Irene's final line to Godfrey is brilliant and quite comedic. Overall, i would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of earlier screwball comedies i only scrutinized it because it isn't a genre I'm particularly fond of.</fullReview>

This movie has it's dramatic turns to it and it's a classic that will make almost anyone interested in it. If you are looking to watch a funny movie that has it's dramatic comedy moments, I would recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey manages to balance humor, social commentary, and great acting to form a perfect screwball comedy. There were many laugh-out-loud moments, and the characters' different personalities were all charming in their own respects. The character of Carlo provided great comic relief, and Godfrey's rather stoic personality balanced Irene's fairly dramatic persona. Cornelia was snarky and fell somewhere in the middle. The plot was engaging, and everything was relatively fast paced, which made it difficult to become bored with what was happening on screen. There were moments where Carole Lombard's somber pouting fits became a bit tiresome, but the attitudes of the other characters managed to counteract that rather well. Definitely a film with humor that almost anyone can appreciate, regardless of the times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Screwball Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that stands out to me when watching My Man Godfrey is its pace. Its brisk pace never lets for any dull moments, making the 90 minute film fly by.You also saw the pace in the dialog at some points in the film the characters are yelling over each other speaking so quickly almost forcing you to listen that more intently. My favorite character was Carlo played by Mischa Auer, Carlo is basically the performing fool for the Bullock family though called Mrs Bullock's protégé, she dotes on him and thinks he is talented while Mr. bullock hates him. Combined with his gluttony and laziness and it makes for great comic relief. Irene Bullock played by Carole Lombard was another great character,she did a wonderful job in this movie. It was her dialog that made me like her part so much. It is easy to be the strong silent type and be mysterious but it is much harder to come off as endearing or likable when you never stop talking and Irene Bullock is either talking or sobbing throughout the whole movie.Yet she doesn't get annoying.Paired with William Powell"s Godfrey they make a great movie couple.Two characters who are complete opposites but it is their differences that make them go so well together, Godfrey will always be distant and Irene will always be smothering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually really enjoyed this movie. My favorite genre of films are comedies, and a screwball movie was the start of comedies. In some scenes it was so crazy, almost unbelievable that some people behaved certain ways. However, that's what made it so enjoyable and funny. I actually laughed out at a lot of scenes. I also liked the story behind it, the fact that Godfrey was a "forgotten man" and "no one wanted him". It tugged at my heartstrings, and made me happy that Irene did in fact want him. However, it was sad that he couldn't be with her at first because he wanted to be good at his job as a butler. It made him respectable and even more likable, no matter how sad it was that he couldn't be with the woman who likes him. He wanted to be good at his job and make something of himself. It was also very obvious even from the first scene of Irene and Godfrey interacting that they would inevitably fall in love in the end, no matter how irritating Irene got.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Godfrey (William Powell) is a bum in the dumps during the Great Depression. Spoiled socialite Cornelia Bullock (Gail Patrick) offers him $5 to be part of a scavenger game. Godfrey is not happy and corners her younger sister Irene Bullock (Carole Lombard). Flighty Irene explains that everybody brings back something unwanted. Godfrey volunteers to go back with Irene to be the forgotten man and win the game for her. She wins and he berates the whole crowd. She hires him as the family butler and looking to make him her protégé. Mean-spirited Cornelia wants him fired. The wealthy chaotic family is a mess.Comedy does change from era to era. The most interesting aspect of these early talkies is that the rom-com formula isn't set yet. It would be more formulaic for Godfrey to couple with Cornelia. The couple first has to hate each other before they fall in love. Although Lombard is older than Patrick, Irene is suppose to be the younger sister. It would feel better to have the older gentleman fall for the older sister. Irene is too flighty and it's hard to take her puppy love that seriously. She is much better as a student of life learning from Godfrey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a great e film in the screwball comedy genre. It is funny, witty, romantic, and even thought provoking. The film takes place in the middle of the great depression, and does a great job of emphasizing what it would have been like to be living in those times. The main character, played by William Powell, is an eccentric who lives amongst those less fortunate as a form of social experiment and self loathing. This makes for a more interesting story. I especially enjoyed all of the little quirks and personalities of the different chapters, each one is crazier than the next and it makes for some very entertaining moments. There is nothing quite special about the cinematography or any aspects of the film that really wow you, but it is an overall great film and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in a smart witty comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My man Godfrey was utterly entertaining and laugh out loud lovable. From Godfrey's stoic, can handle anything façade to the hilarious antics of the Bullock family. I didn't even know he cared for Irene until the very last scene. While being a romantic comedy it also tackled some serious issues going on at the time, such as jobless, homeless people that came to be because of the great depression. The foolishness, and waste of exorbitant wealth, and finding ones path when all seems lost. While it entertained you, it also taught you something. Best actor I'd say is shared between Irene and Godfrey, they were both just that good. When it ended I wished there could have been more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Powell delivered a powerful insight to the life of a lost soul. Transforming roles throughout, Powell convincingly becomes the most intriguing character to invest your time into. His clever witty wordplay and overall manner becomes lovable not only to the viewer, but to almost all the characters in the film. Dealing with the great depression delivered a conduit for Powell to expose the light at the end of the tunnel. In that, he will come out on top, even if viewed as if he's on the bottom. This movie was compelling from start to finish and is a classic screwball comedy that any movie lover should make to the time to watch, as it is one of the most heartwarming tales of a man who you'd never know has so much experience behind those eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Screwball comedies came about as a result of the Hayes Code for decency in movies. The whole idea was to poke fun at the code. And this movie did a pretty good job. It was funny enough, and didn't sacrifice character development and coherency for the sake of comedy. The older sister is probably my favorite character in the movie with how she grows. That said, some of the static characters are so annoying. The mother and the mother's... what is Carlo again?? Anyway, the mother and Carlo were both crossing the line between funny and irritating. I also was kinda irritated by the younger sister, but I guess that's a moot point. I liked how we slowly figured out about the main character's past, and I loved seeing his transformation from the guy in the dump to the butler of a rich family. All in all, good movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey (1936) is a new, fun type of movie that puts the viewer in the head of the main character, Godfrey. The movie is shot for us to see that the world is a material place, but does not have to be. Godfrey's character is so down to earth that the viewer can relate with him. The film pushes the boundaries of what was acceptable for films during this time period. I think that is a big part of the charm. It pushes the limits of love and language without breaking the strict film code of the time. The movie comes full circle at the end that will probably please much of the audience. The movie is shot in a way where it can almost be related to today's cinematography if it were in color. However these old black and white movies still do have a charm to them that is hard to dislike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a fun, good old fashion, slap stick comedy that can appeal to any audience. What makes this movie so enjoyable is how amazing the actors were in their performance. They make the characters feel alive and give them a personality that is able to hold on to your attention throughout the entire movie. Not only that, the story of Godfrey who was once a man of wealth reduced down to nothing but a forgotten man and by realizing his mistakes, uses that knowledge to help out the Bullock family from their financial crisis. Another thing that makes this movie so enjoyable are the beautiful set pieces. Even though this is a black and white film the colors just seem to pop out. Like in the Bullock mansion you can see the reflection of lights appearing off of the floor. The night life that is shown has a vast array of lights and dark that complement each other so well. Overall, if you're looking for a classic movie to enjoy in your free time then My Man Godfrey is just for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, off the bat, the mother is hilarious. In the first few scenes she comes off like a snob (which she pretty much is) but later you see that she loves her children and will do practically anything for them. You have to love her stupidity and the fact that she sees faeries. Her protégé gives you many laughs as well, with his bad opera singing and drama. Him acting like a monkey to "cheer Irene up" was one of the goofiest things I've ever seen. Aside from the characters who are all fantastic, the film has a great message concerning money and the elite. It teaches the principle of peoples self worth. The family Godfry served never would have guessed that he could be intelligent or make the fortune and scheme he has. They never imagined he could be so polite, smart, and good tempered. The purest character traits seen in the whole movie were those of the men living at the dump.</fullReview>

When Godfrey first met the Bullock's in the dump, you could kind of tell that he was more educated than the other homeless people in the dump. The Bullock's are a hilarious, crazy, and disorganized family. Godfrey puts up with them and brings some sort of organization to them. He constantly has witty, sarcastic comebacks throughout the entire movie. We find out that Godfrey came from a high-class and wealthy family and he put himself in the dump to start from scratch and make a living for himself. The Bullock's gave Godfrey a chance to make something of himself. Godfrey was able to do so and he also gave back to not only the Bullock's but also all the forgotten men at the dump.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Man Godfrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always a sucker for William Powell, who plays the title character Godfrey, I was flat-out in love with this movie from beginning to end. The dialogue was constantly laugh-out-loud funny, and delivered well by every member of the cast. It was a rather large cast, too, when you think about how many characters get a bit of screen time that shapes only them (though not likely totally independent of Godfrey).The movie also made light of the Great Depression, which was still going on at the time of its release. This social commentary, rather than dating the film, is an important part of it. It drives a lot of the story and characterization in a timeless way. Though some of the jokes are more relevant to that point in time, most transcended the setting. From clever commentary, to witty repartee, to downright silliness (a busy and constantly funny scene that involves the most horrifying ape impression I have ever seen comes to mind), My Man Godfrey covers such an impressive range of tones--comedic and otherwise--that it's actually hard to get over.On top of being a great comedy, My Man Godfrey is an extremely well-made film. The cinematography is consistently beautiful, elegant, and complementary to every other aspect. For instance, beyond the literal transformation of the dump Godfrey is "found" in, the cinematography is used as a great tool. From Godfrey's initial , depressing scene in the dump, to the sunny scene where he sees hope for it, and finally the light-filled reveal of the restaurant he has opened up there, the aesthetic transformation of the dump doesn't only have to do with the physical aspects.Finally, the characters are just plain lovable. Not just the obvious, dynamic, all-around great Godfrey, but ditsy-and-privileged-but-kind Irene, her short-tempered father, her conniving sister, their cynical-yet-romantic maid. They all get a little bit added to them, subtly or not, that makes them more relatable, makes you want to see more of them. This is perhaps one of the best parts about My Man Godfrey, it leaves you wanting more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a masterpiece of screwball comedy. Never once does a scene go by without a hilarious joke, or site gag. Godfrey's quick wit is smart and eloquent. The zany antics of the Bullock family he is employed by never becomes over drawn or tedious. Every time the family's outlandish behavior comes close to crossing the too ridicules line, Godfrey comes in to wrap the scene in clever way. Every single character is engaging. There is never a throwaway line. And the story entwining all this wonderful comedy is heartwarming as well. The theme being showing the stark contrast of lives between the super rich and the extremely poor never comes across as judgmental or defaming of either side. Its message is uplifting. It shows that the individuals of both parties are not so different from each other. That if one gives enough effort the gap can be bridged. Godfrey bridges that gap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was a masterpiece. From start to finish it was very enjoyable and easy to watch. In the start, the obviously wealthy Cornelia and Irene Bullock are scavenging for a "forgotten" man. Figuring a local refugee camp, also a dump, was a perfect place to find their man. Cornelia's attitude is obviously horrendous and that is shown by the way she talking to Godfrey, making it easy to dislike her. In a desperate attempt to one-up her sister, Irene explains her situation to Godfrey, and Godfrey accepts the label of a "forgotten" man, to beat Cornelia. From then on, Godfrey wins over Irene and is offered a job as the family butler as well as Irene's "protege". The family truly enjoys Godfrey, especially Irene who becomes infatuated with him. Cornelia attempts to frame him for stealing her necklace, making it easier to dislike her character. It comes out that Godfrey was a Harvard graduate, and he asks his partner Tommy Gray to keep it a secret. Godfrey ultimately puts his knowledge into work and saves the Bullock family from poverty, and ends up marrying Irene in a very awkward and funny way. The entire story was easy to follow, with humorous scenes that made the audience chuckle, one being when the police came to investigate the missing necklace and Godfrey was intoxicated, William Powell mastered his role as Godfrey. The acting as a whole was impressive, as was the story. It comes as no surprise that this film was nominated for multiple awards.</fullReview>

It is through and through a timeless comedy. Godfrey's witty comebacks are what makes the movie funny. There are moments where some of the characters seem like they are almost trying to be funny, but nothing compares to the sarcastic butler. However, the plot was confusing and the ending was almost hard to follow. If the comedy was non-existent in this film, I would not have enjoyed it nearly as much. The mother was clearly an airhead and the father's remarks to her were also very comedic and still relevant to the comedy we enjoy today.</fullReview>

Irene was very comical and obsessed with her Butler Godfrey and it was her who gave Godfrey the ability to help the family.Irene was one of my favorite characters.

		<fullReview>This film is what it is because of Powell's portrayal of Godfrey. If a different, less skilled actor had played him, this film would have been mediocre at best. The family he works for seem rather one dimensional, and not much like actual people. I realize they are supposed to seem spoiled and shallow, but we still don't know much about them, their past, or true motivations. They are supposed to be rich and rude and loud, and they are, and that's about it.I didn't like the ending, because it mirrors too much the classic story of a couple who have issues but end up OK. It also doesn't feel appropriate. Godfrey had no plans to marry her, and wanted to drop off contact with the family. But when the daughter tracks him down, he allows himself to be wed right then. It's obvious that he was at least a little interested in her, but his character should not have allowed him to marry her.Fascinating to watch Godfrey, all else is OK, family is amusing sometimes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey (1936): Dir: Gregory La Cava / Cast: William Powell, Carole Lombard, Gail Patrick, Eugene Palette, Alice Brady: Hilarious screwball comedy about what can been foreseen or overlooked in those we encounter. William Powell is mistaken as a homeless man and employed as a butler in the home of a wealthy dysfunctional family. Carole Lombard takes ownership in him insisting that they romance. Much of this is quite sitcom but the screenplay contains numerous pleasant surprises particularly a lesson learned within the outcome. Director Gregory La Cava does well upstaging the material beyond sitcom to hilarious episodes that exploit one's social preferences. It gives a ringside seat to the secret antics that go on behind closed doors to one family. Powell is a steal as Godfrey who plays along with deception while reeling in a lesson that will benefit everyone. He comes from the street and plays off a butler who adds an emotional core to a family with none. Lombard is amusing toying with Godfrey's affections, while Gail Patrick plays her scheming sister out to sabotage until Godfrey brings out their flaws. Eugene Palette and Alice Brady round out the cast as the parents. Palette particularly plays a business person in financial trouble and finds the solution in the unlikely place. It stresses fault in judging others and the motives that eventually set in. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A scatterbrained socialite hires a vagrant as a family butler... but there is more to Godfrey (William Powell) than meets the eye.Why would a man who is clearly part of high society become a butler for someone else and then try to hide his past? It seems there are only so many reasons. The one that comes to mind first is that he is acting as a spy to help out his own family, and after finding the embarrassing details he will come out. Or, because this is a movie, maybe it is on a bet? You have to watch to find out, and you should. William Powell is a fantastic actor. Probably best known as "the thin man", he was so much more and was really a gem of the 1930s and 1940s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main cultural function of the 1930s screwball comedy was fundamentally tied to the great depression, both distracting destitute audiences with escapist laughs, and both poking fun at the inaccessible wealth of the upper class while also teasing audiences with brief moments to bask in their opulence. With all this in mind, it's hard to imagine a film more befitting its time and place than My Man Godfrey. Godfrey, like its 1936 cohort Modern Times, is a comedy with a conscience, diverting, but equally empathizing with the plight of the downtrodden working class. But that's not all: the film sheds rare and frank exposure on the homeless unemployed and the disturbing discrepancy with the vacuous upper class, while also providing valuable impetus inspiring audiences to mobilize and seize opportunities to not only help themselves, but incite paradigm shifts in the employment superstructure to benefit the many, all without excessively taxing the wealthy elite. Oh, and did I mention the film accomplishes all this, is dazzlingly funny, and a surprisingly fresh romantic romp to boot? Sheesh! With such a timeless and recurrently topical premise, it's no wonder Godfrey has yielded so many adaptations and remakes through the years, but it's Gregory La Cava's classic that remains indisputably the one to beat. Armed with an airtight screenplay by Morrie Ryskind and Eric Hatch (repurposing his novel), Godfrey practically dances from scene to scene with a light, limber touch that belies its underbelly of substance. A gentler offering than the manic chaos of later screwball offerings, the film never oversells its circumstance or silliness. Instead, La Cava confidently allows the histrionic excesses of the airy Bullock family to speak for themselves, usually helpfully narrated by the note-perfect gravelly griping of Eugene Palette as the family's cantankerous patriarch, commandeering all of the best zingers ("when there's a horse in the library, things have gone too far?!"). Between the effete tittering of Alice Brady's cheerily clueless mother, who keeps a dimwitted artist on retainer as her 'protégée' (hysterical scene thief Mischa Auer), and the spoiled, scathing machinations of her eldest daughter (the deliciously haughty Gail Patrick), for this 1%, the term "sweetness and light" applies best to the cocktails they indiscriminately ingest, nattering all the while (the talk of "pixies" also provides an amusing throwback to the 1930s, when audiences were evidently less accustomed to the symptoms of a hangover). But amidst the perspicacious satire of the Bullock clan's rampant partying and their scavenger hunts for goats and homeless men alike demonstrating the grotesqueries of the class divide, teetering chaos is grounded through the insertion of a 'straight man' (in more ways than one): their butler, the unforgettable William Powell. Despite the potential for a zany, reactionary leading man, Powell's Godfrey is suave wit personified, the subtlest twitch of an eyebrow or airily offhand line connoting vast backlogs of emotion, passion, and hidden pain, all wrapped up with the most exquisite comedic timing imaginable. Sharing undeniable chemistry with him is the delightful Carole Lombard (the fact that the two were recently divorced adds a bizarre level of subtext to their repartee here). Lombard's Irene ? flighty, oblivious, and prone to feigned (or real) fits of explosive, juvenile emotion ? takes some acclimatizing to, but it's only over time that the slyness of her charm creeps to the surface, revealing a character that, in spite of her privilege, evidences a radiant sweetness, and refusal to be pedantic or talk down to anyone. Their interplay is definitely unconventional, but, as the childishly lascivious Lombard ferociously pursues romance with her butler whilst Godfrey deftly deflects for the sake of propriety, an unusual tenderness emerges, and it's hard not to root for them by the end. Yes, the finale comes across as somewhat overly hasty, as Godfrey's master plan takes effect, and all character disagreements are resolved with an almost utopian neatness. Nonetheless, it's hard not to share the elated zeal of a depression-era audience at seeing such a large- scale happy ending won with such inspiring ease. My Man Godfrey may attempt to have its cake and eat it too by providing such a tidy resolution to the social issues and class discrepancies it raises, all without flubbing a single punchline. However, lest we forget: cake is delicious, and worth being consumed with full gusto, much like this delectable satire and classic of the screwball era. -9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sophistication in post-Depression America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From its plot to its title, My Man Godfrey is unmistakably about sophistication. Blended with comedy and romance, this is not an inaccessible take on the matter and its dry wit tears down the walls between class conflicts in a post-Depression era. If only it teared them down outside of the film too. It's a very interesting reflection to take someone made homeless by the Great Depression and plonk him right back in privileged society, but I wish the film was more focused and meaty in what it was trying to do. Nothing stops it from being incredibly pleasant and engaging with William Powell's natural charisma. He outshines the buffoonery of the rest of the family to the point where you want him on screen all the time. Peeling back a lush backstory more riveting than the film's own narrative, it's unfortunately lightweight when it could have offered more powerful moments. At least its thoughtful moments land in a way that is far beyond its time when compared to the chaos of You Can't Take It With You.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...she's in a family full of eccentrics.Does a comedy film actually have to make you laugh? Can you have a comedy without any laughs in it? This was once a question posed by film critic Mark Kermode. When thinking of this question, the first movie which comes to my mind if My Man Godfrey, a comedy which I love, but there are only a few moments during it which make me laugh, and even those few aren't big laughs, despite the movie's crazy screwball, gorilla imitating antics in which the straight man William Powell enters a cartoon world. But I would still call it a comedy as it's a movie which leaves you feeling melancholic watching it.William Powell's role as Godfrey exemplifies why he is the master of words. He can take any regular sounding lines and turn them into something memorable, and when he speaks any unique piece of script writing, it's like poetry. It's easy to fall in love with Carole Lombard watching My Man Godfrey; she succeeds in playing a ditsy scatterbrain in an endearing manner, but I feel the real unsung cast member of the film is Gail Patrick, one of the most underrated actresses of the 30's, it's a shame she never became an A-list leading lady. She became typecast playing (for lack of a better term) bitches, but could do so with a dose of humanity. I love those moments which describe a ridiculous situation which are never caught on camera. The mental image of Carole Lombard riding into a mansion on a horse, going up the stairs and leaving it in the library is an image better left to my imagination. Let's play grumpy old man and assume, oh say a Hangover sequel would not allow such a scene to be left to the viewer's imagination and thus be unfunny as all hell.Screwball comedy was all about making fun of the rich who caused the great depression; My Man Godfrey is probably the most harsh attack on the rich which the genre ever made, partially because of just how sombre the film is. The opening scene in which men are living in a shanty town by a dump or the scavenger hunt for bums or so called 'forgotten men' and shocking sights for any era. Likewise the Bullock family may be wealthy, but they sure aren't happy and don't get along with each other.My Man Godfrey wasn't based on a stage play, but watching it you might think otherwise as long stretches of the film take place in real time. Plus you get one thing almost unheard of in film's prior to the 1950's, an intricate title sequence. I consider My Man Godfrey along with You Can't Take It With You as the two quintessential "kooky family" movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a 1936 romantic comedy directed by Gregory La Cava. The film stars William Powell and Carole Lombard playing the parts of Godfrey "the forgotten man" and the socialite who hires Godfrey to be a butler for her family. The dialog is very good and I particularly like the sets and costume design. The lighting and cinematography was classy, and there were some interesting camera work. For example, in one scene the camera track a person as the walk through the house but as the move between rooms a staircase puts the person out of view and the camera continues to move and then picks the person back up in the shot through another doorway. These are the types of filmmaking nuance that have to be seen to be appreciated.</fullReview>

During his time in the Bullock residence he sees how dis functional the family is. at first the family takes the man as a nobody but soon enough they begin to discover that he might have a more prominent background than they ever couldn't imagined.This film is a great family film which I found to be genuinely funny something I can't say I find in almost any films or television I now see being produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>at 1st not a screwball, it becomes one in the last 3rd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The forgotten man learns a 1st lesson about what it means being a protégé when he watches the gorilla routine, and one gathers he's not surprised at what he sees.In its own right, a very good movie, thoughtfully written; its plot has a dramatic cursive drive, and a decency and integrity reminding of a really Golden Age for the Hollywood cinema, and just enjoy that opening credits (thought most of the scenes are indoor). The highlight of this script is the characters, so that this is even less of a mainstream screwball than even 'Nothing Sacred', the idea of 'My Man ?' was even less being funny (and neither jaded, but decent). The lead character subverts a trope of the epoch; the forgotten people were not unusual on stage or on screen, but this one, plunged into a dysfunctional family, was an intellectual, nonchalant and streetwise, but he has to be severely shaken and scarred, to resort to such a measure for getting over a grief. Smith is playful, generous, cold, but his cruelty towards Irene can get a little annoying, and the end gracefully claims her victory; script-wise, this also means that part of him is known through other characters' opinions, as when even his friend is aware that Smith is meant for Irene, though he himself doesn't acknowledge it yet. The more developed characters seem real, and reasonably unpredictable; the actors have a wonderful accuracy (Jean Dixon, the jealous woman; also E. Palette, while Auer has more of a bit part). Nowadays, the audiences are more accustomed to rubbish.Carole was the delightfulness on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great screwball comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of my favorite black and white movies of all time. I enjoyed every element of this movie. William Powell as Godfrey was simply amazing. Despite being such an early movie, the acting was incredible. The plot, as well, was very well done. It was very entertaining and always kept you on the edge of your seat in either laughter, excitement, or both. My Man Godfrey is well written, meaningful and hilarious. With many of the older films, I am usually skeptical of the quality of the humor. This movie fulfilled my expectations and then some. The humor is still sharp and relevant. Carole Lombard and her sister complemented Powell nicely. It's obvious that they wanted to hit on a number of social issues at the time, such as the Great Depression, and it did a good job of it. I had also never heard the term "the forgotten man" but it makes sense when talking about the homeless who were simply in that position because they couldn't get a job... not because of drug or alcohol reasons. It was also a fairly light-hearted way of shedding light on the ignorance of the rich as opposed to making them just look evil and uncaring. If anyone is trying to introduce their children to older films or maybe hasn't watched many themselves this is a good starter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Man Godfrey - A Stellar Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey was released in 1936 and was directed by Gregory LaCava. It was a stellar film with a stellar set and shining main man, William Powell. Powell's seriousness throughout the film helps to break up the insanity of the rest of the characters and in turn actually makes the film funnier. He is the foil to the rest of Bullock family. The cinematography of the film was flawless, as characters walk up the stairs the camera glides with them effortlessly. The script was clever, witty, and humorous without being over the top as far as screwball films goes. The set was bright, elegant, and beautifully detailed and accurately portrayed the financial status of the Bullock family. It was a pleasure to look at and easy on the eyes. The costumes were done beautifully and matched the time period accurately. The film as a whole flowed so smoothly that I barely noticed the transitions between scenes. Carole Lombard who played Irene Bullock was a pleasure to watch and worked well alongside Powell. Overall the film was elegant, funny, and enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Story of Godfrey, the Butler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey sends a very strong social message. The film uses subtle, dry humor to criticize the social structure at the time of the great depression.The plot revolves around a butler finding himself in a home with a woman hopelessly in love with him. The audience would normally not expect the two to get together in a normal context, but the entire film sort of dances around the idea of them getting together until the end when they do. It takes place mostly all in one location, almost like a play. It relies almost entirely on dialogue to send its message.it still has very tight editing. It has many close ups, and scenes that include only one or two characters. At times there are quick, over the shoulder shots that add to the scatterbrained nature of the family that Godfrey is with. The aesthetic of the set was very well put together, being in black and white, the house was almost entirely white, making the characters stand out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Silly movie for Anytime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic screwball comedy, My Man Godfrey shows not only how things are not always what they seem, but it also shows how the "other half" live. Taking place either during or shortly after the Great Depression the wealth of the rich appears to be something that none of them properly know how to handle. They play outrageous scavenger hunt games and essentially had to hunt down a man who was seemingly struck down by the depression and became a "forgotten man". The humor and jokes are exaggerated and really played up fr laughs. Early on in the film Mr. Bullock is informed of the misadventures his two daughters had the night before, one involving a horse inside their house. While this could have happened at the time, it is not something that would typically happen when one went out for a night on the town. While the film is a riot and full of laughs and humor and fantastic in the technical aspects as well as the acting; I was personally bothered by the ending. Not because Irene Bullock (Carole Lombard) wanted to care for Godfrey (William Powell) but because she had seemed to force him into a marriage he wanted no part of at the time. The entirety of the film is him fending off her advances toward him, yet at the end of the movie they end up hitched. The film is wonderful, there is no questioning that, but the ending felt rushed and emotionless to me and was what lowered the movie from a 10/10 to a 7/10. Lombard and Powell, although married in real life at some point, lacked any real chemistry on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey was a great screwball comedy with William Powell who played Godfrey and Carole Lombard who played Irene. The whole movie was funny and continued to be funny. Godfrey stayed serious throughout the whole movie and had a great personality. Even though he was living on the streets, you could tell he was a straight up intelligent man. Irene is a nutty girl who fell for Godfrey. She did everything she could to be with Godfrey. Throughout the movie, Irene would talk really fast when she was talking to Godfrey. She wouldn't let him get a word in showing her dominance. Powell was great during the movie. He was a man pulled off of the streets to butler for a wealthy family. It was a joke to the family, but he didn't see that. He was serious while Irene was acting ditsy to him every moment. He came across many different situations but stayed serious through all of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For as much of a comical film as it is, this "talkie" has managed to charm me quite well. I'm not sure if it's due to the over the top humor, the ridiculous characters, or the parallel backdrop. For a comedy set in the great depression, this film is extremely charming. William Powell does amazingly well in his role as the down on his luck protagonist. Becoming an extremely likable and empathetic character, probably even more so back when the film was released. The technical execution is wonderful, every shot feels lively, and always encompasses scenes perfectly, whether it'd be taking in a whole group of the cast, or focusing dead on one character's face.The scenes that are made in this film are amazing, such as the "contest" early in. A wonderful over the top depiction to set the mood for the rest of the film. A great film, and it should always be seen as such, the only reason why I don't find this film a 10, is due to my own personal objection to the ending, spoiler free review of course, but I found it uncomfortable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I am a big fan of comedy movies so watching "My Man Godfrey" was particularly a treat for me. Before watching this, I wasn't very familiar with the Screwball Comedy era and this is the first film I've seen from this genre. Overall, I thought the movie was a perfect mix of humor and moments that were just bizarre. This film takes place in the 1930s in the midst of the Great Depression. In America at this time, there were two large classes of people; the poor and the rich, there wasn't much middle ground. In this case, Godfrey is the poor man while the Bullock's were the rich family. With the exception of the father, the entire Bullock family is ditzy and doesn't care for much else besides their fancy parties and lavish lifestyle but this is portrayed in a humorous way. This lifestyle sets the perfect background for a love story meanwhile in the movie. When Godfrey is taken in by the Bullocks to be the new butler, things take a romantic turn between the poor man and the rich girl. This film is significant because it helped lay the foundation for modern day romantic comedies which is one of the most popular genres of films today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a wonderful little screwball comedy, made irresistible in large part by the presence of the magnetically adorable bimbo Cornelia Bullock, as played by Carole Lombard. She makes it easier for me to overlook an aspect of the movie that I found troubling: sure, he was a dirty derelict, but it wasn't as if he was truly a member of the great unwashed. We learn fairly early on that he is a Harvard alum, and while the movie uses social justice as a buoy to hint at having a message, this detail knocked it in the kneecaps for me. Despite this, I was a fan of the fakeout moments of suspenseful anti-slapstick, and of the supporting family members, who in lesser hands could have been acted much more flatly and less vivaciously. Eugene Palette, especially, is a favorite and pretty much a guarantor of a good time whenever I see his name come up in opening credits, and these ones in particular are some of the snazziest from the early sound era!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey" is a beautiful film set mostly in a Fifth Avenue mansion where the whims of 2 rich sisters are indulged to the point of lawlessness. The film opens with the 2 sisters lavishly dressed, at the city dump, to bring a "forgotten man" to the "Waldorf-Ritz" as part of a scavenger hunt. Sister Cornelia insults the man named Godfrey and he pushes her into an ash pile. Sister Irene takes a genuine interest in him and he decides to go with her to the hotel. After Irene wins the contest Godfrey is asked to say a few words and he rightfully puts all the rich people in their places. Irene is intrigued by Godfrey and hires him as their new butler. Despite Molly the maid's advice that Godfrey keep his hat and coat by the door for a quick get away he manages to put up with the crazy antics of the family and he becomes a model of decorum and efficiency while Irene becomes quite infatuated with him. Everything isn't quite as it seems however and we learn that Godfrey comes from a very wealthy family from Boston and that he gave his fortune away to a woman who ran off on him. Because of his bitter experience he is not interested in Irene's advances. Meanwhile Cornelia becomes jealous and tries to get Godfrey arrested for stealing a necklace of hers but Godfrey is too smart for her and the police do not turn up the necklace. While the sisters are frittering away the family fortune, Godfrey uses the necklace to buy the family company's stock and return it Irene and Cornelia's indulgent father just before the brink of ruin. He also used the money he made to built a nightclub on the site of the city dump and build housing for the homeless men. He also bought back Cornelia's necklace and returned it to her. But Irene could not live without her man and she followed him to his office and had the mayor marry them. This movie is a brilliant contrast of the rich and the poor during the height of the Depression. It highlighted the wastefulness of the rich and their objectification of the homeless and it shined a light on the simple but profound line that "the only difference between a derelict and a man is a job". Godfrey's transformation from a bum to a butler to a man of means and an agent for societal change was surely a hopeful message to the audiences who viewed the film in 1936 and no doubt left an indelible message for all future generations of movie goers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a classic screwball comedy movie about the struggles of the great depression. Gregory La Cava's insight on how even "above average" men were hit hard by the depression allowed for audiences to connect with it for generations to come. The main character is shown as a traditional bum from the 30's. La Cava's great attention to detail really helps move the story along. Godfrey is able to use almost unnoticeable attributes of his character to improve his lifestyle as best he can. The hilarious addition of love interests and other characters that may have been added for humorous effect, but still helped to move the story along. The interesting twists and turns the story takes that show the life of two opposite worlds working together as one.</fullReview>

Perseverance is probably the films brightest message, Godfrey, while placed in unfortunate circumstance, strives and battles the social class system while enduring the humiliation from specific people to eventually overcome all. This positiveness gave all who lived through the stock market clash the escape from reality the had desperately needed while structuring hope for a similar upcoming.</fullReview>

I don't think I laughed like this in a while, which is horrible, so I really liked how this was done and portrayed in a fashion that can be really enjoyable for anyone.One thing I noticed about this film was how beautiful it was photographically. The film was so clean and easy to see, and it had a nice use of brights and darkness. The brights I found especially noticeable, which is obvious since the subject of this film was humorous. I have no idea why but the way the characters act and respond to each other reminded me of the Addams Family. I... I don't even know why but it was just how it was played off.As far as characters go, Godfrey was so enjoyable out of all of them. I LOVE his character and how he may seem like a cynical schmuck with a bad attitude, but he's really quite knowledgeable and goodhearted. Not to mention he has my favorite kind of humor I like to imitate: crude sarcasm. Every comment that comes out of his mouth is hilarious and I could not get over his use of words. That, and it was nice to see how very generous and polite he can be despite his overall demeanor. He reminds me a lot of Niles from The Nanny (show from the 90's), probably because of his stoic yet comical performance. Bravo on the actor's part.I can tell by the use of some very over-the-top acting by the other butler and the wife that it's a common theme in screwballs, and I never found it getting old or grading on my nerves. I find it really endearing, and it's nice to see that this kind of humor once existed and did not consist of sexual innuendos and snide remarks towards peoples' genitalia. Not that there's anything wrong with any of that, but despite the code being issued it was a huge breath of fresh air to laugh at something that wasn't considered perverted or having underlying meaning.There was never a dull moment in this movie, and for that I give it a near perfect score for its ability to entertain even to this day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film told the story of a wealthy and naive young woman Irene hires a vagrant, Godfrey as her families butler. While working for her family, Irene begins to quickly fall in love with Godfrey. Uninterested in Irene's affection for him or any involvement with her crazy family, Godfrey struggles to continue working for her family while trying to keep a secret of his own.This movie is very fun and charming. Carole Lombard really made this movie for me, providing the audience with a funny, passionate and ultimately mellow dramatic young woman seeking the affection of a perfect stranger. It was very entertaining to see the charming Godfrey deal with the spoiled and entitled Bullock family and their strange family dynamics. My only criticism of the movie would have to be the ending when Irene ends up getting Godfrey to marry her.Over all a very entertaining movie but not the best screwball comedy of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stand still, Godfrey. It'll all be over in a minute.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something incredibly progressive about this 1936 film. A female comedic lead that doesn't take a backseat to a male co-star. Now it could be because the two leads, Powell and Lombard, were previously married, but the chemistry between the two engendered genuinely funny moments. That is rare in contemporary romantic comedies. The screw- ball comedies of the 30s and 40s are all but forgotten and it's really too bad. One of the reasons why a film like "My Man Godfrey" is so enjoyable is because of the clever ways the writers walked the line of decency. Instead of resorting to gaudy displays of sexuality, the viewer is forced to fill in the blanks. One doesn't watch a film like this for the plot, in fact there isn't much of a story whatsoever. What is there is simply exists to give the leads a change of scenery to continue their quixotic interplay. Luckily the humor is there among all characters and the lack of story doesn't really matter. Every scene is filled with a chuckle or two and while there are romantic elements, there is never a point in the story when we are led to believe the two will end up together, nor are we given any reason to want them to end up together. The lighthearted nature of it all pushes any criticisms to the back as we're instead allowed to enjoy the hilarious banter among all on screen. It's a shame that films like these aren't held in higher regard among modern audiences who require sophomoric humor in order to consider a movie funny. Many may consider a film like "My Man Godfrey" to be highbrow humor, but once you see it for yourself, it becomes quickly apparent that this film was made for all, yesterday and today.

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie despite having little to no knowledge on it. I only learned approximately 15 minutes of it's plot and was unsure if I would like it. Most aspects to me were very funny but there were some points, however rare they were, which didn't grip me like other scenes. The key aspect which truly made the movie in my opinion, was William Powell as Godfrey. His somber tone and close to expressionless ace throughout most of the movie not only reminds me greatly of a real life butler but also is comedic when everyone else is going a bit loopy. I wasn't a big fan of the ending, though. I found it confusing. Overall, this is a very well acted film.</fullReview>

Godfrey was real intelligent and he didn't want you to think little of him even though he had no home. you knew so little of him the entire story plot and everything just came pouring out about his life last minute I liked that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is an excellent screwball comedy that can adhere to most ages. William Powell was excellent as the lead, Godfrey, and Carole Lombard played the role of Irene Bullock beautifully. this film is a classic piece of American cinema and part of that can come from the filmmakers having to follow the strict censorship code put forth in 1934. The chemistry between the actors and actresses was easily visible and that created the funny moments that filled the film. i enjoy comedies over other types of films and this movie was no exception. Because it wasn't filled jokes or funny scenarios like the movies of more recent times, I was able to enjoy the film for the story that it portrayed while laughing throughout at the interactions between the characters. it was nice to see a screwball comedy that delivers its humor through different methods than those that are seen frequently today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about Carole Lombard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carole Lombard possessed a magical quality that most of the leading ladies of the 30s did not. She was a natural presence in the movies, led by the sheer force of her own infectious personality. She seemed at home on the screen and you could feel that she was having fun. She was multi-talented, she could effectively occupy a film in any genre, but her best gifts were on display in comedies.There was a sparkle in her eyes, in her body language and in her very screen presence that gave you the feeling that this was an actor who was having a great time. Very few actors have that quality and even fewer have the courage to exploit it the way Lombard did. She had a fearless way of approaching a scene, a manner of affecting a scene naturally. Some of this may have come from an early experience while making the Howard Hawks comedy Twentieth Century ? during a stateroom brawl with co-star John Barrymore, the director told her that if she didn't "stop acting" that she would be fired. She took his threat seriously and went into the scene with six-guns blazing.This is a technique that Lombard brought to My Man Godfrey in which she approaches every scene in a way that is fearlessly self-deprecating. She plays Irene Bullock who, as the film opens, is in the middle of scavenger hunt at the high society ball. She and her sister are down to the last item ? find a forgotten man ? so they race to the city dump where many of the city's homeless reside. Irene's sister Cornelia (Gail Patrick) insults a tramp named Godfrey (William Powell), who responds by pushing her into an ash pile, but Irene charms the man by explaining the rules of the scavenger hunt and asking him to come back to the ball so she can claim her prize.Cornelia is not happy that she lost the game to her kid sister and during an argument, their mother decides to hire him as the family butler. Godfrey accepts but he isn't really prepared for this family which is truly a bag of screwball nuts. Aside from Irene and her sister, there's Alexander (rattle-voiced Eugene Palette), the family patriarch who is forever frustrated by the disorder and chaos in his own home and finally gets up the nerve to tells the family that "What this family needs is discipline. I've been a patient man, but when people start riding horses up the front steps and parking them in the library, that's going a little too far." And there's the mother Angelica (Alice Brady), a daffy, feather-headed socialite with a high-pitched voice that is just on the edge of becoming a cluck. She has a man around the house she calls "a protégé," an odd little man named Carlo who is always eating or performing strands of melancholy poetry.At ringside is Molly (Jean Dixon), the maid who warns Godfrey about the asylum he is about to enter. "You won't need any quarters," she tells him "Just hang your hat near the door so you can get it quickly on the way out." With Godfrey in service, it doesn't take long before Irene falls madly in love with him. Her eyes moisten like a puppy when she asks the now clean shaven Godfrey, "What happened to those nice whiskers?" She is so sweet in her approach to him and so clever in the way she puts her words. When she asks if he will be the butler she asks, "Do you buttle?" I don't know if that's even a word but I like it.There is a kid quality to Irene, a kind of arrested development that is present that makes this apparently twenty-year old woman act like an eight-year old. There are times when she scrunches her face, hops on the bed, or just fidgets like her brain forgot to mature. She is spoiled rotten, she knows what she wants and goes after it and, most often, she gets it.There's also a lovely sweetness about her. There are moments when she looks at Godfrey with nothing but love in her eyes. Take, for example, the moment when he washes the dishes and she dries them. She sits on the counter drying each dish but never takes her eyes off him. This is a genuine moment, made even more curious by the fact that Lombard and Powell had been married and divorced.What comes from her kid qualities is a lack of cynicism. Unlike the rest of the family, her vision isn't clouded by the fact that Godfrey came from the gutter, she only sees a charming man who remains charming no matter what. She has such a tender way of dealing with Godfrey but she also has a bulldozing way of performing a sort of a smash and grab when she wants something, like the moment when she goes to see Godfrey at his new office in order to marry him. There she is, with a minister on hand and takes a befuddled Godfrey in her arms. "Don't worry Godfrey," she says "This'll only hurt for a minute."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie took on more of the romance movie role, but did it well in a goofy way. I really enjoyed this movies well put together storyline. This movie was kept very interesting throughout with its dry sarcastic jokes. I really like all of the plot twist as well, and the way they shroud Godfrey's character in mystery for most of the film. For the longest time we do not know his intentions or his past. I think the most comedically successful characters in the film were the women in the Bullock family. The way each of their characters would just ramble on and on without taking a minute to breathe was just hilarious. The actresses did a great job of showing you they were all from the same dysfunctional family. All of they're quirky antics and mannerisms were acted out perfectly. I really liked this film for its originality and dry humor. It feels like a classic version of what has become such a huge modern genre, romantic-comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious Screwball Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that William Powell is a fantastic actor. His performance in this film is outstanding. Usually when i'm watching comedies i don't really focus on how good the acting is, but Powell's performance was impossible to ignore. His deadpan delivery and sarcastic remarks really made the film and made this movie Oscar-worthy. The mother played by Alice Brady was also hilarious. Her character was so cooky and i found myself rooting for her to be on the screen more. The only character that I didn't really enjoy was Carlo. Carlo's character i found a little over the top, but he was a pretty minor role so it didn't hurt the film very much. The ending in which Godfrey was actually a man who came from great wealth was both surprising and intriguing. The movie alluded to that fact throughout, but the hints were subtle. Looking back Godfrey was immediately a very good butler and acted very sophisticated for someone who was living on a dump. The relationship between Powell and Carole Lombard worked perfectly and their chemistry really shined in this film. It's not surprising that they got married at some point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was literally a American screwball comedy. It had all the right dialect and the perfect amount of good humorous body language. The characters literally jumped off the screen and into our hearts. Godfrey (William Powell), had a charismatic and well educated personality that eventually won over the family in the movie. This in return was great. I was able to understand and genuinely like the character that was portrayed. Carole Lombard's character Irene was so sweet and cute but overly dramatic at times; even so I found myself enjoying every bit of her performance. The film all in all was great. The lighting and the camera work was able to convey an interesting insight on what this "wealthy" family was all about but in the eyes of man who has given it all up at one point in time. This is something I would definitely recommend to anyone who is interested.</fullReview>

There's a lot to like, but a few things rub me the wrong way.The two things which rub me the wrong way are - 1) It's half screwball comedy, and half some subtle and not so subtle social commentary - I have trouble shifting gears some times 2) I am, personally, a bit turned off by the extreme madcap elements - the family makes the Simpsons look sane y, so I try to remember that, but tI think if people can appreciate the comedy, while appreciating some of the more serious elements without getting confused they will really enjoy this.People who love madcap zaniness and over the top dysfunctional families may adore this :)At the end of the day, I enjoyed it enough to give it 7/10 due to it's overall excellence.p.s. My favorite screwball comedy is the much newer What's up Doc. So if you like screwball, and want it in a pure, but modern form, check that movie out :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect from this film when I first heard of it and then when I started watching it, although it was quite clear in the first few minutes that it was a classic. The entire film there are smart and witty lines that make the movie worthwhile by themselves if the plot were boring, but fortunately it is not. The quirkiness of the family is hysterical at some points that it even becomes slightly ridiculous, it makes you wonder what happened to that kind of comedy nowadays. The fact that Godfrey must withstand all the family's nonsense and be able to keep his job and do it well is impressive to all that surround him. He is even able to make a good business and save the family that took him in from bankruptcy. The story is a great compelling story that makes the audience root for the underdog position that a man like Godfrey has found himself in all the while making them laugh at the absurdity of it all. The only reason that I did not give this film a 10 was because I did not like how it ended. How Irene finally muscled her way into being his wife was utterly insane! I felt so cheated that it had to end, in my opinion, so cheaply.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gregory La Cava directed this popular comedy that stars William Powell as Godfrey, a wise but penniless derelict living in the city dump who finds himself recruited to be a "forgotten man", that is a target of a high society scavenger hunt. He is found by Irene Bullock(played by Carole Lombard) a ditsy socialite who is so grateful to Godfrey for helping her win the contest that she hires him as the new family butler, but he learns that the Bullock family are the epitome of the idle rich that he has come to hate, so he decides to reform them from the inside, even as he and Irene fall for each other... Funny satire works as both a depression era and high society comedy, and makes thoughtful observations on both. Predictable of course, but leads to a satisfying finish, and the cast is fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey" exemplifies everything great about the movies. It doesn't possess the sweeping grandiosity of such films as "Gone with the Wind" or "The Wizard of Oz", but it still retains the glamorous style of Hollywood life. The film is, above all else, a comedy. This becomes apparent in the first lines of dialogue. But what makes the film more than a mere laugh fest is the cinematography by Ted Tetzlaff. Much of the film takes place inside an enormous mansion where the family of the female lead character lives. The camera pans slowly throughout various scenes, showing off the lavish décor; the large twin staircases, the silver and chandeliers. Like Charlie Chaplin's comedies, "My Man Godfrey" imbues its jokes with wit, intelligence, and sentimentality. However, unlike Chaplin's comedies, which were mostly silent, "Godfrey" is filled with unbelievable noise. The characters chatter and whine and laugh and scream at each other, often all the same time, spewing one-liner after one-liner. These scenes build and build like a wave, and then crash. Eventually the dialogue takes on a rhythm that moves the entire film along. William Powell and Carole Lombard, who play the two main characters, steal every scene in which they appear. Gregory La Cava's career never soared as high as his contemporaries' did. But this doesn't change the fact that "My Man Godfrey" is one of the funniest, most-heartwarming American films ever made. Very few films have remained so vividly in my memory as this one. Only a few characters have made me feel as intrigued or sympathetic as Powell's Godfrey. Any film lover and anyone who loves to laugh must see this film at least once. Three or four times wouldn't be too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good starting point for old school slapstick comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey (1936, Gregory La Carva) is a 30's screwball comedy about a homeless man named Godfrey, who gets taken in by a wacky, somewhat malevolent, probably bipolar, aristocratic family (to become their butler, classic rich snobs). This movie helped come to the realization about screwball comedies. Firstly, they aren't centered around screwballs who do a bunch of stupid acts and get into trouble for it, they are, in some respects, ways of getting around Hollywood's censorship code. Much in the way Blade Runner and 2001 use science fiction to convey a deeper philosophical meaning, movies like Godfrey use comedy as a way of getting away with things you wouldn't be able to in a drama. For instance, a man and a woman can't be in a bedroom together unless they're married, but because Godfrey is their butler, he has to deliver food and other things to their room, that's part of his job description. The movie also has a deeper social context to it. There's always been a notion in American culture that with class came decency or respectable traits. And though the formally rich and very honorable Godfrey was the noblest of all the other rich people in the movie, he doesn't actually develop such humility and respectability until he becomes homeless. Its a rally cry for class equality, in that it shows that their are the good and bad of every class, and that one isn't necessarily better than the other. I'd recommend this movie for someone who likes old time comedies or someone who's trying to get into 30's movies. 8/10</fullReview>

I knew from the start that Godfrey had it for Irene just by the way they had them sitting so close in the beginning dump scene. I loved how ridiculous the Bullock family was portrayed. The classic ignorant rich family, that is completely out of touch with everyday people. The way the director Gregory La Cava shows how easy it is to fall out of fortune was priceless. The Bullock family losses it all and Godfrey moves back up in the world, using his money to better others lives not only his own and not to mention the poor butler also bailing out the Bullock family. William Powell acting was stunning, i can't wait to watch more movies he's in.</fullReview>

It was quite the change how Godfrey starts out as an essential bum, and winds up becoming a butler. At first, I thought he'd start a relationship with the older sister, but she ends up being a spoiled character. It was better how he ends up with the younger sister instead. The younger sister's undying, unwavering love for Godfrey makes for a great element in this movie. It would have been nice to see them complete the wedding at the end, but that's just how they chose to film it. One lesson that can be learned from this movie is that when you are pursuing happiness, you don't always have to pursue it alone. That was shown in the relationship between Godfrey and the younger sister.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow, what a film! to begin, this screwball comedy is definitely one that needs to be seen. going into the movie i had speculations as to how funny this would be. i underestimated what i had coming. i was laughing out loud in a class room along with many others. and its just such plain humor that makes it so funny. besides the humor, the story was really good. the concept and mystery around the main character, Godfrey, makes the film so intriguing. he's such a serious character but yet brings humor to the film unintentionally. the supporting actress, Irene, is a daughter of a rich man and finds their butler Godfrey(formally a homeless man) as the man of her dreams. her mission through out the whole film is trying to get Godfrey to love her like she loves him. my favorite part of the film was the ending. it was so unexpected and, i think, the best way to end the film. Godfrey had invested into stock for Mr. Bullock because he was on the verge of becoming broke and he gave Mr. Bullock a suitable amount of money to be comfortable again but Godfrey also took some of the money and redid his old homeless living area for all his friends and himself.Definitely a movie everyone needs to see!</fullReview>

In short, it's a movie about Class and at the same time, out of all of her frivolous, flighty nature, Carole knows that Godfrey, played by William Powell has something extra going for him.

		<fullReview>While "My Man Godfrey" is a screwball comedy about Godfrey, a wealthy scholar turned hobo turned butler turned mogul, and his love-hate affair with his slums savior Irene, it also has a major political undertone to it. The movie showcases the indifference to poverty in society and the eccentric carelessness and pomposity of the rich. The film entertains throughout and has all the crazy antics and happenings expected from great screwball comedies. That said, one will find the plot a little too over the top even with the suspended disbelief expected for this style of movie. The leading lady Irene simply just comes off as spoiled and slightly annoying at times. The film does shine in other aspects however. The set's attention to detail was fantastic and the camera work was greatly innovative for the time. Overall this movie is definitely one of the quintessential screwball comedies to see if that is your interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Screwball Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have to say "My Man Godfrey" is one of my new favorite films especially of that era. There is such a great mix of round and flat characters that are used. Godfrey's character has so many different sides that you get to see develop throughout the movie. The first scene down at the dump just starts the movie off with a great dynamic, at first between Godfrey and Cornelia and how he actually pushes her into the ashes, then how he agrees to humiliate himself just to help her sister Irene to beat her. All of the characters are out of this world and well played. It was an excellent screwball comedy that kept me laughing throughout the movie. The fact that everyone had fallen in love with Godfrey just shows what kind of man he is especially since he never wanted acted on any of their feelings and in fact he tried to distinguish the fires the best he could but he was just the type of man that you couldn't help to love. Also he wanted to not only work his way back on to his feet but wanted to help others on to their feet as well. Definitely a great moral in the movie as well, that I think makes it a must see movie.</fullReview>

The camera work was highly impressive and the photography was simply beautiful.This was this first screwball comedy I had ever seen, and I found it hilarious. The character's really brought this film - about a beggar hired by an overemotional socialite as a butler - to life. Godfrey (Powell) straight, stone-wall performance was perfect, in a house that included a scatterbrained young girl, a conniving jealous sister, and a comical dimwitted mother. This movie was just awesome and I really admired the photography and directoral work of this film. The ending really puts the whole picture together as just a classic that I could watch again and again. I recommend every one see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey was something that I didn't initially expect to like, but I was very quickly proved wrong and I almost immediately fell in love with it. Obviously, William Powell's performance as Godfrey stole the show. He portrayed Godfrey's character magnificently and without his amazing interaction with the other actors/characters the movie wouldn't be half of what it was. Technically, the movie was very good for its time. Notable moments are the times when characters are ascending the stairs in the Bullock house, the way the camera rises to keep track of the characters while they move seems really innovative and interesting, and it's the earliest example of this type of camera movement that I have seen. All in all the movie is just great, just as romantic as it is comedic. Definitely a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey was a great movie. I thought it had a great story line and I thought the characters did a great job performing their roles. I thought Godfrey was a very interesting character and you really had to pay attention to him the whole movie to understand him completely, which I thought was fascinating. I liked the different combination of personalities put together in one household as well. You had just about a mix of everything. I thought they did a great job shooting the film also. The different camera shots and scenes were well done. I would recommend this movie for people to see, I think it was a very intriguing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie a "forgotten man" (Godfrey) is used as a part of a scavenger hunt fora very affluent party, and after he knows it he becomes the butler for a very rich family. Godfrey soon finds out that the family that hired him is extremely crazy, yet he doesn't mind. In the end of the film when the family find out they are no longer rich, Godfrey comes to their aid and gives them money he made from stocks. I love movies like "My Man Godfrey". They are just so energetic and fun. In this film there is so much going on. In the first few scenes there was so much chaos going on the camera kept moving deeper into the hotel show more and more disorder and confusion. There were some very long shots taken. I liked this because it made the film more interesting to me. I give this film an 8 out of 10 because it is just a very fun entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was amazing, the plot and acting were spot on. The role of Godfrey was played in great fashion he was witty,humorous, and brilliant at same time. How the ending was going to be became pretty clear as the movie went on, not in terms of how he was going to be but in terms of who he was going to be with. The other actors played their roles spectacularly as well, the dysfunctional family had all the right elements; a mean individual, a nice one, a angry yet loving one, a moocher, and a spoiled yet simply slow one which combines to be a bad mixture in the a position of wealth. The elements of comedy in this movie speaks for itself.</fullReview>

This film pairs dark and light, rich an poor, funny and serious together so well that the viewer is left with an abundance of knowledge of how two very different people lived. I enjoyed this film not only because it was so humorous, but because it effectively gave the audience complete insight. The imagery was also well executed. The camera pans seamlessly between rooms and people. Cinematography wise, scenes in this film gives the audience certain perspectives that were absolutely groundbreaking for its time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought My Man Godfrey was a really good movie. I thought it was captured very well and over all the movie gave off a certain attitude/mood from the compositions, the acting , the lighting and the different perspectives used. The movie is shot very clearly and well. They cut scenes when things were in motion a lot of the times, for example when the father goes from the front door to the stair case it isn't shot at one continuous rate. The bright and natural window lights caused harsh shadows on the walls, maybe representing the rich and snotty family. When Irene's tea party was going on to show all the people who attended, they did a pan movement with the camera from left to right. They also had a scene that faded in from another scene, from the kitchen to another room. This movie has a protagonist in the beginning, Irene who takes in the forgotten man in her wealthy home, despite the others opinions and feelings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a great piece about society and the issues that are still present today. The scenery was just perfect with the cluttered dump by the river and clean and grand mansion. The staircase was shown beautifully. I loved the "rich people" furniture, lamps, and decorations for no real reason. The costumes of the females in the film are so dead on. I loved the use of furs and shiny fabrics. The two daughters play off each well. I think girls would really be like that if they didn't have to opportunity for anything besides winning a worthy husband. Godfrey was played with grace and brought a humanity to this crazy family. I like how he handled them all, well except the end. I thought it would've ended differently. I liked this film but I am still waiting for positive female characters.</fullReview>

However, this movie was SO funny, there were times that it was so ridiculous that I just sat watching with a stunned disbelief look on my face. This is what made it funny though. I loved Godfrey, and obviously you're supposed to he's the main character. He is very calm even when the family is having a freak out stage, he is also clever, and the more weird things happen to him the better, because you see how clever he is in dealing with him.

		<fullReview>As soon as this movie started I could tell that I was already going to like it. The whole idea of how Godfrey became a Butler is honestly hilarious. I thought it was really funny how he was living on a dump and then out of nowhere the next day he is living with the Bullock's and they are an extremely wealthy family. The way they live is compelety different to what Godfrey is used to. Another reason why I think this comedy is great is because the Bullocks family are really wealthy but their relationship is insane. They are always fighting or complainng about something!

		<fullReview>This is another film that just has a phenomenal lead actor, William Powell, and the rest just seem to be fillers. Sure, they played their parts well enough, but just not memorably enough. Perhaps that is what they were going for?When I think of older films, especially from the 30's and before, I usually think of the camera being very stagnant. One still shot of an actor right into another still shot of an actor. This film does not fall into that category. I may be easily impressed, but the camera following Godfry upstairs was completely unexpected and welcomed with open arms. It certainly was an experience that was both a spectacle to be hold and an utter shock. Everything from a technical aspect is very well done. The lighting was a bit boring, but completely utilitarian. I really loved those sets and the opening credits were another shock to my system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great hunt!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great depression of the 30s, in a way, created inequality in this country. On the one hand, great fortunes were made and many more were lost. In those days Hollywood's idea for escapism was the screwball comedy, with an emphasis in presenting how the privileged classes lived. This was in sharp contrast with what the majority of regular citizens were experiencing.With that background, Gregory La Cava, a man who knew how to entertain an audience, took the direction of "My Man Godfrey". In the film we are given, on the one hand, what appears to be a city dump near to Sutton Place, one of the richest areas in Manhattan. We are shown a destitute man, Godfrey, who comes in contact with a couple of rich girls out on a scavenger hunt. Godfrey will change their lives forever."My Man Godfrey" gathered a distinguished cast. William Powell and Carole Lombard were at the pinnacle of their popularity. Both actors exuded charisma in any film they graced with their charming presence. They both left a mark of distinction in this comedy. Both are elegant and sophisticated, and they make us care about the characters they are playing.The best thing about those 30s comedies were the marvelous ensemble casts assembled to support the stars. Thus, one is treated to delicious performances by Gail Patrick, Eugene Palette, Alice Brady, Micha Auer, Jean Dixon and Alan Mowbray.This is a classic film that will live forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When one sees a screwball movie, they are often left laughing at the edges of their seats (or couch). However, "My Man Godfrey" has done more than that. This movie was able to perform a screwball movie with a main character that stays sane yet pestimistic throughout it entirely. Out than the main character Godfrey, the other main characters also do very well too, including Carole Lombard, who played Irene, and Mischa Auer, who played the funny-as-hell Carlo. One interesting touch to the movie is how Godfrey has this kind personality to help the family out when they were in dire trouble before abandoning his job to go back "home." "My Man Godfrey" is an excellent movie and is extremely underrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film made a very good impression on me. The tale that it tells is funny, sad and heartwarming all at the same time. Once a homeless man due to running away from a broken heart Godfrey resolves himself to remaining alone and poor in a shantytown at the dump however he is lifted out of his misery when a local rich girl offers him a job as a butler. He later ends up gaining the affection of the whole family and in particular the girl who got him the job.I found the humor in this movie to be very clever and well done. The family's drunken antics provide a very humorous backdrop to what otherwise is a very serious story.I found Godfrey's interactions with the family to be most humorous as he was constantly shooting down their attempts to pry into and interfere with his life.I found it most amazing that he used the necklace hidden in his room to get him in trouble to save the family from the financial trouble they had been sinking into. At the end of the movie when he reveals what he has done, quits and leaves, only to end up marrying the girl he clearly had been suppressing his feelings for the whole movie is wrapped up in a very satisfying and heartwarming way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film, directed by Gregory La Cava, was ahead of it's time in terms of production. The editing was flawless as was the acting. La Cava developed the characters exquisitely using well written dialogue as well as actions by the actor or actress. When the naive Irene, played by Carole Lombard, was introduced it was no surprise that she was going to have to learn a lesson. That's where Godfrey(William Powell) came in. He proved to be extremely witty and after finding out Irene's feelings for him he began to teach her life lessons. Godfrey believed it was in bad nature to get involved with the person hes working for. As the movie progressed, Godfrey also opened up and you found out way more about his life and personality then first encountered. La Cava used lighting to show very clearly the difference in setting. Throughout the film La Cava began to show brilliantly valuable life lessons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The way this movie presents the title and cast is quite impressive and almost appears computer generated. This quality cinematography and enjoyable viewing experience follows through the rest of the movie with the especially great fluidity of camera movement shown when Godfrey first uses the stairs as a butler. This style of movie seems to lend itself to exaggeration and some of the acting does reflect this a bit, but overall the actors are all quite good at portraying their respective parts.Because it is a screwball comedy, the big issue of the day (Great Depression era homelessness and joblessness), is incorporated in a peripheral way that makes it clear this movie is not really attempting to change society ? it just acknowledges the fact the problem exists and suggests one possible, though improbable way to go about implementing a solution.</fullReview>

Knowing where he first came from and not knowing then who he was. You can tell that he was very well educated, or perhaps aware of things and not naive. He didn't have much of a sense of humor at all, but the slick things he said was remarkable and quite funny to me.

At the beginning of the movie when you see the dump, you just don't know where it is going. After just a couple of minutes into the film it just like amazing how funny it is. I feel they portray the rich family just how middle class people think of them, spacey, bored with there money, and have no respect for poor people. The way Godfrey interacts with the family is also something to be amazed about. For each family member he almost has to become this different person so that they will allow him to do his job. The camera work was also great with all the different angles and close ups. Overall it was a great movie that everyone will enjoy!</fullReview>

Up until recently I haven't been able to enjoy a old films acting, discarding Charlie Chaplin and a few others. I also started to pay attention to what characters I tend view or enjoy the most. While doing this I found that almost every character in a film is on one of two sides. One being the good and the other, the bad.

		<fullReview>I want to start out by saying I enjoyed this movie, it was not only entertaining but came with a moving message. At the time this movie was shown, America was in the midst of a terrible depression and this gave people more of an awareness of how people in our country were living. The movie opens up with the best scene I believe of the whole film, a group of men dressed in rags, living in a dump, who got hit the hardest by the economic conditions of the time. When all of a sudden a fancy car pulls up and a well dressed women approaches a man in rags "Godfrey," and asks if she can buy him for 5 dollars to show him off to all her friends at a party. This is such a moving scene because it shows just how out of touch some people are to how the other half lives. The message of this movie was clear to me, go out and help people who are less fortunate. This movie is so well written, I loved when Godfrey was talking, he spoke so wise and witty. Then again some moments when the actresses were speaking I had no idea what they were saying even though it fit their characters perfectly. I recommend watching this film: it is smart, funny, and most importantly it comes with a meaningful message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I judged this film unfairly before I watched it,I thought it was going to be bland black and white with bad acting and cheap scene structure. I was wrong on so many levels. Firstly, William Powell is a fantastic actor. His facial expressions are one of the reasons why this is such a great screwball comedy. You don't need a laugh track when his sly exasperated looks are always there to remind you how hilarious a scene is supposed to be. I haven't seen any films with Carole Lombarde before, and I already like her better than Catherine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers, and Ingrid Bergman. She was funny and her acting skills are far superior to Catherine Hepburn, who uses charm alone to captivate audiences. This can go the same for the actress who played Cornelia. However unlikable her character was, her acting was superb. The actress who played the mother was hilarious in her own right. She was scatterbrained and spoiled and treated everything like a little pet, including Carlo, her Russian protégé. Arguably the funniest scene from this movie was Carlo's monkey scene when he tries to cheer up Irene. This film was endearing and funny, and largely a commentary on humanity. Godfrey's simple sentence, "The only difference between a man and a derelict is a job," is something that still holds true today. People are people, and economic status is something that should not fuel our love for one another. I'm guilty of assuming this film was junk before watching it, and it is probably one of my favorites now. I find myself talking about it in conversation and have already bought the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my review of the 1932 Scarface, I said that it might be the most entertaining studio era film that I have ever seen. Well, I happen to have a soft spot for comedy, and My Man Godfrey happens to be an incredibly witty satire; Scarface is great, don't get me wrong, but I had a lot of fun watching this film, even if it was occasionally predictable. For instance, Irene as a character is somewhat flat; she may be more sensitive than the rest of her family put together, but she still comes of as a spoiled brat throughout the whole film, and predictably she gets her way and marries Godfrey at the end. Obviously that's part of the comedy of the film, but her character could certainly have used just a little bit more dimension. Godfrey's character, on the other hand, is equal parts hilarious, intelligent, and good-hearted (enhanced by a healthy dose of sarcasm). With his performance, William Powell ties together the whole film, and balances out the crazy antics of the Bullock family. His are some of the best lines from the script (which is honestly, my favorite part of the whole film. The writing is brilliant). The camera work is also really interesting; even the opening credits are beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my first "screwball" comedy, and I am glad! These comedies that are coming out now don't truly compare to the pure humor like they use to. The time era that this movie was made was truly apparent in the movie such as, the " The lost man" and the "rich family" which effected the two different societies. William Powell and Carole Lombard were incredibly entertaining and enjoyable to watch, they have great chemistry with one another. The entire movie is fast paced, the characters are outrageously zany, and it keeps you on you're toes from start to finish.At the end of the movie, i was somewhat puzzled. During the entire film Godfrey didn't want anything to do with Irene, but in the end he doesn't stop her when she said marry me. Did he just give in to her zany ways? Does he actually love her? It is funny when Irene says "Stand still, Godfrey. It'll all be over in a minute" when they are about to get married, you think is this a true happy ending?</fullReview>

Although, since the dialog did go quite fast, I am sure if I watched it a second time that I would laugh harder simply because I'd get more of the innuendos in the movie. I found it amusing that Godfrey made a business called the dump and how the workers were the "forgotten men" he once lived with in a shack down by the river.

		<fullReview>This movie will keep you with a smile on your face from the title to the ending credits. The movie follows the typical screwball comedy setup where a man and woman who are complete opposites somehow end up together. The film is shot beautifully and takes place all over Manhattan. The photography is excellent as well with little to no skips at all and features a very clear picture as well. One of the most interesting aspects was that it seemed the studio created some sort of fake Brooklyn Bridge painting or model to make it seem like it was really in the distance in several scenes because to the naked eye it seems a little to good to be the real bridge; however -- the water underneath the bridge is moving, and on top of that bridges are going under it all night long! Besides the excellence in the photography the sound was amazing as well, the characters would sometimes yell outside the view of the screen but it would be muffled enough to let you know the yell was far enough away and not relevant to what was directly in front of view. Overall I highly enjoyed the movie and would definitely recommend it to people and thats why I've rated it an 8!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey" is a wonderful example of a classic comedy, and tells a fun story to boot. It shows that, while there are minor differences between comedy in the 1930s and comedy today, much of the subject matter joked about is the same, such as gender stereotypes, clever wordplay, social status issues, and relationships with family. One beautiful scene in this film is when Godfrey walks into a room where Carlo is acting like a monkey, jumping on furniture and climbing on the door frames, Irene is bawling her eyes out on the couch, and her mother is rambling on, off on one of her tangents. The expression on Godfrey's face during this scene is absolutely priceless. You can see the bafflement and feeling of "what on earth is going on in here?" Written on his face. This was definitely my favorite scene during the film. I enjoyed this very much, would watch it again, and would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MY MAN GODFREY (Universal, 1936), directed by Gregory LaCava, stars William Powell (on loan from MGM) and Carole Lombard (on loan from Paramount), in one of the true classic "screwball comedies" of the Depression-era 1930s. Though butlers as leading characters were not relatively new to the screen, with Charles Laughton as the boorish gentleman's gentleman in RUGGLES OF RED GAP (Paramount, 1935) being a prime recent example, MY MAN GODFREY is presented in true Powell style: articulate, debonair, and with a wonderful sense of humor. And a sense of humor is what Godfrey needs having to cope with a screwy family such as the Bullocks as his employers.Following the opening title credits presented through flickering lights on the side of buildings near the riverboat docks, the story introduces Godfrey Parke (William Powell) as an educated hobo, known to his fellow tramps as "Duke," taking up residence at City Dump 32, East River, Sutton Place. Moments later he's approached by Cornelia Bullock (Gail Patrick) and her beau, George (Robert Light), competing against her sister, Irene (Carole Lombard), on a scavenger hunt out to bring back a "forgotten man" to a society party being held at the Marder-Ritz Hotel. Regardless of Cornelia offering him $5 to go back with them, Godfrey, offended by their nature, angrily chases her away. As for Irene, she remains to converse with the bearded man. Godfrey, who has grown to like the spirited young girl, agrees to help Irene win over her snobbish sister. For doing her such a great service, Irene repays Godfrey by offering him a job as the family's full-time butler, which he accepts. Once at the Bullock mansion, 1011 5th Avenue, Godfrey, now clean shaving and sporting a new suit of clothes, is introduced to Molly (Jean Dixon), the downstairs maid, before seeing what he's gotten himself into. After encountering with other Bullocks, including the sensible Wall Street tycoon, Alexander (Eugene Palette); his scatterbrained wife, Angelica (Alice Brady) accompanied by Carlo (Mischa Auer), her protégé, Godfrey's true challenge turns out to be more than he bargained for, especially Irene. All goes well until Godfrey is met with Thomas Gray (Alan Mowbray), his former Harvard University classmate, at the Bullock social functions, followed by Godfrey being placed under suspicion by detectives for the theft of Cornelia's most valuable possession, her pearl necklace. With Powell and Lombard, Brady and Auer all nominated for Academy Awards for their roles, there were no wins. The real winner is the legacy of the film itself. With Powell being funny within himself in a straightforward performance, Lombard gathers much attention with her wacky portrayal of a scatterbrained heiress. Palette as the only normal member of the family is an honorable mention, along with Brady holding her own as the dim-witted mother who would never say anything behind anyone she would say to their face. Patrick (also on loan from Paramount), offers a believable account of a spoiled daughter by making life difficult for those around her. Regardless of troublesome circumstances, it is Godfrey who benefits by it.The success to MY MAN GODFREY no doubt lead to carbon copies over the years, especially one titled THE BARONESS AND THE BUTLER (20th-Fox, 1938) featuring none-other than William Powell once again playing a butler. Universal's updated remake, MY MAN GODFREY (1957) starring David Niven and June Allyson consisted of few alterations, namely changing the Godfrey character to Austrian diplomat illegally living in the United States assuming a job as butler to avoid deportation. The film itself has some fine moments, but can't compare to the imaginative screenplay by Morrie Ryskind and Gregory LaCava's skilled direction. Out of the television markets since the late 1960s, the original MY MAN GODFREY surfaced on once again beginning in late 1979 on public television stations. Having fallen to public domain, it became available on numerous video cassette distributors, ranging from good to bad to colorized prints. Cable television had taken its toll with its broadcasts over the years, ranging from American Movie Classics (1992) to Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere March 26, 2002) where excellent prints to this comedy classic can be seen in all its glory. Though Powell and Lombard would give further exceptional roles later on in their careers, their joint legacy should rest with MY MAN GODFREY. (***1/2)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic screwball comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a scavenger hunt for a forgotten man rich ditzy Irene Bullock (Carole Lombard) meets homeless man Godfrey (William Powell) at the city dump. She falls in love with him and hires him to be a butler for her crazy family. Numerous complications occur.I caught this multiple times at a revival cinema back in the 1990s. I loved it but the print was always in pretty poor shape. The picture was out of focus and the print "jumped" a few times. However TCM just showed it in a pristine print from the UCLA Film Archives so I was finally able to see it in all its glory. This is a very funny and well-done screwball comedy considered to be a classic. The acting is good, the script sharp and it moves quickly. However (for me) it just stops short of becoming a classic for one reason.SPOILERS AHEAD!!! Halfway through we find that Godfrey actually comes from a very wealthy family and, by choice, chose to be a forgotten man. This sort of weakens the message that the poor people are better than the rich. END SPOILER!!!!That aside it still isn't great. Lombard is just OK in her role and Gail Patrick is WAY too mean as her sister. Still it's a very good movie and a perfect example of a screwball comedy. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know that any screwball comedy could be successful if it deals with the Great Depression. It has to be very clever. The Depression lasted almost ten years and put one third of the labor force out of work at a time of very few safety nets. "Sullivan's Travels" succeeds; "My Man Godfrey" only partially.It's not just that the subject is serious. I mean, after all, Poland was invaded and practically destroyed by Hitler and Ernst Lubitsch made a fine and funny movie out of it. It's that the script for "My Man Godrey" isn't as funny as it might be. It's dizzyingly fast and there are a lot of barbs thrown around and the plot sounds interesting but the problem with the laughs isn't that they're sour but that they're infrequent.The situation hold promise. A loony rich family on a scavenger hunt picks up the forlorn-looking William Powell at a garbage dump in New York. On the impulse of the younger daughter, Carole Lombard, Powell is hired as the family butler. The raggedy Powell decides to be the most polite, dignified, and awesomely grammatical butler the family has ever had. It's easy for him. This is a latent status movie. He's really Godrey Park, graduate of Harvard, scion of the Parks of Boston who are "easily disgraced." In other words, he knows his way around the canapés.The introduction draws us in. It has Powell among the bums living in a Hooverville. He looks like all the others. But he sounds exactly like William Powell, snapping out elegant locutions. But the spell doesn't last long. He's introduced to the Bullock family. They're all silly. One of the daughters is full of spite and hate. Mischa Auer is a permanent guest in the mansion who imitates gorillas, plays the piano, and eats. The pebbly voiced Eugene Palette is pater familias who complains about having to give sixty percent of his income to the government. (He'd be happy today; the highest rate is only thirty-five percent and nobody pays it.) The silliness, already established, goes on more or less for the remainder of the movie, interrupted only by an amusing sequence in which Powell gets drunk with his Harvard classmate Alan Mowbray, and by a plot to help Powell's old buddies in the garbage dump.Powell is fine. This was his kind of role, as was The Thin Man. Carole Lombard is empty headed but the part could have been played by almost anyone. She's okay but I've never understood the praise heaped on her.You know, this improves with repeated viewings. It's not hilarious, like "Bringing Up Baby." There are no loose leopards or dogs burying bones. The wit is all in the dialog, and it has a quite explicit but digestible social message, which doesn't hurt it at all. I think I'll bump my rating up a notch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irene Has Issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the comedic humor of the film but I was often bored at times. The best part was Irene who made the movie. Her antics were hilarious but she needs counseling immediately. I did like the social message which I found to be that poor or homeless people aren't poor because they choose to be or because it's their fault. I like what Godfrey does at the end to help poor people out, but something I didn't like about the end was how he marries Irene. She was the most funny but like I said, she has issues and I can't understand why anyone would allow that marriage to happen. It did make an OK ending though; I don't know what other ending I would've liked more.</fullReview>

The message to be learned in it is revealed at the end by Godfrey. Godfreys quote " the only difference between a man and a derelict is a job.." makes a ton of sense. This was film dying the great depression and it does a great job portraying the inequality of the rich an poor. Godfrey teaches the family how in times of need help someone get back on their feet and karma has a way of helping you out. The picture is great and the movement of the cameras is very smooth. It's not bouncy even with the rate it has to follow for the crazy characters. This movie is a must see. It keeps you laughing throughout.

		<fullReview>The funniest black and white movie of its kind. Godfrey is a hilarious character who is a great example of how to be hilarious without having to be vulgar or disgusting. There is a perfect balance between the amount of insanity in the family and the sanity showed by Godfrey and sometimes the father. The message of equality between the forgotten men and the rich people is very heartwarming and makes you feel like you might have actually learned something from a comedy for once. One person who stands out is the actor who plays Carlo who is hilarious and whose facial expressions made me crack up every time. The end did disappoint me however, I wished I could enter the movie and save Godfrey from the crazy girl, he deserves a more dignified ending.</fullReview>

I've never seen a movie with him in it till this one and now I want to see a lot more. His levelheadedness among a whole group of "nitwits" really amplify the craziness of the other characters, while at the same time he is funny himself.

It was fast paced, sophisticated, and filled with witty dialogue, humorous situations, and good writing. The acting was often over the top, especially in Carole Lombard's performance as the madcap and sometimes hysterical sociallite, but this just added to the movie's charm.It's also a movie with heart and timeless social commentary about the value of each person, regardless of their social status, as well as the importance of making a difference in the world. It also pointed out that simply being rich doesn't entitle a person to look down on people who have less then they do because we all have worth.This film was my introduction to the screwball comedy genre, and I really enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone looking to see a fun movie.</fullReview>

Irene, the main woman character was a very clingy and over the top woman who was almost obsessed with a man named Godfrey that she met and soon helped him become the butler for her family. Her love for Godfrey is so powerful that she over emphasizes her feelings and emotions for him to notice her. She constantly follows him around and says his name many times.

		<fullReview>My man Godfrey is a wonderful screwball comedy. Godfrey is a vagrant that is hired as a butler by a rich family that is genuinely insane! Every character in this film contributes in their own way to a great overall finished product. Godfrey ( William Powell) is the star of the film with his wit, dry delivery, and impeccable comedic timing. He delivered a few lines that had me reaching for a pen so I could write down what he said while it was still fresh in my mind. His performance was that memorable. The strength of My Man Godfrey was that it was more than just a comedy. It also delivered a strong social message about the have's and have not's in society. The film demands that you look beneath the situation people are in and try to see who they truly are as individuals, and how they came to be in their present situations, rich and poor alike. This film is timeless in the truest sense. The jokes feel fresh, the characters familiar, and the message is a strong one that is as relevant today as it was in 1936 when it was filmed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this family. The Bullocks household is filled with characters who are often outrageous, obnoxious, or oblivious. And then there's William Powell's character, a smooth, fast-talking, intelligent man, who's stuck in the middle of it all as the family's new butler. It's a fast comedy with lots of neat camera angles, sensational dialogue, and a soundly-structured plot. I like how Godfrey interacts with each character in the same sophisticated manner in his voice, while his emotions towards each person is different. I also like how he swoops in and out of scenes where other people are talking and he's not even part of the initial conversation. It makes Godfrey seem just as mysterious as people make him out to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this movie has some entertaining characters and scenes, I think in all this movie is kind of a ride down the hysterical line. Carole Lombard is so crazy, in fact, that it started becoming annoying to me near the end of the movie but, that doesn't deter from the fact that this movie is pretty well done. Being shot mostly inside a house, there is a feeling of perhaps claustrophobia or perhaps closeness to the family. Of course with all the close spacing means there is snappy camera work to get all the right angles. A lot of it was pretty entertaining, everyone in the family suddenly bursting with emotion and arguing with each other, while Godfrey merely stands by, does his job, and stays pretty quiet about it. I do feel like the ending was maybe a little rushed, or perhaps not planned well. Silly movie, perhaps the moral of the story is, Godfrey would have rather been left "forgotten" than picked up by this crazy family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over the top.. but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, this film was my first incursion into the oft-zany world of the screwball comedy. I have to admit that while I was far from disappointed, I was not necessarily fulfilled either. I understood that it is in keeping with the plot/style of this genre of film for things to be exceedingly funny, and over the top; however, for me it was a little too over the top. From the films opening scene, with Cordelia and Irene happening upon Godfrey in the dump, and the ensuing antics that followed, I was interested to see where this film would lead. As i stated earlier, I was not disappointed with this film, however, it was at the point that Godfrey shows up to be the Bullock's new butler that I was taken aback, for lack of a better word, by the families antics. All of the Bullock family, to include Mrs. Bullocks protégé Carlo, provide thoughtful, yet seemingly flat performances. Given that this film is a comedy, I understand that the characters are not supposed to especially "deep," but nonetheless, I was left with a feeling of wanting more out of them besides Cordelia's underhanded revenge tactics and aloofness, and Irene's pure and seemingly utter craziness, no matter how well place her intentions are. On the contrary to the acting being a tad disappointing, was the outstanding camera work and cinematography that the film presented the viewer with. For instance, the scene in which Godfrey is for the first serving the Bullock's breakfast is extremely well shot, as the camera follows him up and down the spiral stairs with a smooth fluidity. Another particularly enjoyable aspect of the film was the message that was at the films core: anyone, given a chance and the right circumstances, can change for the better. This is in no way better exemplified then when Godfrey says to his friend from Boston, " You know what the difference between a good man and a derelict is," and of course the answer is " A job." While this certainly speaks volumes to the ideas and prevailing mentality of the time, it also reveals the dedication and work ethic that many men who had long since unemployed due to the great depression possessed. Obviously now, in this day and age, it is commonly believed that there are many factors which contribute to extended periods of unemployment other than one's own sense of laziness, but I know back then that that was the common belief. This film does an excellent job of trying to dis spell that myth. Overall, this film was very enjoyable save for the unexpected, yet somewhat cliché ending in which Godfrey and Irene wind up getting married. While you do not see the act actually take place, the viewer is clearly lead to believe that is the result. I would definitely recommend this film to any of my peers, and I look forward to watching another screwball comedy soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had my doubts about this movie when it first started. The overall silly nature of Irene and Cornelia (two of the main characters)turned me off and I had a feeling that I was about to view the comic taste of some old time rich stiff. My expectations were widely off. This "screwball comedy" lives up to every sense of the name but does so with an almost elegant manner. As previously mentioned, when the movie started I was under the impression that this movie would be a lull, however, there are many points throughout the movie where the seemingly knit-witted characters subtly dispense knowledge and teach lessons. The girl Irene is far different from her family in that although she sees the jobless lower class men as different from herself, she does not treat them as such. I believe she only offers Godfrey the butler job out of admiration and infatuation, but you can see she is kind at heart. Godfrey, although never coming off as innocuous, tells his 'host' family, if you will, that by giving him the opportunity to hold a job they have helped to define his character and thus find out the man he had the ability to become all along, all he needed was an opportunity to take advantage of; and because of their kind gesture, he repays the family with an even greater one in their time of need... It is messages such as this spread throughout this seemingly innocent and silly movie that give it a little more life and relevancy. Even though it takes place during the depression years, we as viewers can still relate to this message today. Great film, very funny, very entertaining, great story (True story?). See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vital work in the opus of American cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To understand American cinema you must watch films like My Man Godfrey. Set in the Great Depression, it is a stinging rebuke of the narcissism of the rich, and a call for compassion for the millions of hungry, homeless, unemployed Americans, represented by Godfrey, who lives in a dump. It is cinema as social criticism, as a call for social change, as a collective social conscience. There are foreigners who have some mighty strange beliefs about America. When they see a war film portraying brave American soldiers, they dismiss it as "patriotic propaganda," as though movies were somehow produced by a Ministry of Propaganda. I encountered a Chinese woman online who responded to criticism of Chinese government censorship of the news media with the blanket assertion that all countries are the same, that all media was secretly an arm of government propaganda, especially America. In short, America is one vast secret Conspiracy, manipulated by the rich. But why would such a Conspiracy produce propaganda that portrays the rich as selfish, stupid and crazy? The wealthy Bullocks are incapable of managing their own lives, much less managing a vast Conspiracy. Oh, I get it! It's all part of a vast Conspiracy to convince the public that the rich are too stupid to manage a Conspiracy -- or so some paranoid foreigners might conclude.My Man Godfrey was released by Universal Pictures. Was Universal part of The Conspiracy? Hardly. The beauty of the Hollywood studios in the old days was that they had the power and wealth to be independent of the moneyed establishment, and so were free to criticize it. The studios' motives were first to sell tickets, but also to produce films of artistic and social merit, and sometimes to directly challenge the status quo. It was precisely this independent streak that got Hollywood into hot water during the anti-Communist witch hunts of the McCarthy-HUAC era. Anyone who knows American history understands this. And anyone who watches films like My Man Godfrey, Sullivan's Travels, Meet John Doe, or High Noon can see it with their own eyes.There are closed-minded chauvinistic foreigners who dismiss American cinema as mindless, violent, chauvinistic entertainment of no quality. It depends what you watch. The social criticism as entertainment you see in Godfrey can be found in American films of all eras, and is what makes American cinema distinct. There has probably been far less cinematic self- criticism in other countries, historically, though that has changed in some places, though hardly all. Godfrey is 75 years old, and a for many, a forgotten film set in a forgotten era about a forgotten man played by a forgotten star, William Powell. But it deserves to be remembered. The Thin Man series propelled Powell to stardom. His classy, understated style was perfect for Godfrey. Fittingly, Powell delivered his swan song in another powerful social commentary as entertainment film, Mr. Roberts.Some dismiss Godfrey as unrealistic, and given the improbable plot it should be viewed as a fable. But having known some Park Avenue brats, I can say the characters are not so impossible as they seem. My Man Godfrey is a screwball comedy, but when the comedy wears off with subsequent viewings, what is left is commentary that stands the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Definitive Screwball Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey," directed by Gregory LaCava, is a timeless comedy that is incredibly entertaining and absurdly funny. The film itself is traditionally screwball for a variety of reasons. the plot itself is slightly obscene in that it is the story of a bum who becomes a butler of a rich family and eventually marries their daughter. The screwball aspect goes on when discussing the characters themselves who often display behavior that an average person would avoid due to embarrassment. The characters are often speaking their mind fully and seriously reacting to obvious sarcasm. Godfrey is used incredibly well for comedic effect as he acts as the only reasonable voice, sometimes speaking how the audience feels. This unnatural behavior combined with the unpredictability of the story and the ludicrous personalities of the characters clashing with Godfrey makes for a definitive screwball comedy experience. The film also attaches a life lesson teaching us that the only real difference between a derelict and a man is a job. This belief is made more sound when taking into account the Great Depression which occurred whilst the film was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic screwball comedy with a touch of social commentary. An old style funny with excessive emphasis on avoiding all of the situations deemed not allowed to be viewed by the public due to the Hayes Code. The movie provides non stop laughs and a few unexpected twists. I really liked this movie because it brought up the fact that men are men with or with out jobs, with or without a house, and no matter what their social status may be. I really enjoyed the smart witty humor that Godfrey brought to the table. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good old fashioned humor with a good message that is not pushed on the viewer and although it is over 50 years old it is still very relevant today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Screwball Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a brilliant, fast-paced, and witty comedy, with an excellent portrayal and social commentary on the rich-poor dynamic. The entire length of the film is based on the interaction of an erratic, childish, rich family, and a witty and proper homeless man turned butler. Carole Lombard is the primary focus of the rich family and is the quintessential screwball. Her performance is only surpassed by William Powell as the butler. His dry wit delivery of hilarious lines is outstanding. My Man Godfrey inspires hope for the unfortunate during the depression, and at the very least is a very funny movie to people of all circumstances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today's comedies simply aren't as good as those brought to us from really 1920 (if you wan to include silents by Keaton and Chaplin) through to maybe the late 50's. We get the occasional comedic gem from names you're familiar with like Woody Allen (Annie Hall), Jack Nicholson (Cuckoo's Nest) and Dustin Hoffman (The Graduate) but My Man Godfrey is one of the funniest American films ever made and it was released at the height of the Great Depression, talk about screwball huh? The film features brutally funny performances from William Powell who played the ever straight shooting Godfrey, Carole Lumbard the lovable yet ditsy Irene, the vindictive and manipulative Cornelia played by Gail Patrick and Alice Brady as Angelica, Cornelia and Irene's mother. In my opinion she and her "protege" Carlo (Mischa Auer) steal the spotlight from Powell and Lumbard. Carlo pegs himself as a starving artist (ironic because he seems to eat everything in sight)and Angelica supports his redundant banging out of the same notes on the piano day in and day out.Through witty and romantic comedy this film does it's job by taking people out of their every day lives during the depression to watch a feel good movie that could've made the saddest sack of the 30's laugh out loud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William Powell Gets Reacquainted with Carole Lombard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the Great Depression, unaffected Carole Lombard (as Irene Bullock) and snooty sister Gail Patrick (as Cornelia) go to the city dump on a scavenger hunt to pick up a bum. The wealthy socialites find a homeless and penniless William Powell (as Godfrey Smith) living among the garbage. Although he looks disheveled, Mr. Powell is no ordinary tramp. Seeming to hide an urbane manner, he finally agrees to be Ms. Lombard's bum, for five dollars. Powell is the hit of the party, and Lombard hires him to be her wealthy family's butler.Serving hungover matriarch Alice Brady (as Angelica) and blustery husband Eugene Palette (Alexander), Powell ensconces himself in the family, which includes houseguest Mischa Auer (as Carlo) and maid Jean Dixon (as Molly). Powell arouses the female members of the entertaining cast, with Lombard clearly falling head over heels with her tramp-turned-butler.Eventually, Powell's secret is discovered... The co-stars were divorced for several years, but Powell and Lombard work wonders with these characters - the idly rich socialite and "Forgotten Man" (President Franklin D. Roosevelt's take on the Depression's downtrodden). That their cast-mates do well is nicely evidenced by the "Academy Awards" nominations for Ms Brady's ditzy mother and Mr. Auer's zany houseguest, in the newly introduced "Supporting" categories. Key to the successful characterizations is "Best Director" Gregory La Cava. There were also deserved nominations for Marx Brothers writer Morrie Ryskind and novelist Eric Hatch.******** My Man Godfrey (9/6/36) Gregory La Cava ~ William Powell, Carole Lombard, Alice Brady, Mischa Auer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic on many levels, even 75 years later. Personalities remain the same and although this is clearly a satire and extreme, some of the types portrayed still are in existence, albeit with different backdrops. Perhaps the only thing that has changed is that the "dump", which is just north of the 59th street bridge, between York Avenue and the East River is now very developed and pricey real estate. I NEED HELP WITH ONE THING: Unfortunately, I can't remember the exact words spoken by Godfrey which express a profound truth always, and especially nowadays. Anyone out there who can fill in the blank?: "The only difference between a______ and a man is a job" - a powerful line set in a movie like this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Man Godfrey (1936)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed My Man Godfrey(1936), but not so much as a comedy. There were a whole lot of over the top gestures and funny character lines, but i found the subtle actions more satisfying. I didn't find myself rolling on the floor laughing. Instead I took more of an interest in the way Godfrey surprised everyone with being wise and humble, and the important lesson he teaches everyone in the end. I'll admit I was surprised at the end when Godfrey and Irene got married. i thought the story would have been over after Godfrey left the house and his butler job, but i guess there is always room to fit in a love story. Overall, I liked the film and the underlying social message to help those less fortunate than yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy with a social message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word "dysfunctional" seems hardly adequate to describe the family in Gregory LaCava's My Man Godfrey, a comedy which may perhaps portray one of the strangest family dynamics on screen. The film itself is considered to be one of the best examples of a "screwball comedy," juxtaposing the rich the poor through the two focal characters (and their subsequent comedic romantic entanglement.) The movie however, transcends this basic lighthearted storyline and manages to present audiences with a portrait of what life was like for those less fortunate, for those hit hard by the depression. The film 's social commentary portrays the rich (as depicted by Irene and her family) as childish, self-indulgent and petty while the poor (portrayed mostly by Powell's "hobo" character) are hardworking, honest and thoughtful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gregory La Cava has made a classic movie, that will forever be considered one of the greatest screwball comedies of all time. Such a simple, unconventional story, with well complimented plot points, but so interesting and enjoyable to watch. The movie had so much to it's advantage, sophisticated mise-en-scene, outstanding camera angles. Also a well thought out story that is so simplistic, but so unique. This movie tells a story of unconventional humor and Godfrey's determination to live up to be more then he was before, it also tells a back story of love and romance that help the narrative story progress in such a natural way. But at the end the romance ends up dominating the entire film, interesting. The camera as a narrator to us remains very omniscient in what emotions are being conveyed; however, in contrast Godfrey the butler is such a restricted character. I think because he's an "inferior" person working as a butler to a family who is considered of noble superiority, Godfrey keeps most of his emotions to himself. That being said as an audience we don't really feel all of his true emotions until the end of the movie when he realizes he loves Irene. Which essentially makes William Powell's character Godfrey quite round in terms of development and change. Another interesting thing to add is that although for most of the movie Godfrey is such a restricted major character, we feel emotions and mood from almost every other character in the movie, even the female maid has emotions that we perceive. But we can't get to Godfrey until later. I found that very intriguing. So all in all this was an excellent movie another one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie because of its social commentary underneath all of the exaggerated stereotypes, which expressed the vast difference between the poor and the rich during the Great Depression of the 1930s. This juxtaposition between the rich and the poor is what makes this humorous film a true screwball. I also appreciated the dialogue that occurred within the film particularly from the mother in the scene in which Godfrey brings her breakfast, and all of Irene's dialogue as it was nonsensical and proved hilarious compared to Godfrey's sensible character. The dialogue made the comedy relatable and easy to laugh at making the film very fluid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heavy-handed social message but the comedy is delightful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Powell and Carole Lombard shine brilliantly in director Gregory La Cava's screwball comedy, My Man Godfrey(1936). The terrific performances by the leads are matched across-the-board by an equally brilliant ensemble cast that never misses a beat throughout the entire picture. In addition to the great comic writing and performances the family's mansion set provides the perfect playground for the diverse cast of characters, the costumes brilliantly express the incongruity between the luxury the family lives in and the devastation of the depression around them and the filming and lighting of the piece sets a lovely and occasionally complex tone. The only drawback of the film was it's expression of the important social message of homelessness and poverty. I felt that the film had succeeded in making the point without the use of the heavy-handed tagline "The only difference between a derelict and a man is a job." The film did such a wonderful job of incorporating the social message of the piece with the comedy to that point that it seemed terribly out of place for the film to get serious all of a sudden. With that said, My Man Godfrey(1936) is truly a great pure comedy that is absolutely full of laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My man Godfrey ( 1936)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic screwball comedy. The plot was very unpredictable and random. In one scene the wealthy people are doing a scavenger hunt which was very chaotic. The scene included goats and monkeys. I thought this was very funny. The daughters were mischievous. Cornelia's character was the antagonist.Planting a robbery on Godfrey showed prejudice towards people of his class. Little did they know Godfrey chose to live life like he did. You cannot judge someone by their social status but by their character. His was very liked. The women including the made all have a sort of thing for his character. I enjoyed the attraction between the two round characters Godfrey and Irene. They were two people you wouldn't think would get together and they in fact did. I thought her character was a riot. She had tantrums like a child and was very gullible. The overall filming was great. It captured Godfrey's poise. In one scene he is walking up the long stair case and the camera flows nicely with him. This was good entertainment done right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stellar Performance by William Powell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say I've seen many of William Powell's films but of the ones I have I've enjoyed and "My Man Godfrey" is no exception. I would even go as far to say that "My Man Godfrey" is my favorite of his works because it's just an all to perfect example of that Great Depression Era screw ball comedy film. This movie keeps you laughing from start to finish with very few truly serious moments, but even in these times you still find your self laughing thanks to the witty dialog of Morrie Ryskind. In it's time it showed the tragedy that many faced but all the while showing Americans that change is on the horizon and things will get better. It also made the rich out to be senseless fools which I presume many American's ,down on their luck at the time, found hilarious. That's not to say I didn't find it funny it's just that I believe that the films humor impacted the audience much more when the film was topical. It says a lot about a film that can still make people laugh in this day and age where basically anything not bathing in inappropriateness isn't so much as chuckled at. For this I give "My Man Goodfrey" a 9 out of 10 and highly recommend everyone to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Man Godfrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly enjoyed this film. It is considered to be a "screwball" comedy because it is all over the place (in a good way). I think the main social point is that just because you are wealthy doesn't mean you're intelligent. For example, the beginning scene where the wealthy people are having a scavenger hunt, they are portrayed as immature and childlike. This point is made clear when Godfrey, the "forgotten man" makes his speech and proceeds to call everyone participating an "empty -headed nit wit". This social point is expressed even further through all of the outrageous events that take place when Godfrey becomes butler. Ultimately, Godfrey turned his life around, and fell in love with someone who he wasn't "supposed to". The movie as a whole was wonderful; it was humorous, yet elegant and beautiful at the same time. Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I highly enjoyed "My Man Godfrey." It was my first screwball comedy and i'm glad it was. It's a brilliant way of poking fun at the upper class world during this time. Making them look like fools with a most ridiculous scavenger hunt to start the movie. Its great to see the boundaries between employer's and the help being crossed or nearly crossed. An unbelievably funny cast make every interaction hilarious to the point where one loses their breath in laughter. William Powell was extraordinary in his role as Godfrey. he was very witty in being rude, courteous, and blunt all at once. though it is a comedy the film still portrays important life lessons worth paying attention to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching a number of movies, screwball or not, from the black and white era, this is by far my favorite so far. It's very well rounded from start to finish, and though a little over-the-top from time to time, it knows when to take a break. All the actors did a great job. Carole Lombard and her sister complemented Powell nicely. It's obvious that they wanted to hit on a number of social issues at the time, such as the Great Depression, and it did a good job of it. I had also never heard the term "the forgotten man" but it makes sense when talking about the homeless who were simply in that position because they couldn't get a job... not because of drug or alcohol reasons. It was also a fairly light-hearted way of shedding light on the ignorance of the rich as opposed to making them just look evil and uncaring.</fullReview>

It showed me not everyone is in it for themselves and when people really need someone, there will always be someone there to help them.

		<shortDescription>Hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great old movie, that I cannot believe I have not seen up until recently. I actually watched it twice. I was laughing the whole time!Irene is a cute sort of funny, but also very enthusiastic. She's meets a bum when here and her sister are in the middle of a game. She ends up hiring him as the butler and falling in love with him.It seems like he is not interested in her at all throughout the entire movie and she seems almost pathetically attached, but in a humorous way. This is a classic screwball because it focuses on how a butler and a rich girl becoming a couple is sort of a forbidden thing, because they come from different worlds. Little do we know that Godfrey actually comes from the same world as her, but the Great Depression impacted his life in a profound way.If you are in the mood for laughing you head off and watching a classic old movie at the same time, then I highly recommend that you go and watch this movie, if you haven't already. If you have seen it, watch it again, because you will forget how much you laughed the first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't tell you how much I loved this film. My Man Godfrey is well written, meaningful and hilarious. With many of the older films, I am usually skeptical of the quality of the humor. This movie fulfilled my expectations and then some. The humor is still sharp and relevant.Although my one complaint would be that no one questions how well spoken Godfrey is for a homeless man. I also became more interested in the character of Cornelia than Irene. Cornelia and Godfrey had great chemistry, which would lead a viewer to think they would end up together. The character of Irene was very funny, but I often felt she was an awful choice for a romantic interest.Regardless of the tiny imperfections, My Man Godfrey is a very funny and delightful comedy. I would highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey" is an excellent example of an early "screwball" comedy. This type of movie is one of the reasons Hollywood was able to survive during the period when the code was being enforced.Comedies like this allowed the audience to be entertained while not being crude or offensive. In my opinion more production companies today should challenge themselves to make more movies like this one. It also showed how the rich viewed the poor and how the poor viewed the rich, in an extremely exaggerated way, during The Great Depression. At one point or another all of the actors conducted themselves in a ridiculous manner. Take Irene(Carole Lombard)for example,he character acts like an over emotional child throughout almost the entire movie. This sort of acting is what makes "screwball" comedies so successful. We know nobody would actually act like that and thats why it is so funny.</fullReview>

William Powell's character is as you would say normal but with a hint of elegance.Even with him being a "Forgotten man" in other words a bum you can tell he has more class then most of the rich people within the movie. In the movie you learn to like the forgotten men more than the rich people. They portray the rich class in the movie as stupid and being drunk all the time. They show the bums to be hardworking. I really liked the movie as a whole because it shows a man that is given a second chance and he actually saves the family he took in from going bankrupt. I really thought it was a good twist to the end of the movie. Also with the ending i thought it was a funny closer how she puts it into his head OK we will get married and there is a minister right there and how funny that Godfrey was denying the whole idea</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed My Man Godfrey. What a great comedy, just made me laugh. definitely a great screwball comedy for sure. there were chaotic parts of the movie, but it never once got overwhelming or hard to follow. just a great story, with an excellent plot, with some interesting twists. For example when Godfrey has invested his own money, and gives it to the family so they don't end up in the "poorhouse." The whining of the Bullock women went from funny to somewhat annoying though. I was struck by the sets of this movie as well. Things like extremely large cases, beautiful doors, just very expensive looking details to help with the believability. There's extremely convincing acting all around. but William Powell was most impressive. I also enjoyed the message I perceived from this film. To not judge a book by its cover, you never know who you are dealing with. It depicts how everyone in society has their issues, even the wealthy. That just because someone is homeless, or doesn't have much, doesn't mean their not a fabulous person or well educated and so on. I kind of felt like the Bullock family, at least the women were being portrayed as, well dumb, as well as being rich. Entertaining! Enjoyable! See it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, I thought this movie was excellent. I found it do be classy but at the same time hilarious. When starting to watch this movie, I thought it was going to be a little bit silly in some parts and deal with more serious issues. I was pleasantly surprised with all of the chaos and insanity that happened within the family. Now, the movie did deal with some serious issues with "The Forgotten Men", as the two sisters called them, of men that do not live in society but are just kind of living on the sidelines. The actors and actresses that played each role, I felt, were perfect for what they played. For instance, Irene was the younger sister who felt no one would listen to her and wanted attention versus her older sister Cornelia who was more casual about things instead of making a production out of things. The whole family was insane but it seemed they would be so put together because they had money, they lived in such a nice home and so many opportunities. I was not expecting things to be the way they were. All in all, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, it has a little bit of everything in there for anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a screwball comedy for sure. The humor of the Bullock family is just genius. It shows that not all the rich are so perfect after all, they have their flaws too. This in a time of depression was an uplifting thing for the audience to see. Godfrey was once a man living in a city dump, and then was a honorable butler. It seemed as though when Godfrey put on his suit and became butler, he turned into a man. His dialogue was more refined, his mannerisms were more delicate, and overall he became more proper.The humor of the ladies of the Bullock family was incredible. After having a crush on Godfrey, Irene became more and more ridiculous, with her fainting and crying. The mother also seemed nearly clueless as to what is going on. If you enjoy outrageous humor, and dramatic gestures, this is definitely a movie for you.</fullReview>

Powell can downplay anything and its still fantastic. Lombard is adorable as the "love interest" who wont leave Godfrey alone. The rest of the supporting cast are all solid. This is a film with a crazy story about crazy people yet none of them go over the top, its crazy yet it reaches the perfect amount of crazy and never steps over that line. The stand out of the supporting cast in my opinion is Alice Brady who plays the mother, she has one of the zanier roles in the film and plays it to perfection, her comedic timing is impeccable. The cinematography in this film is amazing, the camera moves like another character waltzing through the set. The lighting of the film is very soft, it is very pretty. The sets are beautiful and massive, if the actors weren't so damn good they could have easily been lost in them. The acting, the lighting, the camera work and the set design all added together equal up to an explosion of high class comedy which is not to be missed. See this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Man Godfrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The screwball comedy, My Man Godfrey, was not really a film that I was into. There was always a lot going on all the time so giving your complete attention is necessary. The rich family was very annoying. I did not like their tone of voice which made the movie even worse. I also did not like their snooty attitudes and how they dealt with problems. Although I did not like the movie, I loved the morals learned in this film. The fact that a "forgotten man" living in a dump can come from a high class society and not be miserable intrigued me. When Godfrey made The Dump it made me so happy that the poor people now had somewhere to go. I hated that Godfrey and the girl ended up getting married. I do not think that this would really be the way it would have ended. I believe Godfrey would have left and stayed away from that immature, irrational, love sick girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My opinion on the film "My Man Godfrey" is that it was a cute and fun film but probably only worth seeing one or two times, after that it probably gets old. The film was very good on the other hand, the plot made sense and the characters pretty much all had depth to them. There's a lot going on in the film so it's important to stay intune with the story line or else it just seems like a silly comedy that nothing really important happens in. "My Man Godfrey" is considered a "screwball" comedy and it's definitely apparent in the film that this is true, some of the turnarounds in the film really made sense and others were just for comedic purposes. Carole Lombard plays a ditzy socialite and William Powell plays the "forgotten man" of sorts, she takes him in as her butler and soon realizes that she's in love with him resulting in a crazy screwball comedy. This film may not have been at the top of my list of movies to see but it's well worth it for a carefree laugh once in a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. My Man Godfrey is supper funny and has an interesting plot. The main character is really entertaining because of his hilarious, witty way of speaking, which is interesting because when you're first introduced to him he looks like a homeless bum and you don't expect him to be so intelligent. It is really fun to watch Godfrey interact with his employers, the Bullocks, which is where most of the comedy in the movie comes from. The movie also has a great message. It touches on assumptions made about social classes and the people in them. Wealthy or high class people are often expected to be very prim and proper, however the film shows you a family that is anything but. The Bullcock family is crazy and dysfunctional, and most members of the family engage in reckless behavior. In the movie Godfrey says "The only difference between a derelict and a man is a job." The film points out that poor and homeless people aren't inferior to anyone else just because they have less money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey" was a classic comedy in the 1930's. William Powell really does an excellent job playing Godfrey. How the family came to meet Godfrey was interesting, they were playing a scavenger hunt, Godfrey was very interested in what a "scavenger hunt" was. He defiantly had me fooled in the beginning where he seemed not that educated. As the movie goes along you can see how love was coming into play, the daughter is just so in love with Godfrey. In the beginning no one seemed to like him at all besides for the daughter, she's the only one that stuck up for him. But as the movie went along i thought it was funny how everyone ended up loving him, and did not want him to leave. This film defiantly gave me a laugh and I'm very fortunate to have been given the chance to see it. The whole cast played their part so well and you really got caught up in this film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was plesantly surprised at how funny this movie was; I'm not into "dirty" funny movies and this was everything but that. There was a love story, a problem, a wonderful solution and everything flowed very well. It almost gave me a headache in a weird way with everything that was going on and it was even crazier thinking that people sat down and actually wrote out everything these people said and did. It was a very lively movie and the farthest thing from boring it kept you on your toes and made you want to keep watching. All the characters fit there parts perfectly. One of my favorite characters was the mother and after thinking about it i feel as if her part would be a hard one to play with her absent mindedness and yet classy ways even when she was completely drunk and scatter brained. Another thing i found interesting was how widely accepted drinking alcohol was back then more so for the women, one of the first scenes was of a group of wealthy people completely drunk and running around crazy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My man Godfrey is an early comedy during the hays code era. the movie stars William Powell and Carole Lombard. The movie portrays the lives of the wealthy from a bums eyes. Godfrey played by Powell is a mysterious ans modest man with a history not typical of his characters roll which is a bum. Godfrey's eyes were opened to a new light one night down by the river after crossing paths with men who really "lived". He was intrigued by how the bums fought and struggled just to get by with nothing. They had their own community. They were all in it together and were like a family. As Irene's butler, Godfrey sees the wealthy family as a bunch of dumb fruitcakes that acted like children. Ironically Godfrey unknowingly falls in love with one of the fruit cakes (Irene). The movie is very funny and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely a screwball comedy if I ever seen one. Great acting and directing had to go into this movie with the amount of funny and crazy scenes that were in it. To have actors that won't laugh at some of these scenes is impressive. Although there was comedy, there was a theme that was serious. Since the movie was made during the Depression, it showed not only the rich and the poor, but how they all dealt with the Depression as well. One thing I noticed was how crazy and frivolous a family can be when they have money. Since this family had money they could do whatever they want, but for people living by the dump they have to be a bit more serious if they want to survive. This is definitely something that people can relate to, especially in this recession.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey was an excellent example of a classic screwball comedy. The movie was fast paced and always entertaining. The film was also very funny. William Powell does an amazing job playing the straight man in this comedy. This movie was filmed during the Great Depression and the director did a good job presenting how the majority of citizens during that time lost their fortune and were living in squalor much like the character of Godfrey. The only problem I had with this film was that Powell ended up with the character Irene. I thought for sure he would marry the older sister Cornelia, but I guess you just have to expect the unexpected while watching a screwball comedy like this one. Although this movie is old by today's standards I would still recommend it. This film still pertains to today's world because we are going through our own economic crisis at the moment. It's a good reminder that we should still find the joy in life like the character Irene even if it's a difficult time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey was a film directed by Gregory La Cava in 1936. The film is a classic screwball comedy. As a matter of fact, it was ranked #44 on the American Film Institute's 100 funniest comedies. Carole Lombard and William Powell are the starring actors. It also received six nominations for an Academy Award, four of which were for the Leading Man and Woman and Best Supporting Actress and Actor. This speaks highly of the acting performances in the film.Taking place during the Great Depression, the film focuses on the socialite family the Bullocks. Lombard stars as one of the sisters/daughters who is on a scavenger hunt contest. She stumbles across Powell, portraying Godfrey, and the two make a pact. Godfrey becomes the family butler and concocts story after story to develop his fake identity. Themes of My Man Godfrey include social class and overcoming social class. Lombard starts out finding Powell as a broken down man. He holds his grudges against the upper class. By the end of the movie, Lombard and Powell end up together.The film contained much humor as the characters and relationship developed between Irene Bullock and Godfrey. The camera angles and screen shots were well directed. One of the funnier moments was the interaction in the shower scene. Though the film itself was realistic, the storyline was not as believable, due to the large difference in the social classes, especially in that time era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I found out we would be watching a comedy movie from the 30s I wasn't to excited. I didn't no much about the screwball comedy genre but had heard about it. I never gave it a chance and after seeing this movie that was a mistake because this is one of the funniest movies I have seen. William Powell gives a great and memorable performance of Godfrey a man who is living in the city dump during the Great Depression. The most amazing part of this film is when the father tells the family that the stocks have plummeted but Godfrey saves the day by telling them he had used the money from the necklace to buy stock. He saved the family from bad financial problems and then gave the necklace back. It is great that Godfrey gives back to the other men at the dump by giving them jobs and food at the new club that he has built on the dump. I am really glad I got to see one of the best screwball comedies as my first movie. I highly recommend this film for anyone who is new to this genre of film, it will give you a whole new perspective about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was such a crazy movie. It was touching, hilarious, sometimes sad all in one. The bullocks have to be one of the most chaotic families I've ever seen. I feel so bad for the father and the help. I don't know how they survive. I also love the twists in this movie; my favorite being that Godfrey went to Harvard, and was from a well known wealthy family. I knew something was up but I didn't see that one coming at all. My favorite part of the whole movie was when Godfrey went into Mrs. Bullocks room after her long night of drinking and he made "the little men" go away. And what was up with that Carlo guy? I also loved how Godfrey turned the dump into a fancy restaurant (or was it a hotel?)and hired all of the "forgotten men" and gave them places to stay.</fullReview>

The movie was put together very well with the camera angels that where used and the vocabulary made it easy to understand and get the plot of the movie easily. i felt the actors developed the characters very well and made it easy to like or hate them. The relationships in the movies seemed t be n the little dramatic side but it worked for this movie. It also gave a look to what life was like during the depression.Overall i really enjoyed this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a wonderful film that proposes a great moral; that money doesn't bring happiness. Godfrey is a wonderful character who teaches the Bulloch's moral lessons while being stomped on. His character is filled with many surprises with a strong foundation of good morals. This film was also a great satire on the upper class during the Great Depression. The film for the first half was like a circus act with the scavenger hunts, goats, and many more acts of chaos. We need movies like this to remind the people who were not living during the Great Depression that times were much worse than they were portrayed as well as the true heroes of that time who sacrificed there own money to help others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I began watching "My Man Godfrey" I was somewhat reserved. I'd seen a lot of comedy from the 30's on TCM, and for the most part I wasn't too impressed. "My Man Godfrey" on the other hand, was quite funny although a bit over the top. Over all the acting was pretty good, William Powell was perfect as Godfrey. Carole Lombard was also good, but at times it seemed as if she was trying too hard to play the role of the zany but lovable Irene. The set design in the film was superb, demonstrating perfectly the differences between Hoovervilles and the upscale homes of the rich during the Great Depression. I was surprised at how good "My Man Godfrey" turned out to be, it may not be the best studio era comedy, but I would highly recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a classic screwball comedy released in 1936. All starting with a scavenger hunt, Irene (played by Carole Lombard) is in search of a homeless man when she meets Godfrey (played by William Pwell) in the city's dump. she then offers him a job as her family's butler, much to their dismay and falls head over heels for him. Because of the Hayes Code not much romance was in this film, which I felt there should have have been more between the two leading roles. After moving on from being the family's butler, Godfrey makes a name for himself, but Irene tracks him down and ends up marrying him. The end of the movie had me yelling to myself run Godfrey, run. I felt that Godfrey could have done better than Irene, she seemed to childish for him to me. For this movie both leading roles played by William Powell and Carole Lombard, were nominated for Academy Awards, which I feel was a shame that these two outstanding actors did not win that year.</fullReview>

Every players liked him because of goodness. Especially, the main actress who fell in love Godfrey in the first meeting performed her role well too. She showed how she was innocence person and showed the doing when the person who fall in love want to do everything for the lover. Besides, the favorite scene that showed how innocence of her is the scene after Godfrey did not want her to go to his room anymore. She expressed her emotion and performed like the person who did not have feeling. In addition, there was the performing of the piano during the scene that made this scene more dominant.Moreover, the beginning of the scene was interesting because I could not imagine what was going on ,and it became the last place of the scene of movie. In addition, this movie reflected to the problem of the family ,and Godfrey was the key to help connect the relationship between the family with the turning point that made the audience more impressive in the last scene.</fullReview>

Irene finds him in the dump and he ends up working for her and her crazy family as a butler. What I liked about this movie is that we didn't find out till the end that Godfrey was just like the people he works for rich and had everything once in his life. Godfrey helped this family out cause at the end of the movie the family ended up broke but Godfrey helped by putting money into stocks for them and gave them most of the money. So they could of faced being out on the streets themselves. I really didn't like the ending of this movie cause he fought with Irene about not wanting to be with her and then she just shows up and says they are getting married. The ending doesn't even let him say how he feels about the whole situation. But it was a great film to watch cause the crazy family made it humorous to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film, it has been my favorite in Cinema class thus far! Comedy is my absolutely favorite film genre and this one really reinforced that feeling for me! Although it was filmed in black and white, I thought it was excellently shot. In fact, I think the film's character might have been diminished a bit if it were done in color instead. There were so many aspects about this particular movie that I enjoyed. The cinematography was excellently executed. The accompanying music was very appropriate, slow in some scenes and fast in others. Just like the pace of the movie. Scene transitioning was done very well also. Unlike some of the earlier movies we've watched in Professor Jaeger's class, the transitions were done very smoothly and weren't too long between breaks. The acting in each scene was very well rehearsed and animated, especially the hysterical and bizarre relationship between actress Carole Lombard and actor William Powell. Their interactions with each other were hilarious and really made the movie for me. This screwball comedy was a pioneer for later films of the same genre. It was so interesting to see such an early film of this type because I've always been fascinated by the dialogs between one another in comedies. It made me realize exactly where later comedies got their inspiration. For example, in the movie Juno (2007) the on camera relationship between protagonists Juno McGuff and Paulie Bleeker is ridiculously funny. Their conversations are very quick and sarcastic. These types of interactions are what make movies the most enjoyable for me. This is the reason why I'm so astounded by the same type of relationship in My Man Godfrey between Godfrey and Irene. The film was made so many years before another screwball comedy like Juno, but it possesses the same charm. The acting is also so fast paced and witty..Two thumbs up for this film, absolutely!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed watching this movie. I didn't think I would really like the "screwball comedy" films, this film showed a lot of things that a lot of movies in the late 30s wouldn't show. When you watch a lot of films about the great depression, you see a lot of depressing things. Films would hardly end in a positive way. But this film did. It made a negative into a positive, which I really liked. The acting was great, especially the actor who played Godfrey and Irene. I liked when you found out that Godfrey was once wealthy and then was living in a dump. I wasn't really impressed with the ending though. It didn't seem very "real life" to me. How Irene just showed up and told Godfrey that they are going to get married and they did! I'm very interested to see how the color film is.</fullReview>

I believe he also taught the family lessons in loyalty,hard work and friendship. Maybe this movie opened the public's eyes to the real person inside even a "forgotten man." Just because a family has money to afford nice things doesn't necessarily make them above a lower class. The way in which they found their butler did not convince me that this would happen in real life however through the great acting I found the characters to be believable and seem like they could be real people.</fullReview>

The plot for My Man Godfrey is one that is basic and easy to understand immediately. The main family, the Bullocks, are a frantic and insane and make this film even funnier. The daughter Irene played by Carole Lombard is by far the craziest family member, always whining and getting what she wants, and somewhat of a ditz. William Powell who plays Godfrey who is a forgotten man, really makes this character amazing, mysterious, and heart throbbing. The acting was marvelous.The filming was something perfect, the opening credits were very original and something to remember. With the different screen shots, scenes, and editing tricks, it flowed together greatly. This is still a black &amp; white movie, but we have the vita phone in this film, and it made it have such realism.This is a definite classical I can suggest anyone to watch. Especially those who say they have a crazy family, wait until they meet the Bullocks. This movie has nonstop smiles and laughs and you will enjoy every last minute of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screwball at its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film "My Man Godfrey" is a screwball comedy from 1936. It was explained to me that because of the Hayes code, if you wanted to produce a 'love story' it would need to be made into a comedy. Basically when dealing with the Hayes Code any action that dealt with love or romance was not allowed to be shown on film. These actions were deemed inappropriate. Knowing that, I honestly didn't know what to expect out of this movie. William Powell played the main character of Godrfrey while Carole Lombard played the main actress role of Irene. Irene is a young woman who comes from a well to do family. In a very egocentric way, Irene meets Godfrey who is considered a "lost man" and offers him a job as the new family butler. When Godfrey cleans himself up, Irene comes to realize that she has fallen madly in love with him. She is a woman who is lost within her own mind and has no realization of what life is actually all about. Throughout the film, you come to realize there is more to Godfrey then what he reveals to everyone. By the end, its Godfrey the "lost man" that saves Irenes family from losing all that they have. This film is brilliantly put together. It is one in which will make you laugh while at the same time make people open their eyes and see there can be so much more to people then where they come from and what they have. Most times money means nothing when you are a good person, its just money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A childish and scatter-brained young woman takes a liking to a homeless man and hires him to be her family's butler.This 1930s screwball comedy is about as screwy as they come. The wealthy Bullock family is filled to the brim with crazy characters, from the amusingly daffy mother to the aforementioned daughter, her scheming sister, and...Carlo.William Powell plays Godfrey, the butler who wasn't always a homeless man. Carole Lombard plays the daughter who falls madly in love with him. Excellent support comes from frog-voiced Eugene Palette (the frustrated father), Alice Brady (the mother), and Mischa Auer (the eccentric Carlo).Lombard goes all-out for comedy. Her performance reminded me at different times of Gracie Allen and Amy Poehler. (And Lombard is probably the most beautiful of the three.)The "love story" angle was never entirely convincing to me. My favorite thing about the film is all the zaniness inside the family.Nominated for six Academy Awards (including one in each acting category), MY MAN GODFREY is one of the all-time classic 1930s screwball comedies, along with BRINGING UP BABY and THE AWFUL TRUTH. The dialogue is witty and some of the humor is off-the-wall. Over 70 years old, but still wildly entertaining.If you want some classic comedy, check out MY MAN GODFREY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title sounded like it was something to do with a servant, and that is pretty much exactly what it was, it was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die as well, and that was the main reason for me to watch it and hope I would agree. Basically set in New York City following the Great Depression, a scavenger hunt is going on at a party, and spoilt socialite Bullock sisters, Irene (Oscar nominated Carole Lombard) and Cornelia (Gail Patrick) are taking part, the winner is the first to get back and bring a "forgotten man". They go to the city dump where they are determined they will find a derelict, Cornelia finds and offers $5 to bum Godfrey Smith (Oscar nominated William Powell) to come with her to the Waldorf Hotel, but he pushes away and she leaves. Irene however talks to Godfrey and explains that she wants to be able to beat her sister, and for no money he accepts to go to the party as the "forgotten man" and she wins the prize, and following a speech he gives Irene offers him the position of butler for their mansion. She tells her parents, father Alexander (Eugene Palette) and mother Angelica (Oscar nominated Alice Brady), about hiring this man to work for them, a dysfunctional family, they are unsure if letting a man from the streets into their home to serve and live with them is wise, but they allow him to have a chance to prove himself. As time goes by and Godfrey becomes accustomed to his new higher class and professional lifestyle, Irene develops a crush on him and is very protective when Cornelia, who hates him since the night of the party, wants to try and harm his reputation. In the Bullock household a party is being held, and it is there that Godfrey encounters someone from his past before going downhill, investor Tommy Gray (Alan Mowbray) who was with him in Harvard, he has since graduated and gives his former fellow student a salute. Godfrey doesn't want any more of his past to come out to anybody, so he sets up meetings to talk properly about what is going on, and meanwhile Cornelia finds a way to set the butler up for a crime, she hides a treasured item in his room that she hopes will incriminate him and cause the parents to fire him. Godfrey realises this attempt at deception and framing, he does not take any action, and it seems he may be the one that saves the Bullock family from bankruptcy, after Alexander discovers his stocks have been increased by the butler personally, and in the end Irene and Godfrey are free to express their feelings for each other. Also starring Jean Dixon as Molly, Oscar nominated Mischa Auer as Carlo, Pat Flaherty as Mike, Robert Light as Faithful George, Grady Sutton as Charlie Van Rumple and Jane Wyman as Socialite. Powell is really likable as the charming bum turned reliable butler, Lombard is also likable as the young woman who wants him to her the same affection she has for him, but obviously he doesn't give in due to the butler status, the concept of the man on the streets becoming part of a family is obviously the funniest thing, but the bickering and banter makes for some good laughs as well, and the small romantic element is nice too, it is a fun character driven screwball comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Gregory La Cava and Best Writing, Screenplay. It was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zany, yet structured.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon review of this film, I found it to be rather interesting, as well as funny. William Powell plays a great role in this film as Godfrey. He is put right in the middle of this wacky film. Gregory La Cava dabbles with zany humor in this film. He boldly designs this character for Powell ( over a bottle of Scotch, might I add ) and does so in a great way. The character is really dynamic, you get to feel the insight of Godfrey as the movie unwinds. I found it ironic that in the beginning he starts out as a bum and no one wants anything to do with him, but then in the end everyone is in love with him. The time period in which the film is shot is also very interesting. It gives a great look into the lifestyle of the rich and privileged back in the 1930's. Godfrey is the butler among a very rich, and diverse family. The family all has characters that contrast with each other. The mother strikes a cord of comedy, whilst the one sister is a spoiled brat, and the other is young and naive. The father seems to be the only level headed one in the house. The butlers and maids tip toe carefully, obeying every antic of this whacked out family, and do so in a comedic display that is thrilling to the audience. The pace is very quick, there are a lot of quick little quips thrown in here and there, and intelligent banter, which is very different from main stream Hollywood movies of today. I found the film interesting, William Powell's performance stuck out to me, as did the crazy mother in the film. Also Carole Lombard was great to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William Powell Makes This One Likable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey" isn't the best of the screwball comedy genre, but it has its moments.The plot of an unsuspecting homeless man who becomes the object of two high society sisters' childish whims, is a concept ripe with opportunity. William Powell scintillates, giving a witty performance as the mysterious 'lost man' turned butler, and has help from some pretty strong supporting players: Gail Patrick as the evil, snooty, sister; Eugene Palette as the big booming patriarch; and Jean Dixon is enjoyable as Molly, the all-knowing maid.The thorn in 'Godfrey's' side is unfortunately Carole Lombard, and it isn't her fault that her character is written so one-dimensionally. Irene Bullock is so adolescent, and whiny that you're praying Godfrey steers clear of her, even though she's clearly the film's female love interest. It's a pity that Lombard spends the bulk of the film pining over Godfrey like a two-year old infatuated with a new toy. Hepburn pulled it off in "Bringing Up Baby" not because she was the better actress, but because the script gave her something else to do: Chase a tiger. The most "My Man Godfrey's" script allows Lombard is an opportunity to flop on a couch, while watching her mother's protégé monkey around to entertain her.Yes, the script pokes a lot of good fun at spoiled heiresses, but it never really gives Lombard the opportunity to rise above the joke and ultimately hurts the film. It's definitely worth seeing the actors in their prime and fans of the genre should watch for kicks, but, although I wanted to love "My Man Godfrey," I'd sooner re-watch "It Happened One Night" or "Bringing Up Baby" to see greater male/female chemistry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Synopsis: The Bullock sisters, two high society sisters, Cornelia, (Gail Patrick), and Irene, (Carole Lombard), are on a charity Scavenger Hunt and the last item they need to bring in is a forgotten man. They go to the city dump, by the river, where Cornelia is first to approach a forgotten man, Godfrey Smith, (William Powell), but he finds the whole idea distasteful. As Cornelia flees Godfrey's wrath, Irene stays and helps Godfrey change his mind. Godfrey decides to go along with it for two reasons; one, to help Irene beat snooty Cornelia, and the other, to satisfy his curiosity about people who could come up with such insensitive games. At the Scavenger Hunt headquarters Godfrey proceeds to tell everyone what he thinks of their little game, but only after Irene has won her cup. Irene then decides she wants to help Godfrey and asks him to "butle" for her family. Surprisingly, he shows up the next morning, and then realizes that these two nutty sisters have an equally nutty mother, (Alice Brady), who is sponsoring a freeloading live-in musical protégée, (Mischa Auer), but also a patient and loving father, (Eugene Palette), who is struggling to keep his family normal and his money from drying up. Still, Cornelia refuses to fall for Godfrey's butler skills and charms, (still smarting from their first encounter), and does all she can to drive him off. While working as their butler, Godfrey, (who has not been open about his own well connected family), finds a purpose to his life and it involves helping the Bullock's financially as well as his old friends who still live down at the city dump. Meanwhile, all this time Irene has been falling in love with Godfrey and refuses to take no for an answer. Once all truths have been revealed, Godfrey decides to leave the Bullocks but Irene is not far behind and now Godfrey must face the fact that she will be in his life from now on.Recommendations: Director, Gregory La Cava, has given us one of the best screw ball comedies ever made. His direction is fast paced, hysterical and even moving. Masterful! The writing is laugh out load brilliant and of course there's the acting. William Powell and Carole Lombard are perfect together. You can feel the chemistry between them and the fact that they both play their roles perfectly is breathtaking. Supported by the incredibly funny Alice Brady, (nobody played nutty better), and a surprisingly effective Mischa Auer, this film soars like no other film. Even actors not normally raved about turn in wonderful comedic/touching performances. Eugene Palette, Gail Patrick, Alan Mowbray, (as Tommy Gray, an old friend of Godfrey's), and Jean Dixon, (as Molly the maid), milk every laugh and tear from this wonderful screenplay. Once you see this you will realize that this gem is more valuable than pearls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey" is the kind of film that couldn't be made today, a good thing in that it's a Depression-era comedy about a fellow living in a city dump who finds himself the "protégé" of a young Manhattan debutante, a bad thing in that so many sexual and social PC bugaboos would need addressing now you'd never get around to the comedy, "My Man Godfrey's" central point. Also, you can't imagine any actress today bold enough to take on the role of the glamorous ditzy deb Carole Lombard plays, except perhaps one who ironically shares her character's surname.Time has preserved this film in amber no less than a mosquito at Jurassic Park, along with a compelling argument something important was lost in the interim."My Man Godfrey" features the handiest domestic servant this side of Mary Poppins. No, William Powell in the title role doesn't sing (at least while sober) or jump into paintings, but he knows a thing or two about chasing away pixies with Worcestershire sauce as well as keeping a step ahead of the various Bullocks of Fifth Avenue, an eccentric family of upper-class dipsos and scofflaws who usually can't keep a butler more than an hour.As much a fairy tale as a screwball comedy, "My Man Godfrey" was the first film to win Oscar nominations in all four acting categories. Acting is this film's main strength; two of the best performances, by Eugene Palette as the sputtering straight-man father Alexander Bullock ("The life of this family is one subpoena after another") and Gail Patrick as his snobby daughter Cornelia, weren't even nominated.There's a decided Betty and Veronica quality to the rivalry between Lombard's Irene Bullock and her sister, a raven-haired beauty who exudes more and more hotitude the more she schemes against Godfrey and incurs Irene's blonde wrath. Is Cornelia motivated by more than the fact Godfrey left her sitting in a pile of ash? Is there affection beneath the menace of those dark eyes? Patrick does a good job making you wonder.Lombard and Alice Brady as her frivolous mother Angelica give the flat-out best performances. Clearly, here is one acorn that didn't fall far from the tree. Irene's idea of a successful romantic foray is getting Godfrey to zap her with a cold shower, while Angelica upbraids her husband when he says he can't afford to keep giving the taxman 60% of what he earns while his family takes 50%. "Why should the government get more than your own flesh and blood," she demands.William Powell is a lot of people's favorite as Godfrey. I wish he was mine, but I find him hard to buy at the film's outset as a bum and a bit of a stiff as things move on. There's a nice bit of loaded political commentary at the outset, directed at then-President Franklin Roosevelt, when Godfrey tells a fellow bum "Prosperity is just around the corner," FDR's campaign theme when this film came out in 1936. ("I wish I knew which corner," the other bum answers.) While the film never quite goes out on such a limb again, it does tease out a message of class being about more than money, a message that rings a bit hollow when we see how much better everyone's life here becomes for having some more of the green stuff.Director Gregory La Cava doesn't dwell on anything too long for us to notice such points, and in many ways, his facile touch is a plus. I didn't see anything that extraordinary from him except the opening credits, a period-piece delight that nicely segues from Broadway glitter to the East River squalor of the dump where Godfrey lives. The script by Morrie Ryskind and Eric Hatch is full of great one-liners, and an ending so abrupt it is pure genius.I wouldn't rank "My Man Godfrey" ahead of "Bringing Up Baby" as the better screwball comedy, but most of it, especially Lombard's manic goofiness, holds up very well to repeat viewings and the film as a whole is a nice capsule of a time and place gone by, leaving us nostalgic for what never really was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MY RATING- 8.4Well I was never too keen of screwball comedies, specially the Katherine Hepburn's ones. Movs of that kind relied too much on her feminist style and I certainly didn't identify with that! This one made me change my mind, it's one of the oldest (1936) and it's some of the best. It's all about a `forgotten man' of the Depression (wonderful William Powell, he was nominated for the oscar) who is caught by rich crazy girl Irene (Carol Lombard, also nominated) to be butler of her family. The rest of the cast is simply brilliant: Alice Brady (nominated), an often forgotten lady of the 30's, who is absolutely funny in the scenes with Mischa Auer (nominated), as Carlo, her `protégé'. I was laughing a lot in his gorila scene! Also with the great Eugene Palette as the father and snobish Gail Patrick as the inteligent sister, Cornelia.This is another gem by director Gregory La Cava, who marks his soft and inteligent flow of action here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The clever idea-- partying Manhattan socialites go on a scavenger hunt for "forgotten men" during the Depression-- could have been a platform for both comedy and social commentary if it had been in the hands of, say, Preston Sturges. Unfortunately, it's in the hands of Gregory La Cava, the man who gave us "Laugh and Get Rich" (two IMDb comments) and "Lady in a Jam" (zero).Godfrey is not the problem. He's a Boston Brahmin who's been reduced to living in a Hooverville in New York, and William Powell plays him as a wise and amusing sophisticate who brings great dignity to his role as butler for the wealthy Bullocks. Nor could the supporting cast be much improved upon: Eugene Palette as the patriarch; Mischa Auer as the parasitical artist (pianist) who is Mrs. Bullock's project; Gail Patrick as a skeptical, cynical daughter; and Jean Dixon as the wise-acre maid. The problem is the other daughter, who is the film's heroine. Even played by Carole Lombard, Irene is a bullet to the brain of this movie. Overbearing, nervous, vain, and blabby, the character turns this from screwball comedy into screw-loose clunker. At no point is she sympathetic, let alone likable. It is impossible to imagine Godfrey settling for an annoying, boring half-wit like Irene.This is the only movie ever to receive six Oscar nominations, which (1) did NOT include Best Picture, and (2) won zero. In fact, "Godfrey" received no awards whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 30s was when movies decided what they want to be.You can spin one of three or four narratives tracing that development. One of those narratives casts genres as beings and has them duking it out, only a few surviving. In this narrative, you'd see a rope from the movies about stage performance to this, movies about life performance, to Citizen Kane (through "O Brother," surely), where you have life and stage performances "folded."Another of those narratives follows the meme of stereotypes, especially sexual ones. In this tale, it is the identities that matter, that survive and all else is wrapping, container.(I suppose if you are particularly broken or fundamentalist, you'll adjust this to some Marxist or sexist or racist narrative.)But today I choose the actor thread. We obsess about our celebrities today, but these folks in the 30s were truly important. Women of course, nearly always women. But of the men, William Powell is near the top of my list. If I were building these narratives, he would be one of the key male actors.No, not Wayne or Gable or any of those folks who were celebrities first and actors second, and then only acting themselves. Powell seems to have understood how to bend the detective persona and may have been the first actor to noticeably wink at the camera. You and he were in cahoots when discovering what happens next.Here he is teamed with his exwife Carol Lombarde and teases out of her one performance worthy of remembrance. She would have a similar screwball relationship with husband number 2. So no matter what sort of narrative you build of the history of films, you will find it passes through this fine little project.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great comedy with that human touch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a comedy from the era of the Great Depression, a bum found at the New York city dump, who had at one time been a man of means, becomes the butler of the filthy rich. The premise was made for comedy but William Powell (as Godfrey) and Carole Lombard (as Irene Bullock) gives the characters a human touch. When you look at Jimmy Steward in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington", you never got past Steward as something like a cartoon character. With Powell, you see the human face of existence, the complexity of existence, at the whim of existence. Powell (as Godfrey) had been of means and gave up his fortune over the loss of a love, only to find himself by whimsical fate back in the lap of luxury all over again. And such is his disdain for this lap of luxury, he could end up in the dumps again.But there is more to the story than that. Each one of these actors knows by the standards of depression era society, they are the filthy rich, making phenomenal amounts of money they could never envision in their youth. Carole Lombard's salary was some $450,000 a year. That is filthy rich by any standard and certainly by the standard of the Great Depression. So these actors had a real sense of the whimsy of fate and how unequal and oftentimes unjust it can be.That Powell/Godfrey opens at the dump a fancy nightclub and names it "The Dump" suggests keen awareness of what this story is all about.Powell had the persona and acting skill to pull that sentience off on the screen as he recites lines written by Morrie Ryskind, lines based on a novel, "1101 Park Ave" by Eric Hatch. And these people/actors receive tons of money for essentially playing themselves. Such is fate.The film is great because of the ensemble cast, the talent of Powell and Lombard, and a topic about the whimsy of fate and how it can turn, and an expectation for a turn for the better by the end. While the ending may be hokum, it is delightful hokum. Powell gets the girl, and gets his wealth back.</fullReview>

Most of the humor throughout the movie is a combination of wit and crazy characters/situations as opposed to a lot of the heavy physical humor that came in many films before it. Most of the characters of the film are very over-the-top and seem unrealistic, serving to make the point of being "stupid" rich. These are all balanced out by the main character Godfrey (William Powell), who comes to be a character the audience understands, relates to, and really likes. He serves as the informed, educated, and righteous American man who is redeemed through his journey and able to overcome the influence of wealth and in the end serves the general good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not think My Man Godfrey was that funny. It began with two sisters on a scavenger hunt and they were supposed to bring back a "forgotten man" to get points for the hunt. The older sister tried to pay him to come back with her but she was rude so he refused so she left. However, the younger sister stayed and talked to the man and he agreed to go back with her so she could win the hunt and it would make the older sister mad. The younger sister, Irene, ended up hiring Godfrey to be her family's butler. The older sister, Cornelia, did not agree with the decision to hire Godfrey because she didn't like him. Godfrey soon found out that the family was kind of nuts. Another worker, Molly, informed Godfrey on what to expect and what he would be doing for the family. Irene began to have feelings for Godfrey but he only liked her as a friend. This began to upset her. Cornelia put her pearl necklace under Godfrey's mattress in hopes of getting him fired and then told her family it was stolen and they should call the cops. When the cops came, she told themto look under his mattress and she was shocked when it was not there.Her father realized that she tried to frame Godfrey and told the policeis was a misunderstanding. The family hoped to take Irene's mind off of her heartbreak and sent her to Europe but it didn't help. When she got home, she pretended to faint so Godfrey would stay and help her instead of going somewhere with Cornelia because she wanted to take him away from Irene. Irene thought that Godfrey loved her or else he wouldn't have taken care of her and Godfrey was make that she lied about fainting. Godfrey quit his job and even helped Irene's father out who was struggling financially by buying a stock without them knowing.Godfrey helped stop them from going broke. At the end of the movie, Godfrey returned to the dump where he was found in the beginning. However, its not the same dump it was in the beginning of the movie. It was a lot nicer and clean. Irene followed him to the dump and brought a priest with her and tricked/forced him to marry her. The movie ended with the two getting married down at the dump. I thought this movie was boring and not very funny at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a hard task to come into existence in the middle of a tidal wave of screwball comedies and shine bright enough for people to take notice after the storm has passed. Godfrey isn't just a lighthearted, code-taunting escapist bucket of laughs. It has a poignant, stark reality behind it. In every zany scene in the Bullock household, somewhere behind Carlo parading around like a monkey, a touch of unfamiliar contrast is added in the presence and dealings of the titular character. William Powell is an endlessly stoic straight man in his role as Godfrey, unfettered by the cutesy melodrama of his affluent workplace, knowing by firsthand experience the realities of life outside the mansion. An intellectual commentary on inequality and status it is not, and some might call it heavy-handed, but it manages to maintain a steady stream of laughs and a solid and interesting plot progression. At the end of the day, My Man Godfrey doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is - a particularly notable entry into the fad genre of the time. It is that sort of focus that makes it great. The film's thesis is not social commentary, but romance and comedy, and it is a masterpiece because it excels even where it wasn't asked to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is the story of a derelict, who despite being content living in the city dump among others of a similar fate is hired to be a butler by a slow yet adorable socialite named Irene. In the film we see a very successful blend of sophistication and accessible comedy that allows it to exude a very palpable charm. Godfrey excels as a screwball comedy by having the relationship between its leading man and woman grow exceptionally without needing to relying on any type of average Hollywood romance.Godfrey's character initially comes off as very one-dimensional. I thought I'd had him figured out by the time Irene brought him in for the scavenger hunt. I was sure he would remain the way he was there throughout the rest of the film, very cool calm and collected, still managing to be suave despite the way he looked, but in a flat way. I thought he would be the peacekeeper type and rely on everyone else for laughs and a majority of the entertainment value of the film. I was absolutely wrong. Sure, he maintains a sophisticated and debonair outward appearance, but Godfrey shows off so many more dimensions as the film progresses. I was really happy to see him come off as vulnerable and flawed so early in the film. It was a relief to see him daunted by his first day on the job. Of course he ended up being near perfect as a butler, but he does make mistakes, and they keep his character grounded. Sure, it's not hard to have his secret origins figured out before the reveal, but that doesn't even manage to take away from the film. My only complaint with his character is when they turned him into a wizard of Oz type near the end. Disaster strikes the Bullock household, but Godfrey swoops in to save the day and with that he takes his leave so everyone can contemplate the gifts and life lessons he had left them with. No. This is the exact opposite of what the film had worked so hard to do. Thankfully He becomes such a captivating protagonist that he manages to recover from that awful blunder, and he could have carried the entire film if he needed to. He certainly didn't need to, however. Irene is the perfect antithesis to Godfrey, and it's because of her that the film can work as well as it does. She pulls off being completely naive and simple without it becoming irritating or a drag on the film. In her case, she's very one-dimensional and it actually works. The only person in the film that manages to overstayed their welcome because of a one sided personality is the mother, but she has her moments.My Man Godfrey succeeds on multiple fronts. It's the type of movie that can be excellent as a film but still stay fun. You don't really expect something like Godfrey to be so genuinely funny, but that surprise adds to it as a whole. Godfrey set the bar for homeless vagrants turned butlers. Will he ever be surpassed? Probably not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the fact that this movie had an underlying purpose to it. It's not only something that was going back then but it's something that still goes on to this day. People are treated differently simply because of the amount of money they have or don't. Which is where the movie first started off. Godfrey was just a man living in the "slums" basically when a group of wealthy people came to just use him as a pawn for a game. I understand that it was a screwball comedy but I didn't really find much of it that funny. I think it was just too much of the actors and actresses being over dramatic in a way. It became a little obnoxious. I focused more on Godfrey's transformation from the beginning to end and how he still managed to come back to his roots at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be quite honest, I did not much care for this film. When I watch a movie that is labeled a comedy, I expect the film to make me laugh. Unfortunately, My Man Godfrey did not do this for me. While the premise of the film is clever, I did not find the content of the film to be funny. I feel that this is due to the fact that I am used to more modern aspects of comedy, and this film was made in the 1930's. However, the acting was very good throughout the cast, especially in terms of delivering dialogue. In my opinion, other than the fact that the film was not funny to me, it did just about everything else right. I will recommend this film to those who want to explore older forms of comedy. While it doesn't compare to today's comedy films, it is still a well done work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't a big fan of this film. While I liked the main character, and found the social exploration interesting, the shrill family annoyed me to no end. What to some may have been comedy was eye roll worthy for me. That being said, I can't dismiss it completely due to the truly interesting choice of a main character. When I think of classic Hollywood, my mind goes to classy ladies and debonair male leads like Cary Grant. My Man Godfrey introduces their lead in a sorry state, living in a garbage dump and face full of scruff. The central importance to him is his hardworking nature and that he isn't too proud to work for people he once rubbed elbows with. Given that this movie was made at a time when the majority of Americans were experiencing hardship, Godfrey probably served as someone to relate to and look up to for many.I also found the relationship between Godfrey and Cornelia fascinating. It made me wish that she was the main female love interest instead of her rather goofy and hysterical sister. Yes, there was a sweetness to the fact that Irene, even in her spoiled state, saw past what he was and looked upon Godfrey as a person. But all the same, I think there was a far more interesting story to tell in Cornelia and Godfrey if they had focused more on her journey to realizing he was more than just a bum, but an exceptional man. It almost felt like they were teasing me with what could be a great movie while instead giving me a ridiculous romance that ended in non-consent marriage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Man Godfrey (1936)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings about this film. On one hand, I think the premise is good, and the general execution is mostly entertaining, but there's just something missing. I can't say it was boring or completely bad (I actually really liked the cinematography and lighting especially, and for me that can make a film worth watching regardless) but the characters aren't particularly engaging and I found myself not really caring about them, and chuckling at the jokes rather than being invested in the story. It's rather obvious that you're supposed to agree with and/or relate to Godfrey, but as for Irene I just found her downright unbearable. I understand that as a screwball comedy the film is not supposed to be realistic, and that it's exaggerated for comedic and social commentary/contrast purposes, but after a while it just became overplayed. One thing I will say about it though (for better or worse) is that it's extremely captivating. Regardless of whether I liked it, I was totally glued to the screen for the entire duration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was on-and-off for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this film a 7/10 because of the script. "My Man Godfrey" (1936, director: Gregory La Cava) is a film formatting many others, made for the 'warm fuzzies' and the amusing silliness. But in the matter of compatibility between the two love interests, the resolution leaves a sour taste in one's mouth. While the story itself seems good, it unfortunately only is on paper. It's set up like a typical screwball comedy: with two opposites attracting after being drawn together under extraordinary circumstances, endless mishaps, the knowledge that they'll end up a couple after defeating whatever the conflict is, and several flat characters that help the story move along.In any screwball or romantic comedy, the love interests give the story an inciting incident when they have their "meet-cute". This gives the plot a motivation; They are supposed to be the couple to root for. Our main potential (albeit forced) couple is the titular bum-turned-butler Godfrey, who is clever and grounded, and the spoiled, whimsical Irene Bullock. He has his priorities in order and refuses to be distracted from making a life for himself; She has no real concerns besides getting Godfrey to love her and spiting her sister, and her empty head is far from what Godfrey needs in his life. Other than that shortcoming, the characters are funny and charming, the script is full of witty one-liners, and there is just enough ridiculousness to be constantly entertaining. Now, let's get something straight: I wouldn't watch it again. I can't say I'm glad I watched the movie because the puzzlingly bad story concerning the "fated" (gimme a break) couple eclipsed the pleasing amusement of the film and made me dislike the experience of watching it. Now that I know the clever punchlines and laughed at the goofy jokes, what the film's really about (bringing the love interests together) infuriates me. These love interests clearly don't belong together. I cringe when I think of them spending the rest of their lives together when they are polar opposites, and not in the good way. When the film was coming to a close and the credits began to roll, I found myself not only thinking "wait, seriously?" but genuinely surprised. What would they have to talk about? Their characters are in each other's lives for what, a year or so? And yet Godfrey never feels the same towards Irene as she does him, because they have nothing in common. At all. I honestly felt bad for Godfrey at the end. And worse, I thought he would end up with Irene's sister, because even they would have made a better match!</fullReview>

All of the different characters had starkly different personalities yet they all had amazing chemistry on screen. The actors in the film had perfect comedic timing and the cast really meshed well together. Other than the funny moments though I found the film kind of boring. There were just some moments that seemed to carry on much longer than necessary. There would be a very funny part and then for a while nothing funny would really happen. For a screwball comedy it felt very serious at times, in fact it got a little too serious in some moments. Despite that fact I still enjoyed it and for me the good outweighed the bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this "screwball" comedy because it had a great balance of romance and comic relief. Godfrey is a trooper for sticking it out with the Bullock family and their antics. I felt that the beginning was not as thought out as the rest of the film though and seemed to be the only real hole in the plot. As the viewer you're kind of wondering what these two upper class sisters are doing searching for a "forgotten man" in the city dump and why or how it has anything to do with a scavenger hunt. Then it comes as a bit of a surprise that this formal affair ends up with the Bullocks hiring a hobo and inviting him to their home. Never the less this film did a terrific job of being entertaining, hilarious, and teaching values. Each member of the Bullock family is a riot in their own way and all have really interesting characters. I personally found Irene to be so over the top funny thanks to Carole Lombard's super dramatic acting. Godfrey balances out the family, although he is secretly rich, he chose to work his way up to success, which is something the Bullock family knew little about until meeting him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a weird ending...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could not get over the end of this movie that seems like such a surprise twist. Why would Godfrey ever go along with the wedding? There is, in my opinion, not even a hint of budding romance on Godfrey's part, no repressed admiration or affection, and certainly no love. If Powell was trying to play secret admirer, he played the part a bit too well, because any affection he had for Irene seems like a delusion on her part.Irene on the other hand is beautifully portrayed by Lombard as the quintessential ditz. I'm not quite sure how old that word is, but it could have been invented to describe this character, flighty and fantasizing with no connection to the real world. She interprets Godfrey's putting her in the shower and leaving the house as loving her and then chases after him, as she has been chasing after him the entire movie, convinced that what she feels is love, rather than the infatuation that it probably is. The movie is beautiful, in spite, or perhaps because it is in black and white. Texture and shimmer become the color of the movie, decorating the characters and the scenery in just the right amount of glamor to depict the rich Bullocks and their world and draw you in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey" is one of the most underrated classic films of all time. Yes, I'm aware it was a big hit when it came out, and I know it was nominated for several academy awards (first to be nominated for all four acting categories), so why is it constantly overlooked when it comes to classic comedies? To me, this movie did something that not a lot of screwball comedies from the 1930s could do; it gets you invested. Usually these movies are too goofy and over the top for you to take them seriously, but "My Man Godfrey" has a very mature feel to it, which makes it stick out from the bunch. It has the right amount of drama to keep us invested, and it has the right amount of laughs to keep us entertained. I can't really think of another movie from this time period that has this perfect mix of comedy and drama. A lot of that is because of the intelligent writing, but where this movie's real strength lies is in its characters. The film is great in its way of spoofing high society during the depression era with the Bullock family. This is an unforgettable cast of characters. You have the scatterbrained mother, the spoiled, mean daughter, the kinder, but more naive daughter, the blowhard father (who doesn't seem to understand his own family), the wise cracking maid, and the mother's mooching protégé. But what completes this perfects cast is the contrast of the character Godfrey. He's so laid back, and normal compared to the Bullock family that we're on his side. We're with him as he deals with this family that is so far removed from the real world, and that's why he steals the show. Now this whole cast is amazing, don't get me wrong (it wouldn't work as well if the rest of the cast didn't contrast with the main character), but the main reason to see this movie is for William Powell's performance as Godfrey. Usually in this genre, characters like Rufus T. Firefly ("Duck Soup") or Susan ("Bringing Up Baby") steal the show, but here, it's the more down to earth character who steals the show. He's just one of those characters you want to be. He's so cool, so mysterious, and you know he's always one step ahead of the other characters. He reminds me of other famous characters like Mary Poppins, or Willy Wonka, who are also very mysterious characters who leave a lasting impact on the others around them. The film is only a little over 90 minutes long, but it accomplishes a lot in that time. It feels longer than it really is (in the good way), and by the end, you'll wish it were longer. This is a great movie, and one of the great classics of the 1930s. The only flaws it probably has are the ones that only apply to the time it was made. If you can't stand the classic Hollywood stereotypes, or the over the top acting, then get the fudge out. But if you like all that stuff and you want to travel back to a time that was more carefree and fun, then this movie is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure the film was funny and smart and had its witty one liners, afterall it is one of the early seminal works of the "Screwball Comedy" a genre and artform, a discipline all its own which seems to be on fire here in this film. The actors compliment one another and maintain cool control especially the lead man "William Powell" he sort of enchants you with his eyes and devious smile as well as his warm nature but it's always counterbalanced by his sensible and no bullshit allowed sharp tongue, he stands out to me more so than the rest who are too caricatured for my taste. In that sense some of the jokes and comedic setups if you will don't stand the test of time, or perhaps it's just too much for me to handle. At certain parts I felt myself lost as to the actual storyline, it's a matter of personal taste, patience and perhaps attention span and intelligence in this case. BUT what I adored about this film was the camera and the bewitching things it saw, the lighting it captured, the calm contour of each setting where it felt like it was all magically in the right place, nothing stuck out to my eye and disturbed me visually, everything blended into this glitzy glossy creamy visual mixture, things shined like halos, the cameras movements felt very natural very friendly to the viewer in fact the combination of all these things was so great it felt like my eyes were being massaged and there were moments where I was extremely close to just dozing off.</fullReview>

How one he works for tries to pull a trick on him by hiding her pearl necklace under his bed, ends badly for her as Godfrey uses his intelligence against her. But not only did he outsmart her, he did so with almost every person in the movie, he had the ladies wanting him, and with every decision, there was very ethical reasoning behind it.

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a wonderful comedy with a social theme that hit's home. Powell is brilliant in his role of butler, "a nobody," and in the end a social success. He brings laughter but also brings a heart-felt message. A message of charity and giving back, during a time in which hope and happiness were needed during the depression. Powell plays Godfrey wonderfully, and is enough reason to see this film, he pulls it all together. The ending is amazing with him repaying the Bullocks, and beating the social world and tough times. He makes you love him and his emotionless and yet full of emotion face, hits home.As for the time period of being filmed, it shows great improvements in the film industry with the use of the cameras in filming certain scenes. And the use of animals in the film, during the scavenger hunt seemed to be new for the time period as well, and being able to control the animals for the scene. Wonderfully filmed, and wonderfully acted was My Man Godfrey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is a wonderful movie to watch.

Godfrey's first day as butler was a great scene to watch because the camera followed along beautifully and still captured Godfrey's ability to remain cool and collected. Angelica, Carlo, and Irene add loads of comedic action to the film especially when Irene becomes a little faint. With a grand combination of their delightful ditsy comments, ability to eat all of the food in the house, and insisting love and attention for Godfrey the movie could go on and on and still seem oddly real. Godfrey ignored Irene so well it was hard for me personally to know if he had liked her back. The end may have been a little abrupt, getting married and all, but it showed that people can do well for others out of the goodness of their heart. In Irene's case the end showed that perseverance and good intentions are all one needs to follow their heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy with a social conscience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A flighty Park Avenue socialite (Lombard) runs into a vagrant (Powell) during a scavenger hunt and brings him home to be the family's new butler. Little does she know he is not what he appears to be. He's really a Boston blue blood in disguise, slumming for a reason, best explained in the movie. The socialite's family is composed of a absolutely nutty mother (Brady), an older, uptight and calculating sister (Patrick) and a long-suffering Wall Street-type father (Palette). There's also a slimy European type (Auer) hanging around the house, sponging off the family at the sufferance of the addled mom. "Godfrey" does his best to be a good butler until an old Harvard buddy (Mowbray) shows up at a house party and almost blows his cover. And of course, the younger daughter is smitten with her butler. This is a great comedy of the period, with a very serious undertone as it was made during the Great Depression. With the exception of the father, the palatial household's occupants are exposed for the callous fools they are, but in a forgiving Hollywood sort of way. Perhaps that's why GODFREY was the recipient of so many awards and so much acclaim. Powell steals the show, and Palette is a hoot as the father who doesn't know if his family is crazy or he is. Lombard, who admittedly is playing the giddiest of rich young ladies, unfortunately comes off as shrill a good part of the time. Patrick as the cunning older sister would do a horror film proud, she is so evil and vengeful. One of Lombard's last films, if I am not mistaken.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No need to repeat consensus points made by others. The movie is indeed expertly done in all departments. What surprises me is that the triumph comes from lowly Universal, a minor studio at the time. Nonetheless, the production values are first-rate. Catch that monumental trash heap at movie's outset. In the dim light it looks like one of the levels of Dante's Inferno, and furnishes a perfect setting for the city of forgotten men. Ditto the impressiveness of the cavernous hall where the teeming glitterati compete for a trophy signifying something or other. Note too, the spacious mansion interior with its beautifully winding staircase and well- appointed rooms. It's first-rate atmosphere for a narrative that moves from the depths of Depression era poverty to the heights of Park Avenue wealth. (In passing?it would seem no accident that Godfrey's surname is 'Park', thus suggesting the precariousness of the entire wealthy class, given his own fall from high status.) Anyway, producers La Cava and Rogers are owed a big salute, along with the Art Department and Special Effects, for creating such effective settings to go along with the great cast, sparkling script, and laugh-out-loud results. I'm just sorry all those nominated (6) didn't also take home Oscars. They deserved them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To be a gentleman, and a man of honor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very close friend of mine is somewhat of a throwback to the kind of man William Powell portrays in this very touching film about the antics of a socialite and her crush on a "down on his luck" regular Joe living in a unwarranted and misnamed "Hooverville".Powell's character, in spite of having the worst of vengeful behaviors pitted against him, and impish mischievousness likewise directed his way by the other sibling in the family, uses guile and honor to withstand, and in this sense combat, the trials and tribulations of social morays.Powell's character has a past. One not sorted with skeletons locked in bricked over closets, but one with a wounded heart. Even so he continues onward, undaunted. Unshaken. Steadfast.Prior to his adventure Godfrey spends his time with other men who have been the unfortunate victims of the bucket-shop mentality and the ensuing stock market crash. With no finances, no family, and fewer friends, he and others pool their resources, and makes a go of it exchanging philosophical heart to hearts and other truths with fellow forgotten men in the shanty towns that sprung up in 1930s America.Enter the blonde. Carol Lombard's character is naive but loving. To her the world is something to be enjoyed, and the people in it something to be cherished, if not played with in a very loving way. She comes across the tall stranger who, with all the trappings of an impoverished human, stands tall with dignity. His wealth is not in fiduciary concerns, but in his character. The gold that he holds is in his heart, not his wallet. Lombard's Bullock sees this on an instinctive and spiritual level. It is a connection that true lovers the world over know and feel.But Godfrey's hurts are deep. He does not let anyone see it, not show it. He keeps his reserve and comport to the public, though risks some brazenness in his privacy when he can afford it. He is a man of honor, but like a Greek hero is not above guile as a means of defense.Godrey is the kind of man that used to hail from the dawn of civilization, but to which has been forgotten in a day and age of pre-adolescent social norms. The high profile man of today is an aggressive teenager, with like tastes in popular culture. Today it is the Carlo who permeates the world as the desirable male icon. From law enforcement, to the sports' fan, to the investment banker, to the concert goer, to the grocery store checker. The Gen-Nexter has everything in common with Godfrey that a house fly has with a jumbo jet: Both fly, both are aerodynamically sound, but, the jet, unlike the fly, neither subsist on piles of dung nor annoys in its attention getting as does the Gen-Next male.In our day and age Godfrey wrongfully be labeled as effete or homosexual; i.e. having knowledge of culture, but refusing to act like a boor all the while retaining his personal pride. Were we to dress Godfrey in armor and give him a sword, then he'd be seen as the classic hero. Likewise were we to dress him up as a cowboy and give him a six-shooter, he'd be the classic western hero. But Godfrey is none of those. He is the essence of those men without the deadly implements.Truly, in our day and age of cesspool popular culture, a forgotten man.The film itself hails from a time when performance, not editing, not SFX, nor any other cinematic trickery, was the gold standard for a good film. For all the money invested in today's B-movie flops, "My Man Godfrey", to me, stands out as a classic piece of art that cannot be assayed by any number of test marketed films.Did I mention the ever alluring Carol Lombard? One of the most gifted actresses to grace the screen, Lombard delivers to us many a woman I met when I was coming of age. On that train of thought, I miss her. Dearly. But I digress.The film itself; one might call it a "champagne" film, but I think that's a mischaracterization of what the film is really about. It has all the trappings of a classic 1930s escapist entertainment, but it director Gregory La Cava was aiming for it to be more. And I think he succeeded beyond anything.Definitely worth seeing again and again. Buy a copy of "My Man Godfrey", today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There Are Two Kinds Of People - So Says Godfrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from an ending that to me seemed at first to lose some of the focus of the story (although there may be a point to that as well - see more later) I found this to be a movie that was both enjoyable and thought-provoking. Essentially the movie follows the lives of the members of the Bullock family through the eyes of Godfrey. The Bullocks are a sheltered and wealthy family who are completely self-absorbed and totally oblivious to the desperation of those who have been essentially lost in the Great Depression, to the point at which the "forgotten men" become nothing more than items to be found in a scavenger hunt held for the amusement of the wealthy. Godfrey (played absolutely perfectly by William Powell) is one of the forgotten men who happens to be "found" in the hunt by Irene (Carole Lombard) the somewhat flighty youngest Bullock daughter. Irene convinces her family to hire Godfrey as the family's new butler and we get pulled into the ridiculous lifestyle the Bullocks lead, as well as becoming increasingly intrigued by this mysterious and extremely well cultured derelict turned butler. As a social critique I thought this was marvellous, very effectively making its point about the sordidness of the extremely wealthy living in complete isolation from the suffering around them; making the point as well that the derelicts living at the city dump were much more of a "family" in every way that gives that word meaning than the Bullocks were.In the end, I thought the movie lost a bit of its power. The transformation of the Bullocks (especially Cornelia, played by Gail Patrick) happens too suddenly and seems far too complete, and the transformation of the city dump seemed too happy an ending for the type of social critique that was being made. This, of course, leads up to the last scene of the movie, which I referenced at the beginning. My initial reaction was that it was out of place; the marriage of Godfrey and Irene being too "romantic" for this kind of story. The more I thought about it, though, the more I realized that in fact it wasn't inappropriate. In fact, isn't Godfrey again being treated as a piece of meat for the amusement of Irene? In spite of her insistence that he loved her, I saw nothing in the character that indicated that. She was, perhaps, the most likable of the Bullocks, but in the end the marriage happens because she insists, and not because he expressed any desire to marry her. So, perhaps, even in what I initially thought was a sappy way to end the film, there was a point being made. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect entertainment for the Depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Man Godfrey" (1936): Having seen quite a few "Screwball" comedies, they seem to have a couple common goals: to take the audience's mind off the less-than-perfect world outside, and, aim rapid fire, relentless, snappy patter at your brain. You MUST pay attention, or you're quickly left behind. Maybe there's a third goal: somewhere in all the high speed exchanges you'll find a morality tale?the perfect "entertainment" during the American Great Depression. Carole Lombard, Alice Brady, Eugene Palette, and others ? all of whom take roles of flakey, pointless, self-centered RICH people ? find themselves facing a "Forgotten Man" (jobless, homeless), played by William Powell. Not EVERY thing IS as it seems, but for the most part, this is a story made for the average person still dealing with the collapsed U.S. market. It's funny, demanding, full of wonderful sets and costumes, and reminds us that there are more important things in life than having a full wallet.</fullReview>

This is escapism entertainment at it's best, with loads of laughs, but with a reminder of the reality that makes us see our own frailties and relate easily to the characters in the story. It's a humourous glimpse at the human condition, and it is indeed very funny! See it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning of the film, Cornelia (Gail Patrick) visits the city dump and selects a tramp, Godfrey (William Powell) to come with her and present himself in a traditional game that the idle rich play. He refuses, but instead goes with her sister Irene (Carole Lombard). Irene falls in love with him and hires him as the family butler. He spends most of the film pandering to Irene's crazy family before springing a surprise on them........and love is in the air...My girlfriend liked this film and it starts well with an amusing idea. Unfortunately, we are also given a taste of the annoying things to come when we are introduced to Irene's family, especially Alice Brady as her mother. The shouting scenes between her and Eugene Palette as the father are utterly pointless and extremely irritating. Brady keeps this up throughout the film. Mischa Auer as "Carlo" is his usual self - someone whose character doesn't quite work, and the whole film is NOT at all funny although it is meant to be. You might laugh once or twice at Irene's behaviour but that is your lot.It's a completely unbelievable story and the only character that is any good is William Powell. He is obviously not interested in Irene, yet ends up living with her....!!! What a load of crap........unfunny, annoying crap with Alice Brady winning the crap trophy. Keep her off the screen! Poor William Powell - he has done far better than this irritating nonsense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Man Godfrey is one of the finest screwball comedies ever made. Performances are sharp from a well chosen cast with William Powell delivering in an Oscar caliber performance as "forgotten man" turned butler Godfrey Park / Godfrey Smith. A nice turn by Alan Mowbray in one of his rare non-butler roles as the snide but warm pal of Powell. Powell's ex-wife Carole Lombard is heartwarming as the befuddled society girl and Gail Patrick is the perfect foil as her haughty, spoiled sister. Interesting how a '30s film can still be relevant nearly 70 years later. The rich still dehumanize the poor. My Man Godfrey is a valentine to the downtrodden. The wealthy are shown as vain fools while the working class are shown as the savvy backbone of society. A lot of truth to be found in such a lighthearted film. Snappy, artsy direction by La Cava and some of the wittiest dialog you'll hear this side of Preston Sturges!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, Carole Lombard is so far above todays actress that it is unfair to even comment. An incredible cast that hits their mark on every part. The face of an angel and comedy timing that is rare in todays movies. Hollywood has forgotten how to make sexy, comedies without the use of cheap language. This movie is every bit as funny and kittenish hot without any nudity, or overt sexual situations. I have guys over who groan about watching a chick-flick and show up 3 months later to see it again. I own a B&amp;W and colorized version and find something new on the sets or in the casting of smaller parts every time I watch it.If Gable was "the man's man", then Lombard was "the guy's gal". It is incredible when people mention the old time actress', she is too often overlooked except by only the most serious writers. Always a Dietrich, Garbo, Colbert or such photo. It is rare to find a Lombard. TCM sold me on nearly forgotten actress of the 30's and this is one of the best examples. I put it just above "It Happened One Night" because even though it is a period piece, its presentation is more timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this amusing and heavily Oscar-nominated comedy, William Powell as super-butler Godfrey believes the only difference between a democrat and a derelict "is a job." From the moment Carole Lombard as Irene Bullock asks Godfrey "Can you Butle?" this movie drifts outside the realm or Frank Capra or Preston Sturges realism and into the cotton candy landscape of Hollywood fantasies about there being NO limits to what a load of nonsense movie goers will swallow. Just to mention one of innumerable possible examples from MY MAN GODFREY, this plot posits that HALF the value of a stockbroker's birthday gift necklace to his daughter is enough to acquire a controlling share of the broker's own firm (and that the other half covers the cost of putting Manhattan's homeless population into a swank new nightclub\condominium project built over the city dump)--and that there's enough liquidity left over to redeem the magic necklace out of hock and let it rest a bit before performing new miracles! What will Godfrey do next--make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, or walk across the East River in August in order to turn water into wine for New Jersey picnickers?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very fun multiple Oscar nominated entertaining movie from 1936, starring William Powell in the title role.It's not the type of comedy that makes you laugh out loud but more the type of movie that keeps you entertained throughout, through its charm and the no-worries type of atmosphere.But its definitely a movie that has its flaws. It certainly isn't the classic must-see comedy that everybody says it is in my opinion. One of the movie its problems are its characters. Godfrey himself is one great character but all of the others are mostly over-the-top and stereotypical comedy characters. Also the main love-interested, which plays an essential role in the movie, isn't really what I would call a likable one. It's a young spoiled rich brag, who cries and screams to get what she wants. And we are supposed to root for this girl to get married to Godfrey? Also the movie is quite moralistic and does have a message in it. This really wasn't necessary and feels forcedly fabricated and things lay too much on the top.Having said that, it's not really a movie you could ever hate. Through its simplicity you can be nothing but entertained by this movie. It's also true though that its very same simplicity and story are a reason why I just don't see this movie as a perfect genre movie of its era. It's a movie with a good cast (it also received 4 acting Oscar-nominations) and especially William Powell does a good job with the movie its main character. All of the other actors go a bit over-the-top in their roles but their obviously some fine actors, so you sort of tend to look through it.It's a fun movie, although its certainly is receiving more praise at the moment than I would ever give it.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Gail Patrick (Cornelia) was the first bitch goddess in Hollywood. She later made a fortune as the Executive Producer of the long running Perry Mason television series.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The screwball comedy genre, as a whole, dated terribly, more so than almost anything else made in the 30's and 40's; My Man Godfrey stands the test of time better than most, mainly thanks to the fact that - in contrast to the usual tradition of screwball - the male lead in this film, played by William Powell, is an interesting and layered character with some mystery to him, rather than a stiff, dull, uncharismatic robot. Powell's Godfrey seems to not be aware that he's in a screwball comedy, which makes the romantic scenes - especially the ending - forced and awkward; but the romance in My Man Godfrey is its worst aspect anyway, and it feels as if it was tacked on just to make the film conform to the genre, and Carole Lombard often looks like she's embarrassed to be a part of it and wants to get it over with as quickly as possible. It's better to ignore that, and focus on the film's stronger points - Powell' straight-man performance, the social satire, and wonderful supporting roles by Alice Brady, Eugene Palette, Jean Dixon and of course Mischa Auer, who delivers the film's most hilariously over-the-top moments. At any rate, My Man Godfrey is probably essential for film history buffs and screwball lovers, and also for graphic designers for one of the finest title sequences of the 1930's; by its own right, it's an entertaining and zany little comedy that's still worth seeing.</fullReview>

This was a slapstick comedy, which means physical and pointless humor ensued. This movie was restricted due to the moral movie codes at the time so there was not much that could have been done besides plot and acting. I am a fan of pushing the boundaries and shocking the audience and this movie shocked me into boredom. I will however, mention that the acting was done very nicely. The sister was a complete imbecile that only a professional actress could portray. The opening credits were spectacular, only to be shadowed by the horrible humor and unbelievable situations.

Director Gregory La Cava seems to care little about contrasting the tones of the material, instead going overboard with the rampant silliness until the scenario no longer resembles anything human. Lombard is encouraged to play this to the hilt, while some viewers may long (in vain) for a little subtlety. What cleverness there is early on leaks out, leaving a good cast to fend for themselves.

		<shortDescription>Tries too hard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the result of a scavenger hunt thrown by a group of wealthy New Yorkers, Godfrey Smith is retrieved from a New York City dump by Irene Bullock and brought in as a "forgotten man." In spite of Godfrey's being a derelict, there is a certain appeal to the man and Irene hires him as the Bullock family butler and designates him as her "protégé," in imitation of her mother's live-in singer/pianist protégé named Carlo. To the mix add in Irene's airhead mother, a calculating sister, and a beleaguered businessman father and you have the setup for this comedy."My Man Godfrey" tries awfully hard to be zany, but was only modestly successful for me. There are some funny lines, many of which are delivered by Eugene Palette as Irene'e father, and some crazy antics, like Carlo's running around in the living room acting like an ape or hanging on the window trellis whenever he is criticized, but I had problems with this movie.There is always a question of how much leeway you give a movie like this in terms of believability; there were many scenes here that exceeded my tolerance. Can you believe that a Harvard-educated wealthy Bostonian would wind up in a NYC dump? In 1936 the unemployment rate was running around 17% - would Godfrey have been in that 17%? I doubt it. And could Godfrey have done enough short selling of stocks to save Bullock from his company's demise? Unlikely, given that the SEC was established two years before. Would the Bullock sisters have gone into a city dump at night to speak to the derelicts living there? And so on.Many things got on my nerves, like Irene's faked fainting spells and Mrs. Bullock's seeing pixies. And all of the derelicts in the dump were such fine people of integrity - where were the drunks and mental cases?And then there is the "message" part of the film that left me confused as to how to respond. Comments and situations about the evils of welfare and the unequal distribution of wealth were mixed in with the breezy music and atmosphere. I think I know what is implied by Smith's comment, "The only difference between a derelict and a man is having a job," but I was left at sea as to what definition of "man" was being used. And that comment is a bit of an overstatement.Social commentary of the era could be successfully mixed with comedy, such as the class distinctions treated in "Holiday" (with Katherine Hepburn and Carry Grant), but the social commentary in "My Man Godfrey" is confused rather than pointed. Consider how Godfrey achieves his success at the end of the film - he stole an expensive set of pearls from his employers and used those as collateral to pitch a scheme to a past friend - a member of the wealthy elite. That success story must have been an inspiration for Depression-Era moviegoers to try to emulate.As to Lombard's Irene, I guess I prefer female leads to be intelligent and independent rather than ditzy and moony.I give high marks to the introductory credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bullocks of Mayberry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films that have great stories and performances have sections that still seem a bit flat-- even motion picture classics that IMDb users give a full ten stars. This morning I watched MY MAN GODFREY, noticing that it was obviously a big budget picture for Universal the year it was made. And we have the cream of the crop in Hollywood on screen in lead and support. Greg La Cava's direction is for the most part quite good. Even the lighting in some scenes is very artistic, plus we have them wearing all those wonderful evening gowns and tuxedoes. Without a doubt, a lot of money and care went into the production. But...those kitchen scenes where Godfrey and the maid talk about the family (meant to give us background information) are as dull as dishwater. Not dull mind you because of the performances, and the dialogue is still razor sharp-- but because all La Cava does is keep the camera in a stationary position in front of the counter as they talk and get ready to take breakfast upstairs. There is nothing visually interesting happening in that scene. There is very little detail paid to using the set in a way that might show (rather than tell) how well-to-do the Bullocks are in society, or how strange they behave. I felt like I was watching a scene in The Andy Griffith Show with Aunt Bee getting the food ready. It truly was no better than an average sitcom scene. These moments in GODFREY stick out even more, because the rest of the film is made with such style, sophistication and flair. On stage we may accept a cheaply constructed set (especially if it's built on wheels and has to be moved quickly between scenes). However, in a movie, especially an A budget film, it is the job of the director and cinematographer to address the flatness. It is up to them to add touches that will mask the cheapness of a set or to draw attention to details that can better explain the story instead of having it told to us in the form of expository dialogue.Am I making too much of this? Perhaps. But these aspects make it less a ten-star motion picture than some people enthusiastically regard it.</fullReview>

A combination of morality tale, treatise on the dignity of man and comedy of manners, it strives so hard for the Capra or Sturges touch but frankly misses by miles.It starts well enough after a superb "city lights" title sequence, then with the opening encounter at a Hooverville camp of two socialite sisters Carole Lombard and Gail Patrick encountering "forgotten man" Powell, but too soon he's morphed into the perfect butler and somehow stolen the heart of younger sister Lombard and gained the enmity of her snooty older sister Patrick. I know that screwball comedies often have fantastic plots but this is all too much to swallow in one sitting. None of the cast are in the least likable or sympathetic, with the arguable exception of the always watchable Eugene Palette as the long-suffering family patriarch. This is the first time I've seen a film starring Ms Lombard and have to say I was far from impressed. She overacts terribly and has the volume button set to 11 throughout. Powell seems far too old for her and there appears little spark between them (weird considering they used to be married) and I failed to perceive his charm to all and sundry. As usual he gets to do a seen-it-before tipsy scene and otherwise seems to play throughout in the one key. To top it off there's a hanger-on of the mother's, her protégé, if you will, who gets to act like a gorilla and eat like a pig. Very strange.No, I was left cold and unamused by this would-be uplifting farce and thought about how much better Hawks or the afore-mentioned Capra or Sturges would have handled this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...mere quarks and electrons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Physicists,commendably, have discerned that we contemplative, noble, base, foolish, wise, circumspect and regardless beings exist in a realm consisting of quarks and electrons energized by four forces only; gravitation, electromagnetism, and two others, obscure and unsensed and sub-atomic. From these bagatelles evolved Carole Lombard and her portrayal of the thoughtless socialite in My Man Godfrey. One is inclined to celebrate the author of this evolution ; alas base reason intrudes to dissuade us and lead us to inevitable and converse conclusions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry, but this one is vastly overrated...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAROLE LOMBARD is a ditsy rich girl, the kind that always played the leads in screwball comedies of the '30s, when audiences hungered for something rich, wealthy and luxurious to revel in when they went to the movies. And here they get art deco interiors of a very wealthy, but unfortunately for us--totally loony characters who inhabit the place.MY MAN GODFREY is a fairy-tale of a screwball type, but without a shred of believability about its many twists and turns as a man is taken from a city dump and turned into a respectable butler for the idle rich. Of course, it turns out that he's not really a hobo but a man with a cause (and actually quite a wealthy one), and he finds his work cut out for him when he lands in the clutches of Lombard and her crazy family.It's several notches below other screwball comedies of the period, but you'd never know it from all the fuss made about it from fans of CAROLE LOMBARD and WILLIAM POWELL. Powell is at his best but the script is a lot of nonsense with a message buried somewhere but try to find it.ALAN MOBRAY and GALE PATRICK do nicely in supporting roles but ALICE BRADY is given to shrill and unpleasant bits of over-acting as the scatterbrained mother.Summing up: Not the best screwball comedy of the '30s--far from it--but it still has a reputation that can't be denied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard for years that this was a great screwball comedy, perhaps a cut below "It Happened One Night." But this one piles one improbability upon another right at the outset. Powell is living in a dump -- for obscure reasons of his own -- but is selected as butler to the Bullocks. The problem, though, is that Lombard is given no part to play (Academy Award Nominee?). She's a brainless blonde whose only talent is to simulate crying fits. The sophisticated Powell would have nothing to do with her, except that the script says he must. Alice Brady is insufferable as the mother, a Billy Burke imitation, and a bad one at that. But Gail Patrick, biting, sardonic, beautiful, is great in this flick. Screwball comedies demand pace and plotting. This one has neither, and tries to add an "important social message" as well. Powell and Patrick would have been a good pairing in some film other that this one. Some films -- Chaplin, Keyton, for example -- are still funny today. Other films -- and this is an example -- make one wonder why people laughed way back then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY MAN GODFREY in living color!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MY MAN GODFREY has been available only in dreary black-and-white dupes, as it was allowed to go public domain by Universal. Even Turner Classic movies has shown only a dupe print. Now, this sparkling comedy has been colorized by 20th Century Fox, and it is an immaculate print that proves that colorization has come of age. To silence those "purists" who think they have a right to tell me how I should view a film, MY MAN GODFREY is also available on the DVD in the original black-and-white.I never saw a comedy which would not be better served by color, and I must say, I have seen at least 100 black-and white films that begged for color, but I have never seen a color film that would have been better in black-and-white!God bless FOX!</fullReview>
