		<shortDescription>That Connie Francis sure can sing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2003 Turner Classic Films had a poll where fans could vote (out of a list)for films they would like to see on DVD. The top five vote getters would be the films getting the DVD treatment. Surprisingly, this is one of the five films that voters preferred along with Days of Wine and Roses, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Postman Always Rings Twice, and The Wind and the Lion. It's a testament to how well this film has held up for the past forty-three years, not an easy task considering it's subject matter.The basic premise is this: Four college girls escape the freezing north during spring break and head to Ft. Lauderdale because as the title says, that's where the boys are. Not much to make a film about I suppose, but stories have hit the big screen with a lot less plot than that going for them. What Where The Boys Are does have going for it is a witty ahead of it's time script by screenwriter George Wells (based on a novel by Glendon Swarthout), a cast of attractive relatively new stars assembled by producer Joe Pasternak and some nice Florida Scenery.The cast is headed by Dolores Hart as Merritt Andrews. Although having a high I.Q., Merritt is having trouble in college because she has a tendency to say what's on her mind, and sometimes what's on her mind must have sent a shiver down the spine of many parents in the early sixties. In one class, she dares to suggest that premarital sex (playing house is how she puts it I think) might not only be OK but quite necessary. Daring stuff in those days. It also immediately gives us a more complex character in Merritt which helps lift this film a cut above others in this genre. Dolores Hart is exceptional as Merritt, and because of this she is the center of our attention from the beginning of the film to the end. Ms. Hart is one of those actresses whom was never given a chance to show us her real potential in the short time she was an actress before answering her calling to enter the convent. Pay close attention to her performance as Merritt as I did and you'll understand what we may have missed.Paula Prentiss makes her big screen debut as Tuggle and immediately shows a fine screen persona with a flair for comedy. She's the one who has vowed to be a "good girl". In other words, no wedding ring, no hanky panky. The parents of the sixties probably loved her.Yvette Mimeaux plays naive freshman Melanie. She ends up taking Merritt's ideas in class about sex and putting them into action. In 1960's morals, we know she's headed for trouble and was probably the poster girl for parents to point out the evils that would befall you for indulging in a little bit of bedroom parlor games. Mimeaux is OK in the role, it's just a role that isn't written very well and probably the weakest part of the film. Connie Francis is a revelation as girl hockey player, Angie. We are never given her views on sex so you can paint her in a neutral corner. For some reason (I guess because she's a hockey player)she has trouble getting a guy. I seriously doubt someone who looks like her would have that kind of a problem, but Francis plays the role in a ditsy kind of way. She's adorable, and we love her. Add to this the fact that the girl can sing up a storm and you'll replay the opening titles several times just to hear that heart throbbing voice.Then there's the fellows. Jim Hutton plays TV Thompson, a hitchhiker who has a thing about hats, that the girls pick up on their way to Fort Lauderdale. He hooks up with Tuggle, and their wit blends together so perfectly, that Hutton and Prentiss went on to make several more films together. Their moments together on screen are priceless. George Hamilton plays Merritt's love interest Ryder. Ryder is a millionaire who goes to Princeton, rides around in his grandfather's yacht and has eyes for Merritt. Hamilton is playing the usual George Hamilton type of role, but for this film it's perfect as Ryder Smith would probably be just like George or vice versa. His scenes with Merritt are very cleverly written. He attempts to find a way to seduce her, but knows she is way too intelligent to fall for the standard come ons. They have good chemistry together. Frank Gorshin plays a nearly blind jazz musician named Basil, whom Angie seems to end up with by default. It works because they both seem to have a whacked out comedy sense. Unfortunately, all poor Melanie can end up with is a couple of wicked evil guys who want her for only one thing and I'm sure you know what that is. John Brennan as Dill and Rory Harrity as Franklin manage to be sleazy enough to do what they have to do, than you can forget them both which apparently most people did as evidenced by their lack of screen credits after this film. Also on hand are a delightful Barbra Nichols as the sea nymph and Chill Wills in a couple of brief but funny scenes as a police captain.Where this film excels is in the performances and chemistry of it's young cast. Together they make for many enjoyable screen moments. Where it greatly falters is in some of it's very out dated premises about relationships between men and women. Despite the fact that they are all college women, Where The Boys Are would still have us believe that the only thing these women are interested in is finding the right guy who will wrap a ring around their finger. Even Merritt, who is outspoken early in the film, ends up wanting nothing more than to get Ryder and his millions down the aisle. The fact that this film also falls back on the premise that if you hop in the hay with a guy, you'll suffer severe penalties for it. This is hammered home by the presence of Melanie. Because she makes the "mistake" of doing what nice girls shouldn't, she automatically is punished for it. Enough of the film is taken up with this aspect, that it continually brings a cloud cover over the proceedings and bogs down an otherwise enjoyable film.My advice is to overlook the drama. Enjoy the witty dialog, the on screen chemistry of the stars, the Florida scenery, and listen to Connie Francis belt out Where The Boys Are a few times. Heck, that alone is enough for me to give this film a B.   </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double Standards Bedevil Coeds in Groundbreaking Spring Break Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forty-five years have elapsed since its original release, but it is amazing how this 1960 film introduced a particular genre that continues to be produced today granted in a far more explicit manner - the spring-break, beach-party movie where attractive teens go through a sun-drenched mating ritual and somehow love triumphs over carnal knowledge. Back then, the concept didn't seem quite as jaded as it does now, and consequently there is an entertaining naiveté about the timeworn story of four co-eds from a snowy Midwestern college who journey to Ft. Lauderdale for spring break to meet boys.The plot is based on the then-accepted notion that girls in college are only marking time waiting for husbands to come along, but the journey to that goal depends on the girl. The four in question are Merritt, a smart blonde who is not living up to her academic potential as she questions the moral code around premarital sex; Melanie, so deeply insecure she mistakes sex for love with a less-than-honorable Ivy Leaguer; Tuggle, a tall brunette who zeroes in on an even taller, eccentric hitchhiker; and Angie, the supposedly plain one who gets used to being ignored by men.Directed in a perfunctory fashion by Henry Levin, this is not the type of movie where you are terribly impressed with the performances, but I have to say the acting is certainly miles above subsequent beach-party movies. Elvis' former leading lady Dolores Hart plays Merritt credibly even as she is being seduced by a youthful George Hamilton wanly playing Ryder, a well-to-do Ivy Leaguer with a conveniently located yacht. As the most troubled of the girls, Yvette Mimieux (always loved her name) accurately captures the constantly forlorn, little-girl-lost state of Melanie, a teen-aged Blanche du Bois in the making.So pert and charming as Angie, Connie Francis actually seems miscast as a plain-Jane, especially when she sings "Turn on the Sunshine" with a stage polish completely out of character. The standout is Paula Prentiss who portrays Tuggle with her unique personality in full bloom and partnered the first of several times with Jim Hutton as the comically obnoxious TV. She is an under-appreciated comedienne with a loopy charm and vibrantly twangy voice all her own - it's a shame her career never really took off the way it deserved to.I think the film does make a valid, sometimes even perceptive attempt to address the confusion that Eisenhower-era girls had over sex and love. Girls were expected to function under a double-standard where the only way to attract boys was to have something to offer but at the price of their reputations. This point is hammered home when the tone shifts in the last portion to melodrama. At the same time, the film is filled with predictable comic scenes, including a contrived m?lée in an underwater tank with the zaftig and nasal Barbara Nichols as Esther Williams-wannabe Lola Fandango.Prentiss offers her services and remembrances to the alternate audio commentary track on the DVD, which also comes with a looking-back featurette which includes interviews with Prentiss and Francis. Who knew this film would launch a hundred imitations? The minute you hear Francis sing the title tune, it is hard for a baby boomer not to get nostalgic. If you have an interest in understanding the mid-century moral code enforced upon the youth of America, especially girls, I can think of worse films to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your typical romp on the beach...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film succeeds in the sense that it isn't a stereotypical beach flick. As a current college student, I can attest that it is rather believable, and, oddly enough, some of it applies to college gals today...nearly 40 years later. Actually, WHERE THE BOYS ARE offers the public a fairly realistic, in-depth portrayal of everyday kids in the 60s, as opposed to other beach movies of the period. Simply put: Frankie and Annette had nothing on these gals! Contrary to what the title may lead one to believe, the focal point is not terribly superficial. Yeah, sure, the girls head to Lauderdale to nab a Yaley or two, but that becomes somewhat secondary to what actually transpires. Whether it was meant to be or not, this film is one of decisions, learning, and friendships that are strengthened due to the experiences four college girls share during Spring Break in Ft. Lauderdale. The actors themselves are very believable; none of the main players outdo the others. Hart, Mimeux, Francis, and Prentiss do a wonderful job of conveying many different sides to the characters they portray. The supporting cast is equally skilled and effective in varying roles.Though this isn't Academy Award winning material, it is definitely worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A frank discussion of the intersection of sex and marriage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others who have commented previously on Where the Boys Are (WTBA), I was initially rather shocked at the film's frank discussion of sex. Once I thought about it more deeply, however, it was the open talk of marriage that was really fresh to my ears. I was born 11 years after this film was released and watching movies like this gives me a unique insight into history that goes well beyond the broad brushes of most sixties reviews and textbooks. Clearly both boys and girls of the time were struggling with the implications of sexuality in relationships - not a whole lot different than today.What is different about WTBA than the films for young people of today or of my youth (e.g., The Breakfast Club) is the explicit discussion of marriage. In WTBA both the girls and the boys use different levers to try to achieve their ends. The girls use the potential for sex to get the one thing they want - marriage - and the boys use the potential for marriage to get what they are after - sex. I was amazed to hear that all the girls (even the one with an IQ of 138!) were so focussed on catching a husband at 19. None of the movies for youth that I have seen recently even touch the subject of marriage except maybe to joke about it.While many would argue that no one gets married at 19 anymore, that ultimate end of any relationship still looms out there for young people like a giant prize (or punishment) at the end of dating. The only help I got in seeing young people get together and eventually get married was in The Princess Bride, which could easily be dismissed as fairy tale. I recall in my late teens having to turn to more adult movies like When Harry Met Sally or even Enchanted April to find some guidance for seeing a relationship through to its logical end. Maybe today's youth are skipping over She's All That and going to movies like High Fidelity for similar answers. One would hope so.So instead of a breezy beach movie I got a social history lesson on the mating rituals of my parents' generation. I hope there's a movie that prompts this kind of discussion for my own kids someday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shockingly frank look at sexuality for its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mother sent me to see this film when I was about 9 or 10 expecting a good wholesome beach movie, and I was shocked! (If she only knew!). 1) A girl actually advocated pre-marital sex! (but was hypocritical about practicing her ideas) 2) Another girl actually did it! (although nothing was shown, not even kissing) 3) Another girl said she only wanted to have babies! (nothing new here, except for her honesty) 4) Another girl was horny, and tried to do something about it. 5) And of course the boys actually came out and asked for sex, although couched in the "decent" terms of the fifties/sixties.People (mostly "liberated" women) complain that this movie was about oppression of women (they didnt feel "complete" without a man), but this was women's liberation (women were horny and honest about it)The marvelous casting and dialogue made this film one of the great american classics of its genre that still holds up today.definitely a 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where The Boys Are (1960 Dir. Henry Levin) Fort Lauderdale College Spring Break! Oh Boy! Oh Girl! See where the perennially tan George Hamilton first acquired his swarthy complexion. Also features one of the best '60s light comediennes Paula Prentiss as "Tuggle Carpenter". Lots of talk amongst the girls about how far they should go. Lots of talk amongst the boys about how far they've gotten. A classic American take on life when the air was clean and sex was dirty. Before there was MTV's Spring Break, there was this movie. Great for viewing with mixed company (that's old-fashioned slang for boys and girls together).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beach Movie Rides Along On The Crest Of A Wave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While listening to a Connie Francis CD yesterday, I read the liner notes and found that she had made a few appearances in films. This morning, in one of those all too rare spooky coincidences, I found that Where The Boys Are was on TCM.I watched with anticipation and smiled from start to finish - except of course when the comedy turned to drama, a transition that was expertly handled by the director.A fun film in the tradition of Muscle Beach and Muscle Beach Party, with good performances all round and an excellent turn from Frank Gorshin. I shall never be able to listen to jazz in the same way again! It's a shame that Connie Francis did not appear on screen more often, as judging by this, her debut, she could easily have enjoyed as much success as an actress as she did a singer.Not as camp as the two aforementioned Frankie Avalon classics, though I'm sure "Have You Met Miss Fandango?" had drag queens squealing with delight.If you are ever in need of cheering up, you could do worse than to watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the saying goes, "it is what it is." Cutting edge (for 1960) teen drama holds up well, with excellent performances by several of the leads. Although it doesn't appear they actually filmed the majority of the film in Florida, there are still some wonderful shots on location in Fort Lauderdale. That community has since banned the Spring Break crowd, but I remember it well in the 60s - 80s, when living in the area.Many users have complained about the "moralizing" of this film, but I don't find it "preachy." Prentiss is indeed a standout. Connie Francis is adequate, if somewhat masculine, in her first film role. "Narrator" Paul Frees seems to pop up in the oddest places, including The Haunted Mansion ride for Disney.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHERE THE BOYS ARE is very much worth seeing, although extremely dated and a movie that would probably make today's 18 year-old laugh out loud at the innocent boy-meets-girl shenanigans of kids in an era before string bikinis and drunken riots in Fort Lauderdale.Delores Hart is the crown jewel in this, the very first, "beach movie" that launched a whole summertime surf-romance culture of sand and two- piece swimsuits that, just a few years later, spawned Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon in their BEACH BLANKET money-makers.Hart is the embodiment of the girl next door with a face that could melt granite as she, Connie Francis, Yvette Mimeaux, and Paula Prentiss drive down to Fort Lauderdale during spring break in search of boys. They hook up with Frank Gorshin, Jim Hutton, and rich boy George Hamilton. The antics that ensue are so saccharine you could pour them over ice cream as a substitute for chocolate syrup. It is the Hart-Hamilton romance that is the focal point as Hamilton tries unsuccessfully to seduce Hart on his father's yacht. Near the end, Hart thinks he has dumped her when he fails to show. A disconsolate Hart is left alone on the beach and wonders if she'll ever meet Mr. Right. The final scene between Hart and Hamilton offers a touching romantic twist and caps the whole thing nicely. Of course, the movie's theme song, WHERE THE BOYS ARE, would become Connie Francis'signature piece in years to come.WHERE THE BOYS ARE is certainly dated, but its depiction of a benign teen culture shows us the world of summertime youth before mores,language, and music took a radical turn toward sex, drugs, and rock and roll.TRIVIA: Anyone who doubts the existence of real, religious vocation should study the life of Delores Hart. She had made about 8-10 movies including two with Elvis--KING CREOLE and LOVING YOU. Then making the whopping sum of about $50,000 a picture, she was being groomed as the next Grace Kelley when she announced, in 1964, she was entering a convent to become a Catholic nun! Studio producers were beside themselves and most of Hollywood reacted with skepticism thinking it was a publicity stunt. She was, in fact, engaged at that time and her fiancée was heartbroken. But she entered a convent in Bethlehem, Conn. and remains there to this day as Mother Delores!...About 2-3 yrs. ago Hart was interviewed on 20--20 and disclosed she had a rare and painful nervous disorder that limits her movements. But her spirits were high and she spoke easily of the old Hollywood days, hiding nothing, even describing Presley as sensitive and a great guy...Yvette Mimeaux would marry MGM dance choreography Stanley Donan in the 1970's...Paula Prentiss would marry actor Richard Benjamin (GOODBYE COLUMBUS)...And Connie Francis? This is a life story waiting to be produced on the screen. For anyone interested in the real life tragedy of Connie Francis, read WHO'S SORRY NOW.....Dennis Caracciolo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hysterical when Frank Gorshin fell into the fish tank followed by the rest of the gang. "Where The Boys Are" is one of the best movies of the sixties. Anyone who came of age at that time can definitely relate to the magical love Merritt found, the tragedy that Melanie experienced, the wanting to be loved and accepted as did Tuggle and Angie. The suave George Hamilton made many a young girls heart race faster. Girl crazy Jim Hutton with his style setting baseball hats and comedic personality was simply hilarious. The title song, one of my favorites still gives me chills. I have seen this movie countless times and I love the nostalgia it brings back each time. When it airs, enjoy it at least once. You will love it, I promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where is the beach?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This MGM beach comedy and cult favorite directed by veteran Henry Levin caused quite a commotion when released, with its discussion of premarital sex among young Americans in 1960. Those were the days when "A Summer Place", "Gidget" and other films were pushing the limits of censorship. In this production, the approach to sex is direct but lighthearted and it all seems like great fun, until the final act when Jim Hutton lusts after Barbara Nichols, leaving Paula Prentiss behind, and most of all when Yvette Mimieux is abused. Unfortunately it was done under the still reigning Hays Code, so in the end the proper and nice couples are planning weddings. Nevertheless, it's fun to watch (Sister) Dolores Hart discussing petting with a teacher who sends her straight to the principal's office, Paula Prentiss defining herself as a baby factory, Yvette Mimieux blaming herself for being too lovely and Connie Francis just singing and being the comic relief ?although Prentiss, Hutton, Nichols, Frank Gorshin and Chill Wills also provide a chuckle here and there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a Movie reviewer who has what he calls "guilty pleasure" movies or, movies that a serious movie buff might not own up to watching but which he enjoys watching never the less. This is one of those movies. It is fun inspite of all the "trashines". The acting is excellent throughout the cast. It is enjoyable to see the locations used that are easily recognizable for any one who has been to Ft. Lauderdale. The movie has too many funny parts to list, and in the other reviews on this site many have been cited. I would like to add one. In the beginning when Chill Wills and Chief of Police talks to the assembled troopers about how to handle the invasion of the students. A real classic scene.

		<fullReview>It may look like another boys &amp; girls on the beach movie, but there's a bit more happening here than in your average Frankie &amp; Annette beach frolic. There IS a message here, no matter how clumsily delivered, about the way men (or boys) use women and how some women, no matter how strong, feel somehow incomplete without a man. Any man. What makes this all a bit easier to digest is a cast of four really sharp actresses who bring enough baggage (emotional, that is) to provide layers to this film that the screenwriter may never have imagined. The vastly underrated Paula Prentiss, Yvette Mimieux, Connie Francis and especially Dolores Hart are all accomplished actresses. It's all a bit corny, but extremely appealing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delores Hart, Yvettte Mimeux, Paula Prentiss, and Connie Francis are "Where the Boys Are," a 1960 film about spring break in Fort Lauderdale. The boys are Jim Hutton, George Hamilton, and Frank Gorshin.The four young women drive down to Fort Lauderdale for spring break, with an agenda of having fun and meeting men. The exception to this is Merritt (Hart) who has some school work to catch up on. The first reel is the last we hear of school work. With the exception of Angie (Connie Francis), the gals meet guys immediately - Tuggle (Prentiss) meets TV (Hutton), who hitches a ride to Lauderdale with them; Merritt meets the wealthy Ryder (George Hamilton), and frail, pretty Melanie (Mimieux) meets Dill (John Brennan). Angie later meets a jazz musician (Gorshin).The questions are, can true love be found during spring break? And, how far do you have to go to hook a man? Despite Merritt's free-thinking, she and Tuggle intend to stay pure; Angie doesn't have a choice; and Merritt -- Merritt is in for some tough realizations.All in all, a fun movie and a great look at the '50s mores and the power of the Hays code, which was still punishing girls who had sex before marriage.The best things about Where the Boys Are is seeing all these stars as young and fresh, with their movie careers just beginning, and another chance to hear Connie Francis sing the title song and "Turn on the Sunshine." She was terrific. Barbara Nichols plays a sexy performer and does "Have you Met Miss Fandango?" With the exception of Delores Hart, who became a nun, all of these youngsters would go on to successful careers. The young man who played Dill, John Brennan, was blackballed after yelling at a director who was demeaning the singer Odetta; he went on to work behind the scenes and killed himself in 2007 after his wife's death. Already a huge singing star by 1960, Francis, of course, is still singing after a miserable life that includes the death of her brother, rape, and a bipolar disorder.Spring breaks today still have plenty of booze and suntans but also plenty of everything else (including young women disappearing) - enjoy this film about a much more innocent time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cult Classic &amp; Time Capsule...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike it's remake "Where The Boys Are '84", which starred over-the-hill actors as college kids, "Where The Boys Are" cast young, college-aged stars. One interesting thing about this film is that it could have spawned a big, money-making blockbuster soundtrack album, but it didn't. Aside from the theme song, plus 2 others sung during the film, music is not a big part of this movie, story is. Another interesting thing about this movie is the outdoor location shots. Unlike Elvis' "Girl Happy", 5 years later, which was very obviously shot on a studio backlot. Most movies of this time &amp; especially this genre were not shot on location, that's why this movie had a larger budget for it's time ($4 million). It's refreshing to see the stars on Las Olas Blvd. headed for the beach, &amp; at the famous Elbo Room bar in 1960. Location shooting became common &amp; taken for granted years later. The story revolves around 4 college girls on their way to Ft. Lauderdale for Spring Break. The movie is ahead of it's time because it shows young woman, on their own, furthering their education. It's also very dated because getting married seems to be the main thing on their minds. Connie Francis is fun to watch, but I feel she was miscast as someone who was supposed to be unattractive. No one pays attention to her &amp; it's not very believable (she's not a big fan of this movie &amp; I can understand why!) Dolores Hart had a Grace Kelly vibe going. She later left acting to become a cloistered nun. This was Paula Prentiss' film debut &amp; she has an endearing, goofy persona/quality. Yvette Mimieux is cast as the dimbulb who sleeps around hoping each guy who beds her will fall in love with her (ugh!!). George Hamilton, Jim Hutton, &amp; Frank Gorshin portray the "boys". Unfortunately, there isn't a really good looking dude among the main males (but there are some hot "extras" in the background scenes). The movie starts off frothy but ends on a serious note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films revolving around three-girls-about-town are sure bets for campy dialogue, wild costumes, and overblown theme songs: "Three Coins in the Fountain." "Come Fly with Me." "The Pleasure Seekers." "Valley of the Dolls." 1960's "Where the Boys Are" cleverly disguises itself as a harmless beach-blanket romp (and tosses in a fourth girl, Connie Francis, so she can belt out that overblown theme song), but fear not: the theme of this "kids" picture is the same as those aforementioned trash classics: Sex. As is de rigeur for films of this ilk, each character represents a singular, one-dimensional purpose: Good Girl (Dolores Hart), Bad Girl (Yvette Mimieux) and Goofy Girl (Paula Prentiss). Connie's character is a sort of a cross between Dolores' and Paula's, and though she adds a nicely ethnic, urban flair to the proceedings, she's really just a glorified guest star. (Dig her crazy beatnik number, dad.) The wafer-thin plot revolves around the gals vacationing in Ft. Lauderdale on spring break, all the while plotting marriage while the guys are scheming for sex. Given its time period, the film actually fires off a few eyebrow-raising salvos on pre-marital sex and a woman's desire for it; but, of course, the Good Girl still waits, and the Bad Girl pays for her wanton ways. In the end, "Where the Boys Are" isn't quite as enjoyable as, say, "The Pleasure Seekers" because it simply isn't trashy enough, but it IS a fun, fluffy look at sex and the single girl, circa 1960. Plus, there's the always-welcome cameo presence of the divine Barbara Nichols, who made a career out of playing lovably daffy, brassy showgirl types.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty raw for its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bunch of college girls (Delores Hart, Yvette Mimieux, Paula Prentiss, Connie Francis) spend Easter vacation in Ft. Lauderdale. There they meet some handsome young men (among them are George Hamilton, Jim Hutton and Frank Gorshin) and love, sex and drama occur.For its time this was pretty shocking. There is talk about having sex (called "playing house") and how some girls think it's OK. And Mimieux is raped--not shown but made clear. But by today's standards this is VERY tame...and kind of silly.I saw this a few years ago at the Provincetown Film Festival. Connie Francis was on hand to introduce the film. She HATED it! She said it's a stupid film, doesn't belong in any film festival and she hated the way she looked and acted. In fact she said she only did the film because her father didn't want her to! To be truthful she isn't good. Her character is secondary and the one song she sings on screen (not the title song) is pretty bad. Still it's isn't THAT bad.It's pretty light and flimsy (the rape aside) and the dialogue is on the level of a good sitcom. And all the girls and guys are SO nice and friendly and everything looks perfect. Also the title song (sung during the opening credits) IS a great song. It's pleasant, non taxing viewing and kind of fun to see what was considered racy way back then. This is the perfect movie to watch on a lazy, warm summer afternoon. Also look for the scene (which brought howls from my audience) of a doctor coming out of an operating room...and immediately lighting a cigarette! Pleasant, light entertainment. Recommended...if that's what you're looking for.</fullReview>

Best performance = Ms. Prentiss. Delores Hart (who became a nun after this and 2 Elvis flicks is fine. Connie Francis can sing but needs acting lessons.

		<shortDescription>Begins as a typical teenage comedy but soon starts to become more than that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, the movie began as a typical- and not so great, teenage comedy flick, in which a couple of youngsters are going on a spring break holiday. "Where the Boys Are" however handles delicate themes delicately and the movie is way more than just another teenage comedy.Actually quite amazing considering that this movie got made in 1960. The movie and its theme seems far ahead of its time. It makes the movie all the more relevant for the time period it got released in and all the more interesting now days to watch. This movie is basically a good observation of how teenagers handled sexual themes in 1960, without ever getting raunchy or not honest. It's a straightforward flick with its theme but its style ensures that this movie at all times mostly remains an entertaining and light one to watch. The movie also really doesn't feel like it was made in 1960.It's an all the more interesting movie since it tells the story from the viewpoint of the female characters, which works refreshing for a change.The movie knows to create a perfect balance between its more serious moments and its entertainment value. With movies like this the drama would often feel forced and out of place since the entire movie is done in a comical style of film-making. The creators of this movie however managed to find the right balance, without ever crossing any lines.Above all things it's still a very entertaining movie to watch. It's still mostly a comedy that provides some good entertainment and has some likable characters in it.The characters are also really a reason why the movie works out. Lot of the characters are very stereotypical but luckily the actors don't go over-the-top with their roles, which ensures that we can also really start to like- and feel for some of the characters.The acting was way better than expected. Paula Prentiss really impressed me, also with her beauty and the movie further more features George Hamilton and Frank Gorshin in some early roles. Gorshin is still perhaps best known for his portrayal of the Riddler in the early "Batman" series.A surprising and fresh movie that deserves to be seen by more.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, this is a coming of age movie. They go to Ft. Lauderdale as children and come home sadder but wiser adults. It's a journey.There is also the theme of the outsiders. Our core group are bookish or socially awkward/isolated who go to "where the boys are" and then aren't entirely sure what to do next because while they are full of theories, they are lacking in practical experience. These are not the social butterflies with easy ways and an unconcern about tomorrow who are all around them, casually flopping in their room and crowding every inch of the town. Melanie tragically found out that romantic delusions about Ivy League fellows have nothing to do with reality. In today's terms, she might be the innocent star struck girl who got involved with minor celebrities and all they were into. I hope she went home and gave a decent local boy she had never noticed before a chance.People read their own perspective on life into this movie. That's easy to do because it handles some adult themes and can't be classified as just another beach blanket bingo. It reminds me more of the original Gidget movie from 1959. It's about one crucial time when everything changed for those involved.And by the way, Tuggle sent the police after the rapist. He didn't get off scot free! And there was mention of a girl who got pregnant one vacation but she got married before she gave birth which was awkward but not horrifying, certainly not to these four who wanted love and commitment although they hoped no babies right away. So let's get over the idea that this is a typical "bad girl gets punished and nothing happens to the boy" movie. There was obviously a whole lot of mating going on as the booze flowed into underaged students in Ft. Lauderdale!But our group came from an unusually strait-laced background--nobody could call their college a party school! I enjoyed Tuggle so much. Paula Prentiss was an amazing find and I watch all of her movies I can. Tuggle was the modern assertive counterbalance to Melanie's almost Victorian vulnerability. She wasn't as emotionally constrained as Merritt, except when Merritt broke down and cried, or as passive and sort of sad as Angie. I could see why they would all be friends. They complemented each other. And I could see the nun that Dolores Hart would become in the portrayal of Merritt when she was tenderly listening to Melanie in the hospital.As for the main guys, TV was a stitch if juvenile, Ryder needed to put some age on him before he would be really handsome instead of a callow and shallow rich guy, the Ivy Leaguers were as interchangeable to us as they tried to be to Melanie, and Basil was purely weird--I most remember his myopic fish face in the tank!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the Boys Are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One very hot and widely discussed film when it first came out in late 1960.....sex, sex and more sex was the theme throughout most of the film and by a 1960 standard it was pushing the limit. Teens however went to see it in droves. I was in high school at the time (soph) and I could probably have taken 40 different girls to see that film when it first came out...everyone was talking about it as the top date movie. One top notch cast of guys and gals taking up the sun and rays of Ft. Lauderdale Florida with hormones and suds flowing. The gals, Connie Francis, Delores Hart, Paula Prentiss and Yvette Mimieux got their careers started and advanced with their appearance in this film, although Hart had appeared in a couple of Elvis films before WTBA. This film is comedy supreme. Just taking a look at the girl's hotel room filled with students they didn't even know, sleeping there at random was a stitch. You've got to love the scene with Hart and Francis in a diner ordering two cups of hot water to mix ketchup in!!! Then there are the guys swooning and staring at the gals all over the place. In summary the four gals were all looking for romance in the right and wrong places throughout the movie with a little love, jealousy and heartbreak thrown in. Their boyfriends, George Hamilton, Frank Gorshin, Jim Hutton and a couple of unknowns add to the zaniness with their shenanigans. Check out the scene at the night club when everyone jumps into Lola's swimming pool and the nightclub manager goes bananas trying to throw them out of the club. In the end alls well that ends well and four new romances are kindled with the gals and their boyfriends as they head back to that mythical college in the midwest somewhere. As far as the sexual mores of the time "A Summer Place" with Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee was probably much more sexual in content that WTBA. Also "Imitation of Life" with Lana Turner a year before put sex over the top. Still this is a great film to see even 45 years later as dated and hokey as it may seem.</fullReview>

The entire movie is a great slice of nostalgia. My how this world has changed. My father loved Connie Francis so I grew up on all of her songs. The TV remake should never have been made.

		<fullReview>This is certainly no ordinary college spring break film. Yes, the kids are having a good time singing, dancing, drinking and frolicking in the pool in beautifully warm Florida during their annual break, but there is a rape scene here and it is well acted by a troubled Yvette Mimieux who turns in a genuinely fine performance as one of the girls out for a good time, but certainly gets more than she has expected.Dolores Hart, or should I call her by her current name, Sister Dolores Hart, is really amazing as the girl in trouble with her studies and that family living professor, who goes to Florida to unwind but instead finds true bliss with the wealthy playboy, played by the always debonair George Hamilton.In her first film, Connie Francis plays the spunky Angie along for the ride. Frank Gorshin, with those goggle glasses, adds to the mix, but in comparison to what he could be like, is comparatively subdued here, even with the funny scene in the tank. Barbara Nichols, with that high strung voice, adds to the comic relief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie's a big candy box valentine to its time period. But, since there's a lot of boy-girl clinching going on, the box comes with a dramatic warning at the end, a kind of moral reckoning also indicative of the era. As I recall, the movie was a big hit with young fans. And why not, since the popular Gidget series made a whole franchise out of sun and surf. Now I was prepared to really dislike a movie about unthinking hedonism. Just the thought of George Hamilton in a swimsuit makes my hair go greasy. Still, it's a winning cast of young folks, and better than expected. Even Hamilton is not too obnoxious. There's the steady-hand Dolores Hart; the poignant Paula Prentiss; the introverted Yvette Mimieux; and a sparkling Connie Frances. On the male side is a flaky Jim Hutton; a cultured Hamilton; and a goofy Frank Gorshin. Mix 'em together and there's a lot of good natured entertainment. The Technicolor also shines, as it should, since that's a big part of these sunny beach epics. And catch how the screenplay uses awkward innuendo to soften the abundant hormonal drive. After all, these youngsters are not gathering to play Parcheesi. Still, I see a cloud on the distant horizon. It's gathering in southeast Asia and will soon replace these youthful idylls with an Easy Rider (1969) or a Medium Cool (1969). Nonetheless, the movie's a generally frolicking good time, George Hamilton or no.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Connie Francis, Dolores Hart, Yvette Mimieux, and Paula Prentiss who want to know Where The Boys Are in this MGM film which gave the studio a chance to display some of its young starlets. The answer is course Fort Lauderdale where the girls are on spring break.So are the boys and they consist of George Hamilton, Frank Gorshin, and Jim Hutton. The film has the girls as innocents looking for love and the boys as looking to score. In the end there's a bit of both involved.Of the female quartet I liked Paula Prentiss the best. She and Jim Hutton are both zany and droll as the comic relief in this film. Prentiss reminded me a great deal of her performance in Man's Favorite Sport which I think is one of the funniest films of the Sixties.One of the girls has an unfortunate encounter with a kid who was looking to score. One of them finds real true love. The others just have a good time.Connie Francis got one of those "and introducing" billings and she got a big hit record with the title song back in the day. I'm surprised it was not given an Oscar nomination.Where The Boys Are is a reflection of far more innocent times coming out in that transition period of the Eisenhower Fifties and the New Frontier. Definitely for fans who came of age in that era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gradually Morphs Into a Moralistic Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie begins with 4 female college students who live in the Midwest and decide to drive to Fort Lauderdale, Florida for Spring Break. Although all of them are looking for a little fun and romance their attitudes quickly evolve into wanting something more fulfilling. While their individual reactions to these feelings are somewhat tempered by social norms, each of them approach their dilemma in a different manner. For example, "Melanie Tolman" (Yvette Mimieux) happens to be quite beautiful but she is also very immature and naive. As a result she throws herself at a guy on the mistaken assumption that he loves her when in reality all he wants is sex and promptly discards her afterward. Her naiveté is further exploited a little while later. Unfortunately, she isn't the only person who has to struggle with her emotions as her friends "Tuggle Carpenter" (Paula Prentiss) and "Merritt Andrews" (Dolores Hart) also encounter pressure from their boyfriends which causes internal strife within them as well. At any rate, although this film certainly has its share of comedy, as a comedy as the situations become more serious it gradually morphs into a moralistic drama. Even so, I liked the singing of Connie Francis (as "Angie") and I thought the scene where "Basil" (Frank Gorshin) fell into the fish bowl was quite hilarious. All in all I rate this movie as slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about sex from beginning to end. It starts out in some sort of college class that only women took in the late 1950s. Sassy Merritt Andrews, IQ 138, a 19-year-old Penmore U. freshmen from Illinois, is threatened by her professor, Dr. Raunch (sic) with expulsion for voicing her opinion that most of her fellow coeds are seriously considering sleeping around before marriage. (Probably Louise Fletcher used Amy Douglass--playing the pinch-face dried up old prune Raunch--as one of her models for Nurse Ratchitt in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST.) After the four friends get to Fort Lauderdale, Yvette Mimieux is typecast as the ditsy blonde Mel, willing to say "yes" to any Ivy League pretender who bothers to ask. Merritt must comfort Mel when one of her previously yessed-men forgets to ask, and not only rapes her but rips her outfit. Meanwhile, seven-foot something Paula Prentiss as Tug stands above the fray, hooking up with a cheap date from Michigan who goes by T.V. (Jim Hutton). Connie Francis is thrown in as fourth wheel Angie, apparently along for the ride just to sing for her supper, and her attachment to "dialect jazz" (?!) specialist-soon-to-turn-Batman's-Riddler, Frank Gorshin as Basil, is cringe-worthy when the singing stops. (The sequel--WHERE THE GIRLS ARE--was retitled PORKY'S, by the by.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHERE THE BOYS ARE is delightfully entertaining and you'll be singing the song for days! I love the fact that it is really a Spring Break soap opera that doesn't take itself too seriously. As with all soaps, a couple of threads are usually the highlights. These threads are played by our leads: Hart, Hamilton, Hutton, and Prentiss. Jim Hutton and Paula Prentiss always play off of each other so well, and here again they do not disappoint. They are the comedic story thread. Delores Hart and George Hamilton bring out the romantic drama aplenty. Of course, there are many other lovely girls and silly guys to round out the cast. It's the perfect cast for a Spring Break Beach movie.This isn't necessarily an award winning worthy film, but if they gave awards for Popcorn and Powder Puff Pieces, then this would be in the top 10. It's fun to watch once a year as all the college kids are headed off on Spring Break. Yes, times have changed. Yes, this film is dated. And yes, it represents the end of an era before the studio system began to collapse and then anything goes from that point on, and that's not necessarily a good thing. So relax, enjoy, and be prepared to be entertained two times over by the great Connie Francis who acts and sings the famous title song. Best of all, enjoy being transported to a week of fluff and fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MGM cast several of its contract stars such as George Hamilton and Dolores Hart in this fun filled picture set in Fort Lauderdale and made two of its players Paula Prentiss and Jim Hutton a comedic team and International Movie Stars. Ms. Prentiss has said the reason Jim Hutton and She were teamed was that they were both tall. Paula Prentiss is being unduly modest, Hutton and Prentiss were teamed because they were priceless together. Bachelor In Paradise, The Honeymoon Machine and Horizontal Lieutenant would quickly follow this big box office hit and then the team called a halt for future work; I wish they hand't. I cannot get enough of them together. Ms. Prentiss would go on to co star with Rock Hudson, John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Peter O Toole and Peter Sellars, and Jim Hutton would go on to co star with Cary Grant, John Wayne, Charlton Heston, and Burt Lancaster but none of their efforts with others would match their brilliant work together. Where The Boys Are is a fun picture also starring Connie Francis. Dolores Hart who would do something remarkable and worthy for a Star: Quitting the business and becoming a Catholic Nun devoting her life to God.</fullReview>

The cast is priceless now as I fell in love with Paula Prentiss long ago even though in this film she is presented in her comedienne persona. The late Jim Hutton plays the same person he always plays in films. Like seeing excellent character actors like Chill Wills in any film. Connie Francis sold most of her records based on her fame in this film.Actually by 1960, the sexual values represented in this film were already passé. In fact, what this film was trying to do was take an attractive cast to try &amp; keep women in their traditional role here of looking for a man as the only way to be happy. Considering that divorce rates were already climbing by 1960 creating many single parent house holds, it was going to take Hollywood several more years before they would even get to this stark reality.There is some priceless comedy in this film as Frank Gorshin who is a stand up comedian &amp; then the Riddler on Batman, is at his rubber faced best here. People now forget Gorshin was a top impressionist during this era. Some of his talent shows here. This Technicolor film is fine for the scenery &amp; cast but put your brain away as the plot is very light weight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic Adventures During Spring Break</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun times at the beach and romantic adventures are what four Midwestern college girls hope for when they journey to Florida for a week of Spring Break. Naturally, they meet boys, or rather young men, in this ensemble story, as well as a musician, played by Frank Gorshin, whose band plays "didactic jazz", an element that helps slightly to enhance the story's thematic depth.There's a lot of banter among the characters about shared problems and dreams. Each of the four young women has a unique personality. The two main "boys" are played by George Hamilton and Jim Hutton, both in their twenties when cast. Trouble is, they look much older. Visually, "Where The Boys Are" looks more like "where the men are".Miscasting isn't the only problem. Given that the destination is the Florida beach, the plot spends very little time at the beach, and none at the ocean. Most scenes take place indoors, obviously built sets, in some movie studio. Another problem is the dialogue. It lacks subtext, which renders the story somewhat shallow. The story needs more depth and darkness, more of an edge. It gets that toward the end, but it's too little, too late.As a result, the film is mostly light entertainment. Barbara Nichols is a hoot as Lola, whose screechy voice adds to the comedy. Whatever serious message can be squeezed out of this film pertains to the expectations and roles of women in the 1950s, and in that sense, the film does show how social attitudes toward women have changed in the last fifty years."Where The Boys Are" is a quasi-musical. I enjoyed Connie Francis warbling the title song. And Frank Gorshin's jazz is a delight. But I could have wished for more period piece music, less time spent indoors, and less chitchat among the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOT a lighthearted beach romp as I'd mistakenly thought. I finally caught this on Turner Classics last night and was amazed at what a modern (well, for the 60s) morality play it was. It starts out with the goofy yellow title fonts and jazzy music that scream "Hey Kids, Sixties Teen Comedy!" ... but it quickly turns into anything but. Chaste Girl, "Liberated" but really wants a Husband Girl, Easy Girl and Comic Relief Girl all play their parts to show us the moral of the story - SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE IS BAD.And trust me, this is played with NO subtlety at all. **Warning: Spoilers Ahead** After a scene that in which the "bad" girl has sex against her will (but was clearly "asking for it", having consented earlier), she wanders dazedly down the middle of the road and is nearly hit by a car. Several of them, actually. The sound effects of horns and swerving are hilariously cartoonish; at one point I swear Roger Rabbit's car went by. I expected an anvil with "Acme" written on it to come crashing down on her.This film was made during the time my parents were courting, and mom says its a fairly accurate portrayal of the social mores of the time. Other than "sex is bad", we get ideas like "why finish college, get your husband and go", and "be a baby machine." Ever wonder why so many 60s moms drank and took tranquilizers?

		<shortDescription>The Not-Quite-Permissive Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beach movies were a popular genre in the late fifties and early sixties. Their main attraction was the chance to see lots of pretty girls (or, depending upon one's sex and/or sexual orientation) handsome boys in skimpy bathing costumes. As this was the era which saw the rise of rock- and-roll, catchy pop tunes were normally also featured. It is an interesting comment on changing social attitudes that the supposedly skimpy bathing costumes worn by the girls in such films are quite modest by modern standards, whereas those worn by the boys are actually more revealing than anything likely to be seen on a beach in 2014 when "board shorts" seem to be fast supplanting traditional swimming trunks. The "spring break" has long been a traditional rite of passage for American college students, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is a popular destination for such holidays; apparently it became even more popular after this film was released. (In 1960, and indeed during my own student days in the eighties, there was no equivalent British institution, but in recent years British students have taken to spending the Easter vacation in Cornwall or various Mediterranean resorts). "Where the Boys Are" tells the story of four girl students, Merritt, Melanie, Angela and Tuggle, who leave their university in the snowbound Midwest for a spring break in Fort Lauderdale with love and romance on their minds. (I presume that "Tuggle" is a nickname, although we never learn how she came by it or what her real name is). For most of its length the film sticks to the normal beach movie formula of sun, sea, sand, swimsuits, music and romantic comedy. It does, however, have ambitions to be something more than a standard teenage rom-com. It also attempts to explore the changes in attitudes towards sex and morality among the younger generation at the beginning of the decade which was to give us the expression "permissive society". The four girls have contrasting personalities and equally contrasting attitudes. Merritt, a self-confident, assertive young woman, believes strongly that premarital sex is something all young people should experience, and is brazen enough to express this shocking opinion in front of her prudish lecturer, the ironically misnamed Dr Raunch. There is, however a limit to Merritt's brazenness, a limit probably imposed by the strictures of the Production Code. She never actually uses the expression "having sex", still less its more vulgar synonyms, but prefers to rely upon coy euphemisms such as "making out" or "playing house". (This last, presumably an Americanism, would have surprised my grandmother who used to say "playing house" when she meant "playing bingo", one of her favourite pastimes).Tuggle is just as forthright as Merritt, but believes in saving herself for the right man. Angela is neurotic about her looks and frets that she will be unable to find a boyfriend- rather surprisingly, given that she is played by the very attractive Connie Francis, better known as a singer than as an actress, who also gets to sing the film's attractively melodious theme song. The shy, insecure Melanie takes Merritt's lecture to heart and resolves to lose her virginity as soon as possible. The film then traces the ways in which the girls' attitudes and expectations change during their stay in Fort Lauderdale. Merritt, the apostle of free love, undergoes a conversion when she falls for the good-looking, wealthy Ivy League undergrad Ryder and henceforth becomes an advocate of the doctrine that true love waits. (The actress who plays her, Dolores Hart, later underwent an even more radical conversion of her own, giving up her acting career to become a nun). Angela finds her own love-interest in the eccentric, wall-eyed jazz musician Basil, a boy who is as neurotic about his looks as she is (although in his case with greater justification) and frets about his inability to find a girlfriend. Tuggle is disillusioned when the boy she is interested in, "TV", abandons her for another woman, although as he is obviously a complete weirdo this is no great loss on her part. And Melanie? Well, this is where the film gets serious. The adventures of Merritt, Tuggle and Angela would fit firmly within the normal "beach party movie" tradition of rather silly romantic comedy with lots of fun, music and attractive youngsters of both sexes. The misadventures of Melanie would not. What actually happens to Melanie seems a bit vague as either their own puritan impulses or official censorship prevented the scriptwriters from spelling it out in too much detail, but it appears that she was sexually assaulted; her friends subsequently find her walking across the road in a distraught state and she is eventually taken to hospital after being hit by a car. This episode is only a brief one, but it makes for a jarring ending, something from a serious coming-of-age drama grafted onto a silly comedy. The filmmakers seem to have been aiming at two different markets, the teen audience who wanted to see a film about sex, as frank as the censors of the day would permit, and those members of the older generation who felt that if Hollywood was going to start making films about sex they should be hedged around with as many moralising "thou- shalt-nots" as possible. The resulting dog's dinner of a compromise makes "Where the Boys Are" one of those films that could only have been made during a very brief historical window. In 1940 or 1950 it would have been too sexually frank for the liking of the censors. By 1970, and certainly by 1980, its approach to its subject would have been so mealy-mouthed as to seem inadvertently comic. And today it serves as a historical record of what we might call the Not-Quite-Permissive Society of 1960. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spring Fever Sleeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At a Midwestern university, blizzard force winds knock pretty blonde Dolores Hart (as Merritt Andrews) off her feet. Warming up in class, random dating and premarital sex are college lecture topics of the day as Ms. Hart advises her teacher she intends to "play house before marriage." With copulating on their minds, Hart and three girlfriends decide to spend spring break in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This is "Where the Boys Are" available. Joining Hart are extra tall Paula Prentiss (as Tuggle Carpenter), softly sexy Yvette Mimieux (as Melanie Tolman) and sweetly singing Connie Francis (as Angie). They pick up hitchhiker Jim Hutton (as "TV" Thompson) and find tanned George Hamilton (as Ryder Smith) on the beach...Like many thinly-produced 1960s films aimed at young audiences, this starts out mildly fun and slows to a sluggish pace. Controversial topics are present, but sanitized. The title song and others performed by Ms. Francis are much stronger on the original MGM recordings. The world's biggest female record star, Francis is inexplicably paired with impressionist Frank Gorshin (later famous as Batman's foe "The Riddler"). As you might expect, the attractive women end up teaching lucky viewers the difference between meaningless sex and true love. Highlights are the feature film debut performances by Francis and Ms. Prentiss, both impressing in roles that are otherwise lackluster. The men have little to do, with Mr. Hutton doing it best.**** Where the Boys Are (12/28/60) Henry Levin ~ Dolores Hart, Yvette Mimieux, Paula Prentiss, Connie Francis</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine trashy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing that keeps this from being a classic trashy movie is the absence from the cast of the king of 60's trash, Troy Donahue. However, I wouldn't have wanted to lose George Hamilton from the cast, either. Anyway, it's one fine movie, and if you like trash, you should see it. It's even better than Palm Springs Weekend, which does have Troy (although it isn't as good as A Summer Place or Susan Slade, the latter being John Water's avowed favorite movie). Amazingly, this movie is based on a readable book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Youth opus scrapes bottom...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attractive locales and performers can't compensate for flimsy, uncharismatic story of college girls vacationing in Ft. Lauderdale in search of potential mates; all the gals are chaste except for Yvette Mimieux, whose flirtations are a signal to us that she's in for trouble! Comedy begins OK, but quickly degenerates as the kids start matching up (of all the couples, Connie Francis and Frank Gorshin, playing a nearly-blind jazz musician, are certainly the oddest). The slapstick finale is just stupid, and the cast (including Dolores Hart and Paula Prentiss) strain for laughs. Francis, singing-star making her movie debut, also croons the title tune--the only truly memorable thing in the picture. Remade as a cheesy T&amp;A flick in 1984. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the man crazy piranhas are is more like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start off by saying this had some of the most dorky acting I've ever witnessed; George Hamilton couldn't have been more stiff if he had a fully developed case of rigor mortis. And what a story: 4 man/marriage happy broads go to the beach and can't even enjoy themselves for fretting over "catching a man". Especially Yvette Mimieux's character: I wanted to jap slap that whining moron onto the next sand dune. Long time since I saw Paula Prentiss, the first woman I ever saw "full front nude" in a movie. Unfortunately, she couldn't make up her mind in this epic whether she wanted to use the deep voice or her natural tones. I suppose I can't say this is a bad film, but I wouldn't call it a good one either. I will say the aquarium scene had me on the floor....can't say why I found it so hilarious. Probably just the slapstick of it, plus Gorshin's fish face.</fullReview>
