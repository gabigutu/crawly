		<fullReview>This adaption of "Annie" is an excellent piece of film making. The casting,direction, writing, choreography all come together in perfect balance to entertain people of all ages.My only wish is that budget and time constraints would have allowed for theentire original story and score to remain in tact. The Hooverville / "We'd Like to Thank You Mr. Hoover" sequence in the original stage musical was perfect inshowing the effects of the depression, as well as giving us the introduction to Sandy. I only hope that future TV musicals allow the time for the full production, much like the 1993 version of "Gypsy" starring Bette Midler.I've noticed that some people have commented about the multi-racial castingand how secretary Grace would never have been a black woman. Historically,this is most likely correct, but again let's keep in mind that this is musical theatre and for people to just start singing with invisible musicians isn't very realistic either. I'm glad to see that Audra MacDonald was cast because she has theperfect acting skills, personality and voice to play Grace. Even though many of these stories are traditionally "white", the ability to cast multi-ethnic roles only enriches the piece and is completely appropriate in our modern society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great version!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, I am an avid Annie fan. I first saw the 1982 version, like most people and I loved it. I then saw the stage musical twice and loved that too. There were a lot of differences in the stories on the stage and on the film. Then I saw the 1999 version and I thought that it was great, about as great as the 1982 one but with better actors. I now have both film versions on video and I have seen both many times and I can honestly say that in my opinion the 1999 one is far better. The 1982 one is bigger, with more action and generally a larger production, but that is to be expected as the 1999 one was only a TV movie and with a much smaller budget. I like Alicia Morton a lot more as I think she is perfect for the part. Aileen Quinn was good for the spunky, tough side of Annie but she wasn't really very sweet and was not at all good vocally. One thing that has stood out for me with the 1999 version is the music and orchestration - I have never really noticed the quality of the music (not the vocals, the orchestra) in anything before this. Basically I love the 1999 version as I think it captures the story wonderfully. The 1982 version as also very good but they tailed off the original story too much and made too Hollywood-y for me, so I recommend the 1999 version overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What are you people thinking??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was excellent!! I can't believe how some people can actually claim the 1982 version was better. This version followed the REAL plot closely. I would like to point out to the ignorant type that the 1982 version is NOT the original Annie. Annie was a Broadway play and the 1982 version absolutely ruined the heart of the play. This version wasn't perfect, but definately much better.Beginning with Alicia Morton: She is a sensational Annie. A beautiful voice and she's way more toned down than Aileen Quinn was. She seemed to have a much better grasp on the character. Victor Garbor was also an amazing Oliver Warbucks. Albert Finney had his moments, but he had no heart or feeling until Annie did something about it. That's ridiculous. Mrs. Hannigan is not a drunk or whore or whatever Carol Burnette decided to do. Kathy Bates seemed like a human. She wasn't violent with the kids and it seemed at some points as if she even cared about them somewhat. Audra MacDonald was terrific as Grace. She had a georgeous voice and wasn't a complete loser like the Grace in the movie.I noticed how in the 1982 version, Annie never sings "Tomorrow" in the actual movie until she's in the whitehouse. That's the biggest song she sings!! How can you take it out? Also, they add in the stupid "Dumb Dog" song along with "We Got Annie" and "Let's Go To The Movies" and that song Mrs. Hannigan sings with Oliver Warbucks. The recent version added in the ORIGINAL song "NYC", which is a favorite of mine. They did however take out "You Won't Be An Orphan For Long", "We'd Like To Thank You Herbert Hoover", "Annie", and "We're Getting a New Deal for Christmas." Nonetheless, I was very happy to see "Something was Missing" back in. I thought Oliver should sing a song to Annie always.The ending of the recent version was a bit different however. I was glad that they toned down the big old party at the end, though. What's up with the horses and fireworks and stuff? And then Mrs. Hannigan turns nice? Yeah, right... she woulda been arrested anyway. I did not really like how Lily St. Regis didn't participate in the scam. That to me seemed a bit odd. But, it wasn't terrible. Also, in the original stage version, there is almost no romance between Warbucks and Grace. That's where "Annie Warbucks", the stage sequel, comes into play. So both films were at fault there.Either way, I think those who think the recent version wasn't as good as the original know absolutely nothing about the stage version. Also, I'll repeat, the 1982 version is NOT the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first version in most ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is presented well thanks to superb acting, especially from the convincing Alan Cumming as 'Rooster' Hannigan. (You'd never think it seeing him in the film, but he's actually got a strong Scottish accent). The songs are well-choreographed and the orchestration is marvellous. The ultimate song is one left from the 1982 version: 'N.Y.C.' where all the atmosphere is captured in one shot. The only real fault is that Kathy Bates isn't very gin-soaked or ahteable even as Miss Hannigan.This film was made for TV, and yet you wouldn't think it. Granted some of the sets have a studio feel to them, in particular the mansion, you forget about this as the dancing and story sweep away your imagination.The best advice I can give you on watching this film is to not, as I have done here, continuously compare and contrast this to the 1982 version, as this will deter you from enjoying the full effect of a movie that captures the Broadway atmosphere.All who value a good musical with fantastic orchestration are gonna like this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faithful or not, a profound disappointment (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***possible spoilers***The phenomenally successful Charles Strouse/Martin Charnin stage musical Annie was made into a film once before in 1982. The $40,000,000 film, the first and only movie musical directed by John Huston, was criticized by many critics for its extravagant production, for not being faithful enough to the original text, and for what they felt to be a peculiar choice of director (Huston did, after all, direct The Maltese Falcon). It was not a success at the box office.More than a decade and a half after the Huston film's release, TV producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, who had produced a fantastic TV production of Gypsy, decided to give this musical a second filming. With the support of Ray Stark (producer of the previous film) and Disney, the Zadan/Meron production was to stay as closely to the original stage musical as possible. Unfortunately, some stumbling blocks came to trip this ambitious new production.This $12,000,000 telefilm of the stage musical has some skillfully crafted sets and fine orchestrations of the song score. However, that's about all that this new adaptation has to offer. As Miss Hannigan, the mean-spirited orphanage manager, Kathy Bates tries too hard to `play it up,' and her forced performance ends up coming off disturbingly like a bad Rosie O'Donnell impression at times. Alan Cumming plays Rooster, Miss Hannigan's no-good brother, like a two-dimensional caricature. Victor Garber's performance is terribly unconvincing; as Oliver Warbucks, supposedly a cold, powerful billionaire, he comes off as weak, ineffectual, and far from intimidating. It is therefore unbelievable that anyone could be intimidated by him. As the title character, nine-year-old newcomer Alicia Morton is a good singer, but her performance is nothing special. Only Kristen Chenoweth, as Rooster's bimbo girlfriend Lily St. Regis, is particularly memorable.The production has a few effective moments (a cameo by Andrea McArdle, the originator of the title role on the stage, comes to mind), but the dull direction by Rob Marshall (who also choreographed) brings much of it down (interesting how the vitality and exuberance present in this team's film of Chicago is missing here). The staging is fairly static and seldom takes advantage of the liberties allowed by the medium. The Huston film did this.To accommodate the two-hour running time that the film was alloted in its original ABC-TV airing, the actual film itself is 90 minutes. As a result, Irene Mecchi's teleplay, allegedly closer to Thomas Meehan's original book, eliminates four of the songs from the original score (but retains two that were not in the Huston film), strips all of the political content away, and leaves a major flaw in the flow of the film. One scene becomes another without much time passing (basically day two of Annie's stay at the Warbucks mansion), and Warbucks changes from someone merely giving an orphan a home for two weeks as a publicity gimmick to someone who wants to adopt the little girl. The film needed time to demonstrate how this happened (the Huston film did this), but Who Wants to be a Millionaire simply couldn't get pre-empted or it could have caused a disaster!Also, why are there only a handful of orphans at the orphanage? In a stage production of Annie there could have been that many due to casting or set restraints imposed by that medium, but for a film it could help to show where all the other ones are.Then there's the multiracial cast, most likely suggested by Disney. The concept of a multiracial cast is not a bad idea in itself, but doing it just for its own sake it's nothing but pandering. In a musical set in a time not defined by racial pluralism, it stands out like wearing culottes on a construction site. Grace Ferrell (Audra McDonald, who isn't all that bad), Warbucks' personal assistant, is African- American here, and eventually a romance between the two of them develops! Are viewers to believe that a prominent white public figure, and a conservative one at that, would openly romance a black woman at this period in history? There's no chemistry between them at all, but the main problem is that in this setting it's about as believable as doing The Sound of Music with hispanics playing Nazis or The Music Man with an Asian bisexual Marian the Librarian. It is also worth mentioning that Punjab, a supporting character from Harold Gray's original strip, who was dropped from the play but resurrected for the earlier film, is gone again. I'm sure if he had been kept the Disney suits would have made him Warbucks' business manager and not a mere bodyguard.This film's only advantage over the first one comes by restoring a crucial song from the stage show, `Something Was Missing,' which was not in the first film. Also, the ubiquitous theme song `Tomorrow' is put back in its original place in the story herein. But that alone cannot excuse the mistakes made in this version.I should mention that I am in a small minority that considers the 1982 Huston film to be the better of the two. Though some parts of the production seemed a little over the top, and it did deviate a bit from the stage musical, it had better acting (including a much more endearing Annie), better characterization, retained some of the political elements (this remake has absolutely nothing here of Warbucks' involvement in the formation of the New Deal; therefore FDR's appearance at the end of this production seems pointless and tacked on), and no implausible 1930s interracial romances. Huston and Stark's $40,000,000 clearly went farther than Disney's $12,000,000, and produced a more engaging, more heartwarming Annie.This telefilm, though I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, is a disappointing, artless adaptation of a charming musical. No pontificating against the earlier film can change the realization that in this one, poor Annie has been reduced to a pale ghost of her former self. Leapin' lizards!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(No, I'm not a Disney shill. This is being pre-empted by football in my area tonight so it was shown in the afternoon.)For those who looked in vain to find the broken bones of the Broadway hit beneath the elephantine bulk of the movie version, the search is over. While there are some minor differences, this TV "Annie" is the real deal.It's not only brimming over with wonderful songs and superb choreography, this movie is front-loaded with bona fide Broadway musical chops -- Rooster, Lily, Warbucks, and Annie. Kathy Bates is the surprise knockout of the production (doing her own singing -- who knew?). And Audra MacDonald is sweetly appealing as Grace. There's not a dog in the bunch.Oops! I mis-spoke. Sandy also does a winning turn.This "Annie" is bound to become an annual treat. One viewing will have you wanting to adopt this orphan and make her your own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excruciating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the 1982 movie was bad until I saw this. In retrospect, it now seems like a masterpiece by comparison.Alicia Morton is acceptably cute in the title role, but Victor Garber is no Albert Finney. Kathy Bates can't sing anywhere near as well as Carol Burnett, but does a better job of looking the part.Most aggravating of all was the rewriting of history for politically correct purposes. The orphans are now a racially diverse mixture that would have been unheard of in the 1930s. Same goes for casting Audra McDonald as Daddy Warbucks' personal secretary. She's attractive and sings well, but such jobs simply were not available to blacks in that era, and the intimated interracial marriage at the end would have been unthinkable.Disney's rewriting of history to conform to current viewpoints isn't a new thing (see Pocahontas), but it continues to be annoying, especially for those who are trying to raise kids with a sense of the past as it really was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly weaker than the 1982 version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The role of Miss Hannigan was made for Carol Burnett or Bette Midler; Kathy Bates is merely above average for the part. Alicia Morton is good in the title role, with excellent mugging for the camera, but isn't any more believable as an orphan than Aileen Quinn was. Victor Garber has a wonderful voice for musicals, but his acting is quite inconsistent for Dady Warbucks, a classic Silas Marner role that requires very quick development. Overall, the cinematography, choreography, and set design felt as if they were merely adapted from "The Wizard of Oz" and "Mary Poppins", with perhaps a bit of "Beauty and the Beast" (Disney version) thrown in. When someone with a lot of money remakes a well-known picture, I expect a better treatment than this. It's worth 90 minutes to watch, but I won't see it a second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning and a pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film at a friend's house on DVD, thinking it was the original 80's version. What a pleasant surprise. It is delightfully cast and visually stunning. I liked the 80's version, as well as the stage production, don't get me wrong, but this version stands on its own merits, in my opinion.There were a few moments that seemed choppy like something was missing, mainly after Annie arrives at the Warbucks mansion and before they go out on the town. Otherwise, it flows very well.This might be considered a spoiler, so skip this paragraph if you wish. I got a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes when the "star-to-be" came out onstage during the song "NYC" and on the second note ("N-Y...") I realized I was watching and listening to Andrea McArdle. She's grown into a beautiful young woman and her voice is as pure, strong, and dynamic as the first time I heard her sing (in the film "Rainbow," a TV movie about the early years of Judy Garland). I had to replay the NYC scene over and over again!Remakes can often be disappointing, but this one surely is not. It is a treasure, a delight, and I can't wait to watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only for "Easy Street"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know people are saying this shouldn't be compared to the '82 "Annie," so I'll try to refrain from doing that, though I haven't seen the Broadway version, so it'll be hard. First, I have to say I grew up watching the '82 version, and it was my favourite movie. I had the whole thing memorized. I didn't even know they'd made a new "Annie" until one of my friends mentioned she'd seen it. She'd never seen the first movie, but she didn't like this one. I can't say I was too fond of it either. The fact that there were only 7 orphans in the whole orphanage was kinda weird. I mean, I know in the stage version there were the same number, but this is a MOVIE. On stage you can't exactly have 30 girls running all over the place, but movie versions of theatrical productions should be more realistic. While Kathy Bates is a great actress, why couldn't she have been meaner? Carol Burnett was hilarious as the drunk, man-chasing woman. And those kids wouldn't have been scared of her (Bates) if all she did was threaten them. They probably could've beaten her up. I thought Alicia Morton sang well, but could it have hurt to curl her hair? Something else that bugged me was that all the characters were devoid of any personality, except for Lily and Rooster. Even though there were only 7 of them, all the orphans' personalities seemed the same, so I couldn't keep them straight. Not that it mattered. But I LOVED Roseanne Sorrentino as Pepper in the '82 version, because she made the character mean and tough. This Pepper didn't seem menacing at all. Too bad, because she's my favourite orphan. Other people mentioned this, so I won't go into it: Oliver Warbuck's and Annie's relationship seemed nonexistent. If they had added maybe an extra half an hour to the movie it would've been nice, since then we could have seen more of the characters interacting, and it wouldn't have seemed so rushed. However, there was one thing I loved about this version. Alan Cummings and the "Easy Street" song. I liked Tim Curry a lot (who wouldn't?), but I thought the Easy Street number was better done by all in this one than in the '82 film. The dancing was good, and Lily, Miss Hannigan and Rooster seemed smoother and more evil, like the money-grabbers that they were. I would buy the soundtrack just for that song. So, all in all I was somewhat disappointed. I mean, I enjoyed it once, but I wouldn't twice. (Except for "Easy Street" which I watched about 10 times.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not nearly as good as the 1982 version of ANNIE, but if you haven't seen that version, this one is probably worse. There are lots of things/scenes in this version of ANNIE that are there only because they are in the 1982 version. Two big examples I can think of are the dog and the other orphans. In the 1982 version, they are characters that are essential to the plot. In this, they are there because they are expected to be there, and don't really serve the plot at all. The presence of President FDR at the end is another example. For that matter, the ending is anti-climatic and rushed. Everything is better in the 1982 version, including the acting, the dialogue, the songs, and especially the relationship between Daddy Warbucks and Annie. In the 1982 version, in which Daddy Warbucks is a total scumbag and Annie has to "tame" him. In this one, the two are in pretty much love with each other right away, and it's disappointing and lame.Victor Garber and Alan Cumming are both great actors, but they're playing characters that have already been played to near-perfection before. Alicia Morton, while cuter than the original Annie, is not nearly as good an actress. Kathy Bates is great in this movie. Again, she was not as good as the extremely talented Carol Burnett in the original, but she almost is. Kathy Bates is, however, the best part of the remake. Some of the new songs are catchy, but the best ones are the ones we know already from (you guessed it!) the 1982 version.Anytime this version strays from the 1982 version, it suffers. When it does remain true to the original, it does not live up to it. Watch the first one. It had the best cast, best music, better script, better everything.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the ridiculous notion that Ridley Scott was ostensibly toying with a few years ago of remaking 'Citizen Kane' this re-adaptation of 'Annie' pales beside John Huston's magnificent film of this stage musical. However, Rob Marshall before 'Chicago' is clearly very much in charge of the theatrics, and his choreography and mise en scene is fine. The problem is simply in the casting. Almost without exception, the roles are, simply, too big for the players. In singing &amp; dancing, Alicia Morton can stand beside Aileen Quinn, but not in charisma and screen presence. Victor Garber and, particularly, Audra McDonald slip further down the comparison ladder, as does Alan Cumming. While Kathy Bates is no Carol Burnett, however, she does give a certain gravitas to Miss Hannigan. Only improvement, as far as I can see is that Sandy makes a better mutt. For cinephiles, also, there is a major let-down in the substitution of the anaemic 'NYC' for the sensational 'Let's go to the movies' sequence in Huston's film. All of the above notwithstanding, if we remember it is only a TV movie, with all of the budgetary implications of that, it is an honourable effort, but why would anyone want to watch this rather that Huston's minor masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of the reviews are saying that this tv version of Annie was a remake of the 1982 film of the same name. This is simply not true. This version of Annie is a remake of the stage musical. If you have ever seen the stage musical you will realize that it is extremely different than the 1982 film.That being said, those who have fallen in love with the earlier film will most likely not like this version. Those who are true to the stage musical will probably enjoy it. Falling in the latter category, I like this version better.To me, Alicia Morton was superior to Aileen Quinn in every way, but most noticeably voice quality. Alicia has a great voice for the part. And I personally wasn't bothered by the fact that she had straight hair as opposed to curly. The rest of the orphans did great too.Kathy Bates was also a standout. As much as I love Carol Burnett, I thought Kathy Bates did a fantastic job as Ms. Hannigan and Alan Cumming was a nice surprise as Rooster.One last thing to remember is that since this was for tv, their budget was a lot smaller than a feature film. Taking that into consideration, I think Rob Marshall did a commendable job updating the play Annie for a new generation to view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie made for a new generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several aspects of this movie that I would like to comment on. Mostly I will compare this movie to the movie Annie from the 1980's. That acting, although it is better, fell short of my expectations. I loved how in the 1982 movie Annie was a spunky, unruly girl with matted hair and the most endearing smile I've seen in along time. I think that the actress was able to capture the true nature of Annie, who lived on the streets and in terrible conditions. As for the new movie, Annie is adorable, no doubt but she's rich adorable. Her shiny hair and perfect white teeth don't force us to look past it all and really love Annie for her personality. A second aspect I'd like to address is Mr Warbucks. In the newer movie he is kind of a push over, no offense but the actor who plays him is a sweet man, with hardly a bad bone in his body. But the first movie the man is arrogant, conceited and mean. His heart change is believable. As far as vocals go, I feel that the first movie is more endearing due to the slight lack in vocal talent. Annie, who's voice is decent for a girl her age, is adorable, and Mr Warbucks stumbling baritone is priceless! I don't think Annie (1999) even comes close to being as good as its predecessor. If you are going to introduce your kids to this great movie, do so the old fashioned way. Don't spoil them with a rich kid rose colored glasses view of poverty and love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen "Annie" on stage (although I would love to), so my opinions are not based on which movie version was more like the play. I can say, however, having seen both movie versions, that I find this one infintitely better. Comparisons of the two versions follow--possible spoilers for earlier version.I found Victor Garber's Daddy Warbucks to be wonderful--he conveyed how uncomfortable he was with the idea of hosting a little girl without being loud and obnoxious, which was how I perceived Albert Finney's Warbucks And I much preferred Alicia Morton's portrayal of "Annie" to Aileen Quinn's--until Annie's life is threatened at the end of the earlier version there was no softness or emotion to Aileen's performance. I know Annie is supposed to be "tough" but she was still a little girl--Alicia's performance showed this. As for the role of Grace, I had no problem with the actress who played her in the first film, but Audra Mcdonald was very good, too! I preferred the way the character of Miss Hannigan was written for this version--a little mean, but not a vicious drunkard (this is no reflection on Carol Burnett who is a great actress!), and Kathy Bates did a great job. I found the ending much more appropriate for a movie that is bound to attract litle girls as viewers--no scenes of Rooster trying to throw Annie to her death, which I found very unrealistic anyway.The only fault I would find was with the other orphans. I didn't find most of them to be that great of actresses. But for the amount of time they spent on screen, that is really a minor flaw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one is a tough one to call when comparing to the 1982 version, however it is still very good in it's own right and is probably the *closest* transition from stage to screen this show will ever receive. When comparing this to the 1982 theatrical version, it's easy to be a little disappointed. Kathy Bates puts in a good bid as Miss Hannigan, but it's impossible to tell whether the character is nicer or meaner than Carol Burnett's version. While Bates version seems nicer all around, she does not turn over a new leaf at the end nor does she oppose the murder of poor Annie. Some notable omissions from this version include no Punjab or Asp, Rooster's "Cock-a-doodle-doo", the Hannigan-Warbucks "Sign" number, Annie's curls, and the emphasis on "Tomorrow".Overall, it is an enjoyable watch, however if you are looking to see the very best version, I'd recommend the 1982 classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Per usual, Disney takes a perfectly good story and botches it. What happened to Punjab. Ms. Hannagan should have been more to her true character, which just happens to be a man wanting alcoholic. Of course Disney had to keep it clean to stamp it's name upon it.

		<shortDescription>A remake of the original movie of 'Annie', more largely based on the broadway version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was extremely awful! Annie was my all time favourite musical when I was a kid. Aileen Quinn and Albert Finney really brought the musical to life. Most of the people who complained about the original version complained largely because it strayed from the original broadway plot. They didn't take into account the incredible chemistry between characters in the original. This movie felt dull and lacking of chemistry and vital energy in comparison. The one number that I enjoyed was 'Easy Street' in this version. The rest were dull. Annie in this movie seemed to have less spunk. Aileen Quinn really did a remarkable job when she played Annie. She really brought the character to life. This Annie didn't seem half as tough or convincing. Rent the original if you want to enjoy a musical brought to life for film without the political correctness and mass chease fest!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I liked the kid playing Annie, but the cinematography is quite pedestrian. Kathy Bates is OK, but Carol Burnett in the 1982 feature comes across a lot more effectively. Andrea McArdle still has it, even in a bit part. How many people do you think even recognized her as the "original" Annie? All in all, watchable, but I'm not sure if the production is worth the effort. The tendency to remake popular musicals for TV is becoming a bit tiresome, although the 90s trend appears to have diminished. It is interesting to watch the original along with this version, and I recommend the experience as a lesson in film-making - pros and cons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vast improvement on the 1982 film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know some people would consider this heresy, but I'm one of the people who enjoys this 1999 telefilm more than the 1982 John Huston film. I know many people consider the 1982 film a classic because they grew up with it, but let's be honest. Carol Burnett made that film. That's why fans of it will always call it the "Carol Burnett version." And don't get me wrong, she played it wonderfully and it's one of her most iconic roles for a reason, but outside of Carol Burnett's performance and Tim Curry's deliciously slimy Rooster Hannigan, the 1982 version really has nothing to offer. It was an obvious attempt to meld the stage musical and comic strip into one whole and the result is a huge mess, with lackluster musical numbers, hammy performances and a cloying amount of saccharine cuteness.The 1999 telefilm, while not being without the typical Disney cheesiness, has so much more to offer. For one, it's a direct adaptation of the stage musical, and several of the musical's numbers are reinstated; the wonderful and catchy "NYC" replaces the forgettable "Let's Go to the Movies" and the sweet "Something Was Missing" replaces the catchy but unnecessary "We Got Annie." The cast delivers these songs with amazing panache. The casting of various Broadway veterans was an excellent choice. Victor Garber (Sweeney Todd, Assassins) is a much sweeter Daddy Warbucks than Albert Finney, and while he may seem too young for the role, he plays it wonderfully and his singing is as beautiful as ever. Audra MacDonald (Ragtime), a brilliant performer if there ever was one, brings a great dignity to the role of Grace. The only nitpick I'd have is that she and Garber seemed to lack chemistry, so the love story between Grace and Warbucks seemed sort of forced.I have to say, though, that my favorites in the cast boil down to four of the key players: Alan Cumming, a pre-Wicked Kristin Chenoweth, Kathy Bates, and Alicia Morton. Alan Cumming is no Tim Curry, but his flawless New York accent and deadpan delivery are so much fun to watch. Kristin Chenoweth is darling as Lily St. Regis, with a voice that is just perfect for a character that is sleazy, adorable and dumb all at the same time. Kathy Bates is one of my favorite actresses, and as always, she gives it her all. The character's bumbling alcoholism is nonexistent in this version, so that potential for comedy is lost, but I was struck at how well Bates can sing and dance. She's obviously having a ball in the role, and when she, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth break into their rendition of "Easy Street," I dare anybody not to start tapping their feet.The film's star (and its biggest improvement over the original 1982 film) is Alicia Morton as Annie, and I have to say she really knocks it out of the park. Aileen Quinn may have looked more like Annie, but her singing and acting abilities were really lacking and it was obvious John Huston hoped her cuteness would make up for it. Alicia Morton's acting is really on point, and her singing is just beautiful. Her rendition of "Maybe" starts off the film, and her voice and charm are so pure that you're immediately won over. She doesn't have to resort to winking at the camera or relying on a cute factor to hold the film, and it's such a breath of fresh air. The character of Annie in this version may not be the most interesting character in the show, but when has she even been? The interest of the story came from the colorful characters around her and Annie was always more of the voice of reason that kept the characters in check. Alicia Morton plays this role brilliantly.A lot of people make a big case about the interracial casting of the orphans and Grace, and... well, there's nothing to say except that it's just plain stupid to do so. This is a movie where people in the middle of the Depression are dancing and singing in the streets, and your issue is that the cast is multiracial? Seriously... the entire cast, from the orphans to Warbucks, do their jobs wonderfully. What else matters?At any rate, the 1999 version of Annie is a fun little movie, and if you're a fan of musicals, Disney, and all that that entails, you'll enjoy watching this under-appreciated gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but not as touching as the 1982 version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains some minor spoilers.I grew up with the 1982 version, which I must say has a much deeper plot. However, I liked Alicia Morton better as Annie, she has a "cuter" voice and doesn't have that ugly (imo) curly hair.Most songs were better in the new version but i was really disappointed with the thin plot. The character introduction was poor, Oliver was rude at first but wanted to adopt her after like three minutes. Also, miss Hannigan wasn't really mean at all, it almost seemed like she secretly liked kids.Still, the worst part was the ending. In the 1982 version the ending was scary and dramatic (maybe a bit too much though), but in this version it was just silly and cheesy. Rooster and Hannigan got captured before even leaving the house and suddenly everyone started opening christmas presents and the president was having a speech. But since this is not a remake of the original film but of the broadway show (which i have not seen) this might be understandable.Although i might sound a bit negative I really liked this version and gave it 8/10. I recommend it for everyone, it's an enjoyable movie, though not as deep and touching as the 1982 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Closer to the original but not close enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of Annie is based fairly closely on the broadway musical, which itself was based (very, very loosely) on the old comic strip, "Little Orphan Annie". Reviewers who refer here to the 1982 film as "the original" are mistaken. And this TV musical gets far closer to the spirit of the original show than the previous film ever did.Without the film's overblown ending, its bizarre inclusion of Punjab (a minor character from the original comic) and with some original songs brought back from the dead, this version is clearly trying to recreate the broadway show on the small screen. Unfortunately, it falls short on a few counts.As Miss Hannigan, Kathy Bates is far too nice. Anyone who's seen Misery knows she can play a lonely, unhinged hag, so what's the problem? At times she almost comes across as maternal. Her version of Little Girls is so-so, but it's not the stand-out song and certainly doesn't deserve two reprises.The other performances are fairly good, with scots thesp Alan Cumming delightfully villainous as Rooster. Andrea McArdle, the ORIGINAL original Annie shows up as the star-to-be in NYC. Ironic, that. Perhaps they should have renamed the character "star-has-been".Where this version really falls down, though, is in it's sanitisation of the show. While the '82 film was overblown and at times grotesque, this version is watered down to the point where it's just plain dull. There's two key moments in the show where Annie meets the optimistic homeless and the pessimist congressmen of America. These scenes gave Annie a message and an edge and they've been removed. Still, it's better than the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first i must say that i grew up with the 1982 annie. i never knew anything else. yet, i just realized that the version i always saw was edited for TV, which totally cut out easy street. i didn't know what to expect, and besides...tim curry scarred me for life as rooster when he chased annie up that bridge..to a little girl, that's scary! so, i watched the 1999 annie on abc, wondering if i was going to be scarred again. just the opposite. i 'm not a big fan of cuteness, but this movie was endearingly sweet. kathy bates was awesome with her interpretation of miss hannigan, and kristin chenoweth is just wonderful as the ditsy lily. the only thing i wasn't into was how warbucks did a complete 180 in his affections for annie. but when alan cumming came on the screen as rooster...this was the first time i'd really paid attention to a role of his (besides circle of friends). i'd watched him on talk shows all week- i just had a strange feeling. when he broke out into the first line of easy street...oh man. i was smitten right then and there. their interpretation of that song is to die for!! i had a loop of him singing one line in my head for 36 hrs...no joke. i had to go get the cd...he wouldn't leave my mind!! and he's so much less scary than tim curry. don't get me wrong, tim is a fabulous actor, but i rented the full version of the 1982 annie and... uh uh. no way. it had a nicer political feel and not such a tied up ending, but the 1999 version has heart and FABULOUS performances. i will forever be grateful for rob marshall (director) begging alan to do it...</fullReview>

The cast of the original film, consisting of Carol Burnett and Tim Curry, just to name a few, was VERY good. The new Annie features an excellent cast, the standouts being Kathy Bates and Cabaret's Alan Cummings (incidentally, playing the roles Burnett and Curry played in the 82 version). Featuring "NYC", a song previously only on the Broadway recording... this Annie is a very enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm probably the biggest straight 19 year old male musical buff in history. I Loved the original Annie. One of my favorites. When I heard Disney was going to do Annie, I was incredibly stoked. I'm glad they didn't try to remake the original movie, because nothing can compare to Carol Burnett as Ms. Hannagan, and the original Annie is without peer.This new adaptation is much more lighthearted and colorful than the original. What it loses in Depression-era hopelessness and realism, it takes back in fun. They're both superb musicals, with great musical talent, choreography, and a hilarious Kathy Bates as Mrs. Hannagan. If you love musicals, see this one! If you're a devoted fan of the original, keep in mind that Disney's goal was to be completely different than the original....and it met that goal very well....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too like the previous Annie, with all the same sets, choreography, identical scenes, etc. to be better than the original, but it is brighter, and Easy Street blew away the old version, with Kathy Bates and Alan Cumming being really outstanding. Alicia Morton was an improvement too, being more of a real kid and less a child star kind of actress. Daddy Warbucks, on the other hand, was somewhat colorless in the new version, compared to Albert Finney. Overall, I'd buy this version, simply because it is a brighter, more colorful movie, and, afterall, it is for kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that the 1999 version of Annie was horrible. For one thing the movie was done poorly and exactly like it was on Broadway. There were only the main orphans which made the orphanage look unbelievable because there would definitely be more than 5 or 6 orphans in an orphanage. I am not saying that the new version should've been exactly like the old one but they should have had Alicia Morton have curly hair throughout the whole movie and just not at the end. Also they should have kept all the original songs and not deleted and/or added songs. I think that Kathy Bates is a wonderful actress but did a horrible job when playing Miss. Hannigan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lifeless Adaptation of Classic Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1982 movie version of Annie was one of my favorite movies as a child. I have heard people criticize it many times calling it an overblown turkey, I do admit at times it does seem that way when I watch it now, especially since I am 22 years old now, but there is no comparison to this new TV version, while the 82 version may have been overblown, this new version is just plain dull and lifeless, I know they were trying to tone it down, but that doesn't mean you have to take all the personality out of it, this movie has neither wit nor humor. Aileen Quinn had spunk and energy, and a better singing voice than the Annie in this movie, when I saw her as a child I wanted to be just like her, the girl in this version didn't do anything for me. The other orphans in this movie are like cardboard cutouts they have absolutely no personality, you couldn't tell the difference between Molly and Pepper. The Hard Knock Life number which I absolutely love in the 82 version, is just flat out boring here, they just scrub the floor for 3 minutes while singing it. There is absolutely no character development in this version. Victor Garber is probably a fine actor but he is given nothing to work with in his role as Daddy Warbucks. I prefer Albert Finney in the 82 version. Warbucks meets Annie sings NYC with her and then wants to adopt her after 3 minutes. You never feel any bond between them. What is this movie trying to say? that when you first meet someone the way to form a bond is to perform a musical number together, and then they will want to adopt you immediately? I mean there should be some realism. Kathy Bates as Hannigan is okay, but cannot be compared to Carol Burnett who was hilarious in the 82 version, I don't think her performance was over the top at all. Alan Cummings was wonderful with what little he had to do, but I definitely like Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters better, they were sleazier and more villainous. The ending in this version was downright awful, they had Miss Hannigan pretending to be Annie's mother, instead of Lily. I mean they made the Annie and Grace into idiots in this movie, like they wouldn't be able to recognize her. Then they had Lily bring the cops in, like anyone would be that stupid, besides that FDR shows up with the cops, like he had nothing else to do, it was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!I heard great things about this version but was very disappointed. Definitely stick with the 1982 movie version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than 1982 movie, but still not as good as Broadway.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't going to write any comments on this movie I thought it stood alone and didn't need any commenting but I see I am wrong. I felt that while this movie was much slimmer and a little chopped from any previous version it was the most faithful retelling so far. This movie was based on the original Broadway musical, not on the 1982 movie version which really doesn't resemble the Broadway musical at all. In the 1982 version some of the songs are the same, but many are different, changed, added, or deleted. This version restored many of those songs (i.e. "N.Y.C." &amp; "Something Was Missing") but even in this version there were a few that are still missing ("We'd Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover.") The 1982 movie added many songs "Sandy", "Dumb Dog", "Sign" all of which were never in the Broadway version and really weren't necessary (in my opinion) also if I remember correctly (and I might be mistaken) in the Broadway version Miss Hannigan is not a drunk that was added in the 1982 version. Also added in the 1982 version is the number of orphans, on stage there are 7, this was trying to be truer to that. I have to say that I do feel better saying this because I think there is at least a little bit of confusion as to what this is a remake of. It isn't a remake of the 1982 movie, but of the original 1977 Broadway musical. As to performances in this version, I thought they were all excellent and I liked the re-writing of Hannigan being Annie's mother.</fullReview>

I did not particularly like this version, eventhough it is closer to the play version. Most of the actors made great performances, but you can't really beat the original. Many people say that Carol Burnett way over-acted in her part as Ms. Hannigan in '82, and that she was unrealistic, but whoever said it was supposed to be realistic? The girl who played Annie may have sung well, but she didn't look the part (i.e. No curly red hair). Overall, I would have to say that the two best versions of Annie are the 1982 version and my high-school's production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On almost all counts, this movie was superior to its 1982 predecessor. The actors were a lot more suited to their parts than they were in the first movie, with the exception of Kathy Bates, but I can forgive that since she had Carol Burnett to contend with. I could especially see an improvement in the Annie they chose. Alicia Morton gave Annie a lot more heart than Aileen Quinn did, in my opinion. Audra McDonald also gave a great performance as Grace. I liked the fact that it seemed a lot more Broadway-ish than the first movie did. This would probably put others off, but it seems more natural to give a story like this the Broadway treatment. It even restored "NYC" after the first movie had that fiasco "Let's Go to the Movies". The only complaint I really have about this movie is that it cut out most references to the Depression, as the first movie did. They cut out the song "Hooverville", and they never showed Annie and Warbucks visiting President Roosevelt during his cabinet meeting. But that's just this theatre lover's point of view. The movie is still completely enjoyable and should be seeing a few Emmy nominations this year alongside "The Three Stooges" and "Tuesdays with Morrie".</fullReview>

WHat happened to the Great depression, even the musical focused on that. Those things are bad, but the part that really Made me upset was they still cut out 5 songs from the musical (count them), even the 1981 had they sense to have them replaced.

		<shortDescription>I'm not an Orphan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the 1999 television version of "Annie" begins, we see Annie (Alicia Morton) sitting at the window watching the snow. Then poor Molly (Sarah Hyland) has another nightmare and cries for her mommy. This leads to the argument about being orphans and not having any parents. Annie stubbornly declares that she is not an orphan because her parents said that they were coming back for her and that they left proof. Annie tries to escape the orphanage again, but gets caught by the cruel Miss Hannigan (Kathy Bates). All of the girls in the orphanage are punished for this and made to clean the floors. In the morning, Mr. Bundles (Ernie Sabella) comes with the fresh sheets, and Annie sees another opportunity to escape. This time she makes it out of the orphanage, but ends up getting caught by the police after being chased by them all night. After she is returned to the orphanage in the morning, Grace Farrell (Audra McDonald), personal secretary to Oliver Warbucks (Victor Garber), comes to extend an invitation to one orphan to spend Christmas with Mr. Warbucks. When Grace enters Miss Hannigan's office, she sees Annie in there she says that she will take Annie for the holiday and threatens to turn Hannigan in when she refuses to let Annie go. Reluctantly, Miss Hannigan agrees to let Annie go with Grace and spend the holiday with Mr. Warbucks. While Annie (Morton) is with Mr. Warbucks, she wins the heart of both the audience and Oliver Warbucks (Garber). Warbucks helps Annie in the search for her family. Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dennis Howard) is even involved in the search for Annie's parents. Miss Hannigan's brother Rooster (Alan Cumming) and his girlfriend come up with a plan to pose as Annie's parents and end up getting caught in the lie. There is a happy ending in sight for Annie, the adorable little orphan sure to win your heart. To discover the fate of Annie, watch the 1999 movie made for television.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Version of this Musical (So far)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ABC/Disney mounted an elaborate and entertaining remake of the 1977 Broadway musical Annie for television in 1999 which, for my money, was vastly superior than the theatrical version released back in 1982. This version was directed by Rob Marshall, whose next directorial assignment was a little thing called Chicago. Marshall knows what a musical should look like and having him at the helm as director and choreographer made a big difference in making the piece work, as opposed to the 1982 version which was directed by John Huston, a competent director but clueless where musicals are concerned.For those who don't know, this is the story of a little girl named Annie living in an orphanage during the depression, run by a cruel and sadistic witch named Miss Hannigan, who is chosen to spend a week in the mansion of a billionaire named Oliver Warbucks, a publicity stunt arranged by Warbucks' secretary Grace Farrell. We then watch as a relationship develops between the lonely philanthropist and the little girl and how Miss Hannigan sees Annie's good fortune as a ticket to Easy Street (which is, BTW, the name of one of the show's best songs).Kathy Bates is deliciously evil as Miss Hannigan. I found Bates' interpretation of the character much richer than Carol Burnett's take on the role in 1982. Burnett played Miss Hannigan as a drunk, but Bates brought the greed and viciousness back to the role that Dorothy Loudon introduced to the character back on Broadway in '77. Bates also surprised as a competent vocalist. Her version of my favorite song in the score, "Little Girls" is just superb.I have to admit that I found Victor Garber a little bland as Daddy Warbucks. I actually preferred Albert Finney in the '82 version , though Garber's solo, "Something was Missing" was lovely. Alicia Morton is competent as the title character and Audra McDonald brings a substance to the role of Grace that has been missing in previous versions of the show. Alan Cumming and Kristen Chenoweth are brilliant as Rooster and Lily, Miss Hannigan's brother and his girlfriend, who are Hannigan's cohorts in extorting money from Warbucks through Annie. Cumming, Chenoweth, and Bates bring down the house with "Easy Street".Other songs in the Charles Strouse/Martin Charnin score include "Maybe", "It's a Hard Knocks Life","I think I'm gonna like it here", "You're Never Fully Dressed without a Smile", and, of course, "Tomorrow". During the production number, "NYC", there is actually a cameo appearance by Andrea McArdle, who originated the role of Annie in the original 1977 Broadway production.For me, this is a much richer version of this musical, that takes the show back to the basics, remaining faithful to the original piece while benefiting from strong direction and choreography from Rob Marshall and some on-target casting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I was unhappy with the 1982 version. I've hated the way they've handled the songs and replaced the original Broadway ones with generic ones. So, obviously, I was hoping this version was going to be better, well, it wasn't. Actually, the only thing it has better than the 1982 version are how the songs are handled, the rest is just better on the older one.My first issue with this movie is the casting. I understand Annie was originally played by a blond (Andrea McArdle). Yet, the Broadway musical still liked to remind us that the character was, indeed, red headed. Why did they cast a brunette to play Annie? Then, we have the racially diverse orphans and Grace, who's now black. Seriously, this story is set on the 30's, it was completely unlikely for the time to have racially diverse orphanages, much less racially diverse romance between powerful figures. Finally, who was the genius that decided to cast Kathy Bates to play Miss Hannigan? She does not look like her original incarnation on Broadway, much less the 1982 incarnation. I also find it impressive how all the orphans remain beautiful, pink-cheeked, well-dressed girls, even though they're supposed to be poor.My second issue with the movie is the plot alterations. Why didn't they include Miss Hannigan being an alcoholic? It makes no sense, later on the movie, Rooster pulls off a knife and outright implies he's gonna slit Annie's throat. Then, we have Lily, who does absolutely NOTHING in the movie, she's just there. The role of Annie's fake mom is given to Hannigan, which makes even less sense than the previous change. How did Annie, the girl who spent her entire life hating this woman and knows what she's like, not notice she was posing as her mother? I will never know. But wait, but there's more. Instead of giving Lily an actual role, they have decided she was gonna be the one to ruin Rooster and Hannigan's plan. Way to go, writers! Oh, and also, Sandy does absolutely nothing in this film, he just follows Annie around, barks at fake Annie's parents, and that's it. This just blows compared to the 1982 version, where he actually helped saving both Annie's and Warbuck's lives.Now, my biggest issue with this movie: It has zero character development. Things happen so fast, it's almost unbelievable how characters like each other. When Grace comes to pick Annie up, she just decides to take the first girl she sees, Annie does NOTHING to win her over. Then, Annie and Mr. Warburck's relationship. It starts with Annie asking to watch him working, then cut to a musical number, then they're suddenly all Father-Daughter figure. To top it off, Sandy comes in right at the end and jumps over Mr. Warbuck's car. Grace just says "Well, sir, you've always wanted a dog!" and that's it: Warbucks and Sandy are great friends! Really, now? But despite all the issues, I think this movie is still really enjoyable. It would've been perfect, had it followed 1982's version and fixed the musical numbers. Sadly, it didn't happen. But at least, most of it was very faithful to the original Broadway production, which I respect Disney for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having grown up with the 1982 version of "Annie" this version is not so great,yes,the new Annie is cute,but Aileen Quinn has a charisma Alicia Morton does not have.The song and dance numbers are too short or just plain annoying. I prefer the old cast to the new cast. Kathy Bates does not make a good Miss Hannigan,Carol Burnett was so much funnier. The little girl who plays Molly is annoying and the orphans aren't even grungy looking plus there's only seven (which is weird) even if there were seven main orphans is the 1982 version,they still showed extras . The dramatic scene was cut out and replaced by something else .If you must see "Annie" see the 1982 version,it's so much better</fullReview>

		<fullReview>k, no offense to anyone who likes this movie/musical. But i think that this musical is way to old and should just be put out of it's misery. Annie is kind of like your great aunt Marge... you know you love her, but you don't always want to see her. Not that they should change it to like, rent music, but i think a remake would be best for all of us. Espessially so people don't begin thinking that all that Broadway is, is cheesy music like Annie, and that it can be really good. Maybe they should think about doing a movie of Wicked, or Beauty and the Beast, Aida, Lion King, ANYTHING!!!!! Just get some more Broadway out there for people to begin to obsess over and get all of this rap junk off of the radio. Please, stop the madness and get a new, updated, REAL musical that's actually on Broadway, on DVD. PLEASE!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not cartoony (thank goodness!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up watching the 1981 Annie, but I little expected that they would make what had been overblown and cartoonish into something beautiful and realistic, which was exactly as intended. [If you don't believe me, go to the Disney website and read about why they wanted the obvious changes from the 1981 version.] I admire all the actors in the cast, and like both films! There are flaws here (and in the other one), but they can all be justified.First, there's Victor Garber. I will admit his Daddy Warbucks was most often understated, and that it bothered me at first. But he is a stage actor, and Disney didn't want this "Annie" to be unrealistic. So I don't hold it against Victor Garber for being very subtle. In fact, because of this film he is now one of my favorite actors. I also admire the way Disney chose him because he looks young enough to be Annie's father! That alone makes him more believeable than the others, even though the relationship development between Daddy Warbucks and Annie is lacking here.Next is Kathy Bates. She had Carol Burnett to contend with, and she didn't have the looks or youth to be a convincing whore (it worked for Carol Burnett, though). But, again, the purpose of a remake is not to copy, but to try to make a new and believeable perspective. Bates' acting is wonderful just the same, and her singing was great! It wouldn't have been good for children to see her slap the orphans, anyway.I also admire Alicia Morton, and that Disney broke the rules by giving her straight chin-length hair like a normal 1930s kid. She was younger than Aileen Quinn, and the way Alicia makes Annie not bubbly but sweet and sympathetic (at her age) amazes me. Deep down, Annie was always a sweet but determined girl, and Alicia effectively portrayed those qualities without being too fiesty.Next, the music. It would have been redundant to copy the musical arrangements exactly. The choreography almost never suggested big production numbers like the 1981 film did. But the singing and dancing are uniformally great in each film, and the songs are all great. I had never heard "NYC" before, and it was (thankfully) not as long as "Let's go to the Movies". "Easy Street" was wonderful (as always) but I can't tell if the arrangement was different (the dancing was, but that didn't make it less fun). "Tommorrow" was sung very well by Alicia (and Audra McDaniel, near the end). "Together at Last" didn't have the tap-dancing or fireworks. "Something was Missing" is very sentimental, and perfect with Victor Garber's understated acting and beautiful voice.All in all, the 1981 and '99 Annie films were very enjoyable, but this version is better. It proves to me that a remake is not inheritantly bad, but that it has new possibilities and no stereotypes (except in people's imaginations). 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>30's Pop Culture figure is resurrected in this terrible PC version of the stage hit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest musical travesty from ABC, was missing the two vital ingredients that made Little Orphan Annie a national treasure. SPUNK AND ENERGY! We all know since Cinderella that these TV musicals inhabit a PC world of their own, which is fine. But what is wrong with having a really mean Miss Hannigan. She threatens the kids but she never hits them? What kind of a villain is she? Those little brats in the orphanage were meaner than she was. The Wicked Witch from The Wizard of Oz never touched Dorothy but her presence was menacing enough and her threats had teeth to them. Kathy Bates, who normally is wonderful, didn't seem to have a clue as to how to play the character. It seemed like every time she was getting ready to be really mean she would back off. Can this be the same Kathy Bates from Misery? and Dolores Claiborne? And while I'm all for giving newcomers a chance, couldn't they have at least chosen an Annie who can sing? Or if they couldn't find a singing one, couldn't they have chosen one who could act and dub in the singing? Who is that kid related to? For that matter, who is Victor Garber and why does he keep getting employed in these TV musicals? He doesn't sing that well and he can't act. Besides his head is too lopsided to be a bald Daddy Warbucks. Give me somebody with an nice head. John Schuck played Daddy Warbucks on stage and he did a great job. Why can't they hire somebody who knows what they're doing? Speaking of Andrea McArdle, besides the fact that the NYC number was terrible and I do mean awful, she is not the most attractive cookie on film. Her voice is good, but those veins sticking out of her neck when she hit the high notes. I thought her head was going to explode. I mean I'm all for sentiment, but there are lots of pretty or at least attractive girls out there who could have used this break. Andrea needs to be on stage with a flattering pink gel. Most of the musical numbers couldn't have been flatter. Maybe? Awful! Hard Knock Life! Stupid and pointless. Little Girls? You're Going to Like it Here? I couldn't help but notice that even though Oliver Warbucks had plenty of servants most of them were white (except for Grace). Does being terribly PC mean that good black singers and dancers have to wait for ABC to do the TV version of My Fair Lady so that they can play British gentry? What in the world was the director thinking? The only good number was Easy Street and that was entirely due to Alan Cummings, who truly understands how to have a nasty attitude. This musical will probably do well in the ratings and even though I want ABC to keep producing more musicals on TV, come on people, you can do better. Why don't they hire a director who's actually seen a musical and I don't mean The Wiz or A Chorus Line!? Who is the dweeb who directed and choreographed? There has to be a decent choreographer available. What about the person who choreographed for The Drew Carey Show or those Gap commercials? At least hire someone who realizes he doesn't have any good ideas and is willing to steal! I'll gladly point him in the right direction!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was wonderful. It had perfect casting in every role. Alicia is a wonderful Annie who has a beautiful voice and was a touching Annie, she seemed like a real little girl. Audra, Victor, Alan, Kathy, Andrea and Kristin were awesome. It was nice to see an Annie that made the characters real people instead of cartoon characters. The new orchestrations and movie version of Annie was refreshing, it was like watching it for the first time and listening to new songs. I noticed people comparing this film to the 1982 film version, thinking it was supposed to be a remake of that. This movie is based on the Broadway show which made it's debut in 1977, the characters like Punjab and the Asp do not exist in the stage production nor do songs like Dumb Dog, Sandy, I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here. Those changes were made strictly for the 1982 film. The new film is very true to the stage show, much more so than the original film which in my opinion was poorly done and cast. So I was thrilled when they announced the making of this film and especially with the finished product. Finally a good film version of the stage show. Can't wait until the video is released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First rule of doing remakes should be that they improve upon what came before, not just strip out the parts that made it colorful. What a kinder, gentler, more boring, pedestrian, and stripped-down politically-correct version this is when compared to the earlier film. Can't have an alcoholic, or a man-hungry woman, can't have a strong ethnic character like Punjab. Throw in a little inter-racial romance, and you have a PC dumbed-down version of a movie that DID entertain... It was also pretty amazing how Warbucks went from hardened money-grubber to softy would-be adopter of Annie in the space of about two minutes, without any effort on her part... Obviously, from the high ratings it got and the sampling of reviews on here, it struck a chord with some people... I just don't see how... Blech... I feel the need to rent the original to expunge the horrid memory from my mind :P</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how movie musicals of Broadway smash hits should be done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With perfect casting, tight direction and pretty much every song from the original Broadway show, this "Annie" may have confused those only familiar with the original motion picture with the fact that it was so different. Well, folks, gone are the Asp, Punjab, and overly cute little girls that gave me more of a diabetic coma than "Pippi Longstocking" and "Curly Sue". They weren't in the original Broadway version. The little girls on stage were not so sugary sweet that one more spoonful of sugar would have them running around as if they were on speed. They were real little girls, not really happy with their plight, but supportive of each other and able to seem real while not making the audience want to give them an instant time out every time they looked at the camera and smiled sweetly.There's a fabulous performance by Alicia Morton as the long-suffering little girl who is feisty enough to survive the abuse by orphanage manager Miss Hannigan (an understated Kathy Bates who really makes you feel the plight of what it was like to be a cynical single woman during the depression) and she is surrounded by a talented group of young girls who simply perform their numbers rather than force them down your throat. Gone are the constant close-ups on Annie from the original that was just simply overdone, and also gone is any trace of her trying to be a red-headed Shirley Temple. She's cute without being cloying and the others are totally likable as well. A recent Broadway revival made sure that this mood remained, and rather than "oohs and aahs" for their overly cuteness, they get applause for seeming even more grown-up than the grownups around them.Victor Garber's Daddy Warbucks is softer here too than Albert Finney's, still a hard-nosed industrialist, but one you can feel the secret heart of gold hidden underneath. Audra McDonald gives Grace Farrell a bigger heart than Ann Reinking's, and even if seeing a white man and black woman working so closely together during a very segregationist era is a bit jarring, McDonald is pure joy. Every note out of her brilliant singing pipes is tear-inducing and powerful. She really wins your heart with each number she sings, yet isn't so much of a greedy song bird that the others in the big production numbers are overshadowed.Thank goodness that they restored "N.Y.C." for this production to take over the pretentious "Let's Go to the Movies". To include Andrea McCardle (the original Annie) to play the "Star to Be" was also magnificent casting. The usual thankless roles of Rooster and Lily St. Regis are memorable villain roles for Alan Cumming and Kristen Chenoweth who utilizes her high-pitched, sometimes shrill voice to perfection. With a lot of the smaller parts played by supporting Broadway actors, the theatricality of the original is restored, and the production values make it seem more opened up and less claustrophobic.Yes, there are some good things in the original "Annie" film, but for purists, this one is so much better. The fact that it has a Broadway veteran as director (Rob Marshall) makes this so much more enjoyable and takes away the cartoonish feeling about what Ray Stark and John Huston had done in the early 80's. So check into the T.V. version of "Annie" for proof of how a Broadway show can be filmed without jarring changes that make no sense. I'm sure you are going to like it there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a Disney made for TV movie version of the Broadway musical Annie. It is by far the best version on video. The cast led by Victor Garber and Kathy Bates is fantastic. Audra McDonald plays Grace Farrel. It is very obvious from her performance here why she won three Tony awards before she turned 30. Kristin Chenoweth and Alan Cummings also are great as well. Clearly, you will never see a cast this good on Broadway. There is also a cameo appearance by Andrea McArdle, Broadway's original Annie. She still has the charisma she displayed as Annie.With such a strong cast it is almost impossible for Disney not to make a good movie. However in 1982, the first film version of the play was made with also an all-star cast, and it failed. This TV-movie succeeds. The stage and look are wonderful. Kudos to Disney.</fullReview>

Kathy Bates is one of my favorite actresses, so the opportunity to see her singing and dancing was quite a pleasure. That being said, she is no Carol Burnett, who was divine in the original.

		<fullReview>{clicked, just to be SURE! ya just nevver knoww}This production was an incredible waste of superbly gifted performers, everywhere from stage and big screen, to small screen! From the fantastic stage actor, Victor Garber, and Kathy Bates; she being the brightest spot in the whole production--a refreshing wellspring of fearless, tell-it-like-it-is talent; to the dynamic Audra McDonald, who I often saw while she was growing up, performing in stage plays in local theater back in Fresno, California. She shined technically, but not plausibly, as Grace.. she was just really, uncomfortably, out of place. I'm also quite a fan of the irrepressible Alan Cummings, he's always a giggle. Besides Kathy, and along with the girl who played Annie, he shined brightest, I think. Their parts weren't so affected by the gaping flaws in the film.For those who are too young to remember, or to have learned, what the time was really like, it might have been terrific! But for the rest us, who like productions such as this, with historic relevance, to remain at least somewhat intact, it was an endless barrage of "Why did they doo that?!"~ Start-to-Finish!As has been said, the music was tops. Okay, but you could put a tape/cd, the radio, or TV music station on and hear the same songs without the blatant, gagging, reality-bending, history-twisting PC baloney this piece offered--P U! Sure, there were a few glitches with the 1982 version.. Though the cast was terrific--Carol Burnett was a scrreeeam! {and that really was Tim Curry shushing down the banister, nO double!}--Some of Annie's little cast-mates were achingly posey and forced in a couple of the close- ups during dance numbers... and it may have gotten a bit heavy-handed, maybe, in a few places, but on the whole, it was light-years better than this mindlessly PC mess.Who knows.. If they can do this, maybe someday they'll do an all WHITE version of Porgy &amp; Bess! Roots! West Side Story!..... Mmaaybe nott!~ -_-Sorry, Kathy, I love ya, but bad choice!

		<shortDescription>Why ?!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is nearly a nightmare of a casting : The girl (Alicia Morton) can sing but lacks charisma and looks like a 20-year-old miss. (Victor Garber) is so young to play (Oliver Warbucks), being in his late thirties or something. And (Kathy Bates) seems too dressy, fresh and beautiful to be (Miss Hannigan).The script is deadly dry; there is nothing you can call "funny" in here. I didn't watch dazzling anything either. The musical arrangement wasn't special at all. I know that the director is (Rob Marshall) who'll make later (Chicago ? 2002) and (Nine ? 2009) but OH MY GOD he just made the numbers this time into very tight sets, cadres (and budget !). Suffice it to say that he got the nerve to shoot (Easy Streets)'s number all around one desk (at this point I was about to be asphyxiated!).Actually the differences between the first cinematic version and this TV production define what writing for movies is all about. Here (Warbucks) loved Annie so fast. You must miss the beauty and the beast thing between the 2 characters which was stronger. Where are the BIG numbers? Where are the gags (put the Mona Lisa in my bathroom)? Where is (We Got Annie) routine, (At The Movies), (Sign) or (Maybe) sang by (Warbucks) ? Where is the character of the Indian magician bodyguard ? And where is the BIG finish?? As a whole it missed the most the charisma and the originality that discriminated the first movie. And speaking about missing, I know that I missed too much (Ann Reinking)'s dancing talent, smile and legs !And even without much comparison : The evil brother thinks about the scheme of masquerading as Annie's parents before the announcement of the money reward for Annie's parents ?? (so he'd win what exactly ?!), how Annie didn't recognize Miss (Hannigan) as her false mother ? And it turns into bad comedy at the end when we see President (Franklin Roosevelt) as only the private detective of (Warbucks) !, or how (Warbucks) discovers that he loves his secretary "all of a sudden" ?!!In a word, everything this movie has; proves how great the first one was. However it's not a disastrous movie. It's a musical evening into the (Movie of The Week) format; however just poor and so TV (rather TeeVeeeeeeee !). Without much to be distinct with (only the number of "NYC" and "Someone"), I really asked myself why they remade this lovely musical, after one lovely movie, into one not-as-lovely TV movie ? (else hearing the songs from other performers !). I think I know the answer. Which's simply owning the right of the original play, since a full $9.5 million was paid for it by Columbia Pictures in 1982 (one of the biggest, if not The biggest, sums ever paid for a play, so how about being a cinematic flop at the moment as well ?!). They wanted to utilize the rights but not the fun. So, sadly, I still must ask : Why ?!It could have made a wonderful sitcom or mini-series if you ask me, more than another yet useless needless movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I really like both the 1982 version and the 1999 version- the reason why I do prefer the 1982 version is because that in particular is a childhood favourite. I do admit there was a time when I didn't really like this, but now considering that it was a TV remake, and that it is a lot more faithful to the stage play, it is not as bad as I initially thought. True it is too short, and despite her truly beautiful voice I just wasn't sure about Audra MacDonald as Grace. For my tastebuds, it was a tad sugary sweet at times for my liking. However, it does look lovely, and the music is marvellous, and the same with the 1982 version. The performances are great too. I really loved Aileen Quinn,(and I wish people would stop making horrible comments about her) but Alicia Morton is closer than what Annie is like in the stage show, in terms of age, and while both girls were wonderful, Morton has got the better voice. Annie's friends were well done too, but the scene stealer has to be Kathy Bates as Miss Hannigan, just like the wonderful Carol Burnett. There were times when she was absolutely hilarious, and Victor Garber while just lacking the gruffness of Albert Finney was a delight as Daddy Warbucks. Alan Cumming and Kristen Chenoweth were fine as Rooster and Lily, and I also much enjoyed the portrayals of Tim Curry(who is my favourite actor of all time and vastly underrated as an actor) and Bernadette Peters. This version is closer to the stage musical, and has a real Christmas feel to it. The problem I had with the 1982 version were John Huston's direction, and I know they changed the ending, but to be fair, the 1982 version is NOT the first musical adaptation to take liberties with the stage musical, how about My Fair Lady and Oklahoma! Overall, seeing this again recently proved my initial opinion of it wrong. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this is my all-time favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast is superb, and the screenplay is creatively loyal to the original Broadway script, but all that is beside the point. When Walt Disney reflected on the disappointing box-office performance of his animated feature, ALICE IN WONDERLAND (1953), he tersely explained, "It had no heart." We need only compare ALICE to CINDERLLA (1950) to understand what he meant. Perhaps many of his live-actor features met that standard, yet NOWHERE have I ever found a film with so much "heart" as this production. The Broadway original is said to have contained political overtones, and the 1982 motion picture was frankly crafted to reflect John Houston's considerable talents, but this version of ANNIE was made for all of us who want to be moved by a story and still feel jolly-well elated about the way it develops and ends. It takes quite a rare blend of ingredients to create a composition of this quality, no matter what kind of advantages its creators have at the start. This production succeeds for one overriding reason: everyone concerned put every last ounce of heart they possessed into it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as good as the 1982 production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Warbucks in this film was horrible, he fell in love with Annie far too fast and just couldn't compete with Albert Finney at all. The new Annie is cute and all but this warbucks completely destroyed it. I love theatre and Broadway, but in my opinion making it closer to the actual Broadway play was a mistake. The play Annie actually isn't nearly as good as the 1982 butchering of it. Warbucks in this one just dragged the whole performance down, his acting was fine, but the way they wrote the role was awful. Albert Finney's performance was far greater, there is just no comparison. When they revamped the play in the 1982 production, aside from 'Let's go to the movies', it was excellent. In my opinion they should have cut the song out from that part, N.Y.C. doesn't fit in with Warbuck's role in the 1982 film and Let's go to the movies was awful. But everything else was great, I especially loved 'Sign!'. It fit in comfortably with Albert Finney's 4 note range and had great lyrics. 'You make them grovel, while you buy lavaliers!' My advice, Don't see this film, if you want to see something closer to the original then go out and see the play, because this 1999 film fails to recreate the play without butchering it as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ok remake but not as good as the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people say that this version was more like the play. I have never seen the play but the 1982 version is what we all know as Annie. This Annie was ok, but she didn't have the same spunk and charisma as Aileen Quinn. She was a little on the whinny side. The actors were more professional but I dont feel they were right for the part. Victor Garber as daddy warbucks was a mistake. He was nothing like the original. Kathy Bates is a good actress but not right for Ms. Hannigan. Some of the songs are missing such as "dumb dog" and a lot were added also. The orphans didnt have the magic as the others did. Especially in "It's a Hard Knock life". The 1982 version did a way better job with that song. More gymansitics and just more realistic in general.Overall it's ok, but if you really liked the original you might want to steer clear of this one.</fullReview>

Kathy Bates and Alan Cumming are SUPERB as the villainous Ms Hennigan and Rooster, and the movie lights up whenever they are on the screen. The obligatory "nice" characters (Annie, Warbucks, etc) are not exceptional, but move the story along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a remake of the 1982 "Annie" (thank heavens), this is the first filmed version of the original Broadway "Annie", I know, I've appeared in a couple of different stage productions of the show. Not only has this film returned some of the original songs to the story (although the still left out my favorite "Herbert Hoover") they didn't replace missing numbers with the kind of garbage the earlier film threw in. Kathy Bates is the perfect Miss Hannigan. Don't get me wrong, I love Carol Burnett, she was just too far over the top. She would not have lasted a week as the matron of a NY orphanage in the 30s. Times may have been hard, but the child welfare system was tough, not just on the kids but on those who cared for them. And just a little advice to those questioning the wisdom of having Rob Marshall as the director/choreographer, go see "Chicago"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly the TV version is not without flaws compared to the various stage presentations. It does however stand out as being infinitely more watchable than the 1982 Huston version which shifted the conclusion to July 4 primarily as I dimly recall due to problems in getting access to the Grace Mansion. I will avoid commenting on the choreography but wonder what was going through his mind in the staging. The 1999 version benefits from a better Warbucks in Garber and McDonald's voice which soared beyond Reinking. The ending which was not over powering at least avoided the ridiculous movie ending. Overall, the 1982 movie had so much overacting and poor decisions that anything had to look better in comparison. Its been a while since I first saw both of these products but it was fun to see the TV version again recently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since this was a TV production my wife goaded me into renting for our daughter, I had pretty low hopes for it, especially since it was a remake of a well-loved classic motion picture. But I was shocked and amazed when I wound up enjoying it more than the previous version.(I guess the following could be viewed as containing spoilers, so consider yourself warned) For starters, this one feels much more like a stage play in which the inclusion of songs makes a little more sense. Kathy Bates' version of Mrs. Hannigan is sober, and more clothed, which will make parents more grateful. and they got rid of that ridiculous chase sequence, opting for a more low-key ending that takes place entirely in the Warbucks home. Thankfully.Everything that I didn't like about the original movie has been removed, making this a much stronger film. Heck, I even get a little choked up at the end. And that's coming from a 20-something cynical guy. So take that for what it's worth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who compares this movie to the 1982 Annie with Albert Finney &amp; Carol Burnett will either love or hate it in comparison. My wife and I both MUCH prefer the 1982. (In fact, she was incredulous when I told her most people seem to prefer the new one).EVERYTHING's better in the earlier version: the dialogue, the choreography, the gymnastics, the casting, you name it. One tiny example from 1982 is Carol Burnett's hilarious retort (which is and should be lost on younger members of the audience) when Lily St. Regis brags, "Named from the hotel." (you'll have to watch the film, 'cause half the hilarity is in the line, and half in the WAY she says it). In THIS version, Kathy Bates flatly responds, "Which floor?"We also both thought casting an African-American Grace made absolutely ZERO sense in the historical context of the 1920s/ 30s. Now I love movies about interracial relationships, but that's NOT what this story is (was) about! It's supposed to be about ANNIE, d***it! Having an interracial romance (while simultaneously pretending there would have been zero racials issues associated with it) is simply an annoying 1999 PC distraction to the real story.And where's Annie's curly hair?Leapin' lizards! Gimme the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sun HAS come out on a new "Annie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this version! It was just as good as the original starring Albert Finney and Carol Burnett. It follows the original Broadway version instead of it's predecessor of the silver screen. Kathy Bates was maybe a little nicer than Burnett's Hannigan but she still had that mean-lady aura she had in "Misery". The 3-time Tony-Award-winning First lady of the Broadway musical theater Audra Ann McDonald's portrayal of Grace Farrell put her on the road to becoming a big star in Hollywood as well, and Victor Garber (of "Titanic" and tv's "Invisible Child") makes for an even better Oliver Warbucks than Albert Finney. Kristin Chenoweth is a perfectly ditzy, empty-headed Lily St. Regis ("Named from the hotel") and is a fresh, promising face for Hollywood as well. And let's not forget Alicia Morton's sweet-smiled Annie ("Leapin' lizards!"). But the one who really stole the show (at least for a few minutes) is Broadway star Alan Cumming as Rooster Hannigan (Tony-Award winner for 97-98's "Cabaret" revival) with his show-stopping rendition of "Easy Street". The arrangement for the score in this version was even better than the original version also so the soundtrack should sell a couple of million copies at least. Kathy Bates and Alan Cumming should hopefully get Emmy nominations! Yes, "the sun HAS come out" on "Annie".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Annie" is the musical that made me fall in love with Broadway. I saw it when I was in junior high, and listened to the original cast album constantly. I thought nothing associated with "Annie" could ever be bad. Then the 1982 film version came along and ruined everything. Overwrought, over-acted, over-produced, over-hyped...what a waste of celluloid. When Disney announced this version, I was hesitant and fearful. How gloriously wrong I was!! This new version is classy, well-produced, and features a wonderful cast. The producers recognized the charms of the Broadway show and managed a wonderful translation to the screen. For those who thought Kathy Bates was "too nice," I would counter that her Hannigan was a wonderful mix of meanness and pathos. Alicia Morton did a fantastic job, and has a great voice! Alan Cumming DID steal the show, which is what any good Rooster should do. Kudos to Victor Garber and Audra McDonald as well! Musical orchestration and technical credits are tops! And a big thanks to whoever decided to ditch the "fright wig" and the fire-red dress! While once an important part of "Annie" lore, they are outdated and would only serve to distract from the real charms of the show. Bravo Disney and ABC!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My comments on this film are being compared to the original Broadway play "Annie" rather than the 1982 film version, as I have been a fan of this musical since I first saw a live version of it. In that light, this is a great adaptation from stage to screen, as it mostly stays true to the original story and maintains much of that on-stage feel. This version brings back the song "N.Y.C," the great musical number that the 1982 version omitted. Perhaps the original version with Carol Burnett was more humorous and exciting than this film, but I actually like the feel of this one even better. It has that typical happy and innocent feel evident in many of my favorite Disney movies, such as "The Parent Trap." Unlike the original, all of the actors actually prove to be good singers as well, which is essential in a film like this. All of the songs are performed similar to the original musical, a great thing for fans like myself. Two things really keep this from being a perfect version of this story. First, one of my favorite scenes, in which Annie gets everyone at the White House to sing "Tomorrow," is not in this version. Also, Miss Hannigan pretending to be Annie's mother is completely different from the original story and is hardly believable. Nevertheless, I will overlook those two things because of the great joy this film brings and overall good job this adaptable does to one of my favorite musicals.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film proves that Television can make great musicals. In 1982 Columbia released the much anticipated "Annie" which was based on the Broadway musical. The score had already 2 well known songs by the time that film was released. Those songs are "Tomorrow" and "It's a Hard Knock Life". However that film failed to really catch on! It was a minor hit but the film took a critical pounding! In 1999 Disney/Abc/Columbia gave us this television version which is a far superior product. Major set pieces from the 1982 film are not replicated here. The film follows closely the Broadway Show and that is plus. This film is also runs 30 minutes shorter than the 1982 film. The major number in this film is "NYC". this musical sequence there is a cameo by the best known Broadway Annie which of course Andrea Mcardle. This film is very enjoyable and is well worth seeing. In 2014 there was another theatrical remake. In a few more years I am sure that Broadway will once again have a revival. Until then we have this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an enjoyable movie! I only wish that the networks could bring more staged productions to TV, and do it this well. The music and performances were wonderful--Victor Garber and Audra MacDonald are a magnetic presence. Having never seen a production of "Annie" before, I was pleasantly surprised at how moving the story was, and how really good the music is. This production of "Annie" could have easily gone the route of sickeningly sweet schmaltz, but it rose above that level. The actors (including a highly enjoyable Annie in Alicia Morton) and the producers are to be credited for not making this into an over-the-top spectacle, yet successfully allowing the special theatrical values to shine through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On few counts did this movie version stay honest to the author's intent. The best Annie version ever produced was the 1982 version, where Aileen Quinn added the perfect combination of voice and kid spunk that has been the trademark of Annie ever since its inception.In this version, Alicia Morton was superb in her own right and deserves maximum honors for her vocal performance and her delightful acting. She carried the film despite an abhorable liberal agenda within Hollywood to darken all formerly distinguised caucasion roles with people of darker color. Audra McDonald is within her own skills a very beautiful and highly talented young woman, but the author would be rolling over in his grave to know that an early 1900's musical would have a voyeuristic liaison between a 'colored woman' and a 'white man'. It just would NOT happen. The movie was lovely in many places, save the use of Kathy Bates who for any role in a light-hearted musical is an unwise choice. Ms. Bates is a loud political activist and is too dislikable off-stage and thus ill-suited for gentle scipts.Victor Garber as Daddy Warbucks also lacked identifiable charisma. He is physically awkwardly with an unpleasantly shaped head, and simply does not realistically portray the part of an America Billionaire of the highest success. Mr. Garber's voice is marvelous however, but all-in-all he comes across as a mis-cast schmo.All in all I gave this movie a 10 for Alicia Morton's participation, but a 3 over all, due to its negligance of historical perspective and bad casting outside of Alicia.</fullReview>
