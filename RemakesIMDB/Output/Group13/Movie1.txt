		<shortDescription>One of my all time favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aileen Quinn as Annie has everyone beat. With that darling face, that beautiful voice, she did a fabulous job creating the character. Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks was wonderful! He had that stern 'businesslike' attitude which grew into heartfelt love for this little red-headed orphan girl. Carol Burnett was awesome as the lady who ran the orphanage. She started out gruff and tumble (and drunk) but as it turns out, she really has a love for these orphans.There is NO comparison to the newest version. I can't see anyone else playing these parts better than Quinn, Burnett and Finney. It just isn't the same. If you want a beautiful musical with fun loving attributes, please see this movie!!! Your children will love you for it.Highly Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can you not love this movie? It has wonderful, catchy songs, it's a clean movie, a great storyline, and wonderful actors and actresses! What more could you ask for?! It's better than most movies today because it actually has a moral and a plot. It's a great family movie. It's one of my favorite movies, next to The Sound of Music. Anybody who doesn't watch this movie is seriously missing out. I'm sure you will like it. It's a lot better than the Disney remake. Sometimes the original, older movies are better than the remakes. And this movie is one of them! If you like musicals, or just want to watch a family movie, this is one that you really should watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really great, and I'm a cold-heart film cynic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film as a child and will always hold fond nostalgia for it. You definitely have to watch this from the point of view as a child (with so many "family" films out today, I know this might be hard, when their goal has been to entertain everyone). I loved all the performances in it from Albert Finney to Carol Burnett and Tim Curry. My most favorite Huston film is The Misfits, but don't expect that from this film, which I think alot of people are doing. As most directors age, they tend to get "soft" in their filmmaking as their hunger is replaced with complacency, but this film isn't as bad as some people describe it. It's a musical, it was made in the 80's, and it's primarily for kids. Compared to other movies made in that time period, this one is actually quite good. And although I've only seen parts of the newer one made by Disney, this one seems alot more mature and crafted, and not so candy-coated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>!!!Spoilers!!!The very first time I watched this film, I was hooked. God only knows how many times I have seen it since. And every time I have cried at the bit where Rooster, Lily and Miss Hannigan kidnap her from Daddy Warbucks.Carol Burnett, Tim Curry and Albert Finney are all excellent. As is Aileen Quinn as little orphan Annie. In fact the entire cast are brilliant. Annie is by far one of the best films I have ever seen. One of my favourite parts is the bit where they come in from the movies and Grace and Daddy Warbucks put Annie to bed while she's sleeping. And another fave is when all the kids from the orphanage go looking for Daddy Warbucks' house because they know what Rooster, Lily and Miss Hannigan are up to. Absolute brilliance. One thing I have to say is never, never, never, never watch the sequel. It is complete rubbish!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this movie was a real spirit-lifter. It is a movie that I hope everyone who watches it has a change of attitude towards orphans and homeless children and adults. Sometimes I find myself turning my back on homeless people. Although I am ashamed to admit it, I do hope that others will look beyond money and appearance and see what really matters. This movie, once again, was wonderful. I hope that you keep up all of the good work and keep producing and directing movies such as this one. Enjoy all of your comments and all of your hard earned credit that you are receiving and take the time to really preview all of your scripts and watch the movie several times to praise all of your good work. Thank you very much and I will be watching the movies that you produce no matter how long, or short, they might be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just recently watched this movie, for the first time in my adult life. It's even better as an adult, because you catch all of these little things like, "Mr. Warbucks, you're really handsome, for a Republican." Some people bash it for being different than the Broadway show, but so what, they did a good job. It's a fun movie for people of all ages. It's hilarious, musical, and touching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot count how many times I have watched this film. As a child I would watch it almost daily and as an adult I watch it whenever it comes on the television. That was until my daughter came along and discovered the beauty that is Annie... so we have watched it time and time together, so much so I had to buy a new DVD copy as we wore ours out!Regardless of this being an old film, it does not disappoint, it can be enjoyed by all ages and it will be timeless.These days the story brings me to tears. The music and the songs are fantastic, as are the child actors. The singing, the dancing, the story line have the ability to stir up so many different emotions. And as Daddy Warbucks can vouch, Annie has the ability to win over even the most unavailable hearts.As a viewer you will not be disappointed with this film, if you haven't already, watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Annie, is a wonderful story about a 10 year old girl in the depression Area of our Nation's history. Her one dream is to find the parents who left her on the doorstep of the orphanage and have a family. The orphans that play her friends are wonderful. As the movie goes on she is choosen to live with the billionare Oliver Warbucks for a week as a publicity tactic. Well, she grew on him and he sent out a search for her parents and couldn't find them because none of them knew about the broken locket that Annie had around her neck. It is a wondreful hartwarming story with great music and great acting it is a must to see if you have not already and if you have it is wonderful to see it agian and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up watching Annie and I must say the best song in all of it is little girls. As a mother of 5 girls I wonder why lol. One poster said he hated carol Burnetts part as Mrs Hannigan worst of all. I happen to love her's best of all she made the movie. All of my girls love Annie but this version only they don't care for the remakes. Annie is a classic movie that I am honored to share with my girls today! I have never loved a movie as much as this one. I went through 4 VHS tapes and now own the DVD of Annie. It has stood the test of time. I will not be surprised to see it last another 20 years. I do agree with the omission of Tomorrow it should have been a main part of the show. Albert Finney was great as Daddy Warbucks. I wonder what Grace Farrell is doing now. I tried looking for info on the kids especially Molly I thought she was adorable it seems like the kids aren't acting anymore. Aileen Quinn was the best choice for Annie in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have chosen Annie because I like all the song of Annie. I like all characters in Annie and the dog. I know the songs and they are my favourite and I have seen it on the TV. At the beginning they live in an orphanage and Annie is awake and the other girls are asleep. Annie sings thought the film. She gets picked up by Grace in a car to take her to a mansion, Annie loves it she thinks she's a cleaner but she is a guest. Mr Warbucks wants a boy but he is happy with Annie. He decides to adopt her she wants to find her mam and dad. They can't find her real mam are dad so Mr Warbucks takes her away. I don't have any favourite songs because I like them all. The end bit is my favourite because Grace and Mr Warbucks fall in love and adopt Annie and give her a new locket. I like the fireworks in the sky when Annie's name comes up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aileen Quinn!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Why a kid would want to be an orphan," barks the villainous Miss Hannigan, "is beyond me." Well who can blame the bitter lush: No matter how bad these poor little tykes are treated in that rundown dilapidated orphanage, they're having loads of fun singing and dancing like there's no? tomorrow! Although this big budget extravaganza's loaded with great actors like Albert Finney as bald billionaire Daddy Warbucks, Tim Curry as a con artist and Carol Burnett as the bearer of the quote above, it's Aileen Quinn's ANNIE that steals the show.Displaying an everygirl persona mixed with a dynamic musical talent, Quinn displays the essential energy for the titular redhead without lacking pathos and vulnerability. Even when given a dream-week to stay with Daddy Warbucks for his publicity, her true aim is having a real family. Determined to find her original parents, Warbucks makes a radio campaign with a hefty reward ? perking ears of the wrong people. And while Annie slowly warms the heart of the steely industrialist, songs break out in just about every-other scene.The tunes are catchy, showcased with incredible dance numbers. The time-period sets look and feel authentic; from poverty stricken streets and alleyways to the plush Warbucks mansion, veteran auteur John Huston takes us to a polarizing time of haves and have-nots in the 1930's depression era with vibrant reality. Although one particular scene as Warbucks (constantly reestablished as a greedy Capitalist) is talked into the New Deal by President Roosevelt seems distracting from Annie's personal adventure, we sporadically return to the orphanage where Miss Hannigan's plot to recover the reward along with her nefarious brother provides the audience ? especially the younger ones ? a constantly suspenseful edge.Making this much more than just a kid's movie but the type of old school entertainment that always works. And while there could have been a few less distractions (some songs and characters are more important than others) and even more of Aileen Quinn's Annie... perhaps the studio realized all the talent involved and wanted to make an equal game of it... she's the one we ultimately root for: and this reviewer cannot imagine anyone else in the title role!

		<shortDescription>A good family movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm David's ex-girlfriend - Sofia - and I saw this movie when I was a kid living in the States. I think actually met Annie the character when I was at a Christmas party at the White House for foreigners around 1985. She was as cute as in the movie! Then, I knew all the songs by heart. Funny since they have now made a rap song out of part of the theme song - "Its a hard luck life". When I think about the story now I realize it contains all the aspects that a good story should contain, despair, hope, action and a happy ending. Just like the good, some times scary old tales that you read to your children. I guess you can compare Annie to Pretty Woman - just a different age target. (Finding an older man with money! ) However the move is without nasty jokes so totally OK to see with your kids!Watching it reminds me just how much I miss being with David and how stupid it was to break up with him. //Sofia</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since I was a small child, I have loved this movie. Even as a grown 24 yr old, this is my favorite movie of all time. It is truly a family film. Now that I have it on DVD, I'm not ruining VHS tapes by watching it so often. One of my Aunts fondest memories of me as a child happens to be me sitting in front of the TV, singing "Tomorrow" at the top of my lungs. My favorite scenes would have to be when they go to the movies, the look on the child's face, brings a smile to your own face, and the final scene as Punjab rescue's Annie from the bridge and sets her safely in Warbucks and Grace's arms. This is a movie that I hope one day when I have my own children they will cherish this movie as I have all my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Likable Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ANNIE (1982) **** Likable basis of the Broadway musical about a little orphaned girl, Annie, who falls into the care of a well-to-do billionaire. The rich man had intended to boost his political image through this situation, but he ultimately wants to keep the little girl in light of his newfound daughter-like love for her. Aileen Quinn is fine as the titled character, turning in rags for riches, all the while hoping to someday reunite with her real parents who had abandoned her for orphan care. Though the movie goes on for too long, the charm and likability of this musical production more than makes up for it. Of the lead players, Albert Finney, Carol Burnett, and Ann Reinking are particularly nice to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Annie is a wonderful movie. It's great for children, particularly young girls. I have been watching the film since I was very small, and I have worn out five VHS copies to boot. Ergo I, as a young child, and still do now that I'm older, for reasons all my own, enjoyed this movie. This movie is superb for young children, and that's how it should be viewed, not as how poor the direction was, because most kids don't even know what a director does. See the film through a childs eyes, better yet, your childs eyes, and they will love it. Plus, it always keeps my cousins relatively quite (they like to sing) for two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than its reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this film of the musical "Annie" has often been criticized for a number of reasons, it is hardly the worst screen adaptation of a stage musical (the utterly grotesque 1974 film of "Mame" takes that dishonor). This film is not nearly as bad as people have said. Though not necessarily a great film, it is a good film with a number of strengths. The film's strongest asset is definitely its cast, the highlight of which being Carol Burnett, a treat to watch as Miss Hannigan. Newcomer Aileen Quinn plays a charming Annie, Albert Finney makes a wholly convincing Daddy Warbucks, and Ann Reinking gives a winning performance as his assistant, Grace Farrell. At the film's core is a heartwarming, if somewhat sentimental, story set in the Depression, backed by most of Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin's unforgettable score. Six of the play's songs are dropped, and five new ones have been written. The best of them is the humorous `Sign,' between Burnett and Finney. The large-scale, Busby Berkeley-esque `Let's Go to the Movies,' though it's a nice song and a spectacular number, it threatens to slow down the picture, and is thus a bit of a weak spot. It is a forgivable one, though. A song called `Dumb Dog,' whose melody is taken from the one-night wonder "A Broadway Musical," replaces `Tomorrow' in its proper place in the story, which is a loss. The reprise of the song, `Sandy' works better. The fifth new song, a swinger called `We Got Annie,' is a highly listenable reworking of a song cut from the stage play. Director John Huston, a choice that confounded many in Hollywood, directs the film with competence, though it's not a personal film for him. Most of the credit for putting the production together goes to producer Ray Stark. He assembles a production crew that works together to create a visually splendid film with beautiful period sets. The film's production is indeed extravagant, even by Hollywood standards, but only once or twice does it go over the top (as in the end of the picture). The film as a whole is an engagingly old-fashioned musical spectacle with enough wit, charm and genuine warmth to offset its core sentimentality and occasional excess. Though it doesn't follow the stage version to the letter, it still works pretty well. Score: 7/10</fullReview>

I saw the play last night, which was also good. However, nothing compares to the movie and to Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan = PERFECTION! I love this movie!I read a terrible review of this movie on here and I just don't understand... How could anyone hate this movie so much? It is just a fun, feel good movie. Yes, no sex, no violence (well just a tiny bit).

It used to come on HBO every right around the holidays and recently I owned the wide screen version on DVD (I wouldn't dream of that 19 years ago). This movie was such a spectacle...one of the greatest 80s movies that the new generation (to my big surprise) don't appreciate, the great music...the rich storyline...a favorite for everyone that I know and in my big family.

The purity of a child's voice still cuts you to the soul (if you have one) and I can still remember the goose-bumps I got from miss Quinn's singing the first time I saw it in the theatre. Carol Burnett is great in this film, and she deserves much praise, but above and beyond that - if you want a movie that you and your kids can watch that won't leave them screaming obscenities (or being just plain rude) at daycare on monday, then this is a good film for you to SIT DOWN WITH THEM and watch.</fullReview>

I've never seen the original play, but I feel that the production was pretty splendid, and the casting of the girls were quite good. Though young, they all seem to be able to sing in tune and beautifully, and I just love the way Burnett acts as Miss Hannigan - a kind and non-violent kind of 'eveilness'. Overall, this is a superb production with an excellent musical score - I seldom buy movie soundtracks, but this was one where I enjoyed every single song, and can even sing some of them today despite having last watched the movie on video many years ago.</fullReview>

My parents thought it would teach me to enjoy life I did learn a life lesson that everybody does not have a golden spoon. I wish I had a sister and maybe I might adopt a child someday. The music was very good and it sticks in my head all these years later.Take your kids to see it or rent it. The end of the movie is very scary for very young children. The movie is very different from the play it is more evolved. They should make a follow up as Annie grows up. I hope you enjoy watching the movie as much as I did from LORNE.</fullReview>

The songs are catchy and Annie/the actress playing Annie was a very likable kid who was a lot of fun to watch and sing and dance along with. I watched it again just two days ago and it obviously doesn't look as cool now that it is so many years old, and it just wasn't as much fun watching as an adult, but this movie obviously isn't for adults so much as it is for kids or at least adults watching the movie with their kids.

Tim Curry and Carol Burnett make a wonderfully funny and evil team, along with Bernadette Peters as Curry's sultry love interest. Albert Finney makes a fine lovable grouch and Ann Reinking rounds out the principal cast as the warm, lovely mother figure. I can't believe the reviews I've seen knocking John Huston's only musical effort. The songs are great, the chemistry between the actors seems natural, and the film is wholesome. An ideal choice for a family movie night. Huston was legendary for bringing out the best in his actors with minimal interference, and I think it shows once again in this film. The creator of the Razzies, John J.B. Wilson, should have been gelded for allowing sweet little Quinn to receive a nomination for this performance, let alone a win. Shame on you, Wilson!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ANNIEYou know what... I was expecting this film to be terrible. The whole thing just sounds awful to me... but it's actually very enjoyable.I am not a huge musical fan... I don't mind them but musicals are never my first choice. Although I am a big Oliver fan.Annie was a nice film about a little orphan who is in a horrible orphanage and tried to get away to find her real parents. One day a lady comes to the orphanage and takes Annie for 1 week to live in a huge mansion with a billionaire... he is only allowing this for his image as it makes everyone think he cares.Now as you can expect from any musical (except Sweeney Todd), the acting was not that good. Especially by Annie. But the bad acting didn't ruin the movie. The songs were very catchy and there were obviously a couple of very famous songs too.The cast was quite impressive...Albert Finney was quite funny in the movie playing the billionaire, Oliver Warbucks. I also thought that Carol Burnett was very funny as the evil woman running the orphanage. The best role though has to go to Tim Curry. He plays a great character and as always does a fantastic job. The surprise appearance was from Geoffrey Holder... I mainly know him from Live and Let Die (One of my favourite Bond films) where he plays Baron Samedi... in Annie he plays Punjab. Not his best role, but still quite good.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Even though the acting was not up to scratch, i can still see why this film is locked into a lot of peoples hearts. Very entertaining.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annie Film Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a comic strip original written by Harold Gray. &nbsp;Annie Soon became a sensation that turned into a Broadway musical. It was a huge hit &nbsp;so Thomas Meehan had the idea to write a book on the musical and received the tony award for the Best Book of a Musical in 1977. &nbsp;The play ran on Broadway for nearly six years opening in 1977.Annie was set in 1933 during the Great Depression. The Leading cast included Aileen Quinn as Annie, Albert Finney as "Daddy" Oliver Warbucks, Ann Reinking as Grace Farrell, Warbucks' assistant. Miss Hannigan, Played by Carol Burnett and her brother Rooster Hannigan, Tim Curry. Bernadette Peters &nbsp;Played by Lily St. Regis, and Geoffrey Holder as Punjab. This movie is &nbsp;considered &nbsp;an adventure comedy because of Annie's search for her parents and the encounters that she faces throughout the movie. &nbsp;&nbsp;Annie &nbsp;is an eleven year old orphan during the 1930's. She is very adventurous and tries to escape many times from her orphanage, where she lives with the other orphan girls.Their caretaker Miss Hannigan, is very mean and treats the girls badly. One day while the girls are cleaning the house Annie hides in the laundry basket and is taken outside to The laundryman who take the sheets and dry cleans them. While Annie is out in the world she see a dog that some boys are picking so she goes and helps. While a &nbsp;Policeman is watching her for a distance she is caught and brought back to the orphanage. Soon after Grace Farrell Warbucks assistance comes to the orphanage to take an orphan to stay with his for a week and she chooses Annie. Annie and Mr. Warbucks get along very well. Until Warbucks wants to adopt her and she shows him the locket and note her parents wrote to her saying that they would come back to get her. Warbucks decides that he will help her find her parents and reward the parents 50,000 dollars for coming and taking Annie home. But the people who show up and seem to be her parents turn everything upside down and and things take a crazy twist. (spoiler alert) &nbsp;The costumes in the movie are good at telling the differences between social classes in the 1930's. The clothes of the poor at the time were dirty, old and ripped in some places. When you see Grace Farrell she is dressed very nice as she comes out of the car in front of the orphanage, and you are able to see the differences between how rich people dressed and how poor people were dressed.This shows you &nbsp;how hard it was during the great depression. &nbsp;For lower class people who had little or no money. The movie's costume designer does a good job creating images of the hardships that these people went through during the movie. You really feel connected to the movie through the characters clothes. The set design was very well done. It was very elaborate and had many details to show the life &nbsp;of the characters. You were able to tell a lot about the kids from the orphanage, &nbsp;where everything was very dirty and old. It wasn't kept in good conditions because they didn't that the time or money. You were able to tell that they did not have enough money and were very poor. Then you have Mr. Warbucks home. It was very big, beautiful, everything was new and kept very clean and tidy.

		<shortDescription>It could have been a lot worse; it could have been a bit better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Under John Huston's direction, Annie cannot be accused of manipulating your heartstrings. But when you consider the storyline, you feel like it should. Instead, it is a bit understated; some people are moved by it, and others (who perhaps don't like musicals in the first place) are left cold. My response was in the middle: Annie is entertaining, but not moving. What's right: All of the acting is excellent, especially Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks, who accomplishes the difficult feat of recreating an ancient cartoon character. If judged by its retaining the character of the old Little Orphan Annie newspaper cartoon strip, the movie succeeds. It is generally difficult to bring a modern Broadway musical to the screen, but Vincent Canby, in his New York Times review, says he didn't much like the stage version, and the movie is better. The producer, Ray Stark, didn't like the Broadway version, either. I think Aileen Quinn gets it right, not too polished to seem implausible, but delivers the lovable perkiness the role calls for. Carol Burnett rises above her television persona to do some real acting -- sort of. None of these roles calls for naturalistic acting, although Ann Reinking's performance comes the closest. These are roles that have their roots in a cartoon strip, not a great novel. As presented, this works fine in a musical, in part because Huston doesn't overdo it; With a less subtle director, this could have been a very expensive flop. And there are some genuinely funny scenes,particularly from Burnette, and the radio show. The limiting factors are the story and the music, which are good but not great, a point made by Roger Ebert, with whom I often disagree, but this time his review gets it right: Despite these limitations, the movie is still pleasantly entertaining.The movie Annie inevitably gets compared to is Oliver! In some ways Annie works better as a musical, precisely because it is so rooted in pure fantasy. You can't help feeling something is lost in Oliver! by moving the gritty realism of the original Charles Dickens into a cotton candy fantasy musical. If Annie is cotton candy, well, what else was the cartoon strip? But in both Oliver! and Annie, the depth of emotion the stories suggest is missing. The message of Annie is surprisingly contemporary to America, 30 years later, of Annie opening the heart of Daddy Warbucks, of FDR drafting him to organize his New Deal jobs programs. Spoiler alert:As to the ending, I really wish the Carol Burnett character had been fired or led off in handcuffs. But I guess Annie, herself, was not mean- spirited, so forgiveness was more appropriate. We could learn a lot from Annie, which, I suppose, is the whole point of the story. I recommend watching Annie, not only because it is enjoyable, but also for cultural literacy because there are so many references to it in other movies. And don't miss the legendary Ray Bolger as the radio sound effects man tap dancing with his hands!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did this beautiful classic get such a low rating???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it appalling and ridiculous that the Disney movie got a higher rating than this and that this movie got a 6! that is just plain stupid. "Annie" is a classic, inspirational story. It still is one of my favorite movies, and one of my favorites as a child (well, when I was younger, I'm 14 now). Aileen Quinney (sp.) did an amazing job, she has a beautiful voice and brings such a prescense to the songs she sings. Hannigan and Rooster and his wife whose name I can't remember right now had me cracking up that entire song, they bring a hilarious scene, where Hannigan is clearly drunk, and bring the screen to life with a song that's supposed to be sinister (you will find that I am referring to "Easy Street" but I don't want to give too much away). Hannigan was also my main problem with the Disney version, Kathy bates was too strange, Burnett did a much better job, bates was just too strict and serious, while Burnett was more out there and brought some charisma to the part. Oh and I loved Daddy Warbucks, he was a great addition to this movie as well as Grace.All in all, Annie is beautiful movie that is worth a watch. Please, do not listen to these idiots who tell you it sucked and Quinney can't sing, because she can. Just enjoy the movie, it's great and I promise will become a family classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a child this was my favorite movie. I watched it 3 times at the theater and every Christmas on TV. When we got our first VCR this was the first movie we bought. I watched it so many times, I could say all the lines with the actors and pretend to be Annie. Often times when made to clean my room. I sang it a Hard Knock Life. I would have given anything to have had the internet advantages we do today and kept up with Aileen as she grew. I was also 10 when the movie came out and even remember receiving the postcard sent to all fifth grades in America, searching for Annie!! This is a great movie for this generation with the wonderful bonus of an up to date interview!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was one of my first child's absolute favorites, and it became mine, too, as she wanted to watch it over and over again. The lead characters were wonderful, especially Aileen Quinn. She was the perfect little mischievous redhead, very believable. Albert Finney was unforgettable as Daddy Warbucks. Though his character was stern, warmth shone through his eyes when Annie worked her magic on him. Carol Burnett absolutely shone in this movie as Ms. Hannigan, who shamelessly threw herself at the rich Daddy Warbucks. You felt sorry for her, but delighted in her humiliations by the orphans as they played their tricks and tried to make life for her as difficult as she made it for them.It has been years since I've seen this movie, but I will remember it the rest of my life as one of my all-time favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie Gets A Nine. Carol Burnett Gets A Ten.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>as a film musical, the original 'Annie' is hard to top. i don't know why Disney bothered to remake this. i usually like Disney TV musicals but their version of 'Annie' was done with very little feel for the old all American, right wing, newspaper comic strip heroine. i mean the Disney people portrayed Annie without her trademark curly red afro. what a stupid way to interpret this character. another reminder that even Disney can really blow it sometimes.for one thing, the original 1980's fun musical has a much better cast. you can't really beat a cast that showcases the amazing Carol Burnett, Tim Curry, and the delightfully cute Bernadette Peters. as far as a comparison of Kathy Bates to Carol Burnett, there is none. Burnett owns the role of miss Hannigan. i'm not sure they should have forgiven miss Hannigan at the end here, but hey, it's Carol Burnett after all.Carol Burnett is a American classic (oooo. that sounds sort of rude)and one of the very best female comics ever. People forget that Burnett, like Lucille Ball, forged the way for female comedians in a time when they were mostly men. Carol Burnett can do no wrong as a performer. even when she does drama, she is outstanding. 'Annie' is a reminder that she should have done more broad comedy for theatrical films. Miss Hannigan is definitely very broad comedy (ha! broad. no pun intended). if it wasn't for the likes of Carol Burnett, there might be no Margaret Cho. Burnett is so priceless here screaming "kill! Kill! Kill!" and lamenting the company of "little girls". hilarious.the rest of the cast is superb. beyond first rate. real classy. Aileen Quinn is a marvelous Annie and it's a lot of fun to see curry and Peters ham it up. one of the most under acknowledged performances here is definitely Ann Reinking. for adults, Reinking almost steals the show away from Burnett. but not quite. her role is too soft and sweet to allow anything too intense, but she does it with such classic style and a personable graciousness that is so endearing you just can't get enough of her in this film.i only have one question here. not a complaint. just a question. did Edward Herrmann make a whole career playing FDR? on TV, stage and the movies? he does a nice job, but FDR is my favorite President and Herrman looks nothing like him. the glasses and the make up only help somewhat.this movie also has a really great line. the original comic was very right wing and capitalistic, and this movie definitely touts the glories of free enterprise, but it does have one very deeply profound catch line. Reinking asks Finney, "do you really only love money, business and capitalism? you know those things will never love you back". whoa. deep. cool.look. whoever may read this, and if you really like this movie, i know times are tough right now. sometimes i think they are ALWAYS tough for some of us. i can't tell you for sure if "the sun will come out tomorrow". for all i know tomorrow you may be dead. but not all problems can be solved and life can't always be perfect. maybe it never can. but you should have some hope and try to look to the things you enjoy and what gets you through until the next day. this movie works well enough for me. God Bless and have a happy 4th of July 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Why any kid would want to be an orphan is beyond me..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Depression-era youngster, a red-headed, freckle-faced tot who rules the roost at a New York orphanage for girls, is the lucky child picked to spend a week in the mansion of billionaire Oliver Warbucks; tippling Miss Hannigan, the child-hating headmistress of the orphanage, schemes to get even. Based on the long-running, Tony-winning Broadway musical, inspired by the popular comic strip "Little Orphan Annie", this rambunctious family film is a bit too self-conscious to be much fun: everyone has one eye on the camera, all the while singing and gesturing to the back rows. Newcomer Aileen Quinn is overly-inspired in the lead; she has a sincere little face, but nothing Quinn does--not even running down the street to get away from a policeman--feels natural. Her reactions (like those of her dog, Sandy) seem prompted from somebody just out of camera range. Quinn is hardly an orphaned girl of the Depression...she's more like an orphaned kid from a TV sitcom (you almost expect her to pop up in a poker game). Several of the grown-ups fare much better than the poorly-cast children, with Carol Burnett single-handedly making the picture tolerable as the boozy, man-hungry Hannigan. Otherwise, the choreography is messy, the script unsurprising and unfunny, and John Huston's direction is sadly lethargic. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do you think of a girl with great beauty, and personality disorder ?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. Everything is filled with grace, wittiness and expensiveness. As for the songs, "Little Girls" is my least favorite, meaning that all the rest is a favorite of mine. For little instance, Albert Finney's performance of "Maybe" is holy. And with the wealthy and lively music score; it's one of the best soundtracks ever written for a movie. I was astonished by the dancing, especially ? for sure ? Ann Reinking's. Look at "We Got Annie", ohhh, she was unforgettable delight there. This number wasn't in the original play, that this movie is based on, so I believe they made it for her to show off her unique capacities. Her dancing captured my eyes and heart, and with her beauty; she put an exclusive definition of "sexy" in cinema ! The cinematography created such a bright image. I recalled some of the 1950s classics, where smoothness and serene colors used to rule. Ultimately this movie's looks between a shiny morning and sparkling gem. The production was fair. I loved that mansion. Its interiors did dazzle with the huge everything. And the direction utilized it cleverly.John Huston, who Finney was slightly copying by his performance here, did wonderful in his first, very belated, musical. He felt the music and translated it into cinema. Maybe the big cadres were many, but I think that was for bragging of the production values. Cut to the problems. The casting is on their top. Yes, he performed all of his share of comedy, singing, and dancing rightly, but Finney, who was 46 year at the time, felt, with that bald head, like at least 80 ! If Aileen Quinn didn't suffer from that red wig, WE DID ! Plus she wasn't charismatic as her voice. And to make it typically worse, Finney and Quinn hadn't any chemistry together. Partly, that's why Carol Burnett stole the show as Miss Hannigan. I know, she's a storm of comedy, but ? also ? she hadn't so much competition around ! What didn't help developing more intensity between the 2 leads, was that script. OK, we have another Beauty and The Beast here. Though, this script solves this matter pretty damn fast. After Warbucks's refusal of Annie, and his roaring over "I wanted a boy", it took that script a short dull scene at the pool to work it all out, and Abracadabra, he's all of sudden Daddy Warbucks who leaves his busy empire and takes little Annie to the movies !!! You can say that again about his love story with his secretary, who he discovers, and we discover with him, that he loves for no reason but her crooked teeth ! Add to that another "no reason" point, when Annie didn't feel at ease about her poor parents. It's obvious that the movie's drama wasn't taken care of like other elements such as the music.I hated a passing goof that none of the crew glimpsed : the movie takes place in 1933, however while Warbucks's helicopter was all over New York city, searching for Annie near the end, the modern skyscrapers of 1982 were inside the cadre shamelessly ! 3 points this movie has, I must refer to. Firstly, the spirit of the lavish dream; whereas Annie goes from being a dusty orphan who lives in stinking concentration camp-like to a lucky kid who has a rich loving father and mother, lives in mansions, and gets to meet the president numerously, not to mention sings with him?which's natural since it's based on Harold Gray's daily comic strip that hit popularly during the great depression days, where thousands of real-life Annies were yearning for a fate like this. Secondly, the clear nostalgia for the 1930s. You can see that through the number of "Let's Go to the Movies", which wasn't in the original musical play of "Annie", the long bits of Camille (1936), and the pressing presence of president Franklin D. Roosevelt's character. And thirdly, the movie has undeniable touch of sensuality; with Miss Hannigan's sex craze over men, some of Bernadette Peters' intentionally seductive moments, the deliciously lithe and glittering Busby Berkeley dancers of "Let's Go to the Movies", moreover a dance move Reinking does at the start of that number; which matches a move Madonna used to do while the heavily controversial stage performance of "Like a Virgin" during the Blond Ambition tour ! Annie (1982) was a flop despite the million it made. It's the same crisis of Hello, Dolly! (1969), and maybe part of the musical movies' crisis since the 60s end. But for me, it isn't wholly a flop; just pure entertainment, with a few problems. While I loved its music, lightness, dreaming, and ? most of all ? Reinking, I didn't love other things; like the casting or the script. True they're a few problems, but the thing is that they're "big" problems, even if a few. It's like knowing a girl who has great beauty yet personality disorder. Hmmm, beautiful but imperfect is what I want to say then !</fullReview>

I remember the Annie comics, her with the red dress, and Daddy with the bald head and oval, blank eyes. Miss Hannigan a laugh riot, all floozy and sleazy. The Juniper Berry bottle cracked me up; I love gin and tonics. Tim Curry his usual creepy self (as Rooster; earlier as Dr. Frank-N-Furter in "Rocky Horror Picture Show"). I always adore Bernadette Peters. Geoffrey Holder as the turbaned guy could save anyone's life. He should have beaten up Miss Hannigan, lol. Putting Annie in the bottom of the laundry cart was an excellent idea, for her escape. Warbucks' secretary was just lovely. Loved the scene with the guys wearing the knee pads shining the floor. Goofy as all heck; reminded me of the dancing waiters' scene in "Hello Dolly". Excellent entire movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GREAT Musical which is a True CLASSIC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall seeing this WAY BACK WHEN in the theater and laughing and enjoying CAROL BURNETT as well as AILEEN QUINN and her OUTSTANDING VOICE and dancing. All that brought Shirley Temple back to me with the simplicity and joy of GOOD musicals. NO BRAIN POWER needed - no SERIOUS CONSIDERATION or heavy political issues. The other wonderful dancers, who we seldom find any longer except in quality theater productions, executed all so beautifully. I think it was really nicely done - FUN - HAPPY - excellent performances - QUALITY singing and more. The song 'TOMORROW' still makes me smile and I TRY to hit the perfection of the notes and sing along whenever I hear it. The song and movie brings me hope in the 2014's. A HAPPY and POSITIVE song for these times and it gives ME hope to TOMORROW. Anyone who has not seen THIS ORIGINAL movie on TV or on a DVD is really missing the BEST. I know a brand new version is being presented with a darling little black/African American girl as 'Annie' (I don't know what is considered POLITICALLY CORRECT to call the cute little gal) just in NOT the same thing. A CUTE movie - but remakes are USUALLY not as good as the original. I can think of DOZENS of movies which in their original release was 'WOW'. They were SO scary - or SO on point - or so outstandingly sad or beautiful or deep that ALL remakes are just CRUMMY in comparison. I am not a professional critic by any means, but I recall movies from 50+ years which really made a difference to me. Some of them influenced my LIFE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Tight framing" and full-frame DVD spoils great kid's movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My girls wore out a VHS copy of this film. They loved it so. I wish I could buy it new widescreen. Full-frame DVD makes the film seem even more-so claustrophobic as heads and people are "cut-off" in both the full-screen version and original widescreen. Curiously, as I watch this on TCM, I find that even in widescreen it is framed too tight, as it "squeezes" people into far corners of the picture. The cinematography is terrible.That being said, this was one of my kid's all-time favorites when they were growing up. The only other VHS tapes they wore out were Disney animated features such as "Little Mermaid." (You have to view a tape almost a 100 times, generally, for it to show wear.) Great performances by all, especially Albert Finney and Carol Burnett. Aileen Quinn is perfect as Annie. Several dance numbers are fantastic, especially "I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here" and "Let's Go to the Movies." The streets of New York scenes look amazingly authentic.Film Faults: Although "money doesn't buy happiness" is the reason for the clip of "Camille" used in the "Movies" sequence, that film is a real downer for an "upbeat" musical. However my main "beef" is the finales' photography and especially the scanning on the DVD: 1. You can barely see and enjoy "The Big Apple Circus." 2. Even widescreen, the elephant has no legs! 3. The finale seems "rushed" and incomplete. I think there should have been a longer scene with the orphan girls, Miss Hannigan, and Annie. Instead, Annie appears to totally ignore everybody and only "sees" Daddy Warbucks; as they watch the fireworks (matted in) that aren't really there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I have not seen the play of 'Annie', I cannot compare this movie with the play. But I have seen the 1999 version of this film, and that version lacked a whole lot of magic.Here are some differences:1. We get to know the other orphans more. 2. 'Punjab' is in this film as in the comic strip. 3. Some songs that we do not see in the 1999 version appear in this one. However, the other songs, when it comes to certain lines, it is a different person singing in this version than the other one. 4. We are introduced to the President of the United States a lot earlier in this film than in the 1999 version. 5. In this movie, the end is the 4th of July where as in the other one the end is at Christmas time. 6. 'Tomorrow' and 'Maybe' have reprises. F.D.R. Sings one of the reprises of 'Tomorrow' and the orphans have their own reprise of 'Maybe' 7. 'It's a hard-knock life' does have a reprise, but it is spoken, and it is spoken like it is an army talking (It is just after 'We got Annie)These are a few of the many differences I found in the film. All I can say is that this version (1982) is better than the 1999 one.</fullReview>

It gets better when Oliver Warbucks(Albert Finney) decides to help Annie's dreams of having a daddy possible come true. Annie goes to Mr. Warbucks as planned for one week, but what happens next she never thought that this man would do what it takes to make Annie's dream become reality.

		<shortDescription>Amazing comic strip character brought to celluloid-Wonderful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again John Huston works his movie magic, bringing the popular stage musical, based on a beloved comic strip character to the big screen. The cast is just first rate. You could not ask for better. The pick of young Aileen Quinn for the role of Annie was inspired, and all of the children in this film stand out. Albert Finney is at his outrageous best as Oliver "Daddy" Warbucks, who is so rich he buys the Mona Lisa for his bathroom. After seeing this version I can envision no one but Carol Burnette in her second great musical role. (The first was Mary Roger's "Once Upon a Mattress.")Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters are also excellent as Rooster and Liliy (I'll let you figure out which was which.) Ann Reinking plays a lovely Grace Farrell to Finny's Warbucks. Geoffrey Holder is grand as the mystic bodyguard Punjab. Finally, reprising a character he has played a number of times in different movies Edward Hermann is Franklin D. Roosevelt. With a good script, excellent music, fine choreography and excellent actors what more could there be. With wonderful songs like "A Hard Knock Life," "Little Girls," "Easy Street," "We've got Annie" and of course "Tomorrow."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was Columbia Thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love reading the IMDb user reviews of this film. Everyone either loved it or hated it. I'm one of the ones who loved it ... and so did my kids in 1982 when it was released. One reviewer says Carol Burnett grated on his nerves; I thought she deserved an academy award. One calls Aileen Quinn an ugly little kid; I thought she was perfect for the part including her real and natural looks. Certainly her talent was unquestionable. And several reviewers trash not only the movie but John Huston's direction; I feel this energetic, magical, "alive" film ranks right up there with the energy in "Annie Get Your Gun" and "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers." My only negative comment is what in the hell was Columbia thinking when they recently released a "Special Anniversary Edition" of this wide screen extravaganza in a Full Screen Format only? What idiot was responsible? Equally disturbing is the fact that it doesn't seem to have been remastered or restored. And to add insult to injury the sound is pretty pathetic including the "DTS" audio track. Whoever is responsible for this DVD should be fired and driven from the film industry in tar and feathers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ambitious effort which falls short. The film makers opened their wallets to compile an ensemble cast with marquee names. Each of them wasted. Somebody forgot to give the cast anything interesting to work with. Aileen McQuinn makes a spirited effort to fill some big shoes, in replacing the stage's Andrea McArdle. To no avail. It's doubtful even McArdle (had she still been young enough for the role) could have saved this, since the writing never taps the potential of the source material. This adaptation isn't engaging in any way, and misses the point completely. The characters are Annie and Daddy Warbucks in name only; any other similarity to the comic strip is non-existent. The Broadway version worked, thanks to McArdle; also, a stage atmosphere fits for these songs. "Tomorrow" is wonderful on a stage; it gives you a migraine anywhere else. This film is a painful example of the aforementioned "anywhere else.". The excruciating shrill voices will imprint an after burn in your brain that may require psychiatric care. The convoluted script runs amok with an ugly kidnapping plot, and there's a battalion of unadopted orphan girls running around trailing the action--to what end nobody knows. The director has actors endlessly mugging in a sinister manner in close-up shots. It's a mess that quickly leaves kids mumbling in confused despair, and dismayed adults bolting for the exits to escape the torture.If it shows up on TV, beware. Shut it off. Quickly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the old classics. A nice movie about a little girl, trying to find her parents and on her way she finds something even better. But before the happy ending she has to fight a battle against evil. This is a movie that you should at least know about. The songs are cute, and the performance excellent. I have never seen so young children dance and sing like that. Unbelievable. My favorite scene is "A Hard Knock Life". The dancing and the singing is absolutely perfect. But when you have seen the movie once, you can definitely wait some years to see it again. The songs though are worth listening to, and if you listen to them a lot, you may be able to sing along in the bathtub!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good And Bad Of "Annie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This updated version of the famous comic character, "Li'l Orphan Annie," was pretty good and was very good at balancing all three aspects of music, comedy and drama.THE GOOD - Most of the songs are good because Aileen Quinn, as "Annie," is so good. She has the best voice of a girl this young I've heard on film; she's cute and she can act. She is a legitimate Shirley Temple clone.Albert Finney also is enjoyable as "Daddy Warbucks," although he does get a bit too loud at times. The little girls in the orphanage are talented: good singers and dancers. Their song-and-dance numbers are more entertaining than the adult's. Some of the latter's could have been left out, although there is a great Busby Berkeley-type number when the adults and kids all go to the movies. The period - around 1932 - is pretty to view with nice sets. This is a big budget film and it shows....and the ending is nice.THE BAD - Carol Burnett is really annoying to watch, not because she plays the villain but because of her abrasive voice and her pronounced "G-d" exclamations. Speaking of the latter, Tim Curry yells out a "GD" which has no place in a family film like this. Interesting also to note that, unlike the Temple movies, the only religion given credence here is Buddhism as Geoffrey Holder plays a Buddhist with supernatural powers. Give me a break! This is so typical of today's films. And another with that theme, of course, Democrat Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor are portrayed as extremely caring, wonderful people while Finney is the gruff Republican.OVERALL - Quinn and Finney are so good that they far outweigh Burnett's negative traits and make this a good film to own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annie 1982</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Annie is a fun, comical, family friendly musical movie, that was based off the 1977 Broadway production. The Broadway production was based off of the Little Orphan Annie comic strip that was started back in 1924, which unfortunately ended in 2010. It is obvious why many people love Annie. Everyone loved it so much that the comic strip lasted 86 years! It's a loving, inspiring, cheerful movie. It leaves you feeling happy as you sit back and cheer for Annie as she goes through life with an optimistic attitude as she sings "The sun will come out tomorrow so you gotta hang on 'till tomorrow, come what may! Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya tomorrow, you're only a day away!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Great Depression, Annie (Aileen Quinn) is a precocious red-haired girl living in a girls' orphanage run by the cruel drunk Miss Hannigan (Carol Burnett). Annie rescues a dog and names him Sandy. Billionaire Daddy Warbucks (Albert Finney) invites an orphan to stay for a week to improve his image. His secretary Grace Farrell (Ann Reinking) picks out Annie. It's a giant mansion with lots of servants. Warbucks is not happy with the orphan not being a boy and the wet dog but he relents. Hannigan's no-good brother Rooster Hannigan (Tim Curry) gets out of jail early and bring over thieving girlfriend Lily St. Regis (Bernadette Peters). Annie wins over the tough Warbucks.There are a couple of really memorable songs. This is a try-hard musical. Outside of those catchy songs, this is a rather flat movie. All the girls are acting big like in a Broadway play. In fact, there is a lot of Broadway acting all around. John Huston's directions are rather old fashion. This is a functional transfer from the stage. I'm not a big fan of this type of acting especially for a two hour movie but little Aileen Quinn doesn't deserve a Razzie. That's a douche move.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The oldest orphan in the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little Orphan Annie as a comic strip ran for 86 years from 1924 to 2010 until 1968 under its original creator Harold Gray. Quite a bit is left out when you read a list of Annie's adventures in that period. But the film Annie captures the essence of what she was about. One thing though she never grew up staying a plucky and resourceful orphan with her benefactor Daddy Warbucks the Howard Hughes of the funny papers who had endless money. Young Aileen Quinn is our Annie and Daddy Warbucks is Albert Finney. The film is an adaption of the Broadway Musical that ran for six years and 2377 performances. It hadn't even finished it's Broadway run when the film came out. The film plot concerns Daddy Warbucks inviting a selected orphan out to the fabulous Warbucks estate and Annie gets to be the lucky girl. She gets to him with her innocent charm and plucky attitude.But the mean woman who runs the orphanage who is played with delicious panache by Carol Burnett wants to exploit the situation to her own advantage. Burnett enlists her conman brother Tim Curry and his wife Bernadette Peters. What they do and how Annie triumphs over all is for you to see the film.I'm not sure John Huston was the right choice to direct this, but Busby Berkeley was not available. Probably with a musical or two under his belt Huston might have made a classic. As it is it's not a bad film, just not a great one.In fact this adaption of a cartoon was really perfected by Warren Beatty when he created his Dick Tracy film. That's how you adapt a cartoon as a cartoon to film with live actors.Still Annie got a couple of Oscar nominations for adapted musical score and Art&amp;Set Direction. I wish Burnett had been given recognition when she's on the film really takes off.A good musical with a good adaption for family viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad musical...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The songs in this are good, in any case, and that's the important thing about a musical. This is the definitive version of the classic novel in which a young orphan girl is adopted by a wealthy industrialist and forced to learn airs and graces which don't exactly come naturally to her.It's just a pity that so much of the running time consists of Aileen Quinn's histrionic acting as the screeching Annie. This kid can't say a word but instead has to shout everything in that god-awful voice of hers, and I cringed my way through all of her dialogue scenes. Still, as I said, the musical set-pieces are better, having real heart to them, so it's not all bad, and she's a much better singer than she is a speaker.Cast-wise, there's an exemplary turn from the unrecognisable Albert Finney as Warbucks, the benevolent benefactor, alongside stock villainous performances from the likes of Carol Burnett and Tim Curry. Watch out for LIVE AND LET DIE's Geoffrey Holder as the manservant, Punjab.</fullReview>

Even little Molly who is only about 6 years old hits her notes. Sure it gets scary at the end but that's how the comics were always written. For Annie to always get into some serious trouble and gets rescued by Daddy Warbucks or one of his bodyguards. The songs were always delightful to listen to and even now I know the songs by heart and can follow along while the movie is playing. Is it as good as the Broadway production? That all depends on who is playing Annie that tour.Out of all of the Annie movies and musicals, this is the one to go see!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Annie (1982)** 1/2 (out of 4) Film adaptation of the Broadway musical, which of course was based on the Little Orphan Annie comic strip, which made its debut back in 1924. In the film, the orphan Annie (Aileen Quinn) gets adopted for a week by a rather hard-boiled billionaire (Albert Finney) who eventually falls for her charm and cuteness. Just as everything starts to look on the up, her former abusive orphanage director (Carol Burnett) decides to help her crooked brother (Tim Curry) get money by pretending to be the girl's parents. ANNIE was released to mixed reviews and even though it was one of the highest grossing films of the year, it still didn't make a profit for the studio. I watched this film when I was a kid and didn't care for it too much and while time has been friendly to it, I still think there are a lot of flaws that keeps it from being an actual good film. Director John Huston always made a wide variety of films but I'm still amazed that he actually wanted to do this picture. I'm not sure what it was that drew him to the product but I really didn't care for his direction here and this is coming from a major fan of his work. I think the majority of the dance numbers look quite bland and I think a lot of them lack any real imagination. It almost seems like Huston just set up a few cameras, got the footage and then let his editors throw everything together. I think the film lacked any real style and I'd say the flow of the picture is also rather weak. The songs for the most part are pretty good with of course 'Tomorrow' and 'It's a Hard Knock Life" being the highlights. The lesser quality songs include a very long 'Let's Go to the Movies" and a weak 'Easy Street.' The performances are all very good with Quinn really doing a terrific job as Annie. I think her voice is terrific for her songs and the actress really makes you care for the character as she perfectly captures that tomboy charm. Albert Finney is wonderful playing it tough and sweet and Carol Burnett is extremely fun as the wicked lady. The costume and set designs are another plus and I think there's some pretty funny dialogue dealing with the billionaire and all his famous friends. In the end, ANNIE is a highly flawed movie but it remains watchable for the most part even though it does run on a bit too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the love-it-or-hate-it movies, Annie is perhaps the one which causes the sharpest divide between those it delights and those it disgusts. It's a musical for a start, and musicals are the big love-or-hate genre that people get really worked up over. To complicate things further Annie is a musical aimed at children and starring kids, and for a certain generation (now in its late 20s and early 30s) it was the most popular and ubiquitous of all children's musicals. To many of us, it was either a wonderful part of childhood, or a silly, soppy embarrassment. But there is a lot more to it than some basic and trivial appeal to youngsters.Let's begin with the songs, since after all this is what musicals are about. Martin Charnin's lyrics are witty and playful, in a way reminiscent of the great 1930s lyricists like Al Dubin and Lorenz Hart. Charnin comes up with some lovely ideas, ("Your clothes may be Beau Brummely"), rhyming two short words with one longer one ("Three or four bucks/She gets Warbucks") and putting rhymes in the middle of lines, like "Empty belly life/Rotten smelly life". The cheekiness of these words has a really bittersweet edge, since these girls are singing about deprivation and abuse. Charles Strouse's melodies too can turn from the fun to the rousing to the poignant, often all within the same song. In particular "Tomorrow", "Maybe" and "It's the Hard-Knock Life" conjure up that mix of sadness and hope with which the movie is shot through.Now let's look at the cast. By the time this was made acting performances were most often valued for their realism and sensitivity, but the requirements of Annie mean that the players here can just go all-out with hamminess and caricature. Best of the bunch is surely Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan, putting on a drunk act that is comically over-the-top, like something from a '30s romcom, but is also quite believable in its little mannerisms. It's a sad truth that Burnett's father was an alcoholic and her own childhood was far from rosy, facts which no doubt fuelled her performance. Albert Finney has fun with the role of Daddy Warbucks, but also shows great skill in bringing out the heart of the character without quite losing his gruff, stern exterior. Tim Curry (Rooster) is creepy in a slightly pervy way, which is far more terrifying than someone who shouts and makes threats. In the title role, Aileen Quinn is not the best child actress, but at least she is not irritating.Then there is the director John Huston. Huston may seem an odd choice, as he is best known among film buffs for his cynical and often violent film noirs like The Maltese Falcon and Treasure of the Sierra Madre. But Huston had always been a very rhythmic director, and one who could handle an ensemble well. He shows a real aptitude for staging musical numbers, making even camera and props part of an elaborate choreography. For example, at the beginning of "It's the Hard Knock Life", a girl kicks the wall in time to the song, a pail tumbles down the stairs, and the camera follows it to rest on Annie as she begins singing. Huston displays his cunning use of foreground and background in making set-ups and jokes that kids will understand. For example, while Miss Hannigan is admonishing Lily St Clair for stealing in the background, Rooster is in the foreground going through Miss Hannigan's purse.The story of Annie will appeal to any child who yearns for the unity of family. But there is also a meaningfulness in there that goes a little deeper than what children will get from it. It's full of nostalgia for the era in which it is set, for example the dance number in "Let's go to the Movies" being a faithful homage to Busby Berkely musicals like 42nd Street and Gold Diggers of 1933. But its recreation of 1930s America is touched by the realities of the time too. The fact that these ragtag orphans are living through the worst years of the depression is repeatedly hinted at. "This is no time to be out of work" Grace warns Miss Hannigan. It's unusual to have such politics in a picture aimed at kids, but the economic background gives a sense of urgency to Annie's plight, and the moment where FDR commands Warbucks to join in with the singing chimes in beautifully with the feelings of unity and overcoming the pain of the past, and Annie is all the more moving for it. Whether you loved it or hated it as a child, watching it again as an adult could be a pleasantly surprising experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my one complaint with the film "Annie"--for the most part, it was believable, until we come to one scene where several of the characters (including Punjab) are cavorting in Daddy Warbucks's study. Punjab is supposed to be a magical, mystical man from the far-off land of India, where people apparently have magic powers. However, the illusion of his powers is destroyed when, as Punjab is performing a mind-boggling feat involving a toy plane, you can see the string that is holding the plane in the air! And Annie, despite being a clever, streetwise orphan, actually seems to fall for this farce! The magic was ruined for me after this. When he rescued Annie off the drawbridge later in the movie by using his "powers" of flight, I had real issues with the integrity of the film.On a more positive note, I had no trouble believing that Daddy Warbucks had TWO universities named after him, or that he and Annie were both expert tap dancers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read numerous reviews of this film that were generally tepid. I think there is a strong tendency to be disappointed in film adaptations of popular works from other genres, especially Broadway musicals. I believe reviewers should try their utmost to review movies independently from previous iterations in order to give potential viewers the best chance to use their information. In particular in this film, the performance given by Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan was deserving of much better kudos from critics than the frequent panning she received, perhaps colored by the reviewers' experience with her predecessors on the stage. I have watched this film many times as my various children insisted on repeated viewings over the years; each time Carol slips out of her chair and catches her chin on the edge of the desk never fails to rip me up. I believe she's worth the price of rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the popular Broadway musical this could have been a much loved film for kids and adults alike, I wanted to like it as well, but it just has too many flaws, and I can see what the critics mean about Razzie nominated John Huston (The African Queen) being the wrong director. Basically Annie (introducing twice Golden Globe nominated, and Razzie winning and nominated Aileen Quinn) is one of the many orphans looked after by the stressed and hateful Miss Hannigan (Golden Globe nominated Carol Burnett). After Annie gets back from another attempted escape, a woman who works for billionaire Daddy Oliver Warbucks (Albert Finney), Grace Farrell (Ann Reinking), is hoping to find a child to come and live in his mansion for a week. Annie is the chosen child, but after arriving she is not a favourite with the grouchy master, but she has quickly charmed the hearts of all the staff, and after a while, the same with Warbucks. But Annie doesn't want to be adopted by Warbucks, because her parents before leaving her made a promise to return, so to make Annie happy Warbucks offers a reward to the people who can come and prove their identity as her parents. This does become a clever scheme by Hannigan, her brother Rooster (Tim Curry) and his girlfriend Lily St. Regis (Bernadette Peters) to claim the reward for themselves, but in the end they are arrested for their treachery, Hannigan becomes a reformed woman, and Annie lives happily with her newfound family that she always wanted. Also starring Live and Let Die's Geoffrey Holder as Punjab. I'll tell you all the things I don't like about this film: Aileen Quinn is not cute (she's annoying, naive and ginger!), the songs are too obvious and don't all stand out, only "It's a Hard Knock Life" (especially with Jay-Z or Dr. Evil rapping over it) and "Tomorrow" are memorable enough, all actors are too sloppy, only Carol Burnett is okay, they used quite a bit of footage from the film Camille, and the story is extremely soppy, this film should only appeal to the Teletubbies and Tweenies loving audience, i.e. very young kids and mad people, an unfortunately terrible musical film. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Music for Ralph Burns, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Song for "Tomorrow", and it was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. It was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Musicals (beating so many other better ones!). Pretty poor!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm very familiar with the Broadway hit "Annie". And I'm also familiar with the songs in it as well. When I first saw this movie, it was wonderful. Set back in the 1930's New York, here you have an orphanage for girls and Annie(Aileen Quinn) is sent there when her parents come to get her later. The girls are full of high spirits despite being in the position they are in. And there's that lovable pooch Sandy. Annie's closest companion. I liked the scene where some boys bother the dog, and Annie is not to be messed with. I liked the part where one boy pushed her, and Annie gives him a mean right, then she says, "All right, who's next?" The taller one gets pummeled into the trash can which I think is hilarious. I know the boys should known better than to mess with Sandy and Annie. Then when Annie gets to be in a mansion, she knows she won't have a problem fitting in. Knowing that her parents will get her, unknowing that they have perished in a fire. Annie is later suckered by Miss Hannigan(Carol Burnett) and her brother Rooster(Tim Curry) and Lily(Bernadette Peters). If Miss Hannigan went along with the plan, she'd be in hot water herself. I didn't blame her for clocking Rooster. All the stars made the movie magic come true, and it's very heart warming as well. This is a definite for Broadway buffs. You can sing along to it if you like. 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Movie of Tomorrow" will make you feel like a kid today!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world of stress and problems, it is a refreshing return trip to one's childhood to sit and watch the movie "Annie". It is filled with a musically talented ensemble including Hollywood household names like Albert Finney and Carol Burnett. The cast belts songs that each of us who have seen this work of art have, not only grown to love, but find ourselves humming the tunes while we are hard at work in our daily lives. Heading up this multi-talented cast in the lead role of Annie is Aileen Quinn, who sparkles and shines with great optimism throughout the feature and in turn leaves us with a lump in our throat in her tender moments on screen. A must have for any family, a must see again for anyone who wants to take a trip back to their childhood and to happier carefree days. Return to sing along, or watch to learn some unforgettable songs. It is a clean family movie for the kid in all of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not like musicals, I have always made a point to say this before any review I do on musicals. This one though is very annoying as it is performed by some of the worst voiced singers you will ever hear. After watching this one has to wonder, "do they audition any of the people they hire for these movies"? I only give this movie a two because I somewhat enjoyed Carol Burnette's over the top character and Albert Finney does a somewhat good job as Daddy Warbucks at the start of the film, his performance gets a bit to sappy near the end. The story has a girl who is taken in by a rich man, well not really by him so much as his secretary. A girl that can beat up the boys, because for some reason girls can always beat up boys in the movies, yet in real life us guys have to do all the heavy lifting at work, go figure. Plenty of awful musical scenes await us as she is welcomed into this new home by the staff and soon melts the heart of Warbucks who must have fallen in love at first site with that horrible hair our little Annie has. Then the film turns into a search for her real parents and a sinister plot by a couple of people who think they can turn a buck when Warbucks offers a reward for finding Annie's real parents. I sat through this movie once as a child and it will be the only time I sit through this overly sappy horribly sung movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On "Annie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Annie" has always been my favorite movie from the first time I saw it. I grew even fonder of the movie after reaching high school. Where I got the nickname Annie because of my curly red hair and small physic. I was asked numerous times to sing Annie's theme song "Tomorrow". My favorite song is "Hard Knock Life" so I would tell them, "ok I will sing tomorrow, I don't want to today!" To this day if I see someone I went to school with, even if I don't know them, I hear, "Hey Annie!" I have been writing poetry since I was 17 and I use the pen name Annie Scott. Annie- from my nick name, and Scott- after my late Grandfather Tim Scott, you can look him up here too. Just type in Tim Scott in the search actor section and see for yourself. Anyway back to "Annie": My son(3)just watched Annie for the first time last week and loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Little Orphan Annie has been around for a very long time but I've never seen the play or any of the movies. I do enjoy musicals, and the general story is predictable but great.The musical numbers are very good, especially We Got Annie - fabulous dancing.Carol Burnette was perfect as Miss Hannigan Albert Finney was a great choice for Daddy Warbucks The rest of the cast was wonderful, except for Aileen Quinn as Annie.All through the movie I kept thinking they could have cast someone better than Quinn. She was a mediocre dancer at best. Her voice was shrill, and I just don't think she looked right for the part.That's all just my opinion. I think I could have rated this 10/10 if there had been a different actress in the role of Annie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Main Singing And Dancing Orphans, version 1.20</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can I identify the main girls as they appear in this story and in other films? To get this data I needed to look to detail in the film, including by way of screenshots. Also to IMDb files and to two web sites: Long John Silver's Reference Website and Jon Merrill's "Annie" Movie Trivia. * In that early Hard Knock, etc, most times that girls appear in shot, continuity goes out the window to get some or all of these principals there. This needs to be known as otherwise it can confuse. Annie and Molly are quickly identified at the start. Annie is distinctive and red. Molly is distinctive and the youngest and recognisable by more than her size. The two eldest are Pepper and Kate. Both have black hair. It is Kate, the tallest, who sticks her leg in the air and waggles her pigtails during You're Never Fully Dressed Without A Smile. I find Kate to be distinctive. Daytime she is short sleeved with her long hair in two bunches, un-bunched at night. When Molly overhears the plot about the locket while cleaning the toilets it is Pepper, mentioned by name, who is supervising her and who tells her to carry on cleaning. Pepper is the one who Molly, aged 5 or 6, hits with a mop. Pepper is the one sleeping in the end bed at the start, with a long sleeved top. She walks over the others, encouraging Duffy and July to hit her with their pillows. Daytime she has a long sleeved grey woolly. 'Hard Knock'. The girl who gets a bucket of water thrown at her on the fire escape. Pepper throwing at Quasi Kate, a character with a distinctive personality, sometimes played by Kate and sometimes by Pepper, Quasi Pepper, later by Molly, Quasi Molly. I posted notes on this at the message board under the heading of: Very confused about character of Pepper. That posting also made a comment re the prelude to 'Sign'. Pepper, then a lookalike to Pepper, then Kate being exhausted Kate, just the lookalike is July wearing a wig and not recognisable as July. Pepper and Quasi Pepper, played by Pepper, and pretend Pepper, played by July. That leaves Tessie, Duffy and July, who can be difficult to differentiate. Sleeve length is often the best identification. July sleeps in a blue top that can usually be seen under her sleeveless day top. Duffy is the one who holds the mouse. Her top is a darker brown than the others and is short sleeved. Tessie is a cuticle, and maybe the second shortest. Her top is short sleeved and a bit lighter than the others. During the opening Maybe she says Oh My Goodness. She is the one moving Molly's head during Never Fully Dressed Without A Smile. On 5th avenue she says that she cannot run anymore. At 5th Avenue top they are, left to right: Molly Kate July Pepper Tessie and Duffy. On the 5th Avenue steps the are: back row ? Kate Pepper Duffie Tessie - front row Molly July. Bed positions at the start are: Annie Molly Kate Tessie July Duffy Pepper. Bed positions at the reprise of Maybe are: Duffy empty Molly Tessie July Pepper ? Kate on the other side. * The girls are: Aileen Quinn - Annie - b 28 June 1971 Yardley, Pennsylvania, USA, f7 1982 to 2009 Rosanne Sorrentino - Pepper - b 15 January 1968 Oceanside, Long Island, New York, f1 1982 April Lerman ? Kate - b 6 February 1969 Chicago, Illinois, USA, f10 1982 to 1992 Robin Ignico ? Duffy - b 20 August 1970 Clearwater, Florida, USA, f10 1981 to 1986Lucie Stewart ?

Molly - b 1 January 1975 Scullville, New Jersey, USA, f2 1982 * In the above listing, f1 to f10 gives the number of films that the IMDb details list for each performer. F1 means that they only appeared in this. The dates give the date span of their screen output. I usually prefer to quote the date in the end credits but have kept with the IMDb system for the above. While IMDb lists Annie as 1982, the end credits use a different measure and say 1981. FAQ's FAQ mentions that there are notes on the site that explain how the IMDb preferred date is chosen. www.IMDb.com/updates/guide/release_dates</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rather Harmless Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little Orphan Annie is a spunky redhead living under the ruthless rule of Ms. Hannigan, who runs the orphanage she lives in. She and the other orphans are forced to toil endlessly under their drunk headmistress. One day, Annie escapes from the orphanage in a laundry basket and meets Sandy, a dog. She and Sandy are caught by the police and returned to the orphanage, where Ms. Hannigan locks them in a closet.Then, Ms. Farrell shows up on the orphanage doorsteps. She is the billionaire Oliver Warbucks's personal secretary, and they are looking for an orphan to take care of for a week, as a publicity stunt. She sees Annie and is immediately smitten and manages to wrestle her from Ms. Hannigan's control. She brings her to Warbucks's mansion, where the staff falls in love with her. When Warbucks arrives, he isn't too pleased, but he lets her stay. Then when Annie and Sandy stop an assassination attempt on Warbucks, he begins to slowly give in to her charm.If what I've written above seems to be gushing with cuteness, imagine it with singing. Yep, this film is very, very cute. But it can get very, very annoying. There is a scene where Annie and Franklin Roosevelt sing to each other. I'm not kidding, that actually happens. To be fair, it could have worked, but only with a director who actually cared about the film. Huston did not. A cute children's musical was the exact opposite of the kind of film's Huston enjoyed to make.Despite the lively musical numbers, only one song is catchy enough to be memorable, "Tommorow". The rest are rather forgettable, for example there is a song called "You're Not Fully Dressed Without a Smile." Yep, I'm not kidding. As a musical, the film seems slightly half baked. The dance numbers are well choreographed, but that's about it.As "Daddy" Warbucks, Albert Finney is pretty good and bald. It's really disconcerting. His head looks like an egg shell. As for his performance, it is a caricature, as most of the performances are. He is good, but it isn't his fault, the character is written like that. Carol Burnett goes way over the top, in a performance that is probably the best in the film. She even has a few funny moments, but a lot of the time her lonely Ms. Hannigan comes off as really creepy, or as a pathetic alcoholic.Ann Reinking is okay as Ms. Farrell, but her character is rather one note. She does have a good voice though. Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters as a pair of bumbling con men are good, but not great as they too are rather one note. Finally, Aileen Quinn as Annie is very spunky, and lovable, but she overdoes it sometimes, especially when saying "grown up" dialog.The screenplay isn't that bad, but it does feel rather wooden. It could have been done much better, as most of the musical could have been. When you have a story this well-worn, it helps to spice it up a little, maybe with interesting direction or a different approach. As it is, the cinematographer shoots it in a rather boring, uninteresting way. It feels very stagy, it comes off as rather boring. To be fair, it can be quite enjoyable at times, but at other times it can be too much, or too little.The film seems to rely on Annie's charm and cuteness in order to make you root for her. To be fair, she is cute, but it can be overbearing at times. The scenes in the orphanage are not bad, but some of the other orphan's can be really annoying. There is one actress who kept saying "oh my goodness" in such an annoying way, it made me burst out laughing each time. The film also goes on for way too long, but it could have been worse I guess.Huston's direction is not that good, you can tell it was a money job. His camera seems uninterested, and it drifts through the scenes as if it didn't really want to be there. I have often accused Huston of being laid back, but here he could have been sleeping and it wouldn't make the film worse. To be fair, Huston did have emphysema and would die within five years, but he still could have done a better job.Overall, the film isn't that bad. It can be enjoyable at times, but it could have been much better. If you are looking for a childish musical, this will do. But still, you could do better.Annie, 1982, Starring: Aileen Quinn, Albert Finney and Carol Burnett, Directed by John Huston, 6/10 (C-)(This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

		<shortDescription>The sun will come out when they remake this for television.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The comic strip little girl finally got eyeballs when a smash hit Broadway musical took the cynics by surprise. But in the hands of a tough men's movie director (John Houston), the results were a lavish spectacular that stole the heart which had made the stage production so memorable. Having just seen the latest NYC production, I confirmed what I recalled of an earlier stage production and multiple viewings of this (three when it was first released) to reflect on what flawed this version. The basic Broadway structure remains with characters from the comic strip thrown in unnecessarily. In the title role, Aileen Quinn is thrown so violently in the viewer's face that it seemed unfair to the young actress. She gives her all in the role, so the fault lies in Houston's hands. Let's sum it up in just saying that even back in the 1930's, Little Orphan Annie was NOT Shirley Temple which is how Quinn is directed to play it.Carol Burnett basically plays Eunice's grandmother here, so the humor is there if not the originality. As Miss Hannigan, she has all the right ingredients, and rips "Little Girls" to shreds. But can TV's do-it-all miracle worker do anything wrong? Albert Finney takes on the role of Daddy Warbucks as if it were steak, devouring the role, bone and all. As the sweet Grace Farrell, Ann Reinking seems miscast, and gets to perform the movie's most awkward new song "We've Got Annie". In the villain roles, Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters seem slumming, although Curry (who the very same year played Bill Sikes in the very similar "Oliver Twist") appropriately plays the role tongue in cheek. Peters' inclusion as the floozie Lily St. Regis just indicates the attempt to make this almost a 2 plus hour long Carol Burnett Show sketch where lots of big name stars are thrown in for something really unworthy of their extensive talents.Burnett, Curry and Peters perform the show-stopping "Easy Street" which is filmed so awkwardly (with the camera right on the three as they stare right into it as well as cartoonish visual gags for Burnett) that it lands with a thud. Like the stage production, the other orphans don't come off as overly cute so that is one compensation. The cutting of several prominent songs (most notably "NYC") for new ones is another flaw. "Let's Go to the Movies" may seem lavish, but unlike "NYC", it really serves no other purpose than to remind the viewer that this was a Hollywood project rather than a Broadway one.Changes from the original Broadway production were many, which included the addition of several characters from the comic strip who didn't appear in the original stage version. This included Geoffrey Holder's casting as "the Asp" (Daddy Warbuck's chauffeur) whose performance is more cutesy than character driven. He was serviced better in the soda commercials he was doing around this time than the obnoxiously coy material he was given here. The big "I Think I'm Going to Like It Here!" seems like something out of Disney's big musicals, so filled with moments that might make adults cringe. Finney, having already proved that he could handle a musical with "Scrooge", is excellent as Daddy Warbucks. He's an obvious lovable old curmudgeon who needs something to remind him that he's alive, but unfortunately, Quinn's Annie is too plucky and in your face to really make Warbuck's affections for her realistic.Better as a made for T.V. remake which was just as lavish but far more likable overall, "Annie" suffers from striving too hard to be as far from its original Broadway source as it could be. This shows a lack of faith from the creator's part to gage what Hollywood audiences would want in a big movie musical in 1982. Hopefully with a third movie version of this classic having coming out and bombed, the third time will be an end to try and do this again. There are a lot of things to like here, but minor elements of inconsequential details make it a bit of a mess. That, and the film's altered ending for Miss Hannigan's fate, presented rather unbelievably after a badly included sequence with Annie in the hands of the villains where the entire Broadway plot was sent out the window.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Ann Reinking, Bernadette Peters, Tim Curry, Edward Herrmann, and Aileen Quinn star in this great version of the Broadway classic. Carol Burnett is very, very, very funny as Miss Hannigan, the mean caretaker of the orphanage where Annie is. Annie then goes to stay with billionaire Daddy Warbucks (Albert Finney) at his mansion. Soon she is kidnapped by Miss Hannigan's brother (Tim Curry) and his girlfriend Lilly (Bernadette Peters). The only good singing parts of this film are when Carol Burnett sings. If you want to see Carol Burnett at her best then see this one.</fullReview>

If I had to hear that song one more time, I was going to kick her dog Sandy right in the butt.John Huston's attempt at a movie musical was over-blown to say the least. They sure spent a lot ($50 million) and they sure didn't make much on the film ($35 million), but the show was lively and big and splashy and all that.Unfortunately, there is virtually no warmth in this movie. It's all glam and confetti. Albert Finney walks through it, Carol Burnett is nothing less than perfect as 'Miss Hannigan', and Bernadette Peters has luscious boobs.Recommended as fluffy escapism (...."tomorrow", when I'm not around.

		<fullReview>There is a lot going for this movie; good acting, musical numbers, and overall energy. The main thing people have to realize is there is "Annie" the play and "Annie" the SCREENPLAY. Both are amazing in their own regard but if you go into either expecting the other be prepared for the differences. The movie holds true to the overall concept but is simply written as a movie aimed towards children. People have to understand that the movie is based on a play and the play on a comic. A lot of people go in expecting one thing and get the next. You have to have an open mind to such things, especially something 33 years old. Either way I completely enjoyed both the movie and the play. Everyone should experience Annie one way or the other.</fullReview>

As I have grown up i have only grown to love the movie more. It is serious and playful at the same time, it is rare that we see a children's musical movie that is so down to earth, dealing with real life concerns, and at the same time still holding onto some fantastical elements. This movie is packed with famous actors/actresses, and you can't find a better ms. Hannigan!!!!!!!!

		<fullReview>Critics attacked the movie often saying it is over blown but the more I watch Annie the more I like it. The great thing is that it never becomes stage bound yet at the same time still manages to keep he charm of the live theatre production.The final scenes are actually very exciting and this could never be done on stage so director John Huston opened the story up to include the darker moments of the show. Although I would love to have seen Dorothy Loudon do the Hannigan role Carole Burnett does as creditable job as does Albert Finney. The glorious Bernadette Peters generously underplays as does Tim Curry and they are both fabulous, Easy Street is a real winner. What a pity we never saw more of Anne Reinkin as Grace. This elegant lady nearly steals the film and boosts what could be an annoying role into one of pure charm. The kids are great and Aileen Quinn is a lovely Annie. She does battle in the lower notes as a singer but who cares. Sandy the dog is a real trooper and does indeed get close to stealing the movie but for me Geoffrey Holder as Punjub steals the movie in a small role. A fine movie with the most wonderful songs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Annie is such a great movie I've ever seen. Although, it's like a female "Oliver Twist" type movie and it's really cool and "punny" like I really liked since when I was 5 years old. In that movie, Miss Hannigan was an insane woman who never takes care of girls and....well, she just let them work all day and even all nigh, too. Anyway, at the end, Annie gets adopted by Grace Farrell and Oliver Warbucks and celebrates the 4th of July. Although, the girls sneaks out of the orphanige to see if Annie is still in the Warbucks' home but, she was with those wicked people that might attack her. Anyway, Annie is a very sweet girl and since when she first went to the Warbucks' home, it seems like Mr. Warbucks got jealous of her. Some very funny parts of the movie I've liked when Ms. Hannigan makes crazy-lookin' faces while she sings "Little Girls", Molly hitting Pepper on the face with a mop, Ms. Hannigan saying "She's livin' fat!", Miss Hannigan kissing the radio while she listens to a soap opera, Annie puts herself in a laundry basket, Lily kicking Pepper on the booty, and Molly mimicking Ms. Hannigan while all the orphans work.

		<shortDescription>Annie: One of the last great musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This musical is a near perfect ten! One of the last great musicals ("A Chorus Line" was the very last--at least thus far), "Annie" lost nothing of it's Broadway production in the transition from the Great White Way to the Silver Screen. Albert Finney is the ideal "Daddy" Warbucks, Carol Burnett is the only actress to play Miss Hannigan, Burnadette Peters is perfect as Lilly St. Regis ("named for the hotel") and dance genius Ann Reinking is radiant as Grace Farrell. And let's not forget Aileen Quinn as Annie. She was the perfect age when she got the part (10 yrs. old) but she had had only a small amount of acting experience. She won the part (as I've been told) on account of her tremendously talented singing voice, sweet smile and spunky wit. I last saw her in "The Frog Prince" about 8 years ago on the Disney Channel. She still had a great smile but no one who has seen "Annie" can really see her as anything else (at least not outside of any musical productions). To summarize, the movie is great, the songs are delightful (esp. "Tomorrow", "Easy Street" and "I Don't Need Anything But You") and the acting and choreography are right up there with "West Side Story", and "An American in Paris".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I HATED IT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am surprised to see how many people actually enjoyed this horrible slice of cinema. Now, I have not been an "Annie" fan for long-- I saw my first production of it in the summer of '99, and I was so thrilled with it, I rented the movie right away. I was appalled almost right away. Here are my top 10 reasons for hating this movie: 10. "The Hard-Knock Life" sequence-- it looked like they were on a playground, not in an orphanage. 9. Toni Ann Gisondi-- I hated her as Molly. Just not cute enough. 8. The new arrangements of many of the songs. I especially disliked "I Don't Need Anything But You" and "I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here." 7. Ann Reinking-- Grace is supposed to be a soprano. Hello? 6. Punjab-- Okay, so he was a character in the comic strip, but there was absolutely no reason for him to be in this movie. 5. Carol Burnett-- What in the hell was that performance about? I love her in everything I've ever seen her in, except this. She was way too over the top, even for Miss Hannigan, and that's saying a lot considering it's already an over the top character. 4. The added songs. Personally, I disliked all of them, but one in particular comes to mind-- "Dumb Dog." 3. Annie hanging off a drawbridge-- don't even get me started. 2. Aileen Quinn-- vocally, she was halfway decent I suppose, but had all the charm and charisma of a rock, and all the acting skills necessary for portraying a wooden board. 1. The omission of "Tomorrow." Sure, they sang it over the opening credits, and sang the White House version, but it never really was a crucial part to the storyline, as in the play. "Tomorrow" is the best song of the whole show, and we, the audience, couldn't listen to it all because John Huston didn't like it. Personally, I preferred the Disney version of the film much better. Although it was shortened, it was much truer to the original story with a much more talented cast to tell that story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leapin Lizards! This movie was pretty OK. I hope the sun will come out, tomorrow and give us a better version. It's a Hard Knock Life for us.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Annie is a pretty good movie, I have to say. Still, it's not as good as the Broadway musical, by Charles Strouse, Martin Charnin and Thomas Meehan which in turn, is based on Little Orphan Annie, the 1924 comic strip by Harold Gray which in turn, was originally a poem by James Whitcomb Riley. The reasons for this was a few changes. The film add a lot of new songs, and replace others. While, at the same time, adding more comical campy elements to the film that musical lovers didn't like. Such as adding a few outlandish characters from the comic strip back in the musical version like Punjab and the Asp. The comic strip was more adventure series, while the musical is a bit too political with the commentary, that kinda stray from the story of Annie and more about how depressing the Great Depression was. So I kinda like this film version as it mixed both of them. The film is about the story of Annie (Aileen Quinn) who is a mischievous orphan from New York City who is taken in for the weekend by America's richest billionaire Oliver Warbucks (Albert Finney) who is trying to improve his image. At first, Mr. Warbucks didn't want the child, wanting a boy, but she grew on him to the point, that he wanted to adopt the child from the cruel alcoholic orphanage's supervisor Miss Hannigan (Carol Burnett). Instead, Miss Hannigan wasn't going to do that, seeking fortune. She plan out to trick Warbucks, by having her con-brother, Rooster (Tim Curry) and his girlfriend, Lily (Bernadette Peters) pose as Annie's parents to get the reward money. All the actors did great in their roles. I know a lot of people were getting anger at Aileen Quinn as Annie for being too cute, but I thought she did pretty OK. At less, she wasn't as annoying as the 'Oh my Goodness' girl. Drew Barrymore almost got the role, and I can see her maybe pulling it off, but her suppose co-star, Jack Nicolson as Daddy Warbucks. No, I don't see him in the role at all. I have to say, Albert Finney fits the role despite not being a good singer. I'm just glad, he barely sung in the movie. I don't see him, pulling off 'Something is missing' song. Thank goodness, that song was cut from the film. 'Sign' is so far the worst song in the movie as it's seem like Warbucks knew about Miss Hannigan's cruelty to the girls, but just blackmail her to give Annie up. I always found that scene, disturbing. I thought, if he knew that abuse was going on. He should had call the police on her. In my opinion, Carol Burnett and Tim Curry make the movie, watchable. "East Street' and 'Little Girls" were great villain songs. Ann Reinking as Grace Farrell was OK, but most of her songs were pretty mediocre. I didn't like 'We got Annie' one bit and 'I think I would like it here' is cheesy. It did show her dancing skills, but it was just not needed. I have to say for the film to replace the 'NYC" song with "Let's go to the Movies' was a bad mistake. ''NYC" help set the settling of the story so well, while 'Let's go to the movies' just doesn't fit in with the movie. The movie wasted scenes of them watching another movie. It was so annoying. By far, the worst thing, the movie did is move the 'tomorrow' song later in the film to a scene that should had been cut from the film when they visit the president at the White House. Honestly, did we really need to see the president? I didn't like how the film turn the song from Annie's hope for a better future, into a political statement. I know the original musical had "We'd like to Thank You, Herbert Hoover" and 'New Deal for Christmas', but I thought it was good idea to cut those songs from the film. I really don't think people would like to hear songs about how poor, people are, and see Annie getting spoil by a rich war drumming millionaire. It would make Daddy Warbucks seem unlikable to the common people watching the film. The scene where 'tomorrow' was supposed to play was replace with mean-spirited songs about a dog. I really didn't think Sandy the dog needed a song. Thank Goodness, they cut the songs 'You wouldn't be an orphan too long'. I really don't see a song about J. Edgar helping the story much. I did like how the film, reprised 'Maybe' throughout the film. It really set the mood of the story and plot. By far, my favorite songs are 'it's a hard knock life' and 'we've never fully dress without a smile'. Both are the extreme ends of each other, while 'Tomorrow' seem to be the balance to the film. While, 1999's Annie was a little bit better, I think director John Huston gave us a pretty okay movie. At less, it's better than Annie: A Royal Adventure! (1995). Yes, there were some major differences between the stage musical and this film version by John Huston, but overall: no matter, if it's Christmas or Fourth of July, rich or poor, watching Annie is a joy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In itself, Annie sounds a lot like other films, be they musicals or not. You can love them or hate them, depending on your expectations.Most of the reviewers miss the point : the main problem with Annie is the plot... some orphan girl gets lucky and draws attention from a republican billionaire, melting his heart and getting adopted.Why her? Why not the other orphans? The man she loves has made a fortune on the back of millions of Americans and other citizens of the World, and she just gets to benefit from what he "legally" stole from others.Annie is cuddled from start to finish by dozens of "servants", adults working to take care of her and of the man who adopted her.When she decides she wants to find her parents, hundreds of couples swarm towards the manor to reclaim her... and the 50,000$ cash reward. The movie ends with the billionaire and his armada going after the orphanage's manager, her brother and her brother's lover, which fraudulently cashed in the reward and kidnapped Annie.And what if these people had the chance to live decent lives and earn a decent salary? They would not have had to pose as her parents to make a living.Shame on Hollywood for using children as a shield to defend capitalism and rich people crushing their fellow citizens, transforming poor people into thieves struck down by the money-fuelled few.The worst part : when some dumb Bolshevik tries to kill the billionaire by throwing a bomb into the manor, and the rich man's servants send him back the bomb before crushing the poor bearded guy without the rich bald man really noticing anything.What an insulting "savage capitalist" farce.</fullReview>

When you actually watch it, it's very entertaining with some brilliant locations and believable characters, reflecting the issue of being an orphan and being very sweet, too. It makes fans go through many emotions, including happiness, terror, and sympathy for the poor little orphan girl. So don't diss it until you try it. Really, i think it's a beautiful film with very sweet characters and the evil orphanage woman (i know, technical term, that) makes this a film to watch again and again. So where can i get a copy?!!

		<fullReview>This is a corny and overlong family musical but it's watchable thanks to a hammy Albert Finney and a cute as a button Aileen Quinn. She is precious as little orphan Annie. The songs are mediocre and not quite hummable though there's some energetic dancing. Finney does get too loud at times. However, he breathes life into the film whenever he appears. The period costumes are fine and add to the sense of enjoyment. The film drags a bit and the climax is contrived. Still, it's all in good fun and kids will probably enjoy it. Adults will be bored occasionally.Overall 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the hell? John Huston was known for classics like "The Maltese Falcon", "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" and "Moby Dick". So why this? I probably last saw "Annie" when I was six, and now that I know that Carol Burnett, Albert Finney and Tim Curry all starred, maybe that does change things. But a really neat way that they used this movie was in John Waters's suburban satire "Serial Mom": in one scene, a woman watches it before...well, just watch the movie. It's sort of like when the title characters in "Gremlins" watched "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".All in all, maybe this passes as a cultural reference, but let's not treat it as a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not to be a stickler, but the review for this movie says Annie is 11 and runs away to find her parents. She is 10 and runs away all the time just for the heck of it. She stays close to the orphanage because she has high hopes of reuniting with her real parents through her broken locket. That's what paves the way for the kidnappers, it's why she goes to Washington to meet FDR while Grace interviews all the "hopeful parents". I have been watching this movie religiously since I was way little (it's as old as I am) and my 18 month old daughter watches it just about every day now too, so I can't help but know these "little" details. And the funny thing is, I can't stand Annie herself! LoL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film is not like the stage original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a rule, film adaptations of stage musicals suffer in comparison with the original. "Annie" is no exception, but the reasons are intriguing. The musical "Annie" is only nominally based on the comic strip/radio adventure series, but is primarily an homage to and a caricature of Shirley Temple movies such as "Curly Top" and "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm", made during the years of the Great Depression. Those movies held the promise that even an impoverished orphan with pluck and optimism could charm her way into the heart of an unimaginably wealthy benefactor. Ironically, many of those movies, such as "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm", were themselves nominally based on stage and literature pieces. Adapting Shirley Temple movies to the musical stage was relatively easy because they were not very cinematic; little more than song and dance routines showcasing her talent. Transferring "Annie" from the stage to the screen was a problem that the director solved by drawing more from the comic strip and adventure series, in which the villains were more vile and the perils more perilous. Hence, the climactic bridge scene, which, most agree, darkens and departs from the spirit of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most underrated movie musicals!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The criticisms for Annie have been unfair I feel, then again maybe there's some bias as it was one of my absolute favourites as a kid and still is. There have been worse musicals before and since, as well as better admittedly(Wizard of Oz, Singin' in the Rain, West Side Story), High School Musical movies anyone, as well as The Wiz, Mame and A Chorus Line for examples? As for Aileen Quinn, she isn't ginger! She was wearing a wig, plus Annie has red hair! And she was about 10 years old, when she did this movie, and in my opinion she had a fantastic singing voice for her age, and she is an appealing and spunky actress. Albert Finney is just wonderful as Daddy Warbucks, with his gruff voice, and his slow transformation from stern to heartfelt.. it was totally believable. The locket scene was very moving. Broadway diva Ann Reinking was a lovely Grace Farrell(just look at her dancing in "We Got Annie"), and I liked her voice very much. Sometimes though, it was hidden over the highest voices especially in "I'm think i'm Gonna Like It Here". But to be fair, the arrangements are always done to the abilities of the singers. Bernadette Peters and Tim Curry had a little less to do, but they were excellent in their villainous roles, and their rendition of "Easy Street" was wonderful. Carol Burnett was fantastic in this movie, making Miss Hannigan as nasty as humanly possible, and performance-wise steals the film. The dialogue is very witty and warm-hearted throughout and Burnett has the best lines, she sings and acts the heck out of "Little Girls". The servants did well too, though I don't know any of their names, though Geoffrey Holder was a delight as Punjab. The orphans are delightful, especially Toni Ann Gisondi as Molly, she was so cute, who put rare energy into "Hard Knock Life", and "Without a smile." I was really impressed with the performances. The songs are just marvellous, even the ones added to the movie(especially "Sign"), except for "Dumb Dog", very forgettable and pointless. I have seen the stage play,(my sister Kathryn played Molly) and enjoyed it as well, though the movie should stand on its own and that's what people seem to not take into account. The 1999 film was good if too short and sugary sweet, but while this may seem like blasphemy I've always considered this the better film, more faithful doesn't always mean better you know. The wonderful title song "Tommorow!" played over the title credits, and there was a reprise in the white house, which is one of my favourite scenes. But it showed in her face that Aileen Quinn preferred "Maybe." "Let's Go to the movies" surprisingly worked on its own merits. It looked lovely with some nice movie star references, and the production values in the entire film are fabulous, glitzy and evocative. But the best element of the movie along with Burnett and the songs was the choreography by the immensely talented Arlene Phillips. I disagree that it was overblown, as a matter of fact it worked amazingly well. The only real criticisms I have with Annie, is that I agree that John Huston was the wrong director, I felt his heart wasn't really in it and his inexperience in the musical genre did show somewhat and while nail-biting the climax was a little contrived, but the performances, songs and choreography completely overshadowed them. Fantastic. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horrible failure that should have been a big hit!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really thought that this was going to be a can't miss, super box office hit that would revitalize the movie musical.However, this movie falls under the category of "What Were They Thinking?" I can't speak for anyone else, but when I here the words, "Light hearted, musical comedy", I never think of John Huston. This was by far the biggest mistake of this movie. Huston had no idea of how to film this movie.Carol Sobieski took Thomas Meehan's funny, charming musical and gutted it. Someone should have told her that when you're writing a musical comedy, it's important to have some comedy in the script.Casting - I was disappointed in Carol Burnett. Perhaps it was the writing, or the direction, but I felt as though I were watching an exaggeration of one of her characters from her show, instead of something new and interesting. Albert Finney was fine, although, he's no singer. Ann Reinking is a lovely dancer, but terribly bland in this part. I will not comment on Aileen Quinn, other than to say I think they could have done better than her. In general, there is no chemistry between any of the actors in this movie.Overall, this movie is awful. The shorter TV version with Kathy Bates and Victor Garber is far better than this mess.2 out of 10</fullReview>

It's no surprise that this awful crapfest flopped at the box office, and that the leading "actress" was deservedly nominated for a Razzie award. Skip this horrid, badly acted garbage and watch the vastly superior "Oliver!" instead. No wonder musicals had died out if this was the best they could come up with.

		<shortDescription>Contributed to the Death of Film Musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Broadway show was a popular hit because it conveyed innocence and warmth. The film version didn't do well at the box office because it lacks these important qualities.Part of the problem is John Huston's direction. It is obvious the veteran director's heart was not in this film. He sabotages musical numbers by handling them in a cold, plodding manner. For instance, one doesn't feel for the orphans' plight when they sing "It's a Hard Knock Life" because Huston has them doing acrobatics that detract from the lyrics.Then there is the mishandling of the songs. As a previous commentator has noted, some wonderful tunes like "We'd Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover" and "N.Y.C." have been scrapped in favor of dreary tunes like "Dumb Dog" and "Let's Go to the Movies." These new songs contribute nothing to the scenario. The remaining original Broadway songs are hampered by inferior renditions and Huston's misdirection.The scenario is unnecessarily coarsened. The nasty orphanage head Agatha Hannigan (Carol Burnett) is transformed from the blustery harridan of Broadway to an alcoholic vamp. This type of character has no place in a family musical. Neither do orphans and maids who flash their underwear during musical numbers.As the orphaned title character, Aileen Quinn tries hard but her acting is artificial, so one cannot feel for her. Albert Finney as Oliver Warbucks seems gruff and uptight even when expressing love toward Annie. Ann Reinking seems too cool to convey maternal warmth as Warbucks's secretary Grace Farrell and her husky singing voice is completely inappropriate. Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters as the villains Rooster Hannigan and Lily St. Regis and Geoffrey Holder as Punjab are largely wasted.No wonder Disney decided to make their own TV version of ANNIE in 1999. Anyone who doesn't have the opportunity to see a stage production should watch the Disney version, which is truncated but captures the original show's charm and simplicity. In the meantime, it is an injustice that Columbia has decided to put the misbegotten film version on DVD while ignoring its real treasures like TWENTIETH CENTURY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyably Light-Hearted Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyably light hearted musical about orphan "Annie's" dream of escaping the squalor of her all girls orphanage to find her parents and become a regular little girl.Albert Finney is a delight as hard hearted business man Daddy Warbucks, as is young Aileen Quinn as the precocious, confident little girl who wins his heart. Good support is offered by Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Ann Reinking and Geoffrey Holden. Definitely the show stealer though is Carol Burnett as the dipsomaniacal Madame of the orphanage, Miss Hannigan.It's the Broadway musical numbers (adapted by Ralph Burns from the original music - Charles Strouse - and lyrics - Martin Charnin) that give the film its real highlights however. Catchy tunes such as "It's a Hard Life" and "Tomorrow" are sure to stay with you for some time. Arlen Phillips' choreography is inventive and lively, though occasionally - yet certainly forgivably - overly so.Director John Huston brings the Broadway hit to the screen, pulling the show together well. Drama, comedy and musical numbers are all on an even keel, while Huston cleverly plays on the cutesiness of all the tiny rug rats. And really, who can blame him for that.Thanks to some great tunes and sprightly comedy (screenplay from Carol Sobieski), this "Annie" is good fun. That's saying something for me, not normally a musical fan. Great one for the kids.Friday, October 6, 1995 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown musical lacks a dazzling score...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ANNIE is about the world's most famous comic strip orphan, who finds herself in Miss Hannigan's (CAROL BURNETT) Hudson Street orphanage where the gin-soaked headmistress is full of one-liners like "Why any kid would want to be an orphan, I don't know!" And Carol is just what this musical, directed by John Huston, needs. She brightens every moment with her winning presence in a sometimes hilarious role. As her cohorts, BERNADETTE PETERS and TIM CURRY are not far behind.Annie is rescued from the clutches of Miss Hannigan by Daddy Warbucks (a bald-headed ALBERT FINNEY), who, unfortunately, has some of the show's weakest songs. It's while Annie's at the orphanage that she and the kids bust out in the show's best number, "The Hard Knocks Life". But the trouble is none of the other songs are substantial enough to give the musical elements the lift they need.John Huston is a curious choice as director, but he does get good performances from his entire cast, including AILEEN QUINN as the moppet with the big voice whose tremulous rendition of "Tomorrow" becomes almost an anthem when she sings it at the White House for F.D.R.Summing up: Overblown, overlong stage musical turned into a less than spectacular success on screen.</fullReview>

I'll admit, it was pretty good, but I made the mistake of watching it AFTER I saw it on Broadway. The acting is kind of corny and you can tell that Molly's singing voice is not real (and if it is, that's one talented actress!). But it is fun for little kids and it may amuse your family. I'll give it two and a half stars, just to be nice. The target age range is for younger kids, I think. Carol Burnett makes a great Miss Hannigan and some parts are very comical.</fullReview>

The only good parts of that movie were Tim Curry, Albert Finney, and Carol Burnett, whose acting was the only saving grace of the film. The 1999 version was by far better, but still was lacking in that the ending was "nineties-ized" and the kids ruled the world. But still pathetic all around.I don't get it.

There was no need to toy with the original script so much to put out an overblown production such as this.

		<shortDescription>Peculiar goings - on at an Orphanage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Little Orphan Annie" as a newspaper cartoon was a peculiarly American institution.Set in the Depression era and featuring a precocious child with blank eyes and wire - wool hair,it failed to travel the Atlantic successfully,rather like "Mandrake the magician" which I used to read in the American comics that got handed round at school in the 50s and that mystifies me to this day.It could have been written in blank verse for all the sense it made. "Little Orphan Annie" was another glimpse into an alien culture - albeit one that touched base with life as we understood it from time to time.We had men like Daddy Warbucks,although most of them had been elevated to the peerage.Annie's speech bubbles were often too cryptic for readers who had been brought up on "Rupert " and "Teddy Tail". The concept of cartoons for adults was yet to catch on. Thus it is fair to say that here in Britain the news that a musical version was about to be made did not quicken too many pulses. As an admirer of John Huston I was half curious and half apprehensive at the thought of him tackling a subject that half a dozen musical hacks could have made a competent job of. I'm afraid the Old Man bit off more than he could chew.The result was lifeless and drab,almost as if he'd been tired of the movie before he'd even started it. Some fairly dire songs are performed perfunctorily,everyone remembers their lines and the stunning Anne Reinking rises above the general apathy with a performance that rivals the one she gave in "All that Jazz",but clearly the $9million they paid for the movie rights weighed heavily on the shoulders of the production team.To me it didn't look like money well spent. Albert Finney can neither sing nor dance by any meaningful definition of those terms but he does both in "Annie".His lack of any discernible musical talent does not seem out of place where mediocrity rules.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Annie is one of those movies that leaves genuine movie lovers somewhat confused.It is a good film in the sense that it is good to watch the characters are portrayed brilliantly and we all anticipate the moment Annie will call Warbucks Daddy.To an extent we feel like singing and crying with Annie and the moment of separation caused some kind of devastation.However there was no challenge of how this sweet girl would win the heart of this coldhearted millionaire. It was just too easy and because this aspect carried the gravity of the film this caused an overall down hill ever after.It could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Musical captivates the kiddies, leaves adults a little bored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was just the right age to fall in love with the movie Annie when it was released. At 10 years old I wanted to be a singing, dancing, movie star just like Aileen Quinn!The film is a great little girls film, maybe even little boys. There are big name adult stars in the film (Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters, Albert Finney, and Tim Curry) and though their performances are good the plot isn't terrifically delivered. Be forewarned: cute but not totally captivating.I gave it a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They butchered a classic musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an abomination. It captures none of the charm and grace of the stage show, and Disney's 1999 version (with Kathy Bates) is far superior for those who have have not been lucky enough to see the play. Every deviation from the original is a failure, with the worst offenses being the trash with which Tim Curry and Carol Burnett had to work. I've never been more disappointed or angry with a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that killed Musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Columbia Pictures paid $9,000,000 for the movie rights of the hit Broadway play! They should of hired the director of the play as well! This version of Annie changes the last 1/3 of the play! Instesd of ending on Christmas it ends on July 4th. The little girl in this sings Okay but the movie drags. It starts off good but once Annie gets to Daddy Warbucks house the movie falls a little flat! If your a fan of the play beware that not all the Songs from the Play make it into this version. If you want to see a better version of "Annie" please get the 1999 version! This movie did kill the musicals for a while! John Houston over directed this. Randal Klieser of "Grease" fame was offered "Annie" but he choose to do the movie "Summer Lovers".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sparky musical for kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Annie' sees flame-haired Aileen Quinn play the title role, a cute Shirley Temple type who brings joy into the hearts of all she meets; eventually thawing the heart of the cold capitalist millionaire 'Daddy' Warbucks (Albert Finney in one of his best roles).As a musical though it is only good in fits and starts - there's the overblown 'Let's Go The The Movies' production number, with suited attendants at Radio City Music Hall and finishing with a quick prcis showing of Garbo's 'Camille'. There's the joyous 'We Got Annie', led by Ann Reinking singing and dancing as Grace and involving all the servants. There the standard orphanage song (this time 'It's A Hard Knock Life' rather than Oliver's 'Food Glorious Food'). And of course there is little Annie's best-known tune, 'The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow'. But there's also a lot of syrupy sweetness which soon becomes hard to swallow.Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, and the gloriously OTT Carol Burnett (as orphanage matron Miss Hannigan)are the villains of the piece, and are OK in a pantomime way. And the little girls are pretty good.'Annie' is a second-string musical which now looks tired and runs for far too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tomorrow I will hate her as much as today!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler alert This must be the worst movie I had seen in my whole life; it takes out the worst in me, 'cause everytime I see that dumb red-hair girl I feel like hitting somebody. She's so annoying, with her ugly smile and cheap haircut. And let's not talk about that tedious dog of hers!There's no way I could buy the idea that this bold and rich old man could have fallen in love with this insipid and unbearable little rascal. She's a real pest, and gets to disturb everybody with her screams and whinnings. How come everybody at that house love her? I rather spend my time with Chucky. Ah least he doesn't get to sing those moronics songs every time he feels happy or sad.I was hoping that those thieves that chased Annie succeed on killing her. Unfortunately that didn't happened, and at the end, she gets what she wanted (Trick the rich man and get all his money), and we have to tolerate a sorry end with them both dancing like idiots and shouting how happy their are cause they got each other. I wonder if that man will keep thinking the same after that sluttie Annie kills him and inherit all his fortune. ?Oh, we didn't get to see that in the movie? Well, just wait for Annie part 2 : the real deal. In this movie, Annie kills his adoptive father and that idiotic secretary of his and with all their money, she build up a Strip club, where all the other orphans who grew up with her have to work as slaves of Annie.Yeah, beware all of you, fools who believed on that red hair witch. Annie is no friend of mine or to anybody. Don't ever trust in a smiley face that sings that Tomorrow she will love you...'cause she will be meaning your money, not you.!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I love musicals. Oliver! Calamity Jane, The Sound of Music; they're all great but this film has the same effect on me as sandpaper on a blackboard! This horribly ugly child, whining through the most irritating songs ever written, with the ever wooden Albert Finney (bald in this film, too - double sickener) playing the kindly (oh please) Daddy Warbucks (What kind of a name is that, anyway?), just five minutes makes you want to turn over to something less sugary. Nothing can make me gnash my teeth in (literal) pain (of the eardrums and brain) like that awful, awful signature tune "Tomorrow, Tomorrow!" God, it's making me wince, just typing it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only Movie I ever walked out of!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say, when the kid starts screeching about tomorrow, I got up and left. Carol was good but the rest of the movie looked like it was done by someone who had never done a movie or for that matter seen one! I went home and put on Citizen Kane and then watched on the waterfront, finally I was assured there really were good movies out there. I cannot see how this was a classic Broadway play if it was anything like the movie. I suspect that it was not. I enjoy a good musical like Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, and several others, at least they try to make it look realistic even up to the point of the signing. I did think the Carol was the best part and she can not carry a whole movie by herself when she is not the main star. A major re write and new cast might have made it a better movie. A plot not out of the comic strip would help as well. Avoid this one at all costs. You'll be glad you did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They are cruel to those kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was shocked to see this movie after at least 15 years. I guess I must have liked it okay before so I bought it so that my kids could see it. I'm just glad I previewed it before they watched it. I have several complaints about this movie, but the two that bother me the absolute most are: 1. Miss Hannigan is drunk the whole movie. Maybe that in itself isn't a reason to hate the movie, but I was appalled about that and the fact that she tried to jump every man that walked into the building. I didn't think that was fitting for a children's movie at all.2. She is abusive to those kids. Hearing her name calling, watching her shove them, forcing them to work to the degree that she does- it all makes my blood run cold. I am shocked and appalled that nobody has complained about how abusive this movie is.I guess my kids won't be watching this one, my husband agrees and I didn't even bother watching the end of it. For a society that has come as far as it has I can't believe that this movie doesn't bother anybody else. I realize they were trying to make a point across, and made her like that on purpose, but it bothers me.</fullReview>
