		<shortDescription>Scream meets I know what you did last summer meets Urban Legends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is nothing original.But then what teenage slasher film is. And for that reason only I give this film 7 out of 10. I feel giving a movie of this style a poor review is cutting it short for the credit it should get. It is well shot, the death sequences are well put together and inventive, there are the comical moments, characters you hate and can't wait to meet there makers and the who is the murderer guessing game.Don't get me wrong the film is not special, it's no Oscar nominee and has so many plot holes it is swiss cheese but what you do get is a fun slasher flick that won't let you down as long as you don't expect too much from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less like a remake, more like another slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of sorority girls pull a cruel prank on the brother of one of their brethren. They wind up taking the prank too far, and it goes terribly awry when one of them is killed. Fearful for their futures, they decide to dump the body down an old shaft and keep what happened a secret. Time passes and it seems that they've gotten away with it, but a hooded killer shows up on the night of their graduation party to pick off those involved.I am not the biggest remake fan. I outright skip many of them, though I'm not as vehement in my stance as I once was. In fact, a few have actually been catching my interest more and more as of late, the other most recent example being The Uninvited, a surprisingly well-done adaptation of a somewhat overrated Asian title. Then there is Sorority Row, which garnered my attention for two key reasons; A) I am an unapologetic slasher fan and B) Margo Harshman has a role in the film.With that said, I really enjoyed Sorority Row. I did a double-bill with Whiteout, and thankfully I decided to watch this one second, as it washed away the foul taste of that nonsensical mess. For slasher fans like myself, Sorority Row had a feeling of "old school" to it. The storyline setup, the atmosphere, the wild sorority parties... it felt like old times. Old times that were witnessed via 80's slashers, of course. Some pretty inventive kills in here too, just like in the glory days of the slasher film. No repetitive Scream or IKWYDLS type kills. And really, if you're a slasher fan, the kills are half of the fun. I also have to say that I enjoyed the dialogue in this film. It was always spot-on with the wit, always funny in a dark humor sorta' way. I actually had the opposite reaction to the characters, as the girl playing Cassidy annoyed me. Her voice just grated on my nerves for some reason. The queen bitch was a joy to watch. I thought she was thoroughly amusing. As for Margo, she was stuck with the thankless role of the group slut, but she brought her own brand of deadpan humor to the part. Her lacking amount of screen time was my biggest disappointment with this movie.All of that aside, the killer's reveal was also disappointing. The motivation just wasn't resonating with me, and some of the theatrics seemed too in line with the lame Scream brand of villains. Still, the rest of the film was so much fun, I can't help but recommend this to other slasher fans. If you like this kind of film, give it a chance. If you don't, well, I doubt you'd be reading this far anyway. It's a slasher film, plain and simple, and one I'd give the ol' slash of approval.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly fun slasher flick and a decent remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a prank goes awry, a group of sorority sisters are left with a dead body on their hands. They cover up the accidental murder, but on graduation night someone begins to brutally kill everyone involved in the deadly prank.Admittedly I went into Sorority Row with low expectations because I've always had a soft spot for the original House on Sorority Row (1983) and I feared that this would be another weak insulting remake, i.e. Black Christmas 2006 or Prom Night 2008. However I found myself rather entertained by this polished and energetic remake, it was an engaging ride all the way. Sorority Row has a typical slasher film setup, some hokey dialog, and the usual MTV-style direction, but it manages to build some good suspense and action throughout its interesting plot. Also it has some effectively funny moments of dark humor. In addition there's some flashes of nudity thrown in along with some inventive and bloody murder scenes.Cast-wise the actors are adequate enough though their characters are typically paper-thin. The biggest standout is definitely Carrie Fisher as the amusingly tough housemother Mrs. Crenshaw. She deserved more screen time.Over all Sorority Row is a fun slasher guilty pleasure that thankfully doesn't tarnish the memory of a horror classic. It's a worth-wild watch for horror fans, especially if you don't take it too seriously.** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure whether I heard about this film during the time of its release or not, but I saw clips of it, and I do like to try the occasional scary movie with a distinctive title. Basically sorority sister Megan Blaire (Audrina Patridge) has found out that her boyfriend Garrett Bradley (Matt O'Leary) had cheated on her, and with the help of her sorority friends Cassidy Tappan (Briana Evigan), Jessica Pierson (Leah Pipes), Ellie Morris (Rumer Willis, daughter of Bruce and Demi Moore), Claire Wen (Jamie Chung) and Charlene 'Chugs' Bradley (Margo Harshman) help her get revenge. The plan is for Megan to fake her death by pretending to overdose on pills, they will dump her body in the lake, and she will eventually come back and freak him out, but when they get to a steel mill this goes horribly wrong when Garrett stabs his girlfriend and she dies for real. The sorority sisters and he have no choice, because they cannot face telling anyone, including the police, but to dump her body in a near deep shaft so that no-one can find the body. Eight months have passed, and the sisters have grown further apart in their friendship, but they may be forced to come back together when one gets a strange message from someone that knows what they did, with a picture of the tire iron Garrett stabbed Megan with. This all comes during the time of graduation, and one by one the sorority girls find out the horrific intent of this stranger sending the message, each girl is murdered by someone in a hooded cloak. One of the five girls is bumped off, leaving four to question who the killer may be, they are sure it is Megan come back from the dead, but they conclude it is not after finding her corpse in the shaft. They have their suspicions, and their house mother Mrs. Crenshaw (Carrie Fisher) is determined to stop whoever it is despite finding out about the horrific accident at the start of the nightmare, and eventually it is revealed to be Andy Richards (Julian Morris), Cassidy's boyfriend. The reason is that he wanted the perfect relationship with her, but there were too many people that knew about her involvement in Megan's death, so he killed everyone that he was sure knew about it, no matter who that was. In the end he gets what he deserved after Cassidy knew how crazy he was, fifteen months pass and Cassidy, Maggie and Ellie are the sorority girls left, everything seems to be back to normal, but that is questionable when see a person with scarred wrists, like Garrett did. Also starring Matt Lanter as Kyle. The cast of young beautiful actresses are only really good for their looks, Fisher does make a feisty house mother, this film is pretty much Prom Night meets I Know What You Did Last Summer, a sort of remake, so with that in mind it is not really that original or scary at all, a slightly terrible horror thriller. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slasher remake that beats all of the lifeless remakes/sequels of late</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorority Row seems to be receiving a lot of bad press for the same reasons that all slasher flicks seem to garner - it's clichéd, the characters aren't likable, the plot isn't handled well, the set-up is botched, blah blah blah. OK, these ARE fair points - there exists within this movie one too many "Hello, is anybody there?" moments, too many "Don't go in there!" moments, and let's be honest, they could have quite happily pinned the entire thing on someone else and gone to police instead of covering it up.However, to complain about those things would be to complain about the entire purpose of the slasher genre. Besides Scream, Hallowe'en and Black Christmas, there is not a single slasher that has a shred of believability (and even Hallowe'en doesn't - Michael Myers is the boogie man for goodness sake!). We go to see slasher films to watch people get killed and don't pretend otherwise. These situations do not happen in real life, why expect any level of realism in the film?!?So why bother going to see this? Primarily, for the kills. Out of the 10 or so murders, I'd say but only 3 are gratuitous and 2 of those are badly set up. Again, it's the same old story of bimbo/drunk frat boy wandering where they should know not to. But for the 7 or so others, they rock! The manslaughter at the beginning is pretty twisted, yet I, and many others got satisfaction watching one of those twits from The Hills getting offed and thrown down a mine shaft. Following on, a "pimped up" tyre iron is implemented to cause as much gore and depravity as possible: bottles, mirror shards, cars, flare guns, axes, fire-extinguishers, shotguns and the bird cane from the original all are used at some point to bring the death count to a total Rambo would be proud of. One of my favourite set-ups in the movie comes after the party, when they are aware that somehow, someone knows about their little secret. In an intense scene involving many bubbles - because in the World of the Greek Letters, you are more likely to find a jacuzzi than a room full of mannequins - one of the 5 get caught out in it. The build up ranks with that of Annie in Halloween or CC in Scream 2 - after the girls receive another threatening text, they realise that one of their names was missing from the list and before they know it, the missing girl is running, screaming through the courtyard towards them. Although the scares are few and far between, that scene had me ducking. The murder weapon, that tyre iron, is set to become iconic if it garners any sequels (which, undoubtedly it will).The main characters may not be the most interesting, and two of the girls really are just plain boring, but there are 3 who stand out in my mind: Jessica, Cassie and Ellie. Jessica, the bitchy queen, is played with fervour by Leah Pipes: she relishes every mean phrase, never misses a chance to put someone down, and when she stumbles across the dead body of a sorority sister, her first remark is "God, she looks terrible!" delivered with a dead pan attitude that just rocked. The fact that, unfortunately, she is governed by a bloke is a shame, but she redeems herself towards the end, staying true to her bitchy, selfish nature. Ellie, although a walking cliché in a horror movie, is played really rather well by Rumer Willis. A girl falling apart at the seams as she tries to cope with her part in the accident, she goes from slightly shaky to worried to paranoid to hysterical to catatonic. Yet she maintains some integrity and humour and has quite possibly the funniest moment during which the girls are trying to stop her from finding out that Megan just might not be dead. Finally, Briana Evigans is such fun to watch. Although her character has no right to feel better about herself over what happened and she certainly is no Sydney Prescott or Laurie Strode, Briana brings out of Cassie a feisty, tough girl who can actually be rooted for towards the end. The other 2 VERY good reasons to watch this movie are as follows: gratuitous cat fights (in a burning house with a psycho killer running around none-the-less!) and Carrie Fisher blowing her kitchen to smithereens with a shot gun, all the while taunting the masked killer with lines such as "Come to Mama."All in all, Sorority Row is not a good film but it is sheer entertainment. What it lacks in plot and credibility it more than makes up for in style. it's also the first remake that I've had pleasure watching due to it's total carelessness of where it's origins lie. I'd give it 6 out of 10. (yes I am aware I've awarded it 10 out of 10 but that's because I feel bad that morons would mark it so harsh on its lack of plot... seriously)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enormously entertaining slasher remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of sorority sisters find themselves the target of a maniacal killer in retaliation for their involvement in a prank gone wrong on one of their friends and must survive the attacks before they're all killed off.A lot better remake than initially expected, as it appears to be a glossy-looking, safe slasher that intends to tease rather than deliver, ably demonstrated by the rather low amount of nudity and sleaze offered despite their being not only one but two drunken college parties and more opportunities spread throughout the running time that would've been nice to show off a little more than it did, but also applying to the gore as well with it's rather lame-looking CGI bloodspurts that aren't nearly as much as what would've been unleashed had the kill actually gone down as it should've, yet the stalking in here is rather good with numerous chilling spots, the finale chasing has plenty of action and a nice recurrence of the old burning-down-the-house spirit so common in the Corman/Poe classics and a rather novel killer identity revelation that works really well. Could've been a lot better, but it's still really good as is.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, Nudity, a mild sex scene and drug use</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very good remake of a not very good slasher film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorority Row starts late one night at a party at the Theta Phi sorority house on Ransom University, five of the top sorority girl's play a prank on a boy named Garrett (Matt O'Leary) the cheating boyfriend of Megan (Audrina Patridge) who lets him think that they are going to have sex together. The other four girl's have given Garrett a pill to give to Megan, although harmless Megan plays dead &amp; Garrett panics. Garrett &amp; the other girls decide to take Megan to hospital but they end up at a disused quarry when they claim Megan is dead. They continue to play the joke on Garrett &amp; agree to dispose of the body after cutting it up, however the prank backfires when Garrett stabs Megan in the chest killing her for real. Garrett &amp; the other four sorority girls decide to throw Megan's body down an old well &amp; make a pact not to tell anyone else for fear of going to jail but eight months later the girls are all sent texts referring to Megans death as a hooded figure starts to kill the girls one by one...Directed by Stuart Hendler this is a remake of the early 80's teen slasher The House on Sorority Row (1983) which I have seen but cannot remember anything about other than someone gets a walking stuck in their throat but I still think it's probably safe to say that it couldn't be any worse then this lifeless &amp; dull offering. A lot of classic independent horror films have been remade in the past few years by Hollywood but I am struggling to see the attraction in remaking a fairly obscure slasher film such as The House on Sorority Row, however someone though it was a good idea &amp; what we are left with is a forgettable a teen slasher with no great redeeming features apart from one or two decent kill scenes. The story doesn't quite work, even if Megan &amp; the other girls could convince Garrett that she was dead why was there no investigation into her disappearance? Surely someone else at the party saw Meagn &amp; the other's? Wouldn't the police have investigated? The character's are very unlikable, spoilt rich brats, wimpy worriers &amp; selfish stuck-up girls who really are impossible to like &amp; that in turn makes it impossible to side or emphasise with anyone. When the killer is finally revealed &amp; their motives exposed it's all rather silly &amp; while they were a brilliant silent killer once they are revealed they become a noisy idiot all of a sudden. The killer's identity also leads to the double twist ending in which someone is is earlier thought to have been the killer so why do they start attacking people? Why did they behave in the way that they did? It never made any sense to me. At almost 100 minutes long Sorority Row drags at times, it's fairly repetitive &amp; never really excites or interests beyond how the next victim is going to die &amp; how much padding we are going to have to sit through to find out. All the standard teen slasher clichés are here, silly false scares, lots of walking around dark places, shower scenes, a murder at regular intervals &amp; a twist ending that you will probably forget within a day or two. I can't say I liked it that much.Sorority Row looks nice enough, director Hendler fails to create much tension or many scares but it's reasonably well made with a certain slickness about it. The kills are alright, my favourite was when the girl gets her whiskey bottle rammed down her throat. The rest of the kills all involve a rather awkward look tyre iron with blades on each side, it's a silly murder weapon actually. There's a fair amount of nudity here if that's your thing. Originally set to be PG the distributors decided to go with an R rating, not that it's that graphic anyway but the extra bit of blood &amp; gore does help.With a supposed budget of about $16,000,000 this was filmed in Pennsylvania, the production values are good but the acting got on my nerves with every character's quite unlikable.Sorority Row feels like I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) only with more girls &amp; nowhere near as good, this is standard clichéd teen slasher with little to recommend it. Unoriginal, tired &amp; bland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So another horror remake? Shocker ... though not exactly literally. What it is though is beautiful. Especially if you do like women. There is not much acting necessary (which doesn't imply the people involved are not able to do so), just having to look good and scared. All of them are good in that regard.I haven't seen the original (or I don't remember it?), but the premise is pretty simple. As another reviewer wrote, you could say, just another slasher. The effects/murders are pretty good, so you get your moneys worth from that. Thrills are decent enough, though you do know where it is heading and characters still "act" dumb/irrational, as they always do in those movies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing particularly wrong with Sorority Row, what it does, it does well enough, but you've seen this movie before.Like Avatar is to Dances with Wolves, Sorority Row is to I Know What You Did Last Summer, and considering the latter movie wasn't all that long ago, the former really would have been better off waiting a while longer before it was made.I suppose one area the movie has to be credited for, and thats all the lead girls bare virtually no flesh whatsoever, which is a change for this type of movie, not sure I fully welcome that direction, some of the girls are quite delectable! Acting is all fine, some of the soundtrack choices are quite good, and the direction seems fine, apart from the final reveal of who the killer is, its all a bit lacking in the build up department, it just kind of happens.Some of the death scenes are done quite well, a couple of quite brutal kills. The character by Leah Pipes is a suitably nice bitch character and some of the lines she comes out with are pretty funny.The problem as i've said is its simply far too samey with I Know What You Did Last Summer, and no amount of pretty girls is going to change anyones perceptions of it.Its worth a rental, but I couldn't foresee any reason to own it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Garrett cheats on girlfriend Megan, her sorority sisters decide to pay him back by pretending that she is dead, to the extent that they take the "body" off to a remote site to dispose of it. When Megan accidentally moves, the spooked Garrett reacts by driving a tire iron into her chest, leaving the sisters with the problem of what to do with the body. Cassidy wants to report it to the authorities, but alpha uber-bitch Jessica browbeats the others into dumping Megan's body (and the tire iron) down a mineshaft. At the graduation party eight months later, the girls are texted a photo of a hand grasping a tire iron. As they begin to die one by one, the question is whether Megan has come back from the dead, or is there another explanation? Sorority Row is a perfectly serviceable slasher movie, fuelled by a) who gets it next (and how), and b) who is doing it. If this is the sort of movie you enjoy, then you'll enjoy this one.There was an aspect I particularly liked, and that was the look of the movie - it is beautifully photographed - points awarded for cinematography, because it is filmed with much greater care than is usually the case for this sort of movie.Two elements which pleased me less, though. One is the answer to who is doing it. This struck me as the least probable possibility, with a motive which is less than credible.The other - and please read no further if you don't like spoilers, because this is a biggie - is the last five minutes. The climax is proceeding very nicely, and all looks lost, when help comes from an unexpected quarter. This turns out to be Ellie, played by Rumer Willis. Now Ellie has spent pretty much the entire movie as a snivelling, whimpering, hysterical mess yet, in this final few minutes, she becomes a Rambo-lite lean, mean killing machine (because she'd do anything for her sisters, you understand), in one of the biggest and least believable character switches in the memory of this particular moviegoer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly fun guilty pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh no, a guy is cheating on one of the Theta Pi sisters! Good for them they have a prank lined up for some prime revenge. Too bad said prank ends with one of them dead. To make things worse, a hooded slasher is after them after graduation.Last year, we got a remake of "Prom Night" that ended up being one of the worst horror remakes of the decade, and committed a cardinal sin-a PG-13 slasher movie. Well, look at "Sorority Row" (a remake of the 1983 slasher flick "The House on Sorority Row") as the movie the "Prom Night" remake should have been-the anti-"Prom Night" remake if you will. It's not a classic, but nobodies expecting that now, are they?So, what works?For one thing, while not a splatter flick, there are some impressive kills available, as well as a sweet murder weapon that has potential to become iconic. Also, the performances are fun. Carrie Fisher is a hoot to watch (her role is a bit too minuscule though) and unlike say "I Know What You Did Last Summer", this movie makes no bones about the fact that most of these characters are unlikable and deserve their fates. The best surprise as far as acting is concerned is Leah Pipes as the bitchy leader of the sorority sisters Jessica. She's a blast to watch, and plays the part without overacting or overdoing her character. In short, she steals the show as far as I'm concerned. The movie does have it's flaws-it's a bit too flashy at moments, at times could have done a little more with it's R-rating (there's nudity, but none of the lead girls gets naked? For shame!) and the final ten minutes could have definitely used some work. Nags aside, "Sorority Row" is a fun guilty pleasure. Sure, it's more catered towards a teen audience than hardcore horror fans, but come on, most slasher flicks have been catered to a teen audience. Besides, in an age of pointless PG-13 horror, 3D gimmicks, unnecessary sequels like "Halloween II" and "The Final Destination", horror flicks that try to hard to be hardcore, and horror flicks that try too hard to cater to horror fans (I'm a hardcore horror fan, but occasionally that can get annoying), a piece of unapologetic slasher fluff goes down easy.Plus, any movie that opens with girls in PJ's with their asses exposed jumping up and down can't be all bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An improbable college prank goes even more improbably wrong with improbable results. Rather than dial 911 and flush their graduation down the toilet, the sisters concerned and the one male present decide to throw the body of the unfortunate victim down a mine then carry on as normal. This course of action is passed on a show of hands, but there is a big difference between reluctant acquiescence and enthusiastic consent. Fast forward to graduation, and the cracks are beginning to show big time. There is also the little matter of a mysterious individual who is murdering people with the weapon of choice, and he is coming for the conspirators. It is a he, right?If you have seen a modern day slasher flick before, you have seen this film, or maybe you haven't. An added twist discovered only when the murders are well underway is that the original foul if "accidental" deed has actually been filmed, albeit accidentally (so many unfortunate "accidents" herein) so obviously this raises a probable revenge motive, albeit an improbable one.After this the girls begin to lose the plot, do they really believe the girl who was stabbed to death with a tyre iron then thrown down a deep mine can be alive? Apparently so, one or two of them do at any rate. Having said that, if you allow for the improbables, the fancifuls, and the accidents, this film does have some class one liners and retorts - most of which are unprintable - and a half decent soundtrack. Sadly, there is no gratuitous nudity, well, not so you'd really notice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typical modern horror film, a remake of Mark Rosmans' 1983 slasher "The House on Sorority Row". A group of hard partying hottie college students pull a prank on an unfaithful boyfriend, only for it to backfire and result in the death of one of their fellow sorority sisters. The girls cover up the crime, vowing never to mention it again. However, you can guarantee that some character is going to have a long memory and be determined to punish the guilty.Patently predictable 21st century slasher, with characters about whom you just do not care. The actresses may all be very pleasing to look at, but give rather inauspicious performances here. The original Rosman movie isn't anything great, but at least there was some attempt made at atmosphere. The revised story doesn't offer anything interesting, preferring to basically tread familiar ground. There's a modest amount of very digital gore, and a mildly amusing weapon for our killer to wield: a pimped-out tire iron. We've got a standard "hip" soundtrack and dialogue, as well as updating to the current era in terms of technology. We have one recognizable veteran on hand, in the form of Carrie Fisher, who's decent and who gets to be something of a bad ass.At least, there's some novelty value in the presence of a few second generation performers: Fisher (daughter of Debbie Reynolds), Briana Evigan (daughter of Greg Evigan), Rumer Willis (daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore), Robert Belushi (son of James Belushi). But the movie remains no more than passably engrossing. Even as it works its way through the assortment of possible suspects, it does not, in the end, deliver any surprises.Plus, it's aggravating to see how so many of these current horror films seemingly HAVE to end a certain way.Five out of 10.</fullReview>

There is some skin in the movie, but unfortunately not from the main characters you would like to see it from. A lot of it was as predictable as "Slasher" films can be, but over all it was entertaining. Not bad for a group movie, better than most of them that are out there at this time.

		<fullReview>When five sorority girls inadvertently cause the murder of one of their sisters in a prank gone wrong, they agree to keep the matter to themselves and never speak of it again, so they can get on with their lives. This proves easier said than done, when after graduation a mysterious killer goes after the five of them and anyone who knows their secret...(Summit Entertainment)I love slasher movies. I have a soft spot for them. As a slasher fan, SORORITY ROW was...decent, but it could have been a lot better. Still, I thought it was enjoyable, although lazy in some points. Let's start with the problems because I'd like to end on a positive note: The script is lazy. There are huge chunks of plot holes throughout the film. As the body count gets bigger, nobody seems to notice anything, even in public places like the shower and kitchen.The cell phones also do a great job at not working, as always, although I'm kind of annoyed with that cliché at this point. I'm also annoyed by how the characters strike the killer once and turn their backs when they can finish him/her off when s/he goes unconscious. That bothered me a lot. I also felt that the third act went way too long. Lastly, when the killer is finally revealed, the motive for the whole thing sucked. Actually, was there really a motive? I don't remember one. It was some babbling that sounded like one. Oh, well.With the obvious script problems, there were some good things that actually came out of this movie. First of all, I liked the characters, even though some of them were really bitchy. Leah Pipes plays the bitchiest character you'll ever see in a film. I kid you not, this girl said some of the most cold and low lines that will leave you stunned. However, she's the best part in the film. You can't believe what she's saying yet she felt like a comedic genius! Pipes played the character really, really well and her delivery of her lines is brilliant! Briana Evigan and Rumer Willis, although not quite as good, are sympathetic in their roles. Carrie Fisher also stars in a cameo appearance who was great in her BAMF role with her big rifle. Everyone else was sufficient.There's also some suspense in here as well. There's an underlying excitement going on when a character is about to be killed off, which is why I love slashers so much. The film also managed to make bubbles feel threatening and scary, a feat hard to pull off, I'd imagine. Technically, the film is stunning to look at. The cinematography is symmetrical in some scenes, which I really liked and the lighting is perfect. There's also the score by Lucian Piane which is pretty fantastic.Overall, the film is enjoyable as it is, although there are plenty of flaws. It could have been a better slasher if they fixed the script and had a better motive for the killer. If you're a horror fan, you may be slightly disappointed but it could have been a lot worse (I'm looking at you BLACK Christmas; the remake, of course).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake of House on Sorority Row is a dull, unimaginative waste of film. It is totally implausible and we can't associate or even like any of the characters which makes suspension of disbelief absolutely impossible. Sorority Row is so formulaic that if you've watched any slasher flicks in your life don't even bother, because you've already seen it. The ending is a total anti-climax and there isn't one scare worthy of the price of admission in the entire film. To think that they were making horror movies much better than this thirty, even forty years ago! If you just want to sit there and see a stupid movie about a guy killing a bunch of girls with no suspense, no gory special effects and not an ounce of humor, go see this yawn-fest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just start off by saying that I haven't watched the original movie, so I can't compared the two. That being said, let's start.So let's first assume that no human being would ever be as stupid as this girls were and that was all done for the sake of a horror movie. As horror movies go, this is more of the same slasher killer type. And it fits all of the stereotypes we tend to see in these kinds of movies. Hot chicks do something awful and then it comes to bite them in the butt. And then you find the typical characters you always find on this kids of movies. You have the good girl that always wants to do the right thing, you have the nerd, you have the whore, you have the "leader" and her sidekick. It's just more of the same typical things. The movie doesn't bring anything new, or different for that matter. The only thing that I can say sorta kinda saves this movie, is twist that it gives us when it comes to the murderer. I was not expecting that and I certainly didn't see it coming. That's the only thing I would save about this movie.Overall, nothing new nor exciting is brought to the table. Just more of your typical teenage slasher movie. If you are absolutely bored out of your mind, go ahead and give it a shot. Otherwise, if you have ever seen a teenage slasher movie before, you already knows what happens on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorority Row (2009): Dir: Stewart Hendler / Cast: Briana Evigan, Rumer Willis, Leah Pipes, Jamie Chung, Audrina Patridge: The umpteenth dumb slasher film only this one regards the consequences of our actions. Pretty much the same plot as I Know What You Did Last Summer with a murder taking place and the burying of the evidence. Of course, several months later the guilty parties are haunted and eventually picked off in graphic fashion. Directed by Stewart Hendler who makes good use of locations including a bubble machine. They could have operated that bubble machine throughout the 90 minutes and still made a better film than the junk they eventually released. the cast do nothing more than scream and point blame. Who can blame them? Nobody wants to admit that they were talked into starring in a shitty film such as this. Featuring Briana Evigan, Rumer Willis, Leah Pipes, Audrina Patridge, and Jamie Chung who should all be ashamed to be part of a film this stupid. They could be filmed screaming over a nice game of tag and that would be more entertaining than what they were cast in. We receive countless horror films every year that are similar to this one, and they seem to test the lowest levels of intelligence. What we have here isn't promising. Rather it is a film that should be beat with a tire iron and tossed down a well and never seen again. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being late August, early September, it marks the beginning of horror movie season with hits like "Halloween 2," "The Final Destination," both sequels, but then there's "Sorority Row," which from the trailers portrays an interesting premise. Sorority girls pull on a mean prank on a sister's boyfriend who cheated on her. They trick him into thinking the girl is dying, and are taking her body away to get rid of the evidence. But, he actually kills her which leaves the girls to dump her body in a mine. Of course, there's five girls; one H.B.I.C, the drunk, a goody-girl, the normal, and an Asian. Eight months later, the girls are preparing for a graduation party and a killer starts killing them and all involved with the incident one by one.The killer should have been someone else, instead of a psycho boyfriend in my opinion. The motive would have been better, but I guess the writers decided to take another turn. Not a bad choice for a horror movie though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like teen slasher movies, especially wolf creek, my super psycho sweet 16 1, 2 &amp; 3 and wrong turn 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Sorority row got some pretty awesome death and fighting scenes, like the scene where Chugs got a bottle crushed down her throat, made me feel it in my own throat : s and when one of the girls got attacked in the "party-foam". I also think its very underrated. I thought it would be a pretty good rated famous horror movie. I would have personally rated it 10/10. But for all peoples ratings it ended up as 5/10. I thought it would at least be rated 7/10.... I cant see why this movie is bad. Its good acting, good blood/dirt/gore/ effects and the story is kinda descent, but at the same time sorority row it got their own pearls. If you like movies like My super psycho sweet 16, House of Wax and 7eventy 5ive this one will be perfect for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few years back we had the remakes of "Prom Night" and "Black Christmas" which were pretty awful. Nowadays teen slasher flicks have become redundant with their predictable twists and turns. The only reason I saw this movie was Jamie Chung who I find very hot and also because a friend recommended it. So, of course, I saw this remake of the 1983 movie, "Sorority Row", with low expectations last night. Despite its shortcomings and some weak links, I was surprised by how much I was actually enjoying it.During a party in the Theta-Pi sorority house, the sister Megan plays a prank with her unstable boyfriend Garrett (Matt O'Leary) simulating an OD after using pills. Her sisters Jessica (Leah Pipes), Claire (Jamie Chung), Ellie (Rumer Willis), Cassidy (Briana Evigan) and Garrett's sister, Chugs (Margo Harshman) suggest to dump her "dead body" in a lake and the stressed Garrett sticks the tire iron through the Megan's chest, inadvertently which ends up killing her. Cassidy decides to call the police, but the sisters are convinced to dispose the body in a shaft and keep it in secret under the leadership of Jessica that blackmails Cassidy. Eight months later, in their graduation party, the sisters receive a creepy message with the picture of the tire iron in the beginning of a nightmarish night. One by one, the sisters and their unsuspecting boyfriends are stalked and killed by an unseen nemesis. Has Megan returned from the dead to exact her revenge? Or was their secret discovered by someone else someone now determined to make them pay? The movie has a dark sense of humor, the deaths are effectively gross and the characters have some semblance of actual depth to them. The best acting in the movie has to be Jessica's character who completely convinced us she was a real b....(the 'b' word that I cannot use on IMDb) and a leader figure. Surprisingly, she also successfully carries off the inner turmoil in her life which the others don't have a clue about. Ellie's character came off as nauseating to me. All the other girls were much more entertaining than her. What was the point in keeping her alive again? The tension and suspense was built throughout the movie with some good action along its interesting plot. The only negative aspect was the revelation of the true killer which is quite contrived and made me groan. In trying to keep us guessing who the killer is, the writers have made the only guy who could not be the killer to become a psychopath and hunt all those who knew the truth about Megan's death. Trust me, that was really lame! But other than that, the movie is well worth a watch, even though it has some cliché stuff that every young girl in a slasher movie has to make.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typical teen slasher film. The single quick death scenes were quite inventive and different. Had a good story line but it takes a lot to get into it. It's less interesting towards the ending because its the whole,'running through the house from the killer' thing. it drags a little but the ending has a good twist. it has a whole 'guess the murderer' thing going on as well. Has a good twist on who the murder was. It had good acting and shocking moments. it's a match with 'Urban Ledgends','I Know What You Did Last Summer'and 'Prom Night' but all round quite a good film and worth the watch. 7/10! - but only because its a little slow and typical but then again - what teen slasher isn't?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly that was a movie i enjoyed a lot,the time passed nice,nice music,nice girls,and the well known graduation and party feeling of such movies.About scenario,well it wasn't anything i couldn't guess,nothing new even if we except the fact it's a remake of an older movie.There's a LOT of goofs on scenario and acting that makes it a goofy movie.Half guys crying,half guys being nuts,nothing new,similar to bad cop - good cop.(Starting of spoilers) First i need to say i haven't watched the original but...What i wanted was more mystery and paranormal,i was hoping the dead girl was a ghost or something so the thing wouldn't end up like it did,having a teenager pervert psycho killer which somehow is faster and more effective than Rambo.C'mon,being on the shower and suddenly all the shower faucets starts shouting water together? How the heck did a regular person do it? That leads to paranormal by itself,but i guess by such actions in the movie,the scenariographer and the producers wanted to confuse the viewer so it'll be more mysterious till the end.What confused me and from what i'm not satisfied is the end.I didn't clearly understand who the killer actually was,because judging from other movies and from my experience,the killer we saw might be actually irrelevant or someone who turned to crazy... And of course what happened with the corpse of the dead girl... We saw a corpse somewhere in the house but a 2days dead can't turn into a mummy looking corpse... i guess most of the viewers didn't understand as well.They should look forward to make a Sequel of Sorority Row.Overall i give it 8/10,for me it was a decent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another flash in the pan remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot = A group of sorority sisters play a trick on one of they're boyfriends involving his girlfriend but the trick goes wrong and she winds up dead, but instead of reporting the crime they cover it up and dump the body, but after graduation somebody knows what they've done and starts picking the girls off one by one.This is yet again another flash in the pan remake of an 80's slasher, but updated with over the top murders and something that is totally forgettable. But in my opinion I found this movie pretty good, much better than some of the crappy remakes that have come out in recent years. The cast was solid Cassidy (Briana Evigan) gave a credible performance as the final girl to root for. Jessica (Leah Pipes) I really enjoyed her character as the usual bitchy one. Chugs (Margo Harshman) The sarcastic one was fun but bowed out too soon, but I loved her scene with the wine bottle, the best scene I've seen in years. And let's not forget Carrie Fisher as the gun toting house mother, she was brilliant.There are a few hippcups with this movie though, the whodunnit element was well rubbish (not much of a surprise) I figured it out way too early and way too predictable and plus the reason for why was just too stupid and didn't make any sense. And yes there were cool kills and all, but tension was rarely there, other than that this is a pretty decent remake.All in all "Sorority Row" is a pretty decent movie with some cool deaths, worth watching but don't expect something intelligent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had my choice between "Grudge 3" and this at the mall. I picked this one because I figured out this may be my only chance to see what goes on behind the walls of an American sorority house filled with all buxom babes. It also gave me a look at the latest "it" girls (Briana Evigan, Leah Pipes, Rumer Willis, Audrina Patridge among others) in Hollywood who were all gathered here in one glamorous package. The plot is quite interesting at the onset. An elaborate prank on an unfaithful boyfriend had fatal consequences which the Theta Pi girls had to keep under wraps. On graduation night though (8 months later), during their final sorority house party, the girls were being picked and killed one by one in most unconventional ways by a shadowy assailant in black robes. Could this be the ghost of the victim of their prank venting her revenge on her sisters who abandoned her when she died?The build up to the conclusion became more and more unrealistic and over-the-top, especially as the attractive cast is killed off one after the other. At the end though, the ultimate revelation was mind-numbingly lame. Anyway, came to have a good scare and did so. Had my hands ready to cover my eyes at any time during the suspenseful parts which were quite well set-up. Strong performances by Briana Evigan (as the ethically-troubled Cassidy), Caroline D'Amore (as the bitchy sister of the victim) and an unrecognizable Carrie Fisher (as the bad-ass house mother).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know what you're all going to say."sorority row? Why the hell would you want to see that, that movie blew!" Let me start off by saying that this film did not blow. Does anyone remember that awful, awful film experience Prom night with the cute Brittany Snow? I try to forget it. This film is a lot better than that crap. I am not saying that Sorrity row was a perfect film. As a matter of fact I am going to name the flaws.1.It's a supposedly scary film right? Well, I don't think I was scared once throughout this film. Perhaps I made a little movement during one part but that is it. 2. The film's plot is not really original. For god's sake Hollywood, we know that this film happened years ago. with I know what you did last Summer. Really, this film is a mixture of Jawbreaker and I know what you did last Summer.Those are the only problems I can think of. I am pretty sure that there are more but I don't want to list them. Or can't think of them. The characters are kind of irritating. There is one character who I liked because she was funny. I also liked Carrie fisher, the usual, who plays the sorority mother. The death scenes(Some of the) were creative. This film would've been really original if I know what you did last Summer and Jawbreaker hadn't come out. Within the first minute of the film, I sensed disaster. this film wasn't a disaster. In thew opening scene, it shows a girl's ass. I was thinking as the film went on"This film is rated R. Let's see some tits". That's what I got. Sorrity row also has some bad acting. But really, what did i expect. Trust me people, this ain't no Prom night. I can't exactly say that you should see this film. Because it's not that great. It's like a lot of scary films now days, but better. I think Sorrity row is at least worth a rental.Sorrity row:**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-So Slasher Revamp Full of Slayed Sorority Girls.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sorority Row", a remake of the 1983 slasher film "The House on Sorority Row", focuses on the sorority girls of Theta Pi, in particular a group of seniors on the brink of graduation- the domineering Jessica, the goodhearted Cassidy, the nerdy Ellie, the sardonic Chugs, the docile Claire, and the spoiled Megan. One night, the girls play a prank on Megan's boyfriend, Garrett, in retaliation after he cheated on her. They trick him into believing he killed Megan by slipping her some deadly roofies, and drive to a remote mining site to "dismember" and dispose of the body. Of course, all the girls know Megan isn't really dead, but Garrett is very scared, and very gullible - and he ends up stabbing her with a tire iron to initiate the dismemberment. In a bout of panic, the girls decide to throw Megan's body into a mine shaft and pretend that nothing happened - easier said than done. Eight months later, the guilt is still eating away at most of them, and Megan's body has yet to be discovered - that is, until, on the night of their graduation party, a killer has come to claim them for their crime.I'd like to start off my review of this by stating that in no way, shape, or form, can "Sorority Row" be taken seriously. It's no "Exorcist", and it frankly doesn't try to be. The dialogue is corny, the acting is not outstanding by any means, and the believability of about 75% of what occurs in the movie is pretty low. Now that I've said that, I'd like to judge this movie on this level.Being a strong fan of the original "House on Sorority Row", it's hard for me to be too impressed with what the filmmakers did here. Did this exceed the original? No, not in my opinion at least. The original film was suspenseful and mysterious, whereas this re- imagining is much more like a "Scream" film, minus the tension. Not that this is necessarily a completely awful film, but it does lack in the scariness factor, and it's not too suspenseful, either. The dialogue also killed it for me in a lot of scenes, including a clichéd and drawn out argument following Megan's death, and girls responding to corpses with terms such as "pimped out" and "she looks awful"; the dialogue is often ditsy and unbelievable, and it drew me out of the movie to the point that I couldn't take it seriously. The girls often seemed very unaffected by the deaths of those around them as well, which seemed too unreal to be serious. Then again, I expected this to be very unrealistic, so I decided to kick back and enjoy it for what it was. Does the film have things going for it? Well, yes. It offers a few neat plot twists and some creative murder sequences that I have to give the writers props for. I also really liked the characters in the film, because they were a tad more fleshed-out than the typical lineup of female slasher victims. They had personality, even if it was sometimes cliché - at least it was there. The actresses portraying the girls deserve much of the credit for this, because they made their characters at least halfway interesting, and often quite funny (Chugs' roofie line was a hoot). I was surprised by the mix of comedy in the film as well, at least in terms of the dialogue; while a lot of it was corny and unbelievable, some of it was actually quite funny.The girls playing the roles were competent enough to carry the film; I spotted a few Disney Channel stars, but they seem to have matured from their kiddie days. Briana Evigan plays the leading heroine, which I found interesting since I had seen her in a little low-budget horror movie called "House of the Damned" which she starred in with her dad, Greg Evigan, back in the mid-1990s. She was probably nine years old in that film, and it wasn't a good movie by any means, but she's matured into a very pretty woman, and her acting has clearly bettered with age and experience. Bruce Willis and Demi Moore's daughter, Rumer Willis, was also solid in her sweet-but-nerdy role, and Leah Pipes played the head-honcho bitch well; I liked her and hated her at the same time. The legendary Carrie Fisher of "Star Wars" plays the housemother, and while her part is small, she is very good. And as a bonus, pretty much every person in the film is good looking in some form; lots of eye candy, for guys and girls.The cinematography is also worth noting, because the film was very nicely shot. Lots of neat sets, vivid colors, and decent camera-work. The film looked good as a whole. Now, onto the climax- I wasn't impressed. The revelation of the killer was disjointed to say the least, and the motive was too far-fetched for me to buy. There were also a couple of 180s in terms of characterization that weren't plotted well. The final shot of the film, alluding to a possible sequel, was also extremely clichéd, and had me rolling my eyes. Still, I digress. It may not be a great movie, but it was fun as far as brainless horror junk food goes.Overall, "Sorority Row" is a mixed bag. I liked the characters in the film which were unusually involving, and the film was nicely photographed. On the other hand, the dialogue is often ridiculous, and some turns of events were completely unbelievable. Lastly, the film fails in exceeding its predecessor; I believe the 1983 film was overall a much better movie. "Sorority" '09, however, is at least amusing. Worth a watch if you like your horror extra cheesy, sans all seriousness. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart , sassy and fun remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorority Row is far better than it needs to be.Complete with solid acting, a sharp and witty screenplay, and clever, well-shot death scenes, Sorority Row will not disappoint. Like all above average slasher films, this one begins with a moral dilemma: 6 best friends and senior sorority sisters perform a prank at their back to school bash, and it ends in accidental murder. They decide to forge the ultimate sisterhood pact to keep the event a secret, forever changing their relationships with one another. Cut to 8 months later, it is graduation time, and their secret has suddenly started to resurface, coming to a head at the end of the year party, where each girls true colors and allegiances shine through. It has your basic setup: pretty girls stalked by a cloaked figure, ending in a climax at a drunken, out of control party.The girls are, for the most part, well cast and utterly watchable. The stand out performances here are Leah Pipes and Briana Evigan as the two alpha females of the group, who face-off in a battle of the wits. Evigan plays Cassidy, the smart and uncompromising rebel of the group, hellbent on making things right. Pipes plays Jessica, the manipulative, control freak president of the sorority, who's fear of the discovery of this secret could cost her everything, including her Abercrombie-looking boyfriend, who happens to be a prospective senators son. Jamie Chung is sweet and gorgeous as the pushover of the group. And Margo Harshman steals every scene she's in, playing Chuggs, the resident pill-popping party girl of the group. Harshman gives the film almost all of it's much needed comic relief. As for Rumer Willis and Audrina Patridge...sigh. I have to give Willis a certain amount of credit for her role as Ellie, the bookworm. This was her debut film performance, and she isn't terrible., however she doesn't have the chops to carry off some of the more emotionally complex scenes her character has to sob through. Audrina Patridge, who garnered fame playing herself in the reality show The Hills, barely has three lines in the film. One can suspect that her role had to be severely reduced once she arrived on set, and couldn't bring even an ounce of personality or charisma to her two dead eyes.The screenplay offers some really good scenes for the girls to play out, some funny zingers, and some quiet moments of true emotion. The film allows for more character development than I've seen in any slasher movie since Scream. The direction is slick, and the photography is dazzling, complete with a few thrilling and creative death scenes, which is part of the reason us horror film lovers go to these silly movies. In a land full of boring and bland horror remakes, this one is smart and fast paced, and perhaps, better than the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonably good horror/slasher film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this movie back in 2010 and when I first watched it I was freaked out by it and thought it was the best movie ever. The movie is about a group of sorority sisters who played a prank on one of the sisters brothers 'Garret' to teach him for cheating on one of them. The prank goes as plan as Garret thinks that Megan is dead. They get to where they are going to decide where to dump the body when Garret stabs Megan in the chest because he thinks that she is dead. To his surprise she isn't and starts yelling at the girls saying that 'She isn't dead'.Now knowing the fact that they just were apart of the killing of one of their closest friends they decide to say that Megan went missing at the party and she was never seen again.Months later at their annual Luncheon all the girls get a horrific text that appears to be from Megans phone. That night the sorority house is throwing one of the biggest parties of the year but all the sisters get distracted by the text they got earlier.Chugs was one of the first to be killed at her shrinks house. Both her shrink and Chugs get killed by the person in the 'Graduation Gown'.Throughout the rest of the movie people that know about what happened get murdered so no one else finds out about this massive secret. The girls start to think that Megan isn't really dead so they go back to where they dropped her and the words 'Theta Pi Must Die' are written on the wall in blood.While at the mining grounds Garret is there and the girls instantly think that he lead them there and they run him over with the car so they don't get killed even though he wasn't the one killing everyone off.They arrive back to the party where the whole house and grounds are trashed and only a few people are left since everyone else went to the after party at another house. During the time that they are back at the house one of the main sisters is killed with a flare gun while trying to turn of a hot tub.Now the ending is near of the film and the killers are revealed. Jessica was the only one who told her boyfriend about the real reason Megan disappeared. Jessicas and Cassidys boyfriends are the killers and said they wanted to kill the people because 'They knew'. Both boys were killed by the girls and Megans sister, Cassidy and Ellie walk out of the burning sorority house being the last 3 alive.Overall this is a good movie to watch with friends and a creepy movie to watch in the dark alone. 7.5/10 simply because I've watched it many times but it is still enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eight months after a prank goes wrong that sees the brutal death of their beloved sorority sister, a group of girls find themselves receiving threatening text messages &amp; photos &amp; soon find themselves brutally bumped off by a maniac, armed with his own custom made tire iron that supports some pretty sharp instruments for carving the girls up (a step up from the cane weapon used in the 1983 film). With the remaining survivors left, the girls attempt to stop the maniac or wind up on his/her list of victims. But perhaps the biggest fear the girls have is not what he/she will do to them, but who is doing it? did their sorority sister really die on that horrible night? is it her boyfriend exacting his own brand of revenge? is it the dead girl's sister? or has one of the friends snapped &amp; decided to go on a killing spree themselves? or has someone else with close connections to the girl seen them do it &amp; wants vengeance of their own? SORORITY ROW is a highly enjoyable slasher film that I thought for sure no longer existed! In a world where horror films are now known for casting a whiny WB actress, no gore, no suspense &amp; hiding it's horror movie badge under the title of a "thriller" SORORITY ROW ( Which despite it's claims is not really a remake of the excellent 1983 slasher, THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW) is a fun horror film made for true horror movie fans &amp; is as equally entertaining, scary &amp; suspenseful as the original film!. The plot which bears a strong resemblance to I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, features tons of creative kills, gore, nudity, great acting &amp; directing &amp; enough suspense &amp; plot twists to fuel several movies &amp; the film really had me hooked from beginning to end &amp; never bored me, I really enjoyed this film! it felt like a real horror film. However the box office take probably didn't convince Hollywood that this type of horror film was ready to come back. I suppose the fact that the film wasn't a play it safe, badly made, boring, non horror, PG-13 remake featuring a star from EVERWOOD, 7TH HEAVEN or GILMORE GIRLS or the movie TWILIGHT, killed off the chance of anyone giving this film a chance on opening night. I highly recommend to horror fans who were brought up on the 1970's/80's horror films to see this. Those however who were raised on the kiddie horrors of the 90's need not apply. The only difference in plot is that this time it's a sorority sister who dies &amp; not a house mother. Another thing is that the film takes place eight months after the incident while in the original the killings took place the very same day the house mother died, with the killer being her son whom we thought had died at the beginning of the film. The killer in the remake is not the son seeking his mother's revenge, since again it's a sorority sister who winds up killed. In fact minus those details I mentioned, the sorority name &amp; some characters that share similar traits as those in the older film, SORORITY ROW is an entirely new movie. The only disappointment I had with the film, was it's ending where the villain was revealed (I won't reveal who it is, in case you haven't seen it yet) but I wasn't buying it nor the explanation for the crimes given, it was disappointing. Other than that, nicely done &amp; the gals are not only gorgeous, but they can actually act too! **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Sorority Row, and it wasn't an Oscar nominee, but it was very entertaining. I was freaked out at times, and it had a comedic value to it. The trailer made the movie look more serious than funny, but there are parts in the movie that are intentionally funny.The acting was pretty good. I didn't have a problem with any of the lead actresses, surprisingly. Briana Evigan, who plays the lead, is the all-American girl. Rumer Willis is the sensitive outsider of the group. Leah Pipes is the spoiled, power hungry leader. Jamie Chung is the laid-back free spirit, and Margo Harshman is the drunken loud mouth. Caroline D'Amore was creepy as the sister of Megan, played by Audrina Patridge, who gets killed off in the beginning. Also, I was happy to see Carrie Fisher in this movie as the house mother.The story is a little formulaic at times, the kills had a good set up, and the comedy works at the right times.Overall, this is a decent slasher flick. If you are planning on seeing this, then don't expect too much, there isn't a lot of stuff original here, but this movie is a lot of fun.Rating: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the original back in the 1980's and it was called house on sorority row and i think this one is better,more gory and pretty creepy,although not very original but it does have the look of a 1980's slasher flick.the sorority sister come off as snobby types.Carrie Fisher turns up as the house mother.kind of a far cry from her role in the first stars wars films.the plot is a little like i know what you did last summer.i don't think i ever seen a tire iron as a murder weapon before.as one of the girls says;a pimped out tire iron,with blades,Fred Krueger take notes.it is however a pretty good horror film,i enjoyed this almost as much as the much better one missed call.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous and silly...how do you screw up a typical slasher flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love slasher movies, I love horror movies, I love remakes and I love sequels no matter how campy and silly they are. So for film makers to essentially screw up the stereotypical slasher flick for me would be near impossible but they did it with Sorority Row, a remake that takes campy and stupid to the level of actually being campy and stupid and not the kind that is fun to watch...which does exist. Even seen Sleepaway Camp? Evil Dead? Nightmare on Elm Street 3+...I could go on. The movie starts with a good solid lead in, some gore and a twisted prank but then everything falls apart. Essentially the film takes hints from Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer...90's classics that changed the face of slasher flicks. But when a horror movie relies on gore, guts, nudity and a kick butt killer you really have to make sure you have those pieces in place. Something I believe kept Nightmare On Elm Street, Friday the 13th, and Halloween series going was the killings were always outrageous and over the top and creative and not one death, except maybe for the original prank, are creative in any way. They aren't even funny or campy.No one in the cast stands out so this is one of those movies where the cast can be lumped together in one great big pile. There isn't a "scream queen" and no strong hero or heroine to the film and that is a problem. The five sorority sisters did a crappy thing and now they are being picked off so you don't really want them to survive and you can't root for the psycho ghost killer so you're left watching evil taking vengeance on shallow, stupid kids. There needs to be one strong lead actor. The one shining point in the cast was having the amazing Carrie Fisher in a cameo as their house mother. That part of it was fun and seeing the royal Miss Fisher in the role was worthwhile. I understand she took the role as a favor to a family member? Not much wonder there.The film can be described in one word...vapid. Now some would say that every slasher/horror film is vapid but that isn't true. A good horror film can have plenty of depth and story and characters and despite the beginning Sorority Row has none of this. I think director Stewart Hendler is trying to set himself up in the horror genre but this doesn't help him any but it's mostly likely the script at fault in this case. How do you take the writer from Honey I Shrunk The Kids (The TV Series) and have him pen a college slasher flick? It just doesn't work. Some people are diverse but he needs practice. It's not the worst film I've ever seen...probably not the worst horror film I've ever seen but it's a steer clear unless you're a gluten for punishment. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that should haven't been revamp and it shows....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sorority Row" is the bland remake of 1983's "The House on Sorority Row",provided more laughs than screams,as five close sisters accidentally have their close friend murdered in a prank gone amiss and vow to keep it secret. And if you think that sounds corny and done-to-death,the sisters actually justify their actions by Theta Pi's motto "Trust,respect,honor,solidarity,secrecy." Quite convenient for the lead bimbo Jessica(Leah Pipes)whose desire to impress her boyfriend's senator father causes her to take her callous manipulation to the maximum.And Surprise,Surprise-this little plan comes back to haunt the sisters. It's idiocy all around with a mysterious murderer who starts it all by stabbing the supposedly dead body with a tire iron. How is that supposed to help at all? The moment-which was meant to be suspenseful and surprising-only makes the audience laugh at this bumbling wimp. Resting heavily on the concept of amoral sorostitutes who throw raging parties,take drugs,and have plastic surgery and act stuck up in public, "Sorority Row" fails to keep the opening scenes believable. But the fantasy-or every college boy's wet dream of seeing drunken sorority girls jumping on trampolines topless and smacking each other with pillows by telling you that crap like that only happens in stupid movies where characterization comes second to a convoluted plot with no believability. Like this piece of dung. After tossing the body of their beloved sister down a mine shaft,the remaining girls(one of whom played by Rumer Willis,the daughter of actor Bruce Willis)receiving a disturbing text message on graduation day which reveals someone is aware of their twisted sister. The plot unwinds from there and basically the audience can go by the numbers to exactly what happens next. The slut dies first and the mysterious black robe killer racks up bodies than the Asian girl beds frat boys,not to mention making out with the other sisters too.At least the house mother(Carrie Fisher,yes that Carrie Fisher of Star Wars....in a horror movie??? Who was behind the casting here???),provides humor to the predictable sorority jabs,but its not enough to save this plotlesss,scareless trip through clichés ans stereotypes. And one point the killer writes "Theta Pi must die" in blood on a wall. Its not that hard to agree,but this was a remake that should have been left alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Sorority Row because it looked like a great movie. They put a great trailer together and it looked like the movie had something to offer. Did it? No. You can pretty much skip the first 13 minutes of this movie because it is in the 3 minute trailer. This movie was dragged out, Certain parts of the movie became boring. They should have gotten more into the characters that would be alive at the end. They also make you want the girls to die. Most of the girls are annoying and there is not one part were you might actually not want the person being killed, to be killed. The reason i am giving it a 3 instead of a 1 is because the twist did surprise me but we never really got to know the character in the first place</fullReview>

This movie delivers in the horror department. Lots of brutal killings but not overdone like some recent horror movies. Another thing i liked was that it felt like the good old horror movies like Scream or I know what you did last summer. This movie shouldn't be taken seriously at all. There are some hilarious scenes and some cheesy scenes but this is one of the better "over the top" slasher flicks. The twist in the end was pretty good and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Again, not an Oscar contender but for a movie night and if your in the mood for some blood, check this out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of tight knit sorority sisters decide to play a prank, and as things usually go in these movies, everything goes horribly wrong when one of the sisters is killed. The sisters decide to cover up the killing and never speak of it again.Cut to a few months later, and the girls start getting mysterious text messages and warnings. Someone knows what they did. During the big end of the year graduation party, a cloaked killer starts offing the sisters, and their boyfriends, one by one.Unlike 2005's dreadful 'Black Christmas,' another sorority set slasher, this is a fun, fast paced, gory whodunit filled with well rounded (for a horror film) characters and some actual scares. 'Sorority Row' is one of the best slasher movies in over a decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swift and oddly likable slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8 months after the accidental death of their sorority sister, a group of sorority sisters are targeted by a serial killer.Stewart Hendler's picture is a blend of the hormonal versus the slasher. The sex versus the violence. And whilst recent pictures have blended similar ideologies together (Donkey Punch etc) this is still a highly likable picture.Beginning with your conventional teenage college party we see the camera flowing around in a big one cut opening sequence (impressive one to) as we see students demolishing their surroundings, couples getting frisky and even the odd brawl breaking out. Like the first series of Skins everything is spicy and elegant with colourful unknown protagonists.From Bruce Willis' daughter to Step Up 2 star Briana Evigan we see a collection of attractive personalities engage in a sorority gathering and when a sexual prank goes from bad to worse in the middle of nowhere we dive right into gritty drama.The dialogue in this sequence feels quite ordinary, as if plugged straight from any other horror. From the "What's happened" to "What are we going to do?" everything is samey but thankfully this particular sequence is saved through some wonderfully shot hand held camera motives. Flashes of panicked faces flash by in a whirlwind of emotional drama and incomprehensible circumstance and from there we have our horror.8 months pass by with no incident and as the biggest party of the year arrives, so does a masked guest who targets the sorority girls. Scream was and perhaps still is the first and best original slasher movie thanks to its creepy flinching motive and dark intertextuality to other horrors. This 2009 picture follows similar traits with its unidentifiable villain and modern comedy style. From Facebook jokes to appearance jibes, this stereotypes itself into the trend of modern cinema. If you're looking for a refreshing bite of horror with raw humour like Scream, look elsewhere.Not being too big on horror myself I ashamedly admit to flinching a few times but any big horror guru will not be unfazed by its frankly predictable justification of attacks. The humour is not on the scale of Scream or Scary Movie but modern culture gets a slap in the face with this collection of appearance, sex and party flicks.Acting wise Evigan steps up from her blank portrayal in her last outing and the leader of the girls Leah Pipes is cruel and as suave enough to manage the others, easily generating the most humour. And whilst Rumer Willis cries all the way through and Julian Morris fits the stereotype of aloof boyfriend, they all fit easily to the narrative.By far the best horror in the world, Sorority rows makes for a fun viewing with modern and current vibes of teenage angst and oppression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had Expectations for This Movie - and it Exceeded Them!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has enough frights &amp; thrills to make you jump multiple times, but it's not just that that makes the movie for me. What makes this film different from all of the recent mediocre horror films is that it is very much character and dialogue driven. The characters become as compelling as the plot itself and you actually find yourself starting to care about these characters. The dialogue shoots back and forth between the characters and further builds up the suspense until the final revelation. The suspense is very well drawn-out - it doesn't reveal the killer too early and it doesn't make you impatient for the end. The resulting finale is a big bang and not disappointing at all.The acting was also a cut above the rest - I didn't cringe at the lame screams or badly-acted terrified facial expressions because there weren't any. Kudos to all the girls because they gave performances beyond what I expected would be given.This movie doesn't deserve any awards, because it doesn't want any. Thinking about this movie is useless; if you want a movie that makes you think then go catch Inglorious Basterds. This film is meant to entertain, and entertain it did. It's what most horror films today should be. This movie has set a standard which all subsequent horror films (especially teen horrors) should follow.Just let yourself be drawn in instead of attempting to guess who the killer is and ruining the experience for yourself. If you just go in with a blank mind and just leave all you doubts at the door you will enjoy it as it is and not blame it for being what it's not afterwards. I hadn't watched the 1983 version before going in, but I have no doubt in my mind that this remake is at least as good as, if not better, than the original film. As a film, I give it a 7. But as a horror film, it definitely deserves an 8. I loved every moment of this movie. Completely worth my money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best slashers of 2009.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Sorority Row' is the best teen slasher flick since 90's hits 'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'. As a fan of the original 80's slasher (yes, this isn't a remake of I Know What You Did Last Summer!), I'm glad to say that this is one of the recent remakes that doesn't suck.The film tells the story about a group of Sorority girls, including Briana 'Step Up 2' Evigan, who accidentally kill one of their sisters in a prank gone awry. The girls ultimately decide the only way out of the situation is to dump the body. Bad idea? Yes, because the girls are stalked by a culprit in a graduation gown and killed one-by-one. Fans of slashers, such as myself, should get a kick out of this one. It's just a fun movie that ticks all the right boxes.The film was described as 'Mean Girls' meets 'Scream', and the description couldn't be any more spot on. Being a 90's kid, I was raised on 90's teen slashers, so it was great to take a blast to the past with Sorority Row. If like me you also enjoyed films such as 'Valentine' (2001) and other all-female slashers, then you should check this one out.The film is full of funny one-liners (*cough* Leah Pipes) and violent, bloody death sequences. I loved the actors, and the screenplay was funny, sexy and scary. The killers' outfit was also cool and the 'modified tire-iron' was a great weapon of choice. Throw in some nudity, great tunes, cattiness and Carrie Fisher wielding a shotgun (yes, you read that correctly).So, should you see Sorority Row or not? Well, if you are a horror fan who loathes most remakes and writes Sorority Row off as garbage before you see it - skip it. If you are a film snob - skip it. However, if you are a horror fan like me who can simply sit down for 100 minutes and watch a sexy cast be stalked and slaughtered by a menacing killer, then you should enjoy it!'Sorority Row' is definitely one of the best remakes and horrors of 2009, and the surprisingly good reviews are spot on. It aimed to be a fun slasher and it succeeded. It's, in my opinion, the best teen slasher since 'Scream' and 'IKYWLDS' and I loved every minute of it. Full marks for being one of the most fun slashers I've seen in years! 10/10.</fullReview>

And when I read that this was yet another remake of an older fright flick, I was ready to destroy it.Surprisingly, it proved to be lots of fun and the string of murders were amazing. What I liked in particular, besides the really excellent performance of the whole cast, was the terrific musical score b Ken Seng. The pounding music worked perfectly the hidden violence that explodes when you don't exp3ect it.Director Stewart Hendler moved things along smoothly and never let things lag. As an old timer, I just wonder if college is as wild as depicted in the movie since my glory day back in the early 60s were still in the Pat Boone and Doris Day style of living.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The daughters of Bruce Willis and Greg Evigan team up in Sorority Row, a remake of the 1983 Horror classic, The House on Sorority Row. The remake is of course modernized and takes the classic independent horror film to the next level, with terrific effects, increased levels of fright and gore, and of course a ton of beautiful people. Where is this college and how soon can I apply?! Every guy and girl featured in the film, with the exception of Carrie Fisher, could be models, despite being well passed the age of most college students. The story starts out much like the original film does, with a Sorority prank that goes horribly wrong. The girls decide to cover up the incident and put it behind them, but at a large cost to their sisterhood. A year later, at the same party, someone knows what happened last year, and have decided to make the whole Sorority pay for their crimes. This film is a classic 'who done it' mashed together with a slasher film, and the results are pure excitement. The truth is that most of these film don't have much in the way of a story line and the killer is obvious to everyone, but not this time. This film is very reminiscent of Scream, and it really had me on the edge of my seat. A good Horror film is hard enough to find, but one with all that suspense and a compelling story to follow, that's worth it's weight in gold! Sorority Row is a perfect choice for those who want to spend Halloween, in front of the TV watching a scary movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful slasher-horror remake fails at every conceivable level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have another remake of an 80s slasher-horror movie gone terribly wrong, like many horror remakes we have today. This horror flick follows, directed by Stephen Hendler, a group of Theta Pi sorority sisters who run from a party to pull a prank on one of their sisters' boyfriend who apparently cheated on her. Before too long, the prank goes horribly wrong when they accidentally kill her. In attempt to cover their tracks, the sisters wrap up her body and dump her down a well. A year goes by and the sisters' lives are in jeopardy when a cloaked killer begins stalking them and murdering them and their friends one by one. This film features a cast of Briana Evigan, Leah Pipes, Rumor Willis, Jamie Chung, Margo Harshman, Audrina Patridge, and Matt O'Leary.Out out all of the remakes of the 80s horror films, this one is definitely one of the worst. First case in point, this film shamelessly borrows clichés from nearly every slasher movie out there. Furthermore, the plot revolves around these college girls who are getting stalked by a killer after a murder they committed a year ago, which is roughly the same plot from I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997). Basically, this movie just copies from that movie. The characters are carelessly written and lack any sort of personality. The dialogue is terrible and, at times, quite laughable, especially during the climax scene towards the end. The climax is probably the worst part of the whole film as it hits you with a plot twist of who the killer is that makes no sense nor interest. By this time, the movie completely falls apart and stops making sense.Sorority Row is an example of how not to remake a horror movie. The script is bad, the characters are underdeveloped, and the entire plot is just unoriginal. Sure, it has the blood and gore and titillation that many slasher fans can appeal to. But sadly, it is enough to redeem the film. If you come across this movie anywhere like Netflix, you are better off skipping it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting saves this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have been a terrible movie. It could have turned into a comedy. But instead it was entertaining thriller. A group teenage flick is always going to be tricky to pull off, but the director, actors and film crew manage it here.I thought all of the young actors performed their parts well. This movie gives them a springboard to more mature roles.The script was proficient with several cheeky phrases added to the dialogue. Only a few locations were used which must have kept the production budget lower. The use of predominantly female protagonists and male antagonists made this a bit of a girl power movie, which is fine. Though at times it felt a little like a cross between a Scooby Doo horror story and an episode of Charlie's Angels.The single flaw with the movie is that it has to compete with so many other teenage mutilation flicks to grab attention. That has been a busy genre with other movies already setting the standard to attain. That makes it very difficult for Sorority Row to stand out, particularly without any proper ghouls.Good effort all round. Double the production budget would have produced double the entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>standard horror premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorority sisters Megan (Audrina Patridge) and Jessica (Leah Pipes) set up Megan's ex-boyfriend/Chugs' brother Garrett (Matt O'Leary) for revenge. They gather the other sisters Cassidy (Briana Evigan), Ellie (Rumer Willis), Claire (Jamie Chung), and Chugs (Margo Harshman) to pretend to dump Megan's body in a lake. The girls continue to pretend and Garrett stabs Megan in the chest to let the air out actually killing her. Jessica convinces the group to dump the body and the tire iron in a mine shaft. Cassidy disagrees so they wrap the body in her jacket. Eight months later, the girls are graduating. Cassidy barely tolerates Jessica and has Andy (Julian Morris) as her boyfriend. They all receive a picture of somebody holding the tire iron. Megan's younger sister Maggie (Caroline D'Amore) shows up. Then a hooded figure starts killing people with an implement shaped like a tire iron.The girls need time and space to set up the characters better. Leah Pipes does the mean girl very well and put herself above all the rest. Briana Evigan is functional as the lead heroine but she needs to be a better foil to Jessica. The other actresses can do no better than 2 dimensional cardboard cutouts. Rumer Willis is reasonable as the brainy geek. The premise is not that original but it has good potential as standard horror fare. It just never rises above being a weak B-movie. There are also way too many characters to keep track of and without better characterization, it's questionable why the audience should care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would love to watch a movie about men eating rats rather than this movie. It's not bog-standard; it's abomination. And the reasons why are many..The female cast : They are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO UGLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. None of them can be humanly watched. Their faces, their bodies, ahhhhhh seeing them hurts your eyes and soul ! The plot : Seriously, how many times did you see this known by heart plot before? (they should have called it "I Know What You Did Last Scream" !). And to make it worse, there is no renewal whatsoever. Even the wrong points are the same (like the weakness of the killer's motive). One of the parody's definitions is "any cultural practice which provides a relatively polemical allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice". Accordingly, this is not a horror, this is a parody, yet ? oh god ? without laughing (see the horror of it ?!).The performance : Hideous is what comes to my mind to describe the performance in this ordeal. I thought at the start that this is about different characters in one hot situation, but they were all the same all along !! Moreover, did you notice how all the lead actresses show their deepest fears when someone removes a shower's curtain, nevertheless they don't ever panic while seeing a new murdered boy or girl ???!!!The bore : During the first half, I was saying to myself "I saw all of this before". And during the second half, I was saying "would I live long enough to see this movie's end ?!". These are 2 kinds of bore. And this movie, proudly and foolishly, has them together ! The idiocy : If you think about the whole sequence of the house, you'll hate this movie, their makers, along with yourself. For instance, all hell breaks loose, one boy is slain, and one girl is killed by electricity, though a girl and a boy are still making love, and a girl ? at the attic ? is waiting naked for a boy to make love with her ??? The head of the sorority, played by Carrie Fisher, didn't pay attention to all of this bloody clamor which was going on for long, unless very very late ?! While the killer is finally killed, he falls right in the basement to see that it's on fire too (how come ??!!). And if you just shut down your brain, and surrender to this movie as a brainless fun, then, can you point out to me; WHERE THE HECK IS THE FUN OF IT ??!!The nudity : It was unnecessary, unsightly, and another source of agonizing this movie presented.The so-called surprising last shot : I was between "Huh?" and "Hahahahahaaaaaa" !So what could be right and watchable ? Well, the directing was capable of embodying tension visually good in some moments. This worked with using more than one camera to shoot the dialogs, shaking the cameras in rarely into-the-point and no exaggerated way, plus using the reflections of the flames on the cast's faces during the end; which was artistically done. The dialog's lines proved some wiliness and efficiency ("Silicon floats", "When I buy a book, I read the last page, because I don't like surprises"). Along with Sorority Row, (2009) had long list of horror remakes like : Friday the 13th, The Stepfather, My Bloody Valentine, Don't Look in the Basement!, The Last House on the Left (they don't even name them differently !!). Though, I won't whine about the grossness of the remakes, sequels, prequels, spin-offs in the American cinema lately, this time I whine about one of them. Sorority Row isn't a remake of The House on Sorority Row (1983), however a remake of endless queue of easy slasher movies, with nothing fresh or amusing, to eventually be a perfect example of a movie with no originality nor entertainment !Sorority Row is repeated, predicable, too long, stupid, and has nothing to offer. I was imagining Tim Burton, Oliver Stone, or Quentin Tarantino doing the same stuff, it would have been at least less cheesy and more interesting. But No. Hollywood simply insists on recycling vomit, time after time, effortlessly. At one point in the movie, a girl who recently threw up, asks a boy to kiss her, and he loathes her; doesn't this remind you of something ?! As for me, his reaction powerfully reminds me with myself while the viewing...men eating rats is definitely better; at least it's new !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's almost nothing here to recommend it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this movie might sound interesting on paper, the execution is, well, not especially interesting. If the killers look familiar to you, that's because it borrows from the Scream series. And there's a little "I Know What You Did Last Summer" thrown in as well. Only differences are that the metal hook here is a cross, instead of a pirate hook. And nobody gets run over. But this movie doesn't do those films any justice. In fact, it doesn't do itself any justice. These sorority sisters are one-dimensional, and there's no reason to care about them, individually, or as a group. Sure, you have a bitchy sorority sister, but is there a point to it? The film doesn't even try to be interesting, at least not until the final sequence, which did engage me. If only the rest of the film were just as good. Carrie Fisher appears in what seems like a throwaway role. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good until we find out who the killer is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the movie was pretty good, but my decision immediately changed at the end.The killer is always wearing a hood, so we only find out who the killer is at the end, so it's a mix between a mystery and a horror movie. When this mix is used, we are usually told to make the killer very unexpected, but after watching this movie, we learn it can be overdone.---Spoiler--- It is good to make the killer unexpected, but when the killer is not even a main character, we know we have a problem. Of course this worked out well in Friday the 13th, but it doesn't work in this case. Why? Because of the setup. Setup is everything. The creators of the movie thought it would be a good idea to make the killer some random guy who is barely mentioned in the movie, and HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY. Why should he even care about Megan's death? He wasn't there, some of us even forget he exists. Maybe if the creators developed on his character a little more (or a lot more) it might have worked out.--End Spoiler--- So overall, the movie was terribly ruined at the end, but other than that the kills were pretty good, and the signature weapon (tire-iron) was well thought out. Too bad it turned out a crummy mystery movie, which contained a mystery that shouldn't have been solved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Predictability Is Laughable, But The Kills Are Decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always interested in a good slasher with creative kills. Afterall, besides the kills, most slashers are standard retread fare. Sorority Row is no different. It is extremely predictable and carries every cliché presented by nearly every slasher before it. The ending is particularly laughable, with the killers motive being a pretty stupid reason for killing everyone and way out of character. Admittedly, it is pretty unpredictable, but unpredictable for a reason. Surprisingly, the performances, while also clichéd, are pretty good. It was one of the things that I didn't have a big problem with. But, what I like about the film was little. Not so much that it's a terrible film, just a dull one. The kills are somewhat decent, with the killers weapon being a gnarly mutation of a tire iron and a kill involving a wine bottle that made me squirm. But, I thought that the kills could have been a little more creative. There was also a surprising amount of downtime involving a lot of partying and boring stuff no one cared about. For a movie nearly two hours long, I expected the body count to be a lot higher. For the most part, this film has gone unnoticed, and for good reason. In a time where good horror films are lacking, Sorority Row adds absolutely zero to the mix, with the exception of the creative weapon. But, if you're looking to kill some time (no pun intended), then Sorority Row could be your horror fix, just don't expect much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first word that comes to mind when I think of Sorority row is Juvanaille. Not just because it uses every cliché in the slasher genre, but because it has the look of a University production. The picture is grainy, numerous shots have lens flair, and even more shots are way out of focus. The numerous extras, pyrotechnics and elaborately staged party scenes, do hint however, that the project had resources, but in the end it all comes down to the story. The material has been regurgitated so many times in the genre that Sorority Row almost works as a satire. You can see every shock coming a mile away, which makes you laugh just waiting for it. You might be surprised to find yourself getting a kick out of this flick. I've Definitely seen worse that is for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Got this one from Redbox cuz I was looking for something mindless to watch-and I figured it'd also have a few decent sets of tits in it. I was right on both counts.&nbsp;A group of sorority sisters cover up the accidental murder of one of their own when a prank goes wrong. 8 months later a killer who apparently knows the truth comes hunting the remaining sisters down and a few others who get in the way...SORORITY ROW is another in a long line of forgettable teenager-targeted slasher films. That's not to say that it's terrible-but it's definitely not bringing anything new or interesting to the table. Although not a gore-fest, there are some reasonably inventive and bloody kills. The acting is what you would expect from something of this nature. The one particularly bitchy 'sister' does a decent job, as well as the chick who looks like Winnie from The Wonder Years as the dead girl's sister, and Carrie Fisher as the house-mother is fun in her few scenes too-everyone else is average for this type of film acting-wise, but there's a few good sets of tits on display...always a plus. Personally, I think the swiss-army-tire- iron was pretty ridiculous as a murder-weapon, but whatever. Again, nothing new in terms of original content (the 'big reveal' is pretty anti-climactic)-and the comparisons to I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER mixed with MEAN GIRLS are dead-on. I've never seen the original film that this was based on to form a comparison...but if you're in the mood for a silly, fast-paced teen slasher-I guess you could do worse...5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone going to Sorority Row with any expectations other than fun thrills and kills is sure to be disappointed. BUT this one surprised me. From the very beginning with a cool opening credit sequence, slowly panning through a party, it's a hoot all the way. There isn't a heck of a lot new here, slashers tend to cover familiar territory to give the audience a chance to feel superior in their accumulated knowledge of the genre: Everyone is attractive. Check. Plenty of humor. Check. Graphic violence, clearly seen. Check. An older familiar actress as the house mother. Double check. Twists that might be figured out, but might not. Check. After seeing the ridiculous and unnecessary Halloween II, this stands out as a fresh offering for horror fans. I hope it does well, it deserves to take it's place among the "Pretty Young Girls In Peril" category.</fullReview>

And killings that will satisfy everybody. It did remind me of movies like The Faculty, Scream and I Know What You Did...It can easily be watched by the geeks and by the beginners of the horror scene. I can imagine that people will jump out of their seats. Or will have some moments by turning their face away. Sometimes it's funny and sometimes it becomes a little bit gory but to say that it is the best horror since scream as the producers said, that I wouldn't agree.

The prank goes wrong and one of the girls is killed. They all vow never to say anything about what happened. Several months later it appears their dead and buried sister is back and getting revenge, killing anyone who knew what happened. Say what you will this film really works. It doesn't try to be anything other than what it is and it works. I liked it. Hell any movie with Carrie Fisher as a shot gun toting house mother take charge and kicking ass is alright in my books.

		<fullReview>Over-all I liked the movie. But when it came to the killer the story fell flat, who was this killer? Why was he following those sorority girls? It may have been Garrett, but we never really get the chance to find out. Even in Friday the 13th we found out that it was Jason that was killing everyone. I found that the director used very typical scary movie tactics, like when Chugs (Margo Harshman) was in the bathroom at her therapists and she shuts the medicine cabinet. I've seen that too many times to count that now it's just not scary. Or when Ellie (Rumer Willis) goes down in the basement and someone unexpected (like a good person) shows up from the dark. So not scary anymore.I thought that Jessica (Leah Pipes) was manipulative and self-centered. Considering I love the actor that plays Cassidy (Briana Evigan) I completely biased on her character but I thought that she was the only one in the whole group of those sorority sisters that had morals. I'm wondering where Chugs went after her visit to her therapist? The movie did say a lot about sorority's. Although I am not in one myself I know people that are and they agreed it was pretty damn close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sharp Slasher Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A prank gone wrong in "Whisper" director Stewart Hendler's "Sorority Row," an unsavory, sometimes savage, but smirking R-rated remake of the vintage 1983 slasher "The House on Sorority Row," sets off a succession of sadistic slayings. "Good Luck Chuck" scenarist Josh Stolberg and TV writer Peter Goldfinger have adapted and updated Mark Rosman's screenplay about blood, gore, and babes and supplemented the savagery with sardonic "Heathers" humor. Not only has Hendler orchestrated the butchery and bitchery with style but he has also conjured up an atmospheric slash-a-thon that delivers several shocks and surprises. These gals and guys aren't as idiotic as the usual slasher movie victims. Indeed, more than one girl survives."Quarantine" lenser Ken Sing enhances the grisly quality of this mass murderer melodrama with his grainy, raw-edged widescreen cinematography and he wobbles his camera to heighten the suspense. At the same time, editor Elliot Greenberg carves up the action with such rhythm that each jolt delivers stop-in-your-tracks impact. You'll jump at most of these bolts from the black, especially the sound effects of sharp objects either penetrating or caroming off bodies. Little of this would register were it not for superb sound engineering. The ensemble cast that includes Briana Evigan, Leah Pipes, Rumer Willis, and Jamie Chung constitute all the pretty maids in this "Row" that the mysterious slayer sets out to slay. This mass murderer doesn't discriminate when it comes to killing, even innocent bystanders succumb to the villain's pimped out four-way tire iron weapon. The worst thing that you can say about "Sorority Row" is that the fire department takes their own sweet time responding to the fiery finale. Of course, if they had arrived earlier, they'd have interfered with the showdown between the killer and victims. Nevertheless, the last quarter hour serves up thrills and chills that pay off with a clever ending that likely may yield a sequel.The action unfolds at a bacchanal off campus at a sorority house. Five mischievous wenches of the sorority Theta Pi decide to humiliate a guy, Garrett (Matt O'Leary of "Brick"), who has cheated on his girlfriend with the prank to end all pranks. They have supplied Garrett with what he believes are roofies, and he has dosed Megan (Audrina Patridge of "Into the Blue 2") with them so that she appears to have passed out. She awakens as Garrett is about to take advantage of her and then apparently dies while her devoted sisters gaze on in horror. The queen bee of the bunch, Jessica (Leah Pipes of "Fingerprints"), knows that Megan is playing possum. Jessica, Cassidy (Briana Evigan of "Step Up 2: The Streets"), Claire (Jamie Chung of "Dragonball: Evolution") and Ellie (Rumer Willis of "Wild Cherry") pile into a van with Megan's limp body and a distraught Garrett. They head off to a mine in the middle of nowhere. Once they arrive, Jessica suggests that they hack the body up into pieces so it will be harder for anybody to find. Meanwhile, Megan records the scene with her cell phone. The girls spread out to collect rocks while Garrett empties his stomach on the ground. He musters his nerve and seizes a four-way tire iron from the van. When nobody is watching him, he sinks one end of it into Megan's chest before anybody can stop him. The horrified girls close ranks in the name of 'sisterhood and solidarity' and cover up the crime. Unceremoniously, they dump Megan's bloody body into an abandoned well.Eight months later, at a graduation reception at the Theta Pi house, one of the girls in on the conspiracy, Ellie, shrieks when she thinks that she has seen the dead girl Megan walking among them. In fact, Ellie saw Megan's younger sister Maggie (Caroline D'Amore of "Daydreamer") who is visiting the sorority. The girls plan to celebrate another bacchanalian revelry that evening once their crusty house mother, Mrs. Crenshaw (Carrie Fisher of the first "Star Wars" trilogy) vacates the premises. Meantime, the mysterious killer dons a "Scream" monk's robe with hood and wields a four-way tire iron modified with other forms of cutlery. This weapon compares favorably to the weapons that other serial killers in slasher movies have armed themselves with over the years. This cunning individual follows Chugs (Margo Harshman of "Fired Up") to her shrink's office where she plans to score prescription drugs after she performs oral sex on the crooked physician. When Chugs isn't looking, the killer sends his exotic weapon spinning through the air tomahawk style so it lodges in the good doctor's forehead. The killer sneaks up on Chugs while she is lying on her back with an expensive bottle of liquor in her lips and shoves a bottle down her throat and then shatters it. Another girl has a spear run through her mouth pinning her head to a wall. Yet another dies from a flare gun cartridge that melts in her mouth and turns her face into bubble wrap.Leah Pipes takes the cake as the nastiest sister of the bunch, while Briana Evigan qualifies as the nicest. She is the one who wanted to call the authorities while the others bundled Megan up in Cassidy's coat and tossed her in the well. Meanwhile, elderly Carrie Fisher has a couple of scenes as the cantankerous Theta Pi house mother, but she cannot hit the side of barn with a pump action shotgun. The writers throw in a couple of red herrings to keep us guessing about the identity of the killer. The cast is persuasive even when the action is not. There is a whole lot of stabbing going on along with irresponsible drinking and bare breasted babes in a shower scene. In the original "House on Sorority Row," seven girls covered up the crime while only five try to here. "Sorority Row" is a good slasher movie that is worth watching more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a really good horror/slasher film. As I watched this, I was reminded of the classic slasher films of the 80's and 90's! I loved the killer's outfit, it was really creepy and I loved the pimped out lug wrench that the killer uses. Rumer Willis did an awesome job as Ellie, and was the only girl I wanted to survive. At a party held at the Theta Pi house, Jessica, Cassidy, Ellie, Claire, Chugs and Megan play a prank on Megan's boyfriend, Garrett. When the prank goes too far, Megan ends up dead and the girls throw her body in an old mineshaft, and swear never to speak of it again.Eight months later on graduation day, someone wearing a black hooded robe comes to kill off all the girls who knew one at a time. During the graduation party is when things really begin to cook. Could it be Megan coming back for revenge? Or someone who can't live with the secret anymore? I highly recommend SORORITY ROW!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yep, I know, I'm in trouble here. I have no idea how it happened but I just ended up really enjoying this movie and I stand by my rating despite the reaction it may cause for some. It's yet another remake (of a movie I have, once again, yet to see), it's directed by someone I've never heard of (Stewart Hendler may have his fans but I'm betting there are a lot of people who are just as ignorant as I am about his previous work) and stars a bunch of attractive, young women (including Rumer Willis). And I STILL enjoyed it. Okay, the last point was a plus anyway but I was really not expecting to watch anything more than a tolerable, glossy slasher movie.I suppose it IS a glossy slasher movie but Sorority Row also benefits greatly from a really enjoyable, if well-covered, strand of nastiness that pops up every now and again. It actually surprised me on a few occasions with just what was being shown on screen and that, to me, is a good thing.The central premise is a well-worn genre staple: it's the prank that goes horribly wrong and that everyone tries to cover up and forget until some time later . . . . . when a mysterious figure starts reminding the group of just what they did. Think I Know What You Did Last Summer without the poor acting of Jennifer Love Hewitt and you've pretty much got it. Things start off as a bit unnerving and menacing before quickly becoming very, very deadly for all involved.The cast are all okay, everyone fits into their given role although nobody really stands out (with the exception of the underused Carrie Fisher in a small, fun role) and the sketched characterisations of the different girls may be thin but are also just enough for you to identify with each one and to root for their survival or demise depending on how they're portrayed.Like any decent slasher movie there are plenty of red herrings until we find out who is actually getting rid of the girls, a few half-decent twists and some "good" death scenes. I'm sure that there are some people who were against this film ever since it was announced as being in development but anyone who prejudges without giving it a go MAY find that they've missed out on a surprisingly decent modern slasher movie, a rare thing from the sanitised world of mainstream Americana.See this if you like: Valentine, Scream 2, Black Christmas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a lover of horror films, particularly slashers, and what I love about them is generally is how fun and stupid they are along with the gore. As of late, I've been disappointed by most of the movies that have promised good old bloody fun and creative deaths. They've been lacking. This movie was expected to be the same but it pleasantly surprised me. The deaths were fun, making me giggle with delight from the first death until the end. The cast did spectacularly well considering it's a slasher, they were believable and portrayed each character as I would expect them to be. Some of the lines were cheesy but they were fun cheesy. We figured out who the killer was but that's cause we've seen way too many movies. If you go into this expecting something dark and frightening... well, you're going to be disappointed. It's not that kind of movie. However, if you go in with the expectation that this is going to be a fun movie with lots of blood and boobs, you'll have fun. Will be owning this one when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I live in the UK and our film board is very strict on their film ratings. If you have read the trivia section on this page you may have read they dropped the rating to 15 after a lot of persuasion.I'm a frequent cinema goer and saw the trailer to this whilst watching final destination 4. I thought this was going to be a chick flick until i saw the 50 crazy bi*&amp;(^hes bit. That totally blew me away and made me purchase the ticket to this a week later when it released. But i do have to say i was surprised.I walked in thinking this film was going to be a lot of drunk girls with their boobs out getting laid and was pleasantly pleased that boobs were shown only for a 2 minute scene. The deaths of the characters were surreal and surpassed "The final destination" in realism also. The plot is not original but with a strong cast they pulled it off. Briana Evigan, Margo Harshman, Rumer Willis, Leah Pipes, all deserve credit as their bitchiness put this film in one of the greats of this year. Many of the actresses have moved from being a little innocent girl to freaky drunken sorority sister. One of these is Margo Harshman who was only a few years ago running after Shia LeBeouf in Even Stevens. Gathering momentum and becoming the biggest 'sister' in this film. She delivered a masterpiece performance in her small on screen part including freaking out a potential 'partner'.I thought the studio managed to pull it off pretty well gathering that a lot of box office smashers are coming out in these coming months.If anyone has not seen this it is a must see and definitely earns it's place in the classic cabinet along side a few others. It exceeded my expectations and ....can't wait for number 2. I hope they bring back the last 3 remaining as their last shot in the film was hot!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of sorority sisters organize a prank where one of them hooks up with a guy, who is the brother of one of the other sisters. She pretends to be on a date rape drug and eventually plays dead to freak the guy out. They all drive off to a mine to decide what to do with the "body"- whether to cut it up or dump it whole. At that point the guy decides to take matters into his own hand and with a tire iron stabs the girl dead- for real. Of course at that point he finds out she wasn't dead at first. Now the group has to really decide what to do. Some want to call the police others are worried about their future- they are about to graduate college. A girl named Jessica takes the lead and decides to dump the body and the weapon down a mineshaft.Months later during graduation day, they start getting calls from the dead girl's phone with pictures, videos of what happened and threats. All of this is made clear in the preview. Eventually some girls start dying gruesome deaths. It's graduation party night- off course! Part of our group is a girl named Chugs (?) who will sleep with anyone and is also hooked on pills and who knows what else. Claire is an Asian girl who doesn't do much of anything. Ellie is the shy nerdy girl who just panics about everything. Cassidy who is supposed to be the lead is the girl with the heart of gold and has a perfect boyfriend- the valedictorian. Jessica is the manipulative one, only interested in herself, who is about to marry the son of an old senator. At some point the real sister of the dead girl shows up at the party and she also wants to rush that same sorority.It all ends with some twists and surprises and the obligatory fire with our surviving heroines confronting the killer.Our villain is hooded and has a tire iron-like weapon with knives sticking out that he uses to kill most of his victims. But little else is known about the killer. In fact, we never follow the killer at all. The action is centered on the girls 100% of the time.One thing one notices about these sorority girls is that they are an unattractive bunch with the exception of Jessica. Some of the extras are attractive. Jessica, however, is stunning although at times she looks much older than a college girl, but you're also supposed to hate her. So, in typical Hollywood fashion, they cast a gorgeous blonde with blue/grey eyes to play the evil girl. Leah Pipes, who plays Jessica also gives the best performance- by far. And if you're wondering who the killer might be, just look for the attractive people- that's becoming the standard way of Hollywood whodunits of recent times- predictable politics.The movie is well directed but fails at engaging the audience. The villain is weak- again we never follow the killer. The motivations at the end are rather silly. There is no strong lead character. Cassidy is nice but not interesting. Jessica is interesting but mean. The men in this movie are either horny drunks or complete jerks. The death scenes are effective but rather mild and there certainly isn't any gore. Most of it is filmed- as always with horror- at night, in the rain, and things aren't clear to see. What is good is the dialogue. It does seem real and it's funny at times. The girls are also allowed to act with facial expression and the interaction among them is entertaining. But when all is said and done, this movie is rather forgettable. Very little stands out aside from Leah Pipes's looks and her performance. There are some quick scenes of nudity here and there. This movie is a good example of what happens when political correctness constrains your film-making. In the end all you have is a very average movie that has little noteworthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Awesome Slasher!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a really good horror/slasher film. As I watched this, I was reminded of the classic slasher films of the 80's and 90's! I loved the killer's outfit, it was really creepy and I loved the pimped out lug wrench that the killer uses. Rumer Willis did an awesome job as Ellie, and was the only girl I cared about. At a party held at the Theta Pi house, Jessica, Cassidy, Ellie, Claire, Chugs and Megan play a prank on Megan's boyfriend, Garrett. When the prank goes too far, Megan ends up dead and the girls throw her body in an old mineshaft, and swear never to speak of it again.Eight months later on graduation day, someone wearing a black hooded robe comes to kill off all the girls who knew one at a time. During the graduation party is when things really begin to cook. Could it be Megan coming back for revenge? Or someone who can't live with the secret anymore? I highly recommend SORORITY ROW!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A completely unoriginal horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of Sorority Row is very similar to I Know What You Did Last Summer. It involves Sorority girls who plan a prank that accidentally results in the death of one of their sisters. Now, it's 8 months later and they're still living with that secret. All of a sudden, after graduation, everyone that knows about the secret is being killed off one by one. It is important to understand that this isn't a ripoff of I Know What You Did Last Summer, but yet another remake. The original film is The House on Sorority Row from 1983. Horror movies these days can never be original because the studios know that there are unless remakes that could be made and they will be successful. This is another bad one.The acting in the movie is very bad and that goes for the dialogue as well. I actually counted 15 references to Facebook. Anyway, I just couldn't care for any of the characters. At a certain point, I was just waiting for the next one to die, hoping that there would be some creativity in the deaths. There was probably only one truly disturbing death involving a bottle of vodka that I won't be spoiling in this review because it's probably the most entertaining part of the whole film.The twist was also very disappointing and didn't make any sense. It was just very predictable that they would take it in that direction.I'm going to give Sorority Row a 3/10. If you're a fan of nudity and don't care so much for decent acting and dialogue, then you may like it. If you care, then it's best to just stay away from this trash. There really isn't much good about Sorority Row.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a Horror-fan, this saddens me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few months ago, I was looking through movies that were to come out, and finding out which ones looked like ones that I'd be really excited to watch. This was on the top of that list. This film, especially from a males perspective, has everything a horror-fan could want: a REALLY good plot idea, from a clip I saw: good deaths, hot women and from the trailer I watched; seemingly good cinematography.Oh, how I couldn't be more wrong. This film has quite easily proved just how BAD remakes are. Before I watched this, I always stuck up for it when people would say how much of a rip-off from other films it was, as it was a remake itself. And you know what? I Know What You Did Last Summer was BETTER than this.My main criticism goes to whoever wrote the script, because the speech in this film was the worst I've ever heard. The girls were so unbelievable and yet attempted stereotypes (one nerd, one stuck-up-bitch, one person that had a 'good heart', etc.). It was just REALLY bad. To be honest, there was only one believable character in this film, and she died at the beginning, giving the only imaginative death in the entire film.When reading the reviews, I didn't really care how good or bad they were, I KNEW I was going to see this film, and to be honest, I'm glad I did so I can tell the rest of my friends not to bother with it. Worst ever use of a good plot.2/10 for the bottle-scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were to compare Sorority Row to any other movies, I'd say it had the sharp bitchy dialogue of Clueless or Heathers, the almost satirical horror styling of Scream and all the clichés of any 80's slasher film. Sorority Row is not going to win any awards and I have no doubts that some people will write this movie off as yet another trashy remake. However, if you take the film for what it is, you'll probably thoroughly enjoy its entertaining characters and dialogue, fun and inventive kills and great soundtrack. Despite its clichéd 80's slasher-style plot, it kept me guessing until the final scene with relentless twists and turns. Sorority Row knows it's silly, it's not intended to be a serious or thought provoking horror film; it's fast-paced, funny and frightful. While it won't scare you out of your seat, it does offer a few jumpy moments; perhaps it's only flaw is that it's almost too witty to be truly scary.Other highlights include the well cast sorority sisters of theta pi and their feisty house mother, Carrie Fisher (Star Wars). Briana Evigan, Leah Pipes and Caroline D'Amore offer some brilliantly bitchy performances while Rumer Willis comes across as slightly whiny and mildly irritating. The film focuses on characterisation more so than your typical slasher film which serves to reduce predictability of the death count and allows the viewer to adjust to the subtle comic tone of the movie. The soundtrack and score are interwoven surprisingly well with some great party tunes evolving expertly into some typical but appropriate horror suspense themes.Sorority Row will be ridiculed by many, but if you take it for what it is ? a fun thrill ride of a slasher film with a great sense of humour and some very witty characters, you may just enjoy yourself.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood, Boobs and Boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from watching this, and as with the majority of Hollywood remakes I've seen of late I must say I am quite disappointed. Before I take cheap shots at this film , I am a fan of all cinema, including but not limited to slasher films. All I ask is a devotion to its audience and to this "Sorority Row" does not comply.People seem to think the combination of "boobs 'n' blood" (Can't believe I was able to fit that into a review :P) will win over even the hardest of critics. With the audience that I watched this with, I found it not to be true. The almost O.C.D. necessity of nudity and cleavage was O.T.T (Acronyms FTW). Yes slasher films need chicks and I'm not slating this, but when it becomes the main focal point of the film something has gone horribly wrong.To be honest the only area in which the film didn't follow the "wash rinse repeat" tutorial of making a horror movie, was when a character looked in the mirror and *to everyones surprise the killer wasn't there.**insert sarcastic over-tones* also * indicates sarcasmI have heard people referencing "Mean Girls" crossed with "Scream" when explaining this film to me, professing this as the most valid comparison. I would agree with this to the extent that:It's set around the concept of collage girls The girl's are stupidly spiteful and spitefully stupid. And finally the killer wears a hood/cloak combo. Also (Oooo and at one point there are many people in hoods), *Oh the jeopardy*Now to the death's, this is why we go to see this kind of film; blood and a cocktail of mutilated bodies. Alright... I may have been tainted by the ever so slightly diverse deaths of the "Saw" collection; but I feel the need for more than just variations of the "insert knife here" collection that "Sorority Row" has to offer; Or in its case, *insert tyre iron here*. (Well it made me laugh)But I'll be fair, (*yeah right*), this is no ordinary tyre iron, it has been pimped. (Pimped, yeah thats right, I said it, by the end of the week I'll be a G). But since all the ends are pretty much pointy/cutting attachments, you could rewind a death and watch it again and you wouldn't be missing anything.This brings me to another short but needed point. When characters don't have enough depth to even remember their name, then who cares if they die. Yes its a slasher flick but come on.Overall I have only ever been so disappointed once before and I doubt any film will be able to beat the abomination that is "Donkey Punch"; but my hatred for that will be dished out at a later date. To put it bluntly, by the end of the film the characters had irritated me so much I just wanted them all to die, at least that way I would be safe in the knowledge there would be no sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It definitely surprised me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know going into "Sorority Row" I wasn't expecting truly a whole lot, if anything. Because, although I knew it would be nothing I'd give a 1 rating too, somewhere inside me was ready to feel that feeling of infuriation. I mean coming into this one is kind of already expecting it to be a good for nothing movie with just an excuse to find ways to kill people and to have girls take of their tops, and for their to be a parade of unlikable people who you could care less if they lived. What I ended up getting, actually surprised me. I guess it's kind of redundant too say that "Sorority Row" isn't all those things I just mentioned, because it may be at some points, but in my opinion they handle it in a classier way than most if not all of the movies wouldn't even dream of going. For example there were many scenes where a sexual tension built up, but that all that happened. I really appreciated that fact. Also I must say it was kind of original, I mean sure they don't provide us with anything ENTIRLEY new, but at times it feels fresher. The characters, the moment I saw them I expected them to be the most annoying, under-written, horribly conceived, badly acted, and unlikable characters ever, they really wern't. I mean sure some of them may have been a little stereotypical at times, some of them may have been just like the girls in every slasher movie from the last 15 years, but the dialog is actually handled in a very witty way. This movie has a sense of humor, and I'm glad it did, otherwise I wouldn't have liked it as much. I mean sure if you've seen the movie I'll admit the humor(although I admire it) can be a bit out of it's league for scenes that didn't call for it. However when it's okay to have it, they use it, and it works well. I mean I'm just a sucker for a good sarcastic line, and "Sorority Row" definitely delivers that for me. Next the killings were actually really cool, and fits the slasher tone well. I also felt the film was very well paced, when it started (because they do jump into the story pretty much immediately) I feared that after-wards it would become mellow dramatic nonsense. Mellowdramatic, maybe, entertaining, most definitely. I will say that "Sorority Row" maybe should have given itself a little more credit in some scenes that were a bit sloppy joe, and I think the actresses(although they do a fine job) maybe should have all stayed on the same level of fear. Because in many scenes it's like they're not even scarred or sad yet Rumor Willis' character(who although IS suppose to be like she plays) kind of looks a little dumb, and over the top mellow dramatic. I also didn't particularly care for the ending, I didn't think it was well thought out, and it seems rushed. Plus they killed one certain character whom I didn't want to die, and who went out WAY too easy. I also think it should have had a really good chase scene, and I think the killer should have been a little more active and physical. I mean it's like okay we get it that you need to remain, for the first half, mysterious, but okay now were getting to the main climax come out of the shadows! Again on the VERY end, was it THAT necessary. If you've seen it you'll know what I'm talking about, if you haven't and are going too see it, you'll see what I mean. Overall although "Sorority Row" does have it's fair share of flaws, it's actually not that bad at all. I expect it to not do so well, but I'm just saying out of the recent remake wave that's been happening this one was actually kind of above average. I won't say that as a remake it's great (although I'll admit I've never seen the original), I just think as a stand-alone horror film one would get some enjoyment. Even though the movie may look dull, I actually had a fun time watching "Sorority Row". 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mean Girls meets Black Christmas with a mix of I Know What You Did Last Summer, it's a bloody good time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know what's so strange? Even though I had wanted to see this movie, I was expecting it to be bad, from the trailer, you just knew it was going to be stupid. I still was curious to what it was going to be like and I possibly had one of the best times in a theater watching this movie. I think because we've had so many of these slasher films that everything is so clichéd and you know what to expect, this was a way of doing all that but keeping it fast paced. It poked fun at itself and gave exactly what it should have to it's audience. Not to mention this has possibly one of my new most favorite characters of all time, Jessica. This girl is the ultimate nasty mean b-tch that you know should be killed, but I didn't want her too, she was awesome and hilarious. She led the group and had great charisma. The only character they could've done without or just put in a different actress was Ellie, the nerdy girl of the group played by Rumer Willis, this girl gets on my nerves because I think she's mainly trying to get famous off of her parent's name. But the story while predictable was still a lot of fun.Run by Mrs. Crenshaw the college sorority Theta Pi is home to seniors and best friends Jessica, Cassidy, Ellie, Claire, Chugs and Megan who, despite Mrs. Crenshaw's best efforts, constantly throw wild parties. During one of these parties Megan discovers her boyfriend Garrett is cheating on her and, with her friends' help, decides to pull a prank on him as payback, faking her own death while making out with Garrett. With help from the sisters Garrett brings Megan to a steel mill, the girls start joking by saying they need to dismember the body, Garrett then stabs Megan with a lug wrench, actually killing her. Panicking, the group dumps Megan's body in an old mineshaft, vowing never to speak of the events that transpired ever again. Eight months later, during the party held after graduation, the girls all receive a picture sent to their phones: a hooded figure holding the bloody wrench Garret used to kill Megan. Jessica takes lead and insists it is merely a prank and they continue with the party. But a hooded killer appears killing off each of the girls involved one by one.Sorority Row doesn't have likable characters at all and that's why I liked it I think, because it didn't take itself so seriously, we know these girls deserve everything they get after throwing their friend into a ditch without giving her family the proper grief and closure of knowing that their daughter died. Plus that tire iron is possibly the coolest weapon we've seen in a while, it has a blade on one end and I think a bottle opener on the other, lol, OK, just joking. But the kills were cool, the dialog was hilarious, and the characters were awesomely mean and nasty. This was a fast paced action slasher movie that I'm sure in some way will be a cult classic down the line, like those 80's films, I'm sure Sorority Row will have the same reaction. Anyone who didn't have a little fun watching this movie, I feel sorry for you.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best slashers in a very long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you watch a slasher film, what is it you expect? Girls dressed in very little being chased around, a killer, an inventive weapon that slices and dices up the brainless teenagers, a narrow plot with very little investment into background, characters or events? With Sorority Row, all of the above comes true. Except this time around, things are much better. Sorority Row does the unthinkable and actually gives the characters some real personalities, albeit in a very stereotypical way. There are archetypal characters within this film such as the main girl, the bitch, the geek, the tart and the loyal friend. But each character is likable in their own way, believable and you often care what happens to each of them. The acting is the strongest point in this film. Briana Evigan who plays Cassidy (The main girl) is fairly strong in the main girl role; she is highly attractive, likable and even though she isn't the most skilled actress, she more than certainly holds her own in this film. Margo Harshman who plays Chugs (The tart) is downright hilarious in her role as she gets up to mischief, coming out with some funny moments such as when she reveals she has vomited just before kissing a guy. Its a shame that her acting is limited by the short tenure of her character. Jamie Chung shows real charisma as Claire (The loyal friend). Whilst Claire is probably the most generic of the characters, Chung plays her in such a way that you genuinely feel sorry for her throughout the film, especially in the jacuzzi bubbles scene. And while her screaming becomes very irritating at one point, Rumer Willis who plays Ellie (The Geek) shows some real fire in her role and plays the sweet, innocent geeky character. But there are two special standouts. Leah Pipes as Jessica (The bitch), steals the show with her put downs, catty stares and fabulous character. Without Pipes, this film would not be the same. Pipes is by far the VIP within this film and draws out the best of anyone she is in a scene with. The one let down in this film, cast wise however is Caroline D'Amore who plays Maggie. She has no charisma, is weak in her line delivery and comes across as irritating more than anything else in her role. During the fire scenes at the end of the film, it becomes clear that you only want her to perish. It isn't helped by weak dialogue for her character. Overall, Sorority Row is an amazing film, with some minor flaws. and any fan of such a genre should definitely take some time to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Horror Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror-comedy Sorority Row -- which is based on Mark Rosman's original screenplay Seven Sisters and the 1983 cult classic it beget, The House on Sorority Row -- follows five members of Theta Pi who cause the death of their fellow sorority sister Megan (The Hills's Audrina Patridge) during a prank gone wrong.With help from Megan's traumatized boyfriend Garrett (Matt O'Leary), the surviving sorority sisters -- the good-natured Cassidy (Briana Evigan), 'Queen Bee' Jessica (Leah Pipes), bookish Ellie (Rumer Willis), Claire (Jamie Chung), and Garret's party animal sister Chugs (Margo Harshman) -- dump Megan's body down an old well at an abandoned mine. Only Cassidy objects, saying they need to turn themselves in, but she's ultimately made complicit in their crime.Months later as graduation nears, the sorority sisters think they've gotten away clean ... until a cloaked, tire iron-wielding killer starts picking them off. The killer knows what they did (no, I will not say "last summer"!), leading the girls to the conclusion that Megan has returned from the dead to get her revenge. Will the sisters finally do the right thing and confess to their crime, or just dig their graves deeper? On a technical level, Sorority Row could be used as an example for why night exterior scenes shouldn't be shot on digital. All of the scenes set at the mine look awful; they're grainy, blurry, shifting in and out of focus like a home movie shot on an old camcorder rather than a feature film made by professionals. This hit-and-miss digital cinematography pulls the viewer right out of the movie. But what the film suffers from most is an identity crisis.Sorority Row is never quite sure if it wants you to laugh with it or at it. The horror-comedy hybrid is perhaps the trickiest genre mash-up to get right; are you making a horror film with some moments of humor, or a comedy with some horror in it? It's the difference between Scream and Scary Movie, and a reason why so many horror-comedies don't succeed artistically or commercially. In the case of Sorority Row, one gets the distinct feeling that the filmmakers were trying to make a horror film with some comic relief in it ... until they got into the editing room, saw just how goofy their movie was, and tried to salvage it by embracing its inherent ridiculousness. But I'm just speculating.The protagonists are simply thumbnail sketches and not fully realized characters. You have the sisters' bitchy leader; the conscience of the group; the bookish one; the slutty boozehound; the sexy but vacant one; the tough but devoted housemother; the doting boyfriend; the jocks. The actors largely seem to understand and accept that they're playing types rather than people, with the standouts being Pipes (who nails the film's biggest laughs), Evigan and Carrie Fisher as their housemother. Willis has but two functions in this movie: scream and cry, which is still more than Chung has (which is to look hot, a feat she accomplished simply by showing up to work).There are a few good kills, but precious few thrills in the movie. As with so many horror films, particularly teen-centric slasher flicks, the events of Sorority Row are predicated on characters making bad decisions then compounding their foolish mistakes with incessant stupidity. But aside from being dumb, these characters are uniformly repellent. There's not a single person in this movie that anyone with a brain or an ounce of class could actually like. They are all -- even the so-called moral compass of the group, Cassidy -- self-absorbed, superficial, and utterly soulless prima donnas. Spoiled rich brats trying to get away with murder. It's really tough not to root for the killer here, which I guess is the sick point of a slasher flick, except that this movie spends enough time trying to make you care that at least the "best" of the sisters escapes death.Yet despite so many drawbacks (not the least of which is its absurd ending and the real killer being a completely unjustified choice), Sorority Row isn't unwatchable. This is due largely to Leah Pipes, a relatively unknown actress who steals the show and helps the film function on some level as a twisted comedy. Ultimately, there's enough eye candy and camp value in Sorority Row to warrant a look-see from only the most die-hard of horror fans. To them I say, go for the tits but stay for the tire iron</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will definitely say that this is much better then the woeful original, but it's not as clever as it likes to think it is. It's black humor serves it well for a lot of the duration, the characters are well done, but at about an hour in I started to become bored of it all. How many times have we seen this type of genre now, ever since I Know What You Did Last Summer came out? quite a lot in my opinion. Some of the kills are fittingly graphic, I especially liked the one involving the shady doctor and Leah Pipes is hilariously disturbed as Jessica, but it just didn't quite hit the mark when all was said and done. I predicted the killer halfway into the movie, it was pretty obvious in my opinion, after all I've seen way too many horror films with the surprise killer option.Performances. Briana Evigan is a likable heroine, and does fine as Cassidy. Leah Pipes played a great b**tch as Jessica. She was hilariously twisted and very nice to look at as well. Rumer Willis does a great job as the wimp Ellie, she especially shines at the end. Carrie Fisher has a delightful cameo as a bad ass.Bottom line. I enjoyed a decent amount of it for what it was, it's cleverly constructed at times and it sure beats the original, but I started to get bored after an hour in. It's worth a look for Horror fanatics though.5 1/2 /10</fullReview>

However afterwards apart from some shoddy acting on the killers part when revealing who he was the movie was very gory, scary and exactly what I would wish for in a horror movie. And even better? I was actually scared more than once during this movie so although it was great any self-respecting horror movie fan should be falling over themselves to watch this. The different ways that people are killed and the acting in this movie were both excellent. The 'who's the killer' could definitely have been laid on thicker and for longer but there was still a lot of guessing. I especially loved the gown. Tres cool!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising premise fails to deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were going to make a satisfaction graph for this film, it would peak in the first 10 minutes, plateau in the middle hour and then fall into the Grand Canyon upon the revolution, before climbing back to middling for the ending, such is the frustrating experience of watching Sorority Row.The premise is promising enough, the Theta Pi girls find out that one of their number, Bree, has an unfaithful boyfriend and so decide to prank him by making him think the girl has died by his hand. Of course they keep the prank going too long and the boy ends up accidentally killing the girl for real in trying to dispose of her body.The middle section is almost as banal as a film can be. Carrie Fisher appears to play a highly improbable character and the girls involved in the initial murder get knocked off one by one. From here it's pretty standard stuff as the harlot dies first, the only likable character is the main and the nastiest girl is saved for last.But the journey through these staples is particularly banal, with the kills, especially that of the horrible Jessica, not elaborate or drawn out enough. The fact that red herring characters like Maggie, the younger sister of the murdered girl, Jessica's boyfriend and his father are all such execrable stereotypes and the film's middle act is far from satisfying.And the ending? ,Arrrgh. Terrible. The only other likable character in the film , Megan's boyfriend turns out to be the killer (he has committed these murders for no logical reason), Jessica's boyfriend turns out to be some type or sexual predator, not enough build or significance is given to her death, and Maggie, a horrible character, survives. But the fire scene is quite well done and some of the scenes work well enough to save this from being a complete waste of time.This film contains sex scenes and nudity, and on top of that, isn't very good anyway.</fullReview>

This could be the chance to inject new life into these stories. But nope. The kills are dull, as is the killer. The setup is interesting, but it soon settles in to a formulaic curve. Obviously the girls with morals are going to survive the longest. Why couldn't the bitchy, sexy ones have survived? It would have been a little bit fresh. The slasher genre is in serious need of a kick up the arse. Hopefully Scream 4 will do just that. Until then we can settle for generic remakes of mediocre films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorority Row</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the last few years, young filmmakers have been given a chance to either remake or rip off from horror flicks they grew up watching with the Hollywood machine behind them. With a cast of good-looking leads and all the slick flash money can buy, movies like Sorority Row, a gen-x revamp of House on Sorority Row, aim to please slasher fans wanting their violence and eye candy. As far as slashers go, to me, Sorority Row is no better or worse than the recent remakes of My Bloody Valentine or Friday the 13th. The girls are superficial snobs with daddy's banking account at their disposal, planning their perfect lives with affluent hunks whose father's are senators or businessmen. I will say that I found the weapon, a pimped-out tire iron with a knife, as ridiculous as it is, rather amusing, and the reason behind the one responsible for the series of vicious murders on those who were unfortunate participants in the accidental death of a fellow sister in the sorority chapter Theta Pi, after a prank goes seriously wrong, really funny(..and, to be honest, found myself understanding his seriously warped logic). The sisters consist of Cassidy(Briana Evigan), Chugs(Margo Harshman), Ellie(Rumer Willis), Claire(Jamie Chung), and Jessica(Leah Pipes). Audrina Patridge, of The Hills, is the ultimate victim, Megan, whose death is the catalyst for everything that transpires.Jessica is the queen bee bitch of the group, with practically every snide and hurtful comment aimed with potent venom towards anyone that raises her ire. She is self-absorbed and worried only about her own self-interests. Most of us are ready to celebrate when this piece of work gets what's coming to her. Cassidy is the set-up final girl, it's as clichéd as ever before, the one who wants to go to the police and turn themselves in, but the others(..except Ellie)set her up as the murderer through the use of her jacket as a blanket to cover Megan's body before dumping it in a mine shaft. She's strong, the only one who can stand toe-to-toe with Jessica, having a backbone the others lack. Chugs is the resident tramp who downs lots of liquor and has a serious lack of morals(..to score some pills from her psychiatrist, she's willing to bang his brains out if necessary, and offers her warm vagina to a freshman boy who seems disinterested in sex, the idiot). Ellie is always crying, sobbing, worried, paranoid, and quivering, the black sheep of the Theta Pi chapter, only allowed a sister because of her brains(..she helped Jessica achieve high grades)..Cassidy is her confident and strength. Claire is Jessica's punching bag, a constant source of ridicule because she's spineless, but pretty and rich, so her weaknesses are acceptable. If there are others who overhear or are told of the "Megan incident", they are targets as well. To be honest, slasher fans get what is expected: the tire iron does some serious damage(..mainly as a swift stabbing weapon)and we get a lot of chicks to salivate over(..not to mention boobs, boobs, and more boobs). There's plenty of partying hooligans and general beer-guzzling at the Theta Pi parties. The obvious red herring is the one who puts the hole into Megan's chest, Chugs' brother, Garrett(Matt O'Leary), because he truly thought she was dead from accidental overdose of roofies(..the sense of humor in this movie can be pretty dark indeed), and wanted to punch an opening so she's sink in the river without floating back to the top. Julian Morris is Cassidy's lover Andy, a seemingly sweet guy with a good head on his shoulders, the college's valedictorian even..he's very protective of Cassidy, and has been there for her during the past 8 months as she struggled to cope with what her sisters did. I will give a lot of props to the producers and filmmakers for their little nods to the original film. Carrie Fisher, as Tom Atkins was in MBV, is the veteran in this slasher, toting a shotgun and threatening to blow to smithereens the one who wants to harm her girls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY entertaining horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most entertaining horror flicks i've seen in a long time. Style and Story remind of New Classics like 'I know what you did last summer' and 'Scream' but this movie still keeps it's individuality. The dialogue is well written for the genre...some lines are funny, some are just spot on. The female leads act alright, Cassidy is likable, Jessica a real bitch and Ellie...well, she screams a lot, but Rumer Willis did a good job.There is not that much gore but the whole movie and the killing scenes have a nice pace. And what can I say...I didn't guess the killer!...And that means something ;)If you liked 'Ikwydls' and 'Scream' back in the days, you should give this movie a shot. It's a million times better than 'Prom Night' and I really enjoyed it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How many different ways to kill with a tire iron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted everyone to die in the movie. Sometimes when I am watching a slasher film, I want at least one survivor cause it feels like all that running and screaming has to pay off and if everyone ends up getting killed than all those scenes are a bit pointless unless it has a good ending to go with it. The ending sucked in this film and I just wanted everyone to die, even the so called good girl of the pack I found her very annoying and it just wasn't her really husky voice either, she is a pretty crappy actress anyways. The film starts off at a big party where a couple of sorority seniors decide to pull a prank, but it goes awfully wrong. They just decide to hide the body and act like nothing has happened, than fast forward about 8 month later to graduation when the killing starts to happen. After each of the girls and a guy gets a message from there phone showing the event that happened the night of the murder. Than it just goes about in a manner of how many different way you can kill someone with the same weapon, although few died a bit differently. The only reason I wanted to finish this movie was to find out who the killer is and when you find out, it will be a big disappointment. You just don't give a crap with any of the character live or die, and I guess that is for the best cause I got so much enjoyment out of every character that died, it's a shame that few survived.4.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Derivative and uninspired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorority Row offers all the ingredients of the average slasher film; young, beautiful people, each filling a niche personality-wise, are chased by some kind of costumed killer and die gruesome deaths. Of course, the main characters are all linked by some terrible sin of the past. This particular recipe has been used by countless films, but Sorority Row particularly takes inspiration by the 90s slashers, which added slight moments of humor, sometimes even during the scary scenes. Think Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer and you aren't far off what Sorority Row attempts to do. There was certainly an attempt to get actors as attractive as possible but someone in casting probably forgot to make them speak a few lines; the acting on display during the 100 minutes is often cringe-worthy. The uninspired director probably hoped that numerous shots of breasts would make everything else forgiven.If Sorority Row took itself more seriously, the film and its awful story would be unwatchable. But the light tone makes it OK for one watch. Do not expect revolutionary death scenes or an epic villain. In fact, don't expect much, except a way to kill 100 minutes of time.Barely recommended, strictly for slasher fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I take my hat off to the director and maker of this film. And of course, the sorority girls. It was well put together, the trailer was very good too. It scared me to death! My favorite is Jessica, because of her mean and sassy attitude. It put a spunk to the movie. The ending was also very well put together... however the survivors don't impress me very much. I mean it was kinda obvious 2 out of the 3 people who survived were gonna survive because of the happy endings in the movies. This one wasn't all that happy, but i am not at all surprised about the 2 out of 3 people that survived. However i was very surprised about the killer :O I think anyone who watches it are in for a surprise! Its a great movie and its one of my favorite movies, i watch it over and over again. I hope they make a 2nd one! A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pimp my tire iron.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With it's excessively asinine plot, crazy killer armed with a particularly impractical weapon (a modified tire iron), exaggerated death scenes, a larger-than-normal quota of bitchy, big breasted bimbos (including the obligatory sexy nerd) and their equally obnoxious boyfriends, and a fair smattering of gratuitous nudity, I'm pretty certain that Sorority Row was intended by its makers to parody the countless, moronic, teen slasher remakes that have blighted horror in recent years. However, it appears that their motive may have been lost on many viewers, who seem to have mistaken the deliberate playing up of genre stereotypes and intentional over-use of dumb clichés for a case of plain, old-fashioned bad movie-making?something which there has been plenty of over the last decade or so.It's a shame, because when armed with the knowledge that much of the film's apparent awfulness is by design, one can have quite a bit of fun with Sorority Row.The film opens with one of those frat parties that only ever seem to happen in the movies (or maybe I just went to the wrong parties): it's thumping with the latest cool tunes, heaving with physically perfect specimens of both sexes indulging in all manner of hedonistic activities, and overflowing with an endless supply of alcohol. Whilst the gorgeous revellers bump, grind and get wasted, six sexy sorority sisters carry out a mean prank that will have disastrous results: they con a poor schmuck into believing that he has accidentally killed his ex-girlfriend Megan by plying her with drugs. Carrying the joke a little too far, they also convince him that it would be a good idea to hide his crime by pushing her body into a lake located near a disused mine. Unfortunately, before they can reveal that it is all a sick joke, events spiral out of control, and Megan winds up dying for real when the guy plunges a tire iron into her chest (to let the air out of her lungs so that she will sink). Now the group are forced to dispose of a genuine corpse?opting to dump their dead friend down the mine-shaft.A year later, as the girls celebrate their graduation, a hooded murderer is busy at work on the campus. Is it Megan, back from the dead for revenge, or does someone else have a motive for the rapidly rising body count?What follows is undeniably silly, but as I have said, when viewed with the right frame of mind, it's also rather enjoyable; one can have fun spotting the deliberate attempts by the makers to ridicule the more idiotic conventions of the genre (the over privileged students, the stern but protective den mother, the innocent girl who unwillingly goes along with her friends' plans) whilst also revelling in the brutal violence, ogling the many attractive women, cheering on a shotgun toting Carrie Fisher, and marvelling at just how much Rumer Willis sounds like her mother.It's not a brilliant piece of film-making (if it was, the parodic content would have been obvious to all), but it's not nearly as dreadful as many might have you believe. I rate Sorority Row a reasonable 6/10. Give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Sorority Row</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't help but to compare this with I Know What You Did L:ast Summer, where one can make a slasher film by assembling a bevy of hot looking girls, never mind if they can act to save their lives, and designing enough innovative ways to make them fall to the killer's weapon of choice. It's pretty no brainer, and while this film succeeded in its casting, the way it went about dispatching its victims was a tad too boring.Story centers around a group of sorority seniors whose prank went awry resulting in the demise of one of their own. The surviving members decide to hush it up after a great moral debate on what's right and wrong, and the voice of reason gets drowned out. Fast forward some 8 months later to graduation, they get haunted by the victim's phone messages and video clip of the event, that they decide to investigate just who is bumping them off one by one.The filmmakers don't even try to make the killer an iconic one worthy for induction into Horror's Wall of Infamy, and designed yet another generic psychopath that are B-grade plenty. Body count is low too, and it didn't help that the characters are unlikable to begin with that you just don't bother if they live or die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart, Funny, Scary and Gross</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a fantastic contribution to the slasher cannon. It's a little like IKWYDLS, but with smarter characters, better dialogue and a satisfying, entertaining take on 'the killer'.The film sets up quickly, and moves at a brisk pace. As well, the dialogue is clever and engaging, and is used to good affect by the cast to set up their characters. (I read a NYT review that slagged the set up and characters -- what film did that reviewer see? Not the same one I saw). This film is definitely rated R for a reason -- there's lots of gore. Still, it's all handled really well by the film makers. There's not a hint of 'torture-porn' in this film -- even though the murders are super gross and nasty, it has the hallmarks of 80s slashers, where the characters are 'dispatched' and the film doesn't dwell on their pain or suffering. You can watch this film without needing a trip to your therapist.All in all, this is a fun film. Another reviewer said this was the best horror they had seen in 2009, and I'd say I have to agree. This is a solid movie, and I'll be looking for more from these filmmakers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake of one of my favourite slashers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I am somewhat of a fence sitter when it comes to remakes. Whilst I quite enjoyed My Bloody Valentine 3D, I still haven't seen the rehash of Halloween and I don't intend to. For me, the original was a masterpiece and with all due respect, giving Rob Zombie the reins for a new version is almost like giving Henry Hill the chance to do a remake of The Godfather. Somehow, modern-day teens seem far more arrogant than they used to and the MTV generation are a lot less alluring body count material for splatter flicks.The House on Sorority Row was one of my favourite genre pieces of the peak period. A great story with a compelling mystery and razor sharp direction gave it an advantage on its brethren from the same era. That eerie final sequence is a postcard from the greatest period of the stalk and slasher and I hoped that if there's any justice in the kingdom of moviedom, Sorority Row would pay not just homage, but respect to its grandfather. Having Mark Rosman on board as executive producer, was a good move, because I felt sure that he would really want to guide the way in terms of representing the brand he created.After a poorly-planned prank goes wrong, a group of sorority sisters are left with an incriminating secret that could cost them their lives. After some on the spot soul searching they decide to keep it between themselves and dispose of any remaining evidence. Eight months pass and the group have mostly put the events behind them and are looking forward to graduation. Things take a turn for the worse when someone begins targeting the girls with evidence linking them to their earlier endeavours. Before long a hooded killer turns up and begins working his way through the group one-by-one... The film kicks off poorly and by the ten-minute mark, I was expecting the worst. After the prank backfires, there's a panic-stricken scene which was a golden opportunity for the junior thesps to show that they had the talent to build some rapport with the audience. Unfortunately, they don't take it and there's a clearly visible lack of chemistry and cohesiveness as they scream at each other unconvincingly and sink to further depths of banal dramatics.I found it hard at first glance to like these characters and for an avid fan of eighties slashers, the words Facebook and YouTube seemed bizarre in this kind of flick. Well I have just turned thirty, so maybe I am getting too long in the tooth now. My view is admittedly dated as social networking plays such a large part of the youth culture of today that I guess I should credit the necessary attempt to pull the category forward in to more modern surroundings. In fairness, as a critic I should have given this a chance on its own to impress from the start, but it was impossible for me not to think of comparisons with the original. I hadn't seen it for a while, but I remembered the ominous opening and the haunting score that set the tone so early on. Here we are given a bouncing 'Hip-Hop' baseline, conceited characters and zero recognition that this is a horror film rather than yet another dumb teen comedy.Then suddenly and most unexpectedly things began to improve. Now I'm not sure if it's because the aforementioned poorly-acted sequence was the first that they shot and they hadn't yet found their footing. But after an uncomfortable and disorientated opening, the plot began to tighten, the dramatics improved and the river of intrigue began to flow. The killer's guise was nothing special (how many cloaked maniacs have there been since Urban Legends?) but using a lug wrench as a weapon allowed for some inventive slayings and the film found the right balance of subtle parody and engaging plot.Stewart Hendler's energetic and ambitious direction is exactly what the film needed and the fluid cinematography adds to the party-like vibe. Briana Evigan grew in to her role as the plot thickened and there's a good mix of characteristics on display so that you can chose those that you like or those you want to see gruesomely impaled on the tyre iron. The mystery is a tough one to crack, but in effect is a bit disappointing once revealed. I mean, where did that come from? Nowadays MTV horror movies are targeted at a younger generation of viewers, so in order to get a wider target audience they don't invest in gratuitous gore, which would probably result in a stringent rating from the censors. Sorority Row, unlike the appalling Prom Night remake, does at least pack some blood and creativity in to its murders and although there's never any really solid fear factor on display, Hendler does produce moments of suspense.So is Sorority Row worthy to share the brand of one of the best films of the golden period? I would say just about, yes. Don't get me wrong this is nowhere near as good as the film it redesigns, but compared to the amount of plop we get nowadays that describes itself as horror, Hendler's slasher does enough to separate itself from the masses.The only negatives are the large amount of 'hard-to-like' characters, an insignificant bogeyman (they don't even try to make an iconic Jason/Michael Myers type) and no real scares.It pains me to say it, but slasher films of modern times are the chick-flicks of the horror genre and that's why they need to do the little that is expected of them to the best of their ability. Row does exactly that and boasts a frantic pace, some cool kills, a good mystery and a divine final girl. Fairly good global box office meant there's life in the cycle yet...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Mean Girls" meets "I Know What You Did Last Summer."...and it works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having had no expectations going into this movie I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it really was. I skimmed some of the other reviews on here and a lot of the other comments are very hung-up on the nudity in this movie. However, having only graduated from College 5 years ago director Stewart Hendler would have failed miserably in making this film if he wasn't working to make it as realistic as possible. The opening sequence alone helps a lot in establishing the characters and the roles they will play as well. The drinking, drugs, sex, and nudity are part of the fraternal culture, at least in America. Unfortunately so is the way the men (I mean, boys) in this film treat women. Every night is another party, there are no real consequences or adults, just older kids with family's who have plenty of money to do whatever without supervision....until something bad really happens to them.It is true it starts out very much like "I know what you did last summer" (or any other horror movie where a teens do something stupid and immature, and then try to cover it up), but the quick-witted scrip and GOOD ACTING (yes, good acting, in a slasher film) save this movie from the junk pile. The actresses in this film were in full-form, showing genuinely their ability to capture what its like to be 21 again, thinking that "we are adults now" but then quickly realizing that they don't even have a clue of how to behave like adults or make good decisions when confronted with the death of their sorority sister after a prank goes wrong.It is the oldest morality-play in the book: people making bad decisions and then being forced to suffer the consequences, that being their own gruesome deaths from a mystery killer.It also didn't hurt that the camera work was excellent as well as the score. The director Hendler was able to ratchet up the suspense plenty, keep the story moving, and create an ending that was very unpredictable and unnerving. Although somewhat last minute in nature, the ending did make sense, in that horror-movie kind of way.This is a definite must for those who enjoy murder-mysteries and good acting/suspense. While there is some gore, this isn't for gore-hounds. Sometimes the less you see the more frightening it may be.</fullReview>

Not a good thing in the Brainless Slasher Genre. Just some Kool Kills please. Some Gore-Art splattered with biting satire and irreverent denunciations.There are a few mildly interesting things here but in hindsight they are fuzzy because this is a Movie that is filled with a lot of filler. It whisks around from locations and time-frames and halts occasionally so the Sisters can bicker and bond and bond and bicker. Get on with it. The Fun leaks out of this thing like a punctured vanity implant. It is a busybody of a Movie that loses its focus more than once.Overall on the Slasher Scale it is in a Midrange of not Awful but somewhere in the c'mon this isn't that hard to pull off realm. It's not like there aren't a Gazillion others to steal from. Oh that's right this has stolen from its better Sisters, it just didn't know what to do with the Booty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very good movie. It was very unpredictable and just enough gore. It takes a while to predict the killer and your most likely to get it wrong. The director obviously wanted you to think it was somebody else. Made it so the clues would somehow lead to that person but in the end it wouldn't match up and they wouldn't have a reason to have killed the girl.I think the bitch girl thing for Jessica was very boring and plain. You would think she would be a little more defined in the movie but she was a one of the girls in every horror movie that at the beginning you know they are going to die at one point. Ellie was a very interesting character near the end. Even though she was very weak and fragile she still managed to stay alive throughout the whole movie.Chugs was my least favored character. Cassidy was my favorite character. She was the kind of character that you know will live. She was very strong willed and bad ass. Maggie seemed like the prime suspect to me and seemed most likely to have seen them kill her sister. She had a reason whereas Andy seemed to have the worst motive to kill them. The idea of a prank gone wrong isn't very original but the director switched it up so it seemed original. Overall a very good horror to watch during a party.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining if A Bit Loosely Connected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I enjoyed the movie as a whole. It kept me entertained until the end, trying to guess the culprit. That being said, this is no masterpiece. There were many predictable elements and replications from previous horror films, as others have also mentioned.The main characters were colorful, especially Leah Pipes as Jessica, the girl you love to hate. I thoroughly appreciated her convincing portrayal as the bitchiest girl alive. As much as I loathed her initially, I was rooting for her towards the end due to her humor and brutal honesty, and was disappointed when she died. I liked Briana Evigan as Cassidy, although I thought her character's personality was inconsistent. She was so strong and vocal at the murder scene, fighting for what was right and being the only voice of moral righteousness. Then, 8 months later. In the scenes with her "sisters," she blended in with the others and acted passively. Where was this passionate, virtuous person we had previously met? The strength and vigor reappeared later, when she took the lead in fighting against the unknown assailant, but to me, it didn't live up to the promise of her character as originally presented. Now to the questionable elements of the film. When we believed that the killer was either Garrett or Megan (or, for a moment, Ellie, as I briefly surmised), it made sense for the tire iron to be the weapon. After all, each of these parties was there when it was originally used, and in their twisted minds, it would be reasonable to perpetuate the use of the tire iron for the enactment of vengeance or rage. However, once we realize that the madman is Kyle (no, just kidding, it's Andy) - I was perplexed at the use of tire iron. It's obviously meant to frighten the viewer and presented as a quintessential element of torture, but, why would ANDY use it? He has no reason. He wasn't there, and therefore, did not have the connection to this item. Why not a normal weapon? We are not given any background on Andy as a master of medieval weaponry or metallurgy, so why should we be believe that he would 1) be able to fashion such an object, and 2) be inclined to do so? I suppose if you simply accept he is insane, you wouldn't question his motives, because insanity needs no explanation.I also think the viewer needed to have some additional evidence or representation of the relationship between Cassidy and Andy, and Andy and Ellie, to accept the events are they are explained to us. Andy says that Ellie told him what happened. But we never once see any significant interaction between Andy and Ellie (unless you count her shooting him at the very end), so how can we believe that they were so close that she would confide in him? Sorry, but this is just a cop-out to explain how he knew, and attempt to connect the dispersed elements of the plot. In addition, we have no background on the interaction between Cassidy and Andy, and we don't see his numerous attempts to try to get her to talk to him (as he claims in one of the final scenes) Thus, this felt a bit contrived. I would be remiss if I didn't comment on the telephone issue. Really, with all of the actual and fictitious events that have transpired at sorority houses, you wouldn't have a land-line phone? Unbelievable. The whole "mission for a phone" series of events was not credible. They could at least pulled the cliché, "Oh, no, the killer cut the phone line!" We see what happened to Jessica's phone but what about Ellie's and Cassidy's? This was obviously a ploy to get them back to Mickey's body and into a confrontation with the killer.Another thing that troubled me was the luring of all the characters back to the quarry. Again, if this had been Garrett or Megan, it would make sense for this to be the scene of a final confrontation. But, being that it was Andy, what was the point? All that it accomplished was finding out that Garrett was not the killer and that someone had written a threatening message in blood. Oh, and that Megan's body wasn't there, but they already suspected that, anyway. This sequence of events makes the movie longer but doesn't add anything to it. What would Andy's motive be in dragging them out there if not to take action? It was an obvious plot filler. And, how can you NOT show us how they got Cassidy out of the hole? Come on! Are they all spelunkers?The character of Ellie (Rumer Willis) was frankly annoying. You have to be able to do something other than scream and panic and faint! Such a weak link would have been killed much earlier. Especially from the mindset of Andy - after all, Ellie was the one who told him about the murder! Shouldn't she be the first to pay for having placed this burden on him? It would be logical from Andy's twisted point of view. I haven't looked it up yet but I am fairly certain that the actor who plays Andy is British. I noticed a few slips of an accent in the later scenes. Can't any of you Brits hold it together? This is a personal annoyance of mine. Stay true to the character! Don't give the viewers a reason to get distracted from the moment!All criticism aside, the special effects were great, and acting was pretty good, especially from the lead girls. It was genuinely scary and gory, as horror movies should be. And the end twist was nice. I assume that was Garrett we see as one of the landscapers, due to the scars on the wrist? Not a great movie, but not a bad one, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What could have been a great slasher parody fails to deliver the laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one of the girls in this farcical teen horror film finds her deceased friend's rotted body in the bathtub, a friend who died of a prank gone wrong for which she is partly responsible, she comments the discovery by saying "well, she looks terrible" in a casual manner, you know you are watching something special. Later on, as the house is lit on fire by a Molotov cocktail by the killer, the same blonde wonders out loud who could be behind the shenanigan. She is a smart woman, a self-proclaimed queen of all bitchiness.Sorority Row is a divided film. Quite literally, as people get hacked to pieces, but this is not what I mean. The first half of the film is like a terrible teen slasher with nothing to give suspense, horror nor story-wise. The makers behind the film must have realized that, because the last half of the film increasingly transforms itself into a parody of slasher films. If you are not convinced by my assessment, just wait until they reveal who the killer is. It is not only an insane choice, but a crazy one on purpose. Some might argue that the comedic elements are unintentional, but I disagree. They are clearly intentional and sometimes even funny. But to the disappointment of the audience, the film makers realized too late they had been making a farce all along and nothing is as over-the-top as it should have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorotity row is a movie that was between decent and good. Its far from great, yet its far from terrible. The characters were so fake,with the exception of Casidy and Claire. Audrina Patridge delivered the most mediocre performance I have ever seen in a slasher film. The movie is about her character getting killed and in graduation someone comes back and starts killing them. Best original script! Yeah right. However, this is a remake of THE HOUSE ON SOROTIY ROW. That movie came out in the 80's when most of the slasher films came upon. The death scenes, however were great. Chugs, chugging for her life was so ironic and hilarious. Jessica getting a wield through her mouth was so well deserved, ironically her big mouth killed her. Ellie,survived, but her screaming was so annoying! I wish she would have just been killed, and who can't agree when Cassidy's boyfriend comes up starts talking to her, says something in Latin, and right before he kills Cass, Ellie comes from behind, shoots him and says the translation. That was awesome. With no doubt, this movie was not the best of the bunch, but was certainly entertaining to watch. A rental will make people smile at the end of a bad day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite Gushes of Blood, "Row" Is a Big No</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Freddy Kruger and Jason Vorhees wouldn't break a sweat, but one sorely longs for a cameo in this yawn inducing by-the-numbers slasher based on the movie of similar - if slightly longer - title ("The House on Sorority Row") or on any other slutty girls in trouble flick of 1983 and beyond. This waste of talent is only watchable for the palpable chemistry between its leading ladies. The bitchy-ness of Leah Pipes, who unabashedly channels Edie Britt (of "Desperate Housewive's" fame), is another asset (she even looks a little bit like a younger version of Nicollette Sheridan). Formulaic, hence forgettable. Gruesome killings aren't what they used to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ho-hum, how many times have we seen this formula. Bunch of teenagers (read women in their late 20s) do something tragic, cover up the event, and then proceed to be picked off months later by an unseen menace.This movie was pretty much predictable, except the supposed twist at the end which seems to have defied all logic and reason.Then there are the sad details. When I saw one of the girls was Asian, I knew she'd be one of the first victims, because the minority cast member is ALWAYS the first to buy it. (Seriously, why is that? It's kind of racist, Hollywood. Why not make the Asian babe the "Final Girl" who survives through pluck and virtue?) Sadder still, Carrie Fisher. It's been a long time since Star Wars, hasn't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty mediocre horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the "slasher" cinema has two variations from the formula, which are very similar but they have an essential difference; in movies like Friday the 13th, Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street, the murderer is the star, and his victims are simple sacrifices on the road to the final confrontation between survivor (who is usually a woman) and villain, which offers a few times a slight psychological or emotional ingredient.The second variation keeps in secret the identity from the murderer, so we do not only see how he kills his/her victims, but we also look for clues to reveal the villain and his motives for the killings.Sorority Row belongs to the second group, but it did not leave me satisfied, because it was too boring for me to care who the killer was.Sorority Row is a remake of The House on Sorority Row, a film I have not seen, so I will not be able to make any comparisons.However, it will be unavoidable for me to compare it with other films from the same genre, specially on its fails.The story from this film is kinda similar to I Know What You Did Last Summer (anyway, neither this was nor The House on Sorority Row were the first ones in using their premise), but set on the vacuous and irritating university context, something which reminded me to the atrocious remake of Black Christmas.And as well as on that film, Sorority Row shows us young actresses trying to create drama and emotion with their stupid internal conflicts and insipid discussions.The result is something like a bad episode of Gossip Girl or 90210, but with more blood and less obsession for fashionable clothes.The characters are extremely antipathetic, and the actors (Rumer Willis specially) do not seem very interested in them, so I did not care too much if they died or not.Besides, Stewart Hendler (who had left me a pretty good impression with his previous -and first- movie Whisper)'s direction helps to sabotage the narrative with excessive close-ups and poor edition, which make what happens on various scenes difficult to understand.In summary, I cannot recommend Sorority Row, because it is boring and pretty mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good slasher horror film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that the horror film Sorority Row was very good film. It is about a group of sorority sisters who are trying to cover up the death of their house-sister after a prank which has gone wrong, only to be stalked by a serial killer. They found out a guy cheated on one of their sisters, they play a prank on him. by tricking him into thinking that he has killed his girlfriend, then take him into the middle of nowhere to dismember the body, but then reveal to him that it was a prank. But the prank goes horribly wrong and all of them involved swear never to speak about it again. A year later at their graduation they are all about to be reminded of what happened a year ago.I thought the actors in this film were very good especially all of the sisters. I would recommend this film for people to watch. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's a body. Do we wrap it in the blanket as it is, or do we chop it into little pieces first?" Chugs (Margo Harshman)Sorority Row has girl-women in micro shorts with heels long enough to pierce armor, guys not quite as smart as their abs, and a hooded serial killer deft with a tire iron. A remake of the 1983 cult fav, The House on Sorority Row, it is nothing if not derivative of every schlocky, sexy, bloody, and ultimately silly horror film that can't decide if it should be funny or scary because having both is a difficult trick rarely achieved except by Jack Nicholson in The Shining.Sorority sisters cover up the bloody result of a prank by burying the body of a house-sister and spending the rest of the movie eluding a stalker who may have witnessed the crime. Although Rumer Willis (yes, daughter of), who plays nervous Ellie, tries in an interview to elevate the film to a study of the consequences of sin, there's no way this is anything but a weak slasher movie that uses every horror trope to almost no effect (we've always known an unaccompanied trip to the basement is not a good idea nor a shower with no one else in the other stalls, etc.).Leah Pipes does well as Jessica, the leader of the pack: She has the right mix of indifference and nerve to invoke laughs and admiration as a new feminist who is bold, beautiful, and ambitious. Well, Nicholson she's not, but welcome to this tired plot she is.Sorority Row has going for it my disbelief that films like this are made at all. But they are, and it may take another 25 years for it to become a cult classic.Right now, we've seen it all already, and it's not pretty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sorority Row" is the remake of 1983's creepy college slasher flick "The House on Sorority Row" about the murder of a sorority house mother.It's filled with obnoxious but extremely hot teenage girls,who are viciously slashed to death by a crazed killer.The prank goes wrong during sex and fun filled party and one of the sorority sisters ends up dead.The girls dump the corpse in a nearby mine shaft.Months later someone apparently knows what they did last semester as a robed figure begins taunting them with threats and evidence from the murder scene.And the blood is being shed.The acting by teenage actresses is fine and the killings are creative.The robed killer resembles Ghostface of "Scream" franchise.The comedy/satire aspect of "Sorority Row" is unconvincing and out of place.There is also no real tension found in this teen slasher pic,but if you like cheap laughs sprinkled with nudity give "Sorority Row" a look.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the worst Horror film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It starts off with steady clichés in the background as if to make fun of itself. Every seen is blatantly obvious, the nude scenes are cheesy. Let me just give you an example of a bad scene:A college girl is taking a shower, she turns the water off and hears her friends talking. They leave and all the showers turn on. Now this isn't unusual is it, since they are college students and well they take showers. But for some reason she gets out of the shower scared out of her mind and says hello. "Hello is anybody there, maybe a guy with a hook and trench coat waiting to kill me?" Hello? Anyway yeah the guy from I know what you did last summer is there and well the film is full of this. This is the worst horror flick next to house of the dead.For me, movies are no longer scary. They trick the audiences into watching gruesome murder scenes to somehow get us use to killing. It is a bad influence on children and it needs to stop.There are no more scary movies like Poltergeist, just blood soaked gore, murder on film.</fullReview>

I'd have to say, I can't believe people actually party like this in real life, it's disgusting and some what disturbing, which makes it all the more sweet when the killing starts. And yes the main characters all deserve to die for what they did. The characters are generic, as usual, I don't care for them at all. The plot was somewhat intriguing, but seemed to much like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer. I actually laughed at the prank going wrong, I don't think the filmmakers intended for that to be funny. Throughout the film I really wanted some of these characters to die, they don't make it easy to like them, they are how you say, complete trash. The ending was very unsatisfying and generic, but what can I say, I wasn't to fond of the kids to begin with. I do love some good horror/slasher films but this one was forgettable, even by horror standards. The only people I could see enjoying this are the same people that commit these hennas acts of partying, sex, and disgusting stuff. I would need a testiness shot if I had to be in that house.I don't recommend this film, but if you must, it's only six bucks on i-tunes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sisters from a sorority decide to play a prank on a boy that has cheated on one of their sisters. The prank involves the one girl he is making out with, to pretend to be dead of an overdose. While they are deciding what to do with the dead body, the boy grabs a tire iron and stabs the dead body, uh-oh. Now she is really dead. The girls freak out and dump the body down a well of some kind, or a mine shaft and decide to keep it a secret, so it doesn't ruin their lives. Months later they are hunted down and killed by someone who knows, or someone who is back from the dead.Never seen the original, with remakes I always feel I need to state that I've seen the original or not. Whether that plays into my liking it, or the reader taking my review into consideration or not is still up for grabs. Sorority Row is yet another horror remake that puts good looking young teenage girls in a series of brutal murders. The spin on this is that, well, there is no spin. This is a cookie cutter of a slasher film if I've ever seen one. The problem with the film, and there is many, is that it doesn't try to be serious, or poke fun at the genre. It for some reason falls bizarrely in the middle. Thus, I wasn't really able to enjoy the funny bits, or the serious ones. The girls end of killing one of their best friends and after 5 minutes of some tears, they throw the body down that hole. Great friends? Only one seems to want to report this to the police, while another just keeps crying. We are instantly given our character archetypes. The bitch who is fake to everyone, the slut who sleeps with everyone, the smart one who is treated like a friend but really isn't, the I'm all about my looks girl and finally the one we are suppose to connect with, our heroine. The girls stick to these archetypes throughout the film and never change a beat. Do I care about anyone? No. Am I suppose to? Yes. This isn't Freddy, Jason or Myers, in which I'm rooting for the bad guy to kill.The kills themselves aren't anything special. In the words of one of the characters, the weapon is a "pimped out tire iron". Get it? The girl was killed with one, so the killer is killing them with one. The "pimped out" weapon has a harpoon hook at one end, a knife at another, then two handles I'm guessing. The killer throws this weapon everywhere. Great accuracy. With the exception of maybe one kill involving a bottle down a throat, everything else has been done before. Stabbing here, stabbing there, not even the one death with a flare gun was shocking, when it was suppose to be.The film never really gets you guessing as to who the killer is, not like Scream or any other "whodunnit" films. The reveal is eye rolling and ludicrous, along with the killer's motive. Why they decided to be crazy all of a sudden is beyond me, but if any slasher film knows, it's always the person who has the least amount of screen time. I was hoping this film would throw in a twist and have it be one of the main characters, silencing the others so she could live her life with the secret knowing it will be safe. But nope, they went the old generic route.Sorority Row tries to be a throwback to the 80's slasher films, but it fails horribly at it. It forgets what it's intentions were about 20 minutes in and the film tries to modernize itself with the inane dialogue. Do they have to mention facebook so many times in the beginning? 5 years from now will people still remember facebook? Who knows. But I know that 5 minutes from now I won't remember this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horrors of 2009</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very impressed with it, and this is coming from a big fan of the original movie. I thought the acting was impressive for a slasher film, especially from Leah Pipes, who I thought was brilliant. Rumer Willis impressed me as well considering I was all geared up to hate her because I don't think her mother is a very good actress, and I hate to say this, but she didn't look that ugly with her glasses on. Carrie Fisher was also excellent even with her limited screen time.My only fault with the acting is that Julian Morris' American accent kept slipping, and I think that it would have been better for him to have kept his natural accent for the film.I was thankful that Audrina Partridge only had limited screen time, because she (along with her 'friends' from their 'reality show') is not an actress, and should not really be acting.I liked the plot twists too, such as the characters thinking a certain person was the killer, and having that person attack them, only for them to be killed some time later by the actual killer.I also liked the homages to the original with the 'Sea Pig' guy, and Cassidy using the cane when she goes to look for Claire.One plot hole is never explained though, which bugged me, but it may seem like a minor gripe. Cassidy falls down a mineshaft, with no way out, but the next time she is seen, she is with the girls getting out of the car. How did she get out? The only character I thought shouldn't have been in the film was Maggie, because she served no purpose other than as a foil to Jessica and a red herring. The actress wasn't very convincing, and she wasn't particularly attractive either, and I think the film would have been better had she been excised from it. IMO, the only thing that was worthwhile involving her was the fight scene she had with Jessica.All in all, it's a solid slasher and definitely one of the best of 2009. I'd give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so entertaining!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just returned from a midnight screening of Sorority Row and must say that I left pretty satisfied and not for the reasons I originally thought. "Row" tells the familiar story of a group of sorority sisters embarking on their senior year who commit a devilish prank that ends gruesomely with the death of their sister Megan (Patridge). One year later of the eve of their graduation day and on the night of the biggest party of their college life someone starts offing them one by one in really creative ways. The killer is unimportant so don't spend to much time thinking about it because it's not the films focus. The films focus is a mixture of Heathers and Scream. And it plays delightfully well it got some scares but its got some even bigger laughs. the dialogue is so sharp between the bitchy young victims its obvious was not to take the film seriously. The kills are great and wonderfully inventive from a wine bottle to a flare gun and a "pimped out" tire iron. The reason why the tired material works here and earlier this year in the slasherfest My Bloody valentine is because it knows what type of film it is. And relishes in the absurd retartedness of slasher classics. There lots of gore, nudity and a bloody kill every five seconds. Like Valentine the characters more developed than in most horror fare and the acting is above par as well. With surprisingly good performances from Rumer Willis and a career making queen bitch one by Leah Pipes ads Jessica. I mean you have to laugh at the ridiculously lame but awesome cameo by Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia of Star Wars). And the absolute absurdity of the films last twenty minutes. But with plenty of well placed grease,ash, dirt and plenty of slow motion shots of the girls in front of the fire you can't help but to hope it could go on forever. Look I could complain about some of the films inconsistentcies, the fact is has really nothing to do with the original except one of the characters names and a cute prop thrown in or the absurdities of the films events or lack of originality in concept but why bother this monster wasn't engineered for all that bs. So don't expect to be surprised by the the films story line but do expect to be blown away by the films fantastically fun execution. The most entertaining horror film of the year! ****/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood seem to have something of a talent for churning out the most derivative, generic, cookie-cutter films in existence and SORORITY ROW is a case in point. Ostensibly a remake of a little-known slasher from the '80s, it turns out to be another completely unmemorable reworking of the hoary old I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER storyline.A group of sorority sisters (the usual clichés: the sensitive one, the brash one, the slut, the nerd) accidentally kill one of their own and cover up the crime. Whaddya know, years later somebody starts killing them off one by one with the silliest weapon I've seen to date in a slasher: a tyre iron, of all things.Directed by a no-name with a fine-line in copying other people's work rather than coming out with a style all of his own, SORORITY ROW is a complete bore. The characters are intensely irritating, and the script is alive with the same old tired lines and situations. Even for horror fans it's a letdown, with lame stalk 'n' slash sequences playing out in ways that are invariably predictable. Yet another modern "horror" film I'm glad I didn't pay to watch...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Well, to the bitches of Theta Pi, I'm saying farewell."When a couple of members of a sorority pull a mean-spirited prank, one of them ends up dead. The others cover up the incident in order to not ruin their own bright futures. But a few months later they find out that someone knows about what they did, and they're angry about it. Angry enough to kill.Sorority Row is nothing more than another slasher flick where lots of hot chicks get picked off one by one. And it's not a particularly good one, either. Some of the kills are a little cool/creative, but the movie is only entertaining sporadically, and the final reveal of the killer and their motive is outright ridiculous. As are many of the decisions made by the characters. The movie is also far too long, and spends too much time in the inconsequential lives of characters that are kill fodder. If this is on TV and you have a desire to see a bunch of sorority clichés of varying bitchiness get killed, and you really have nothing better to do, it's not a complete waste of time. Just keep your expectations suitably low when it comes to scares, T&amp;A, cleverness, and anything else that the best movies in the genre do so well.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slasher films are not hard to do right. There are just a few ingredients you need to make one that is successful. Classics like 'Friday the 13th' and 'Prom Night' are just a couple of examples of this sub-genre that are exactly what a Slasher film should be. But not everyone has what it takes to make one that works and that satisfies what fans of these films crave. Remakes have become a big thing in Hollywood and most of the classics have already been given this treatment and so now studios are going through the lesser known efforts, some of which that do have small followings. The trouble is that some of these remakes are nothing but watered down, trendy, hollow wastes of celluloid. The 1983 film 'The House on Sorority Row' is hardly a classic of the genre, but is entertaining and has enough talent in front of and behind the camera to be better than average. The new film is more of a re-imagining, but that doesn't change the fact that it belongs in the pile of worthless remakes.Pros: Actresses Carrie Fisher, Rumer Willis, Briana Evigan, and actor Matt Lanter are the only people in the cast to come out of this OK and actually breathe life into their characters. Competently shot and with very high production values. Nice score. A few creative and bloody kills. Pace picks up for the second half.Cons: Sloppily written and filled with putrid dialogue. Aside from the actors mentioned above, the rest of the performances are pretty bad. Painfully slow first half. You will remember little when this is over. Lacks suspense and effective scares. Attempts to be darkly humorous, but fails every time. Really no one to root for.Final thoughts: Look I wasn't expecting a modern Horror classic here, but this film is so problematic that it makes enjoying it near impossible. This is actually almost as bad as the remake of 'April Fool's Day,' which went straight to DVD, a fate this film too deserved. The makers of this film should never ever go near this genre again. You have been warned.My rating: 2/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts with a interesting situation with a prank going wrong. It starts with a surprise and builds a good situation. It really looks funny and intense. The viewers are expecting a jaw gripping thriller.However as the movie progresses it goes downhill. There is total lack of development of characters. There is strange coldness and lack of interest among the girls. Lack of any police investigation after sudden disappearance is also questionable.The girls lack the proper emotions which would have made the thriller much more intense. There is strange coldness in the situation of crisis. According to human nature, people would stick together in such situations and help each others out forgetting their differences for a while or at least try to save their own skin. But on the contrary the girls seems to spend more time in arguing about who is bigger bit** and trying to score off each other. They really don't seem to be in hurry to rush out when finding that some serial killer is on loose or place is on fire. The movie with a same theme could have been made much better by a different director. The quality is dragged lower by mediocre acting and poor sound effects. And following the convention of most of the slasher/ psycho killer style movies, the motive seems to be too weak for committing so many murders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorority Row is nominally a remake of 1983's House on Sorority Row. The plot lines are similar, but Sorority Row ditches the accidental death of the housemother for the accidental death of a sorority sister after a prank gone very wrong. Naturally her sorority sisters cover it up, and everything is just fine until graduation when a mysterious killer emerges to get revenge. Is it sorority sister back from the dead? Is it a crazed relative? Is it a completely random person who had no connection to the initial murder? While this movie does have some nice production values, it is Carrie Fisher who really saves things and manages to steal the movie despite having perhaps five or so minutes of screen time. The other characters are largely one dimensional, and basically those who exhibit typical horror movie behavior that leads to death, do indeed die. As with many horror movies, logic plays no real role here and characters do stupid things just for the sake of the storyline. There is also gratuitous nudity and a lot of gore. Sorority Row is by no means a good movie, but it is entertaining, which is more than can be said for a lot of other horror movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No The kills are not that good (1 or two aren't bad) and if that's all we go to see in these slasher flicks, then this movie fails badly and this genre is no longer swirling around at the top of the toilet bowl, it's headed through the trap and down the drain. This is a HUGE regurgitation of "I know what you did last Summer" and a million others with about 90% of the film rehashed and borrowed from all the other (almost) B-Grade slasher flicks over the last 20 years making this a "D+" crapper flick at best. I have turned off about 6 movies in my entire life. This was one of them. Actually I fell asleep and then turned it off, how bad is that. It would be nice to have someone make a film in this genre that's not just concerned about a paycheck, how little that may have been for the 32 people that may have rented this piece of junk worldwide. The direction Rob Zombie took with the remakes of Halloween 1 &amp; 2 were at least interesting and unique...well done. He stayed true to Carpenter's style instead of raping it for a few greenbacks. Directors and producers of this type of "Sorority junk" will never be remembered for their "work". This genre is now officially filled with too many directors that want the Cole's Notes quick fix to making a horror flick. Maybe I should write "Slasher Flicks for Dummies" (or lazy Directors/producers) just to make a few bucks. Any thoughts</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the stupidest movies I've ever seen(well ones that made it to theaters anyway) The acting is terrible. I still can't believe Carrie Fisher actually decided to do this(she was so good as Leia in the Star Wars movies) but she really really sucked in this. Audrina Patridge doesn't have enough lines so I really cant tell whether she sucked or not. The only acting I found to be even close to decent was Rumer Willis's. Aside from the acting the dialogue was the worst part of the movie. Clearly Screenwriters from were I live can't write worth sh*t. The line "We're sisters. We stick together.", was overused so much it became annoying and I thought; "Ok if they use that line one more friggin time, I'm gonna totally loose it." and of course they did. and how many times are directors and screen writers going to use the same plot over and over again? There's just no originality in it and the plot pretty much just has the girls running around getting picked off one by one. Not to spoil anything but when I found out who the killer was, all I could think was "Why him(or her)." The explanation was just too stupid for me to understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Ridicules re-make of the far better 1983 shocker "House on Sorority Row" has a group of collage girls pull a deadly prank on local lover-boy Garrett, Matt O'Leary, for cheating on one of them in the romance department. Setting herself up for a fake drug overdose in a date rape pill that Garrett slipped into her drink Megan went into convulsions and suddenly died in Garrett's dormitory room.This sick joke went a bit too far when an distraught Garrett seeing his future about to go to hell just lost it and actually killed the very much alive Megan with a tire-iron in an effort to have her body dismembered and buried and kept form being found by the police. The girls lead by ringleader Jessia Pierson. Leah Pipes, are now in really deep sh*t in being responsible in Magen's death even though it was Garrett not them that killed her! With Megan's body hidden in a mineshaft and Garrett now under psychiatric care it seems that Jessica and her girlfriends have gotten away with murder as long as they Ellie Clair Cassidy &amp; Chugs, Rumer Willis Jamie Chung Briana Evigal &amp; Margo Harshman, keep their mouths shut about the entire incident.It's now eight months later, Graduation Day, after Megan's death and strange things start to happen at the collage. This black hooded psycho with a custom made tire-iron, that has nothing at all to do with changing tires, shows up and starts to not only murder the collage girls responsible for the prank that lead to Magen's death but also their their boyfriends and anyone else who knew the truth about what exactly happened to her. As it soon turned out with the body count of those, besides Jessica and her partners in this horrible crime, raising to alarming levels it become very evident that the girl's attempt to keep a lid on what happened to Magen by keeping quite just didn't seem to work! With some of them blabbing about it to everyone within earshot who together with them ended up being targeted by the mysterious Tire-Iron Killer.The explicit gore and violence in the movie didn't quite make up for the many plot-holes in it that you can drive something the size of the "A Train" through. The killings by the Tire-Iron Killer begins to get so predictable, in whom he murders and how gory the killings are, that you became bored of them before the movie is finally and mercifully, for those of us watching, over. The film gets so carried away with its violence that every time to think you know who this Tire-Iron Killer really is he in fact gets brutally murdered by the Tire-Iron Killer! Thus eliminating him or her as a suspect!****SPOILERS*** What's by far the biggest letdown in the movie is its "Suprise Ending" that was to finally show us who this shadowy Tire-Iron killer really is. With all those suspected of being him now dead and buried there's really no one left in the films cast for him to be! P.S It's been reported on the movies comment page that the killer was actually the sorority house's shotgun toting matron Mrs. Crenshaw's, Carrie Fisher, derange and mentally unstable son Eric whom she kept locked away in the basement. Even though Eric or the actor who supposedly played him is nowhere seen in the films credits!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful Combination of "I Know What You Did" with "American Pie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During a party in the Theta-Pi sorority house, the sister Megan (Audrina Patridge) plays a prank with her unstable boyfriend Garrett (Matt O'Leary) simulating an OD after using pills. Her sisters Jessica (Leah Pipes), Claire (Jamie Chung), Ellie (Rumer Willis), Cassidy (Briana Evigan) and Garrett's sister Chugs (Margo Harshman) suggest to dump her "body" in a lake and the stressed Garrett sticks the tire iron through the Megan's chest killing her. Cassidy decides to call the police, but the sisters are convinced to dispose the body in a shaft and keep in secret under the leadership of Jessica that blackmails Cassidy. Eight months later, in their graduation party, the sisters receive a creepy message with the picture of the tire iron in the beginning of a nightmarish night."Sorority Row" is another rip-off of the franchise "I Know What You Did?" and other sub-products of the slasher genre combined with "American Pie", with those sorority houses where the women are stupid sluts and the guys are stupid drunkards. The result is a plot absurdly imbecile and the characters Jessica and Maggie are simply unbearable. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Pacto Secreto" ("Secret Pact")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Theta Pi Must Die!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off with a little bit of good news, "Sorority Row" is definitely one of the BEST horror remakes of the past five years (and all of us horror fanatics know there were a LOT of horror remakes in the past five years). Especially in comparison to other college-slasher remakes, like "Prom Night" or "Black Christmas", "Sorority Row" almost feels like a near masterpiece. Perhaps this is because the makers clearly never intended to aim too high with their film. The original "House on Sorority Row" certainly isn't a classic in the genre and 90% of this remake's target audience presumably never even saw it. This is inarguably the more clever method to do a remake. If you're going to remake popular genre movies like "Nightmare on Elm Street" or "Friday the 13th", there are thousands more people to claim that "the original was much better". Secondly, and even more important, the producers of this film wisely decided to keep this a genuine horror shocker with a good old-fashioned R-rating, rather than a PG-13 without violence, guts or even a minimum of sleaze. This way, "Sorority Row" truly captures the beloved 80's spirit, with nasty killings and bimbo female characters not afraid to show a little bit of T&amp;A. The basic premise of "Sorority Row" somewhat differs from Mark Rosman's inspirational "The House on Sorority Row". In the original, a bunch of pledge sisters accidentally killed their despicable housemother and tried to keep it a secret, whereas in this film the murder victim is one of their own fellow sisters. The rest is pretty similar, though. One of the sisters gets killed during one of the stupidest college pranks in the history of stupid college pranks. Five of the culprits are willing to do everything to get rid of the body and pretend it never happened, so unquestionably they WILL die. The other one insists on doing the right thing and confess, so she still has a slight chance of survival. Eight months later, during the graduation party, the girls all receive a "I Know What You Did Last Summer"-styled text message to inform they must pay for their crime after all. Next thing they know, the girls as well as various other people are picked off by a cloaked maniac with a "pimped" lug wrench for a weapon. Who could be the killer? Did poor Megan return from the dead to avenge herself or did one of them snap mentally? Perhaps their housemother Mrs. Crenshaw found out or maybe Megan's younger sibling Maggie ? who suddenly popped up on graduation day ? discovered the ugly truth? I honestly can't write too much negative stuff about "Sorority Row". It was everything I hoped to be: a non-stop, fast paced showcasing of the clichéd 80's slasher formula! The obnoxious Theta Pi sisters and their beefcake boyfriends are all glorious slasher stereotypes and they willingly volunteer to be massacred in various imaginative ways, like with a flare gun, a liquor bottle or the aforementioned lug wrench. There's bloodshed, nudity (not too much, though) and a vivid supporting role from Carrie "Princes Leia" Fisher as fatigue sorority housemother. Fun stuff.</fullReview>

The story went worse and it remained the same but the ending got WORST. extremely poor and disappointing ending I was forcing myself to watch it. There was nothing interesting left.There were some unnecessary scenes including the shower scene. There were some parts which were interesting, the killing were cruel and I liked most of them but honestly overall, the movie sucked.The best part is its start 10-15 mins.If you have time and nothing else to do AND you have the DVD, you might wanna watch it.

		<fullReview>Like with every film I watch I went into this movie with an open mind but also with hopes that this could turn out to be a really fun slasher film something i haven't seen in a long while. However I was wrong so very very wrong?The film opens with a ridiculous large party that looks like something only celebrities would hold. I have to say most of this movie takes place during parties and they are both stupidly large and just down right silly, don't get me wrong I would love to go these kind of parties but let's be real here guys these scenes defiantly pulled me right out of the film. I really liked the opening style of the credits and the party scene but I quickly lost interest once I saw just how insanely unreal these scenes were. On a good note I did enjoy some of the shots of this film but they were few. Now it's time to talk about the main characters of this movie and to be honest there's not much to talk about. Hardly any of them are really likable most of them seem like they would stab the other in the back without a second thought about it. By having these unlikable characters it means we really don't care about what happens to them which also knocks out any real tension during tense or death scenes. One of the main characters the supposed leader of the group is so cold hearted and numb to every killing and dead body she comes across that it becomes overly stupid a machine would have more heart then her. This film is riddled with silly moments that add nothing to movie, there's nothing here to make us laugh or hide behind our pillow this film just feels empty. The murder scenes feel sort of lazy in some parts and then in other they feel too insane and again silly. The killer's motive for murdering feels like a lazy excuse to have him go around and killing them.Overall this film was a waste of my time and will be yours if you haven't seen this and are planning to. No tension during murder scenes, unlikable characters, ridiculous scenarios and a boring and flat plot line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to graduate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a tiny, otherwise throwaway scene in Sorority Row that pretty much nails the appeal of this particular subset of slasher. As the Rosman University campus erupts in a shower of booze, barfing and bubble-bath during a graduation party, a cowled hooded figure in a black graduation gown wends its way through the throng. Could it be the serial killer who's been picking off the sorority girls and their boyfriends? As the ominous music swells and crescendos, the cowl is suddenly flung off to reveal... a half-naked babe with big jiggling funbags! Wha-hey! And there you have it: the timeless confluence of sex and death could hardly be made more crassly explicit. If only there was as much substance to the rest of the movie.As we join them, the honey pies of Theta Pi, including queen bitch Jessica (Leah Pipes), five-boys-nightly Chugs (Margo Harshman) and bookish Ellie (Rumer Willis) - a "spellchecker with a nice rack" - are playing a trick on Chugs' brother Garrett (Matt O'Leary), who's been cheating on Sorority sister Megan (Audrina Patridge). The upshot of said 'prank' is almost too unbelievable to relate, but there's no taming these psychotic Hollywood screenwriters nowadays, lurking furtively round the Sunset Strip like rabid skunks. Garrett is given some fake Rohypnol by the girls, who encourage him to slip it to Megs. "You get to have sex - and a good night sleep!" as they say. Megs starts foaming at the mouth (all part of the joke, it's really baking soda! Hahahaha!!) and while still feigning death, she's driven to an old disused mining quarry by Garrett and the girls, who discuss how best to dispose of her body. Regrettably, at the point Megan is about to be 'revived', a panicked Garrett plunges a tire iron into her chest to get rid of the air in her lungs so she'll sink better. Better invoke that old Theta Pi motto of "Trust, respect, honour, secrecy and solidarity". In other words, it's ding dong bell, Megan's down the well.Eight tight-lipped months later, on graduation day, the girls' guilty consciences finally catch up with them in the shape of an unseen murderer, who starts picking them off with a pimped-out tire iron. Who's the psycho? A now unhinged Garrett? Megan's newly-enrolled younger sister Maggie (Caroline D'Amore)? Perhaps even Megan herself, somehow returned from the dead to exact her grisly supernatural revenge? And after nearly 101 tedium-filled minutes, will anyone give a tuppenny toss?The derivative 'Row (shower scene with obliging nipple flash - tick; unstoppable killer - tick; bimbettes wearing three-quarters of nothing and their bums literally hanging out of their jimjams - tick) is not only a lame remake of a movie from a widely derided, bastardised sub-genre (a strong exception: Bob Clark's original Black Christmas), it also exemplifies the fundamental problem many have with horror-comedies, being neither funny or spine-chilling enough to convince on either level. If the comedy is tastelessly fudged, the shocks are purely of the jump-scare variety. The makers even successfully argued the BBFC down to get their 15 certificate - that's how seriously it takes its horror. Among the incidental character credits, the likes of "Stoned Dude", "Waster Guy" and "Bra-Clad Sister", is a certain, mystifying "Sea Pig." Type that into Google images, and we can guarantee you that what pops onto your monitor will disturb you more than anything on show here.It does, however, have one ace to play, in the glorious, fiftysomething shape of Carrie Fisher, cameoing as housemother Mrs Crenshaw, a soppy if iron-willed spinster prepared to protect her girls at all costs. "Please don't think I'm afraid of you" she sneers at the advancing killer, "I run a house with 50 crazy bitches." Filmmakers, take note! Whether armed with a double-barrelled shotgun, a rebel blaster or, in the case of The Blues Brothers, a 4-barrelled rocket launcher, a tooled-up Fisher always adds instant value to any movie. If only she could be arsed to script-doctor them all too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of a 1970s drive-in slasher flick is worth watching only if you are not familiar with the genre, which has been (pardon the expression) done to death. Plotwise, it is virtually identical to the "I Saw What You Did" series. A group of mostly bitchy sorority sisters ends up with the death of one of their own on their hands. They cover it up, and soon enough a hooded figure begins stalking them one by one. Who the killer turns out to be is not exactly the most exciting revelation, and the only reason I can think of for watching this cheapo horror flick is all the young, nubile females, some of whom have nude scenes. Also a couple of the deaths are worthy of a Jason flick. Otherwise, steer clear. Leah Pipes is among the cast, and she's fine. Carrie Fisher has a small part as a shotgun-toting mother hen.</fullReview>

There is a reason why she hardly has any lines. And the plot has been done quite a few times. A group of friends accidentally kill another friend and then cover it up. Then sometime later, all the people that know the secret suddenly start dying.The main problem is the deaths are really boring and not much gore. Also, when we learn who is doing it, the reason behind it was so stupid.FINAL VERDICT: this has been done before and a lot better</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*1/2 out of (****)"Sorority Row" is one of those films that is specifically target at a main demographic. Those who beseech only one aspect: to be entertained. As for anyone else who's looking for more than captivity, you're out of luck. Even slasher fans looking for their typical formula: gratuitous breasts and gore, will be severely disappointed. The amount of nudity amounts to a scarce thirty seconds and as for the gore, probably a pint of blood gets on a character's clothing. Anybody looking for a great scare or two, should stick around for the first thirty seconds, and leave. Nobody is expecting high art or new grounds from "Sorority Row", but the fact that a film plays so many clichés, is predictable in every direction, and has lazy characters makes this outing a poor one. Also, any sense of logic is tossed out the window. I think the director solely made this film for the ADD crowd or basically anyone that has nothing better to do. I don't mean to be bashing on this film, but it's hard to find redemption in a film as shallow as this. And, I do like my fair share of slashers, if done effectively. The 1981 cult "The Burning" is a slasher, that I like. It had decent characters, a good plot, clever kills, and some skin. Why can't "Sorority Row" be like this?Okay, stop me if you've heard this story before. "Sorority Row" revolves around a group of sorority sisters that decide two-timer Garret, by making him believe that his girlfriend, Megan is dead. It turns out that the prank went too far and Garret accidentally kills Megan (that's not a spoiler, it happens in the beginning of the movie). Now, the sorority sisters all get a text, saying that someone knows their secret and will make them pay. It turns out that after Megan's death, people start to get murdered. Could this be Megan? Or can this be someone who knows the girls' secret? See, this plot sounded pretty interesting, when it was first called "Jawbreakers", or "I know what you did last summer". Tie in the stuck-up character (ala Meangirls) and you have "Sorority Row". Yes, I'm fully aware that "The house on Sorority row" came before "I know what you did last summer", but having scene both films, none are alike, beside the similarity in titles. Besides the story, the script is inane. This would be acceptable, if the film wasn't trying to be realistic. That's why when a serious situation happens we are thrown over because of the ridiculousness and the whole irony. Or, a potentially good scene, is watered down by a few, forced-in gags that are just redundant and overbearing. The characters, aren't developed at all, and we pretty much don't care whether a character survives or not. Any good kills? Nope. The goriest kill we get, is a slash to the throat, which even then, lacks some blood. Any good nudity? Nope. Yeah, we get some instances of female nudity, but nothing even close to satisfying perverts, as it lasts for half a minute. Any tension? Nope. Besides the inane script and the contrived plot, there are some redeeming qualities. For once, some of the dialogue is witty. I also thought the cinematography was beautiful and the film is very entertaining. Scenes don't lag and your attention is invested in the film.Overall, "Sorority Row" is just another film part of Hollywood's "quick buck" scheme that the targeted audience will inevitably devour. However, the slasher fans are in disappointment and so are horror lovers. Forget about critics. The first minute they laid their eyes on the screen, they already had enough. I don't mean to always side with the critics, but it's because the critics are, a majority of the time, right. They, like us, have had enough with these kinds of films. Can the critics be wrong? Sure. But that's not the case here. "Theta Pie, Says Goodbye" and apparently everyone's involvement and career in the movie is too. Oh the irony.</fullReview>

As a graduate and member of a very large fraternity at a major state university (the kind of school where Greek stereotypes are created &amp; the only kind of school where houses like this one exist- not some tiny liberal arts school or city school somewhere) I can state w/absolute certainty that no national sorority would ever allow a chapter to have parties inside one of its houses.

Eight months later, when they're graduating, someone starts sending them text messages with videos of the killing and saying they're going to all die.Positively insulting redo of "I Know What You Did Last Summer" (which sucked too). The plots are virtually identical with a typically annoying ending when someone who you never suspected is the killer. To be honest the person seems to know things that it would have been impossible for them to know...but I was so bored by then I could have cared less. The plot has the same boring clichés we've all seen--people wander off into the dark alone with no protection; there are ENDLESS stalking scenes; there's the evil rich girl and the sweet one (guess who lives); bloody murders that aren't shocking or interesting; a gratuitous shower sequence to show off nude females and male characters who were hired for their looks and muscular bodies--NOT their acting. The girls are all attractive and might actually have some acting talent but you can't tell by this. I gave up on this movie totally when one of the women is going into the sorority house alone and is warned not to. Her response? She holds up a FLARE GUN and says, "I'm protected" with a straight face! I broke out laughing at that one! This is yet another attempt by Hollywood to revive the slasher film by giving us the same garbage that KILLED the slasher film back in the 1980s! Let's put it this way--the 20 minute or so documentary in the DVD is a hundred times more entertaining than the full movie! Also don't let Carrie Fisher's name being in the credits fool you--she's barely in this. Boring, stupid and pointless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Know What House on Stupidity Row Did Last Summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorority Row (2009) * (out of 4) Remake of the 1983 slasher offers up very little in terms of originality but that didn't stop anything two decades ago. This time out some sorority sisters play a prank, which goes wrong and one of their friends end up dead. Eight months later, before leaving school, they decide to have a party and someone shows up and starts killing everyone off. Even though this is a remake of THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW, it comes off more like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. The original movie featured a twist that anyone could see coming and while the mystery here is hidden a lot better there's still no way to recommend this film outside die-hard fans of the genre. I must admit that I hated every single character in this movie and that's not good because even the most brutal horror films usually have at least one person for you to care for. I thought the females here were all incredibly mean spirited and I personally think it's a bad thing when you want to see the victims get murdered because of how much you hate them. Even Rumer Willis' character, the good girl who only wants to do what's right, came off rather bland and bad to me. I could almost overlook the characters but the screenplay, as poorly written as it was, has one dumb moment after another and by the time the ending came I was rolling my eyes and really starting to lose my patience. There wasn't one character that came off as a real human because of how badly written they were. The stupid things they did just made them look even worse. Some might be saying all horror films depend on characters doing stupid things, which is true but the ones here don't do a single thing right. Willis, looking and sounding eerily 100% like her mom, doesn't come off too bad here but no one in the cast really stands out. The violence doesn't contain too much blood but the kills themselves are rather brutal and mean. The film at least tries to be a throw back to the real years of exploitation and we're even graced with a shower sequence, which certainly needs to make a comeback in the genre. The direction is pretty much all over the place but there's one very effective scene where a character finds herself down a mine shaft. More scenes like this one were needed and a lot less was needed of drunks playing it cool.</fullReview>
