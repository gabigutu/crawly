		<fullReview>I caught this movie on VHS in the early 90s, having Missed it in the 80s I don't know how? I just re-watched it tonight, and I must say YES its a typical 80s slasher movie but it has great Humor and great suspense and A really creepy Killer.The music just adds to the suspense and mood. And you have to love 4 out of 5 Doctors, the house band at the girls party! Just check out that dudes hair!If you like your Horror served straight up ...and you are tired of what Hollywood has been releasing as suspense/horror these days, go rent HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW, pop some popcorn, turn out the lights, and put on some candles, just don't watch it alone,especially on a College campus!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A creepy slasher movie. Positive nostalgia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The House On The Sorority Row" came in the right moment; the early 80's.The "Friday the 13th" franchise commanded the slasher explosion by 1983.Tons of slasher movies were released but only few are still in the memory of horror fans. "House On The Sorority Row" may be one of those films that are still remembered and recurred for some slasher fun. The plot is somewhat inspired by Friday the 13th. The movie starts with Ms. Slater giving birth to a boy... Sadly, she has to abort due to some difficulties. Twenty years later (or more)Ms. Slater -now the owner and director of a sorority house for girls-is killed by the sorority girls. The girls killed her accidentally as they were planning a prank on her. These girls try to hide Ms. Slater's dead body outside the house. Unfortunately to them, the body disappears and suddenly these girls and their boyfriends start to disappear. One by one, these teens are brutally murdered inside and near the Sorority house. Katie Rose (one of the girls that had to do with the murder) finds 2 dead people and believes that Ms. Slater didn't die and now is doing the murders. Katie goes with the Doctor that 20 years witnessed Ms. Slater's abortion. To Katie's surprise, the Doctor confessed that the child didn't die and probably is living inside the house.Katie and her boyfriend especulate that Ms. Slater's son watched her mother being killed and now is taking revenge. Katie realizes that her friends are still on the house and their lives are in risk. Could it be that Ms. Slater came from the grave and is taking revenge? Is it possible that Ms. Slater's son is alive? Katie and her boyfriend return to the house to solve the mystery and stop the killing spree. Witness one of the most shocking and terrorific endings in slasher cinema."House On The Sorority Row" delivers a great slasher experience as it's gory, suspenful, and very well directed. The acing and fun factor are interesting as you can imagine the outcome of the movie but you're never sure about it. The best thing about the movie is the creepy atmosphere. You can say the girls are terrorized while being inside the dark, big house.This movie was the producer's first and last experiece in the industry. I think these people had a good potential in the genre. This movie is buried in the slasher cementery, just behind the precursor franchises of the genre. 4/10 Overall. On the slasher rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very good slasher film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>another comment said it best a hidden little gem, The House On Sorority Row is a classic horror film, movies like scream and most of all I Know What You Did Last Summer ripped this off, a bunch of Sorority girls pull a prank on the old women who runs the sorority they by accident kill her, and dump her body in a pool that is filthy so they think for the time being the body will be safe there since nobody will swim in the pool, well the body turn up missing and the sorority girls are getting killed one by one. the acting was not that bad at all, and the directing was solid, this is a fav of mine, if you can find it rent it, if not if you have a dvd player buy it, if you're a fan of 80's horror you will love this classic horror film i know i do, i give The House On Sorority Row 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an above average slasher film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The House on Sorority Row is one of the better tales of vengeance in the slasher genre.Sorority girls pull a prank on their house mother, only for her to end up dead and the girls left in a world of trouble. They believe they have covered up the crime, but when night falls someone begins to seek murderous revenge against the sorority sisters. Questions abound, but will anyone be left alive to answer them?Between director Mark Rosman and a decent cast, this low-budget horror tale rises above many of it's kind. Rosman makes the most of the filming locations while nicely adding stylistic touches to the film with good camera work and some nice imagery. He creates some truly effective moments of psychological horror, as well as physical (with some occasional bloody moments). Ultimately the film manages to build to some good suspense and a claustrophobic finale! Also of note is the lavishly wonderful music score, which provides some beautiful and haunting themes for the film.A worthy (and under exposed) horror outing for genre fans! Check it out.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What it lacks in originality it makes up for in competence and entertainment value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Halloween' certainly inspired many other movies, but some of those films even inspired some themselves. Without 'Friday the 13th' we wouldn't likely have 'My Bloody Valentine' and without 'Black Christmas' we might not have 'Silent Night, Deadly Night.' Roger Corman produced many great cult films in the 1980s, some of which imitated other films that were great hits. The 1982 Slasher flick 'The Slumber Party Massacre' was his contribution to the sub-genre and would make way for a few similar films, such as this little known one. Like 'Slumber,' 'The House on Sorority Row' involves a bunch of young women partying it up and being slaughtered. Sounds like good times, which for the most part it is.Pros: Fine job done by the cast, and surprisingly the characters are not really interchangeable. A score that's often eerie. Moves at a good pace. Doesn't take itself too seriously. Plenty of creepy sequences. Writer/director Rosman gives the film more style than it deserves. He also creates some suspense.Cons: Nothing new here. Too many characters, not enough time to really get to know each of them. Pretty dated, especially because of the band playing at the party. It's not much of a mystery who the killer is. Disappointing end.Final thoughts: This is pretty much a case of "been there, done that," but the film isn't a total washout. You can tell the people in front of and behind the camera were having a good time and trying to make the best film they could. I wouldn't go out of my way to get a hold of a copy, but if you love 80s Slasher flicks like I do then give it a chance.My rating: 3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good 80's slasher flick that is a must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of your typical 80's slasher horror flicks similar to "Prom Night", "Friday 13th" and all that goes with it. A group of teens dicide to have a party at the owners expence and find out how mean she is when she does not like their behavior. The teens try and get even with the lady by accidently shooting her in a swimming pool and she later comes back to life and kills the girls one by one. This movie is fun to watch but it lacks more explanation as to who the killer really is. After all the girls are dead and only one is left, we find out that her friend the doctor had something to do with "bringing the old lady back to life". Then in the end we find out that it may be her "long lost son" that could have been the killer. Or was it the doctor himself? That was the only part of the film that I couldn't get. Other than that..... I liked it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O.k., lot of alot of elements here! (scream, i know what you did last summer) but in early 80's fashion. This is a pretty good little horror film that i actually enjoyed. Starts out in June of 61' when a woman is giving a painful birth on a dark and rainy night. Speeds up to present day (82). A group of seven college graduates plan to throw a farewell part in a old looking house on sorority row. The house mother gets a little upset (the woman in the beginning giving birth). The plan of the party is shot down. But the girls plan a prank that they think will be a funny sweet revenge, that backfires into a total no laughing nightmare. The house mother is shot dead, so the girls hide her lifeless body in the swimming pool. And proceed on with the party. Then the body turns up missing, and the body count starts. Victims are being stalked and killed. Only thing is The house mothers dead body is found in the attic. ummmm. I wonder if this has anything to do with the beginning!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The House On Sorority Row:" A House Worth Visiting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The House On Sorority Row" is above your average slasher flick. It's up there with "Halloween's" followers like "Friday the 13th," "Prom Night," "My Bloody Valentine" and "Sleepaway Camp." Unlike most slice-and-dice movies, "The House On Sorority Row" actually has a plot, some good acting from the cast, a mysterious killer, and it's not that bloody.The plot revolves around the 7 girls of Theta-Pi sorority: Katey, Vicki, Liz, Diane, Stevie, Jeanie and Morgan. At the end of their college days, the Thetas decide to have one last fling before they go. However, their evil house mother, Mrs. Slater, is willing to do anything to stop the festivities. But that doesn't mean that the Thetas don't have a plan of their own. They decide to pull a very cruel prank on Mrs. Slater, which is guaranteed to work perfectly. But the prank goes too far, and it results in Mrs. Slater's death. Afraid that the police will suspect them, the girls hide Mrs. Slater's body in the pool. They will have their party and will get rid of the corpse in the morning. Unfortunately, somebody knows what they did, and that person decides that they're going to make the girls of Theta-Pi pay for what they did."The House On Sorority Row" is very similar to "Prom Night" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer." However, "Prom Night" and its successor were there before the 1997 box-office smash.The cast is well-chosen with Kate MacNeil as Katey, Eileen Davidson as Vicki, and the rest of the sorority girls are not bad."The House On Sorority Row" does have its flaws, but they are only minor. One of the girls has almost zero lines of dialogue, the film drags just a little bit, and it's so obvious that Lois Kelso Hunt's(who played Mrs. Slater) voice is entirely dubbed, since director Mark Rosman says that her voice was not scary enough for the role. But I did not pay attention to these issues, and I really enjoyed the movie.The result: Sometimes, what a slasher fan needs is a little bit more than just a hack-em-up film. Some genre fanatics might look for a slasher-thriller. "The House On Sorority Row" is that movie. It offers suspense, a little bit of gore, some of the inevitable female nudity, good characters and a creepy villain. Not to be missed.***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better sorority slashers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>House on Sorority Row is not just some of the some ol', same ol' as we've seen before with sorority slasher movies. The movie is based on a group of seven sorority sisters who are all just about to graduate college and they come up with the idea of throwing an illicit party at the sorority house. If the girls just could have gotten the blessing from their sorority mother, who is Mrs. Slater, this party would have worked out. Instead, Mrs. Slater won't allow any such party under her roof. Mrs. Slater wants the house to be vacant during that weekend- and you'll find out why later. The girls decide to rebel against Mrs. Slater's wishes, particularly Vikki, who is played by Eileen Davidson. By doing so they all participate in a prank targeting Mrs. Slater. However, this prank takes a turn for the worst. Soon thereafter, these college babes come up missing. It then turns into a tale of whodunit. Solid direction, which is done with such finesse by Mark Rosman.I liked the idea of the killer in this one, who uses a sharp cane for the weapon of choice. Some memorable death scenes are a decapitated head found in a toilet bowl and various stabbings with that cane that I had just mentioned. There are plenty of genre flicks that deal with this same topic. Those that I am referring to are: PROM NIGHT, SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE, SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE and THE INITIATION. The House On Sorority Row isn't anything groudbreaking, but it does still satisfy us bloodhounds out there. The script is original, the suspense scenes are built up with the proper tension and there is a satisfactory amount of blood; however there could of been more. In addition, I thought that the cast did a better then decent job on the acting duties. The budget DVD is worth getting. The uncut version is now available for the first time in the U.S., which does include the extra cinema shots of Vikki getting stabbed to death. Previously, this was unattainable in the U.S. I give it 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better than average slasher flick about a group of sorority babes who accidentally kill someone during a prank and try to cover it up. Later they're murdered one by one by until the inevitable 'final girl vs the killer' showdown all these things seem to have. It's a good movie of its type with some humor and gore (although probably not enough to appeal to gore hounds). Starts out with some Miss Marple-type music that, back in the day, had me double-checking the VHS label to make sure I had the right movie. The cast is pretty good, with early roles for Eileen Davidson and Harley Jane Kozak, and a nice leading role for Kate McNeil. My favorite scenes are Eileen Davidson showing off her breasts and the Sea Pig scene. Given her age you would assume Lois Kelso Hunt (playing the sorority's house mother) was a seasoned pro, but her acting is so bad that she's outshined by everyone in the cast. Even the Sea Pig. There's also a corny band that screams 1980s. It's a fun movie, if you like '80s slashers (which, I assume you do or else why would you be watching this). Might lose a little punch if you've seen a lot of similar movies that came after. Oh, and avoid the 2009 sort-of remake at all costs. It's garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found these film in one of those 4 movie sets on ebay, produced by the obscure Hollywood DVD. I wasn't too keen on watching this one, though when I read the plot I felt like maybe it was worth the watch.The film is fairly well done for what it is, an independent low budget slasher. It has a great memorable theme tune and an interesting plot, though a very stereotypical one of an '80s horror.A group of girls grow fed up with the house keeper, the aging Mrs Slater. A prank is pulled, though she ends up shot with a pistol. Her deformed child watches this whole event through the window, and starts picking them off one by one with a sharp object. Elements of Friday the 13th pop up at the end when we see him in a toy's mask.Overall, it's a good film, if you're willing to accept the times and budget. The main character Katherine is played by a decent actor, and if you liked the movie "I Know What You Did Last Summer" then you may enjoy this one.I hope you benefit from my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive, considering. - Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this on a 2-in-1 DVD and watched it just last night, and have to say that for what I was expecting I was pleasantly surprised.As with any slasher, the story isn't overly complicated, although it does a good job of setting up a plausible scenario for the teens/twentysomethings in a big house being slowly stalked by something horrible.Basically, the girls have finished university and want to have a party in their sorority house, but the house mother won't allow it - for some reason she always shuts the house earlier than all the others (Mystery and intrigue? You got it by the bucketload :). Led to revolt by Vicky, the girls play a prank on the house mother but it goes wrong, and then, at the party, the girls start disappearing...The film has some good characters - for once we don't have an utterly virginal heroine whose morals are her strength. Instead we have several girls, most of them scared enough by what is happening to follow Vicky, the rebellious and selfish one, and the heroine as the only one who sees that Vicky is actually quite a stupid and uncaring bitch of a character.By far my favourite bits were towards the end where the heroine has been injected with sedative and starts to space out...some relatively simple effects are used very well to create a thoroughly creepy build up to the finale.My only criticisms of the film would be the ending, which seems somehow incomplete, and the killer's weapon - a walking cane which, while distinctive, just doesn't instill any fear in the viewer.But the effects are great, there's some nice little set pieces, and overall I'd definitely recommend any slasher fans to watch it. It urinates from a great height on every slasher flick released in the last couple of years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parochial, begging for parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine how low the bar was set in this field, that relatively early in the slasher something like this passed muster. If you want a prototype example of what is completely cliché and uninspired about this type of film, look no further. We tend to idealize originals and chide remakes for pilfering artistic vision, but this is no less of a soporific cash-grab than the 2009 remake.A bunch of sorority girls planning a party, a prank gone awry, the evil house mother. We see a girl put on lipstick (bright red), and she's the first to die. One of them is the bitch, the ring leader, another is the good one who tries to dissuade the rest.It doesn't take a genius to make a film like Scream then. Only someone with basic observation skills. The only difference between the Wes Craven parody and this, is that Wes Craven understood how laughably derivative a lot of this is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorority Slasher flicks, you've got to love them, The House On Sorority Row isn't your normal sorority slasher flick though, this one actually has a story, and believe it or not, it's actually a very good one. A couple of sorority girls accidentally kill their housemother and soon enough the girls start disappearing one by one. You can really feel the tension between the girls and everything is very well done even though the movie is fairly predictable.Now, while other sorority slasher flicks tend to be very tacky with lots of female nudity, this one is actually very stylish and we only get to see two girls get naked (sorry guys, but it'll just have to do). The movie is brilliantly directed and the photography is so incredible that this movie could've been made today. Oh don't you just love these high budget slasher flicks?The acting is actually very good, Eileen Davidson whose great during her short time in this film, All in all, The House On Sorority Row is a highly entertaining slasher flick with a very clever story, even if very predictable. If you, like me, love high budget slasher flicks with a little brains, this will most likely entertain you as much as it entertained me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seems to be a lot that people have to say about this movie, and I will make no exception of this- but I must cast my foot squarely in the camp that says that this was a great 80's slasher flick.If you look for shocks, then surprise: there are shocks.If you look for gore, then surprise: there is gore.And there is suspense, and there is pretty people all about.This was, after all, what 80's slasher horror was all about. Do not forget that the proliferation of these films in the 1980's was no mistake: if you watch this film, you can watch it either for a good startle, a good lark, or merely as a study in the culture of the time.Prom Night, Friday the 13th, Halloween...all of them say something about us between the late 70's and the late 80's- a loss of innocence, a loss of restraint, and the depreciation of the antiquated values that came with a homogeneous and repressed society.In all of those cases, the gloves came off with these slashers; what made this one unique was that it did not swamp us in sequels which repeated the message. Culturally, this study of privilege, of deception, of 'sisterhood,' and yes, even of vengeance stands well because it stands alone.I will not ruin the movie for anyone, for clearly there are enough spoilers on here if you wish to ruin the surprise of the movie- however as my younger sister, an anti-80's slasher horror critic said to me after watching this one day, this is one creepy, scary movie! If you let yourself enjoy it, and enjoy it for what it is, and what it says about the time before computers, you may just agree!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Slasher Mainstay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a seemingly innocent prank goes horribly wrong, a group of sorority sisters are stalked and murdered one by one in their sorority house while throwing a party to celebrate their graduation. This film has become a standard among the slasher subgenre and is beloved by many. It remains popular today (2016) even as the remake is already forgotten. And this is despite the complete lack of notable names attached.What is interesting is the score. The film's music score was written by Richard Band and performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The Washington D.C. based powerpop band 4 Out of 5 Doctors appears in the movie, performing several of their songs. Band is mostly associated with Full Moon, his brother's company. But this film shows he is a good composer in his own right and not just blessed by nepotism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't very scary, but it's never boring. The basement and the climax have tension, but the rest of the movie just isn't scary. In fact, there are more funny moments than scary ones: some girls at the party gush over how cute an average guy is when he gives the goofiest, cheesiest smile imaginable; Mrs. Slater tries to be intimidating, but the acting just comes off as cheesy.There are some things that are confusing: the prank scene and Eric. When Vicki points the gun at Mrs. Slater, the girls think it isn't loaded because Vicki said it wouldn't be. She then points it at a lamp post and shoots it, breaking the glass. A friend comes up to stop her, and Vicki shoots her in the leg. They then reveal that it was a prank, and Vicki wasn't really shot. Then the gun goes off and Vicki accidentally shoots Mrs. Slater for real. What was really in her gun? Blanks, bullets, or a mix? If Vicki shot her friend with a blank, then where did the fake blood come from? And how did the lamp break if she was using blanks? For the lamp to break, she had to have been using at least some real bullets, but the movie never really explains how all this happened. The second confusing thing is Eric. The doctor says Eric died at birth and Mrs. Slater just pretends that Eric lives to make herself feel better. But during the climax, Katie fights the killer, who appears to be a man, and Ms. Slater seems to have been dead the whole time. If this were true, then how would the doctor have not realized the baby was alive? The baby he delivered was either already dead or died soon after, certainly before Mrs. Slater woke up. So assuming she got her baby back after for a funeral, the doctor should have realized the baby was alive. If this is what happened, the movie didn't make the twist very clear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The House on Sorority Row is a classic low-budget Eighties slasher, but its got a genuinely creepy-as-hell ending scene... let's just say it's got a clown involved.Anyway, the plot follows a gang of girls living in a sorority house, under the thumb of strict Mrs. Slater, an old woman with a haunting past. When Vicki gets caught having sex and Mrs. Slater pops her water bed on purpose, Vicki decides to play a mean prank on the old lady. Unfortunately it all goes very wrong, and soon the girls are being picked off one by one at their own party.I loved this movie; sure it was kinda cheap but if you're a fan of the slasher genre you'll probably love it, too. It has cool soundtrack, decent-enough acting and a good story to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Go check out by the pool..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Full of eerie imagery, suspenseful murders and performers that are perhaps a tad better than you might be expecting, "The House on Sorority Row" is a subtle and slow-burning, but to me extremely effective slasher flick that is now one of my favourites, but for the longest time after I first ever saw it as a little kid all I could remember of it was that I liked it a lot, but nothing else except that an old lady was forced into a pool at gunpoint, and that it had a fat guy in said pool who says "I'm a sea pig!" And when I randomly got the cheap DVD that just happened to be it, it was the coolest thing as it got to the scene and I realised that it was the movie that'd been at the back of my mind for so many years. And it turned out to be a real diamond in the rough and my yearning to see it again was very well-founded. It's a very solid and entertaining slasher, one that I personally feel is very unfairly underrated and overlooked. I think it has a superb atmosphere of haunting dread and a level of sustained suspense throughout that I find quite brilliant. The cinematography is really beautiful and the look of it has a great use of shadow and light which gives it a certain weird crisp atmosphere that helps create a generous amount of creepiness. Its look is very sleek and bright-looking, but also shady and sinister. It's visuals help to set it apart and make it more distinctive from its more formulaic and forgetful brethren that were around in abundance at the time. The attic set is especially spooky with the children's toys and clown motif which is of course a little foreshadowing with the name "Eric" spelled out in toy blocks for a moment in the background. The film is also helped enormously by the score of Richard Band which gives it a lot of soul and depth that I don't believe it would've otherwise had. Just imagine it without the music. *Not* pretty.. There really isn't all that much to it, it is a very simple and straightforward venture and is definitely no gorefest by any stretch of the imagination, in fact with the killings it's mainly what you thought you saw, as it mostly cuts away or is done off-screen. So what? It's kind of got its own special thing going on and isn't just about waiting to see how many gruesome ways in which a bunch of random people running about can die! I mean yeah, obviously it's not a great deal more than that, but it's very well-written and tight in construction, with an engaging pace that flows nicely as well a strong compelling quality to its story that keeps me engaged the whole time and I've never got sick of it yet, I find it satisfying on all the levels that I think should count when it comes to a slasher movie. At least it tries to be a mystery by never completely revealing the killer and keeping you guessing until the end, and I love that about it, although as a kid I never quite grasped that it wasn't Mrs. Slater, even after they find her body.. I think it still does a good job of misleading the audience. And I found the group of girls likable and interesting enough, everybody had a good chemistry together, I bought them as friends. And although nobody was exactly brilliant or anything, to me they seemed like characters that actually had a little character or at least it was better than what you'd typically get from this kind of movie. I don't even mind the obvious dubbing of the puritanical house-mother, it's great fun to laugh at and it kinda makes the flick feel like a Japanese movie at points! The acting was good from pretty much all involved, with the big gaping exception of Jodie Dragie as "Morgan" who was a total airhead and had the acting talent of a porn starlet, which leads me to suspect that the only reason she was ever in the movie was perhaps because she was 'humping' Mark Rosman! The awesome moment when she blurts out: "How do we know she *IS* alive!?" is hands-down the most hilarious part of the movie and just has to be one of the all-time great terrible line-readings ever, it's that bad it's funny. Even Eileen Davidson chuckles at it on the commentary! No surprise at all that it's her only ever film credit. Take a bow, sweet Jodie! And Kate Mcneil was a good lead but I really couldn't stand her, she was so irritatingly goody-goody! Even though she's technically right about what she's saying, the way she delivered her lines just made her come off as a big 'ol stick-in-the-mud to me and she went a little overboard with the whole responsible one thing.. I thought she was great at the end when things get a little bizarre and she's all doped-up and lures the killer to the attic with the ominous musical jack-in-the-box just like his mother used to... And I still find the ending to be great and pretty unforgettable. When the jester unexpectedly lifts its head up is still one of the most chilling moments in horror movies for me. A little more jester would've been nice, but it's still an effectively intense climactic scene for the movie. And that's something else I love about it, the way it leaves things on a strangely satisfying ambiguous note where things are not looking particularly bright for Kate! Love this movie, I think it still stands as a superior little slice of this particular branch of the horror genre. Now "Get out of my house!" G'night folks!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Not Bad 80's Slasher Flick!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1983 horror film stars Kate McNeil, Eileen Davidson, Harley Jane Kozack, Christopher Lawrence and Lois Hunt. This begins in 1961 with housemother, Miss Slater (Hunt) in labor and ends up losing the baby after her doctor, Beck (Lawrence) tries to save it. Over 20 years later, Miss Slater starts to have a mental breakdown and the girls in her sorority start to get concerned. McNeil plays Katherine, Davidson (The Young &amp; The Restless) plays Vicki and Kozack (Arachnophobia) plays Diane. Soon, Vicki decides to play a mean prank on Miss Slater for ruining her date and it goes too far when she accidentally dies. The girls become hunted by a killer and start to wonder if she's really dead or not. This isn't bad and if you enjoy horror/slasher films, you may want to check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vintage 80's Slasher-horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is exactly the type of film that embodies the 80's slasher-horror genre.This film has great atmosphere, suspense, and some great kill scenes.While the mystery and the twists are easy to see coming, that is mostly the fault of the genre over-doing this in the thirty years since this movie was released. Spoilers:As someone who has seen a lot of horror movies, I fully expected the killer to be someone else other than the mother. Early on, I never assumed the pregnancy had ended in a stillborn baby or anything like that. The movie does a good job of trying to get the viewer to buy that it is the mother who is borderline psychotic, and had I not been fully expecting a twist, I would have followed that line of thinking.The acting is good enough for a movie like this. I think sometimes people expect Academy Award-winning acting out of horror movies and I think they miss the point. The acting isn't intended nor does it need to carry the film like in a drama.The death scenes are done very well. In the age before CGI and multi- million dollar horror films, the production crews of these films had to use their minds to figure out how to do the impossible; kill someone on screen. Movies like this and Halloween do the death scenes very well. Action-in-the-shadow is a simple yet effective technique, as are the quick shots of someone getting stabbed. The shots are quick enough so the mind can't register that you are in fact looking at a fake body or a fake weapon, but just long enough so you see the person getting it.I really can't fault this film for anything that other reviewers did. Maybe younger people, who didn't live in the 80's wouldn't appreciate something without top-notch effects or gallons of fake blood...I don't know.Anyway, this is a classic slasher-horror film, before the genre got stale (forever) with constant sequels and remakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly eerie, and at times atmospheric low-grade 80's slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the 70's - an amazing decade for cinema as it saw a new age of violence and depravity erupt onto the screen which could never have been dreamed of before with slashers like "Black Christmas", "The Toolbox Murders" "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Halloween" and exploitation films such as "The Last House on the Left" and the notorious "I Spit on Your Grave", the 80's was geared up for some awesome massacres... with "Friday the 13th" (An awful film), "My Bloody Valentine" and "Prom Night" to start things off, and then along came first-time director Mark Rosman who wrote and directed this low-budget slasher "The House on Sorority Row". It would be impossible to count how many low-budget and sleazy slashers were churned out over this decade, but although it's a fun enough movie to watch, it's far from one of the best and is actually quite tame when compared to many of the others.But that being said, I don't think many could match the creepy atmosphere and eerie dread that hangs over this film (Quite similar to that of "Black Christmas") Whether it was intentional or not, it just works very well and it surprised me to be honest, because I was expecting this to be pure crap. The plot is basic enough - a group of sorority sisters want to throw a party in their sorority house to celebrate graduating from college, a few of them are now going onto law school. However, the mean house mother, the creepy Mrs. Slater, won't allow it, and after ruining a passionate moment between one of the girls and her boyfriend, the girls decide to take revenge on Mrs. Slater by playing a prank. However, it goes wrong and Mrs. Slater is killed. But instead of reporting it, the girls agree to go on as normal and hide the body and have the party. But Catherine is reluctant, and it ruins her blind date. The girls are horrified when the body ends up missing... and then someone begins to stalk them around the house, killing them one by one with the very cane that Mrs. Slater used to walk around with...It's predictable enough, and as soon as we are shown the attic turned into a children's bedroom, we can tell straight away who the killer is. But Rosman is clever here in that he doesn't show us straight away the killers face or anything. And that was what made this all the more creepy and enjoyable. The music is superb, echoing the eerie atmospheric score from "The Amityville Horror" a few years previous. The acting is pretty crappy, but hey, who watches these films expecting Oscar-winning performances? And surprisingly enough, there isn't much nudity for what you would expect from a slasher film about a sorority house. It threatens to really run out of steam halfway through, but then with the arrival of the doctor on the scene, things begin to pick up again. The violence isn't very brutal, and some murders are only shown as shadows or off-screen etc. however there is a cool scene where the cane is hurled through some random fellas throat and the scene with the head moving in the toilet in the hallucination was very well done and displayed the extent of the special effects that were on hand here for Rosman. Rosman has gone on to just direct crappy romantic and family comedies. Overall, although being far from one of the better 80's slasher films, it's still worth checking out for the atmosphere and eerie music and twist ending. It could be said that it owes a bit to "Black Christmas" but it does enough to stand out on its own two feet all the same.</fullReview>

But that is what most slasher movies from the 80's were. The plot was good, so I give it 9 stars. I also like the creepy clown costume. I thought the costume was a little scary and I did jump once when he came from behind that curtain. The part with the doctor was a bit obvious. It was clear he didn't call the police. I haven't seen the remake and now i am not sure I want to. They ruin everything now. I don't know if it is worth the $10 it cost for matinée.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, bad killings, damp sex!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This slasher pic from the 80's is fondly remembered by fans of the genre - but not by many others. Which is a shame - this film is on a level with the original Friday the 13th, way behind Halloween and probably a bit better than Prom Night.Anna Friel-lookalike Kate McNeil (who she?) is terrific in the role of helpless sorority girl regretting her past and looking to be a lone survivor amongst all the slashings going on around her. Yep - Jennifer Love Hewitt's role from I Know What You Did Last Summer. But McNeil was there first. She went on to appear in a Walton family TV movie and crap film extroadinaire Glitter. But she's picked a good one here, so all is forgiven for future cinematic or televisual manure.So what will your date or your mother or whoever you choose to show it to, get out of this one?Well - the acting from virtually all concerned is pretty much OK, and sometimes even convincing.The plot can be dealt with in a sentence of course. I'll do that now, but won't give anything away - honest. This is the basics. But if you don't want to hear anything at all, then look away now as it's a***POSSIBLE SPOILER SCENARIO*****Sorority girls in baby doll outfits (OK then - often in baby doll outfits, but not always)kill old owner of the house they live in and the stalker that comes back could or could not be this old owner back from the dead. She was also a mad old owner with a viscous-looking walking stick -so it could well be a possibility worth considering. The mad old owner also once had a difficult labour (of the baby kind - not political party or hard kind)and the doctor who was present at the time still hangs around. Bizarre huh? Take your pick as to who's killing the semi-dressed girls. Or go for another option. The choice is yours!***POSSIBLE SPOILER ENDS*****There - told you. One sentence. Well, nearly. And only a bit longer than the word count needed to describe the plot of Prom Night or Friday the 13th part so and so (all of which I love by the way - don't get me wrong!).What else do you get to see? Oh yes - sex on a water bed that gets very wet. Some pretty unexplicit killings, of the family-orientated kind. Well, maybe not family - but of the drunk teen kind for sure. And a nice music score with rubbish 80's pop band in the middle.The bit where our heroine waits in a darkened room, doped up, for the killer to arrive is also very effective. Worth watching for this almost surreal sequence alone.Good acting, bad killings, damp sex. Nothing new here for an 80's slasher movie. Oh - apart from the good acting bit of course.Your date will LOVE this movie - or hate it. But hey - if he/she hates it and you love it then what are you doing sharing a sofa together in the first place?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best 80's slasher films ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After accidentally killing their house mother, following a prank that backfires, seven sorority sisters decide to dump her body in the filthy pool, but attempts to dispose of it goes haywire, when guests for their party they are throwing on campus after the rest of the college kids have left arrive for the evening. However their deed doesn't go unpunished, when a maniac, armed with the house mothers cane, uses it to his/her bloody ends, dispatching them one by one &amp; dumping their bodies in the pool, while the remaining girls attempt to save themselves &amp; figure out who's doing it &amp; end the maniacs bloody crusade. But the big question is did the sorority house mother really die? or did she live &amp; is now out for revenge? (an incident in the films prologue causes her to become somewhat unhinged &amp; capable of murder, as we find out after the opening scene). HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW is easily one of the best horror films ever released in the eighties! unlike most horror entries released to capitalize on the horror movie craze of the 80's, ushered in part by Friday The 13th, SORORITY ROW is a fine example of a really good horror film, tense set-up's executed with style, suspenseful build up's before the characters demise, plot twists, the requisite amount of creative kills, nudity &amp; gore &amp; enough jump out of your seat moments to please even the most demanding of horror buffs. The acting &amp; directing is also a big plus here &amp; it also helps that the cast is attractive (the sorority sisters are gorgeous!) A must see for horror fans, with an entertaining &amp; interesting plot twist. Despite it's claims as a remake, the 2009 film just called SORORITY ROW is not a remake of this films plot &amp; merely borrows a few character traits, the house name &amp; carries a very thin plot to this films about an accidental murder committed by the girls who pledge to cover it up &amp; never speak of the incident, only to be picked off by a maniac eight months later, while brandishing a home made tire iron &amp; not a Caine.**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie from the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see this movie and actually was able to go to the house where it was shot. A huge brick mansion. If I remember it right, it used to be the old summer home for the people who owned either Hecht Company or Holchild Khone stores in Maryland. A huge house and grounds, with a huge built in pool. This place was beautiful!!!! Land everywhere, you could not see any main roads at this location. The movie is one of my all time favorites. Something to watch on a rainy night, or just anytime. Of course we all know who Eileen Davidson is from The Young and the Restless. Yes she does show some skin in this one. There were other soap-opera stars as well. Harley Jane Kozack played a great part. I have this movie on VHS and I would love to see it on DVD. Does anyone know where I can pick it up on DVD? A great film to see once, or many other times. I just love it. The house now is still standing, however, it's been sold off as flats. People purchased them and they live there. I would love to see it now.</fullReview>

This little gem is now available in the UK on budget priced DVD and is well worth checking out. Good direction, casting and an interesting plot make this excellent viewing for fans of this horror sub genre ! Even though this film does not have any "Hollywood stars" in it - the general level of acting is far superior to many of the other low budget slasher flicks of this period (many of them were dire...) This film is beautifully photographed and makes excellent use of its "Big old house" location. Check this movie out - NOW !!!</fullReview>

Some of the murders were well shot, but again a different weapon might have made the gore a lot more interesting.The ending was stupid. A typical attempt at a dramatic finale leaving the film open for a sequel was totally ruined.

		<fullReview>Sisterly spoilersHOUSE ON SORORITY ROW starts off promisingly: the acting ain't bad. The camerawork is good. And the set-up is plausible. So I had high hopes for this film while watching it but then suddenly it turned bad, FAST! I have no idea why the quality of the film deteriorated so quickly but it happened right after the stupid scene with the woman who was attacked by the mysterious killer and helped by the film's heroine safely back into the house, only to have to watch the woman not go where the people were or where the party was happening but go alone in a bathroom on the deserted second floor, is when I gave up on it. The scene is just plain STUPID. The filmmakers wants us to believe that a woman who was attacked by a total stranger, didn't seek refuge where it would have been impossible for the killer to attack her again? Come on. But the scene in the bathroom itself is terrible and we've seen it a million times already. The rest of the film is pure junk. The gore effects were terrible. The hand that got stabbed looked like it was made of papier maché. In fact, everything involved with prosthetic effects looked like they were made of clay or papier maché.The really crappy thing about HOSR is the heroine. She was a freaking pain in the butt with her noble and stuck-up attitude. The actress who played her, Kate McNeil, wasn't that good or interesting. Eilein Davidson should have been the heroine. She would have been a formidable heroine. I wanted Kate McNeil's character to die a slow and miserable death.The direction and the script are at fault here. No one behind the caneras understands horror. The sub-plot with the doctor locking up the entire house was pointless. Scenes of McNeil having hallucinatory moments were truly laughable and amateurish. Hard to believe anyone thought those scenes were effective or added anything to the film. The many moments with the girls trying to get rid of the body reminded me of WEEKEND'S AT BERNIES. And the ending in the attic is unbelievable stupid and ineffective. No suspense or terror. And the very last shot of the movie, after the heroine made the killer fall from the attic down to the next floor, and the body of the killer is not moving or anything but then his eyes suddenly open. That's it. That's the last shot of the film. What happened after that? Did the killer murder McNeil's character ( I hope so)? Did the killer in the clown suit ran away and joined the circus? Did the two get married? Was the ending done in preparation for an eventual sequel that never happened(Arf!)? The whole ending left me with a big "Huh?" That has got to be the lamest ending I've seen in a horror film, and I've seen a lot of them.To add more kookiness to this already wretched product is the undeniable feel that while I was watching HOSR I was actually watching a Brian De Palma movie. Then I read somewhere that the director of HOSR used to work with De Palma. Wow! No wonder HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW starts off great and ends miserably. It's a Brian De Palma trademark: aside from CARRIE, all of De Palma's movies have great beginnings, lousy endings. If I had known that the director used to work with De Palma, then I probably wouldn't have bothered to watch this flick.</fullReview>

They decide to throw a party like a day or two later and suddenly a mysterious murderer who wears a cool looking jester costume begins killing them one by one. The acting was pretty bad for this film but I guess it was just the 80's style of having bad acting. The whole setting screams the 80's and it really does well just like The Burning and Nightmare on Elm Street. Most of the kills in this movie are off-screen which is kind of a disappointment but they are at least creative for what it. I also really enjoyed the ending as well I mean it was honestly my favorite part of the whole film! This movie gives the viewer a really good time as it takes each character and kills them, unexpectedly. I give this film an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

There is a strong performance from the leading lady and she makes it more enjoyable but every other actors (and their characters) are sub-par. Of course, that wouldn't matter if there were some laughs or great special effects or a decent storyline however there are none of these either.As with most slashers it's quite predictable and the majority of characters do stupid things to get themselves into positions where they can be killed for the viewer's pleasure.The storyline is very unlikely (an accidental killing gets covered up by a group of sorority girls, with none of them thinking it better to go to the police to explain) and the ending is totally rubbish, silly and lacking suspense.For a one-off watch it was OK but not worth a re-view, apart from the slightly creepy scene in the attic in the last 10 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid slasher entry which is far more than the sum of its parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat down to watch this not really expecting that much. I am a fan of Slasher movies in general and movies from the Slasher Golden Age (1974 ? 1984) so came across "House on Sorority Row" by simply going through the back catalogue. One quick look at the lurid cover, the title, and a quick scanning of the plot I figured I would quickly be struggling not to turn it off from being bored by pedestrian acting, woeful direction, and a plot that was exploitative and, even worse, cliché?even back in 1983. Still, in the interests of better understanding the genre, I decided to give it a go and must admit to having been very pleasantly surprised.The house in "House on Sorority Row" has been occupied for the past few years by a group of average, fun-loving, all-American college girls who are keen to organise an end-of-year party. However, for the past few years they have had the misfortune of being supervised by the mean and austere Ms. Slater who forbids the party going ahead. Undeterred, the girls decide to play a prank on her which goes horribly wrong and results in the death of Ms. Slater. The girls try to hide the body but as people start being brutally murdered the girls begin to wonder if Ms. Slater did indeed die or if something more sinister is responsible.The movie has all of the plot devices of a bog-standard slasher: anniversary of a gruesome event long kept secret, hot teenage victims who question authority, imaginative kills, and the final girl. However, the movie does a good job piecing these tropes together and, with the respectable performances from (most of) the cast, a good use of location, and a reputable directing job, manages to establish characters early and build the atmosphere into a suspenseful and watchable slasher thriller.Sure, there are better films in the slasher genre (obviously the likes of 'Black Christmas' (1974) and 'Halloween' (1978) as well as lesser-known slashers like 'The Burning' (1981))?but then again, there are many, many worse films you could spend an hour-and-a-half with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above average slasher.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The House on Sorority Row" is one of the finer examples of slasher films, a genuinely creepy and moody movie with a particularly ominous and mysterious killer. The story is one of those "prank gone wrong" deals: fed up with their crabby, odd duck of a house mother, Mrs. Slater (Lois Kelso Hunt), a group of sorority sisters decide to pay her back for spoiling their fun. When the prank results in Slater's death, the girls go out of their way to cover up their mess, not knowing that somebody else witnessed the whole thing from an attic window and is coldly determined to make sure THEY pay a steep price. Writer / director Mark Rosman, who amusingly enough went on to direct things like 'Lizzie McGuire' and "A Cinderella Story", started out working for director Brian De Palma, and brings a fair amount of style to his story, not content to go with some of the clichés of slashers. For one thing, he wanted his victims to be culpable individuals, and not get punished for such arbitrary things as premarital sex. He also was determined to have a downbeat ending unlike much of what we see in slashers, although his preferred resolution ultimately got cut down. Some good black comedy and tension arises over the matter of what to do with Slater's supposedly dead body; for example, the girls getting nervous over the possibility of somebody turning on the lights for the pool where the body was dumped. There's some real atmosphere and spookiness to some of the suspense sequences, some delicious hallucinatory visuals (after the last one standing has been given a sedative), and a killer whom we never really see; they're most often behind something or wearing a mask and/or costume. The extent of whatever problem they have is never given much detail, except of course for the potential for violence. There's a mild bit of gore, although nothing in the way of bare female flesh. The acting is better than usual for this sort of thing, with co-stars Kate McNeil, Eileen Davidson, and Harley Jane Kozak going on to success in both movies ("Monkey Shines" for McNeil, "Arachnophobia" for Kozak) and soaps such as 'As the World Turns', 'Days of Our Lives', and 'Santa Barbara'). Hunt indeed has the right look for Mrs. Slater, although she would be dubbed in post production as it was felt her real voice wasn't intimidating enough. A big part of the effectiveness lies in the lush music score by ever reliable Richard Band. And the movie also shows, once again, just how incredibly formidable clown get ups can be in this context. Newcomers to slasher films are strongly advised to check out "The House on Sorority Row" and have some good chills. Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Intriguing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly Intriguing 'House On Sorority Row' isn't just another sorority slasher flick where beautiful barely legal girls run from a killer in their underwear. Well OK it is that. But it's a good one.What makes the film work is the surprisingly very talented actresses. The characters are one dimensional. Nothing beyond being mere slasher victims. But the great acting makes us really care about whether or not these girls die. That's a rare achievement for a slasher film. The photography is also above average. Another RARE achievement for Hollywood.The plot: Standard but interesting. It opens in 1961 when Mrs. Slater (although the film establishes she's never been married that's what she's called) undergoes an experimental fertility treatment. After a troubled birth the mad scientist doctor lies and says her child was still born.In 1983 Mrs. Slater is an overly strict sorority mother always harassing her girls.She even threatens to ruin their graduation party. It makes us question why knowing how mean Mrs. Slater is, they want to have their graduation party in the sorority house at all? The girls plan to "prank" Mrs. Slater using a boyfriend's .45. Was the sorority hosting meetings of the Second Amendment Sisterhood? When the "prank" ends with a bullet in Mrs. Slater while their party guests arrive, the girls quickly dump Mrs. Slater in the pool.The film moves quickly and 2/3rds take place during the party. Mrs. Slater's corpse pulls a 'Diabolique' and vanishes but new corpses male and female start to pop up during the party.I won't reveal it but you should be able to guess whom the killer is. And it's not Mrs. Slater.The film has more boobs than blood and it is very entertaining. Especially by sorority slasher standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nifty little early 80's college-set slasher flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The seven lady members of the Theta Pi Sorority accidentally kill their overbearing shrew of a house mother Ms. Slater (a memorably huffy Lois Kelsa Hunt) and try to dispose of her body by hiding it in a filthy old pool. Unbeknownst to the girls, Ms. Slater has a hideously malformed son named Erik (the creepy Charles Serio) who doesn't take the news of his mother's untimely death too well. In fact, Erik proceeds to exact a harsh and bloody revenge on the girls by bumping them off in assorted gruesome ways. While it's admittedly routinely plotted and predictable, this cool little slasher feature still makes the cut thanks to Mark Rosman's stylish and assured direction, a respectable body count of nine, several gory kill scenes (said murders include an iron rod in the torso, a steak knife in the neck, and a cane whacking to the head), sound acting from a capable cast, Richard Band's splendidly eerie and elegant orchestral score, a smidgen of gratuitous nudity (the luscious blonde looker Eileen Davidson is notable in this department as the slutty Vicki), a reasonable amount of tension, Timothy Suhrstedt's lush, handsome cinematography, and a few inventive oddball touches (a severed head in the toilet, the heroine confronting the killer while tripping on hallucinogenic drugs). Moreover, this film warrants extra praise for departing from the slasher norm by not presenting the main female characters as your usual innocent lambs brought to the slaughter; instead these gals bring what happens upon themselves. Above average of its type and well worth checking out for fans of 80's slice'n'dice low-budget horror flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ After recently viewing the terrific documentary "Going to Pieces" about the rise and fall of the slasher film, I got a bit nostalgic for those days gone by. There were only two films mentioned in the entire documentary that I hadn't seen and I am currently rectifying that situation. One of those films was The House on Sorority Row. This particular house on sorority row is filled with lovely coeds who just want to have fun. Too bad mean old Mrs. Slater sees things differently. She doesn't want them to have a graduation shindig in the house and proceeds to kick them out. The girls decide to pull a prank on the wicked house mother and things go downhill from there. It's one part Slaughter High/Terror Train and one part Black Christmas. It seems to be held in high regards by both fans and critics alike. I don't agree. I saw nothing here to separate it from the hundreds of other titles in this sub-genre. No outstanding kills, no tension, no future starlets, and no iconic stalker. I've seen much better and expected better from the other reviews. Pass this house on by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will always have a special place in my heart for The House on Sorority Row. Back in 1982, my father was vice president of a small company in Washington, D.C. called VAE (Visual Aids Electronics). They had contracts with all the major hotels in D.C. to provide their audio visual equipment for all the meetings and conferences that were held there (microphones, TV's, overhead projectors). The company was doing so well, that the president of it (John Ponchok) wanted to branch out and try different things. They started a record company (which failed miserably), and then wanted to try their hand at producing movies. Their first (and only) project: The House on Sorority Row. Filming took place during the summer of 1982 in Baltimore, MD. One day during the summer, my father drove me, my sister, and my mom out to Baltimore for the day to watch them film the movie. I was 7 at the time. We watched them film the scene where they had just shot Ms. Slater, and they were trying to revive her by the side of the pool. I had a blast. I remember meeting some of the girls, and the lady that played Ms. Slater. Later in the afternoon, my family and I were taken up to the attic where the final scene takes place (I'm not sure if it was Mark Rosman or not that took us up there). While my parents were talking with whoever took us up there, I was cruising around the attic on a toy pedal tractor that was up there. In the movie, that same tractor that I rode on is used by the character Peter. One more thing. When they are trying to revive Ms. Slater by the side of the pool, one of the girls screams "Oh my God, the band's here!" A shot is then shown of a station wagon and a white truck coming up the driveway. That white truck was actually one of VAE's old company trucks that they lent them for the scene. After they were done using it in the film, my father bought it from VAE to use as a moving truck for my family's move to Northern Virginia that summer. After we were done with the move, we parked the truck in the woods below our house where it rotted away for the next 15 years, before it was finally towed away to the junkyard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The house on Sorority row" or "House of Evil" as it was called in Europe is one of those slasher movies of the early eighties that seemed to have missed the boat and sunk with little or no recognition, which is a shame because it's one of those well made, well acted, once off little movies that deserves to have made it up there with many of its contemporaries like Halloween or Friday the 13th and in this case is far better produced than many of Friday's sequels. The story, set in and around a house on Sorority row centres on the "house mother" Mrs Slater who, for some strange reason, closes down the house every June 19th. This year however, due to insufficient funds, 7 of the house girls decide to throw their graduation party within the house grounds. Mrs Slater is furious and after catching one of the girls in bed with her boyfriend (The obligatory sex scene) she decides she's had enough and rips the girls water bed to shreds. Some of the girls plan a revenge prank that goes horribly wrong and Mrs Slater winds up shot. Panicked, they dump her body into the swimming pool to hide it till the graduation party is over but in the tradition of Lois Duncans novel "I know what you did last summer" someone knows their secret and is out for blood... The movie contains some genuine suspense scenes and the acting overall, is above average from the supporting cast to excellent from the lead heroine Kathryn MacNeill (Monkey Shines). Unlike other slashers of the early eighties this actually has a good storyline with plenty of plot twists and red herrings, reminiscent of the more recent slasher flicks in the "Scream" vein. You can actually notice movies like this one as well as "Final Exam" "The Prowler" "Prom Night" etc cropping up in Kevin Williamson's ("Scream" "I know what you did last summer") stack of work and you can see how these movies have influenced the structure of his screenplays. Well worth renting if you're a fan of the genre or even if you just want to see a good murder mystery with an extra dash of blood on the side for gory measure!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Classier Slasher Films of Its Time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surely one of the few great early '80s slasher films, "The House On Sorority Row" is a clever and entertaining horror movie that seems to have been long forgotten. The film centers around Pi Theta sorority, where a group of girls have just finished up with college and plan on spending their last week at their sorority house to throw a party before heading off into the real world. Much to the dismay of their grumpy housemother, Ms. Slater, the girls decide to throw the party anyway, and come up with an elaborate prank to play on their cold housemother. But they soon regret it when the prank goes awry and Ms. Slater ends up dead. In a panic, the girls hide her body in the stagnant backyard swimming pool until their party is over, and plan on disposing of the body later. Unfortunately for them, Ms. Slater's body seems to have disappeared in the middle of their party... and someone who saw what they did is starting to murder the sorority sisters.In my opinion, this is definitely one of the top ten slasher films of the decade, along with a few select others. Directed and written by Mark Rosman, "The House On Sorority Row" is a neat and thrilling horror flick that seems to have gained little attention or recognition, but really deserves it. For one, the story is original. With shades of Bob Clark's "Black Christmas", the script is actually pretty solid and has very little problems. Sure, it's a slasher picture, but there is actually quite a lot of originality in this one, mainly because of the incident that precedes the murder rampage, and some great touches that make this a creepy little flick that stands out among the bunch. The camera-work is professional-looking, I'd never have guessed that this was a rather low-budget film, because it doesn't look it. Director Rosman obviously knew how to make a nice-looking film. It's quite creepy as well, and the film manages to balance an even amount of shocking moments, some believable violence, a couple of very well-written plot twists, and sufficient suspense fused with hysteria - all the things that you need to make a good horror movie, it's got them!Surprisingly, the acting isn't half bad either. The cast is mostly made up of unknown actresses, but they all give decent performances and were actually quite convincing for the most part. Kate McNeil plays our leading heroine, the 'good girl', and has a pretty decent performance throughout most of the film. The rest of the girls who make up the sorority are all decent and give good performances. One thing I liked about the film was how the characters responded to the situation, which was in a realistic manner. They aren't your typical slasher film female characters, and each of them had different and well fleshed-out personalities, which was nice. There is plenty of gore in the film as well, but the kills aren't overdone, and while some of the special effects are a little dated, most of them are still convincing. The film's big revelation/climax is unfortunately predictable (I was expecting it from the beginning) and that is the film's biggest downfall. But it does come together nicely enough and ends on a very creepy note.To sum things up, "The House On Sorority Row" is a wonderful little horror movie that should be much more popular among genre fans than it is. I'm not sure why this film isn't more known-of, one would think upon viewing that this would be remembered as a prime slasher classic. I'd definitely advise horror fans to seek it out, it's a rewarding and underexposed film that is worth seeing, I consider it one of the best slasher films of its time. Sure, it has a few little problems here and there, but what '80s horror film doesn't? Overall an excellent and memorable slasher picture. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Sorority Lambs to the Slaughter?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"House on Sorority Row" appears to be one of the more decent early 80's slashers, thanks to a good pace and a reasonably high body count, but that's sadly all just a very misleading first impression. The more you focus on the clichéd and thin storyline, the more it gets overly implausible and stupid. Writer/director Mark Rosman tries hard to keep the actual identity of the killer a mysterious secret, yet even to the most brainless viewer it's already obvious since the chilling pre-credits sequence. Mrs. Dorothy Slater is your stereotypical unpleasant sorority housemother. She forbids the girls to organize parties, or to invite boys to their rooms and she even doesn't allow them to use the pool. During the stupidest college prank in the history of stupid college pranks, seven graduating girls accidentally kill her in the backyard. Six of them are willing to do everything to get rid of the body and pretend it never happened, so unquestionably they WILL die. The last one prefers to call the police and confess, so she still has a slight chance of survival. Shortly after, the girls (and some random idiotic guys) turn up dead in all the corners of the house. But...who's killing them? Could it possibly be Mrs. Slater's hideously deformed &amp; maniacal progeny that she somehow managed to hide in the attic for 20 years without anyone ever noticing it? Yes indeed, this movie tries to make you believe that it's perfectly possible to keep a monster silent for several years while there are constantly attractive and scarcely dressed coeds hopping around the hallways. Yeah, right... The rest of the film is frustratingly mediocre. The murders aren't very spectacular, the acting varies from adequate (lead beauty Katherine) to plain awful (that's you, Morgan) and there's not as much nudity as you'd expect to see in a dorm slasher. The camera-work is rather professionally handled most of the times, providing the stalk-'n-slash sequences at least with a tad bit of suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK time killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this one. The setting and story remind you of Black Christmas, one of the very best horror/slashers ever. I'm also a somewhat fan of slasher films, such as Friday the 13th and Halloween, I find these films to be pleasant time killers. But bad slasher films are simply the worst kind of films you can watch. I found The House on Sorority Row to be mediocre all the way.The acting is generally OK, in comparison to most other films of similar nature. The murder scenes are a mixed bag. Some are quite gripping while others are just plain bad. Director Rosman has an adequate feel for creating an overall uneasy mood by use of camera-work and lighting etc., which was used to more brilliant effect in Black Christmas. But he isn't as good at sustaining it as Bob Clark was. The film just becomes a routine slasher, with all the familiar settings and executions. The final showdown is fairly tense though, not too logical but that's maybe not why we watch these films in the first place.In the end I guess I got what I wanted, a pleasant enough time killer. It's just that I thought this was going to be a little different. Aside from a few artistic touches here and there, this film falls completely in the Friday the 13th vein rather than unjustifiably comparing it to superior stuff like Black Christmas and the original Halloween. It's just not that good.</fullReview>

Sure enough, they start getting killed one by one. As can be expected, there's some nudity - plus some drinking; remember what they said in "Scream" - and the strict lady's history eventually gets revealed. Although "The House on Sorority Row" isn't anything great, it's certainly enjoyable, and that's what counts. Seeing that the movie got filmed in Baltimore, I now wonder how it would have come out had either of Baltimore's famous directors (Barry Levinson and John Waters) directed it.Anyway, nothing special, but entertaining.

		<fullReview>Actually this is one of the best sorority house slasher flicks, and overall a solid slasher feature. The plot has a strong and obvious reference to "Friday the 13th" but you need to see why. Everything starts in black and white scene where Mrs. Slater has (supposedly) an abortion. Years later we learn that Mrs. Slater leads a sorority house of hot slutty girls. The relationship between Mrs. Slater and the problematic girls is not the best and the best example is the prank they throw at her.The prank goes too far when after menacing Mrs. Slater with a gun and making her falling to the house swimming pool, she ends getting shot by accident (and the gun was supposedly not loaded).The cynical girls decide to hide Mrs. Slater's corpse in a dumpster! Yes, besides cynical they're stupid. Why hide it there?! And hours later they decide to throw a wild party. Now that's what I call cold hearts.As night passes, these girls, their boyfriends, and some unfortunate guests start to get killed by an unseen shape that uses Mrs. Slater's cane. As you might expect there is a tender and clever girl that didn't want the homicide to happen , and now with all the killings she regrets for it. But this girl has the chance to stop everything when she discovers the dark secret of the house on sorority row...DEATH SCENES/GORE If you watch this movie is mainly because of the death scenes, that's no mystery. Here you got plenty of brutal stabs but minimal gore. It works for the movie. To my surprise, most of the death scenes are very well done mainly because there's suspense behind them. NUDITY There's little nudity but plenty scenes of girls wearing minimal clothes and a not so explicit sex scene in the beginning between Vicky and her boyfriend. Not much to dig in. Mrs. Slater enters the room while they're having sex and interrupts them. Probably that's another reason why she got shot.DIRECTION/SCORE For being a low budget, Mark Rosman did a very good job. There's tension, suspense, and a chilling ending. I like the killer's POV in the death scenes and the scene where the Doctor is killed is absolutely well done and chilling. Good job! The score also deserves special mention because it's chilling and sometimes offers catchy tunes.Overall this movie is a must see for die hard slasher fans. It offers the necessary death scenes, nudity, and suspenseful scenes. The ending is one of the best in the genre. If you are afraid of clowns then you need to watch it. Enter this sorority house, you will get more thatn you expect.</fullReview>

It keeps you guessing as to who the killer might be, There are a few choices and you never sure if it is the head lady of the house or one of the girls or a guest to the party...I mean its pretty well done in that regared.

		<fullReview>(*** out of *****) A group of sorority babes pull a prank on their mean (and slightly unhinged) house mother, Mrs. Slater, and, wouldn't you know it, it backfires and Slater winds up bound in blankets at the bottom of the dirty swimming pool out back, dead. Or is she? Desperately trying to cover up the accidental murder and host an end-of-semester graduation party at the same time, this becomes the question of the night, especially when Slater's body disappears from the pool and, one by one, the girls start disappearing as well. The first half of this college co-ed slasher covers pretty familiar ground (bodies floating in a pool, a head stuffed in a toilet), but it really kicks into high gear in the last twenty-five minutes or so, when the story takes a rather-unexpected turn and the suspense is cranked up five or six notches. Most of the acting is okay, but, unfortunately, some of it is absolutely God-awful (especially Lois Kelso Hunt as Mrs. Slater -- for one thing, her voice sounds more badly dubbed than an extra from "Godzilla vs. Monster Zero," and talk about stiff acting! An upright piece of wood could have delivered a more emotional performance! Granted, Rosman should take some of the blame for less-than-stellar dialogue.) Kate McNeil does better as the goody-two-shoes heroine Katherine Rose, but soap opera star Eileen Davidson is the most fun to watch as Vicki, the most ruthless and immoral of the sorority sisters. Christopher Lawrence also stars as the shady Dr. Nelson Beck, who acts no better than the conspiring, self-serving sorority girls. Rosman worked with Brian De Palma before writing and directing this film, so he has some experience creating suspense.HIGHLIGHT: Heroine McNeil is drugged by the unorthodox doc and used as bait to lure the killer into his trap. Between Kate's bizarre hallucinations and the fear of what's to come, this is a very tense and creepy scene and shows the closest resemblance to a De Palma-crafted atmosphere of dread. Also -- beware of clowns!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potentially good slasher flick falls short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"House On Sorority Row" is one of the many nearly forgotten slasher flicks from the genre's golden age in the early 1980's. Directed by Mark Rosman, a former protege of Brian Depalma, "House" is a refreshingly stylish film from an era that produced mostly crap. IN fact, the most frustrating aspect of this film is just how good it probably could have been. Despite the lively direction and strong performances, the film eventually falls apart thanks to a clumsy and often laughable screenplay that does nothing to further what is actually a fairly clever story. The film's aforementioned strengths, also aided by a classy score from Richard Band, keep this movie from sinking to the level of such trash as say, "The Burning". Rosman's stylized direction shows plenty of DePalma influence, but flare can only carry a movie so far before it is at the mercy of the script, and this film has far too many moments ranging from contrived to downright silly that prevent "House" from being elevated beyond the status of a marginal slasher flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House on Sorority Row is basically your standard 80's slash flick. Now I love 80's slash flicks, but this one wasn't very good even up against those standards. Sure it has a slasher, some T&amp;A, and cheesy dialogue, but it was missing something. It just seemed empty. The story was pretty stupid and the killer wasn't all that. I'm sure the writer thought it was a great twist or something, but just put a guy in a mask with a knife and I would have loved it. A movie that just ends, because it hit the 90 minute time limit and they ran out of ideas. Watch at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new but still one of the more enjoyable entries in the slasher sub-genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a prank goes wrong a group of sorority girls end up killing their domineering house mistress and are forced to hide the body. Soon after the girls start being systematically dispatched by an unseen murderer.The premise may not be particularly original and the film adds nothing special to the horror genre, yet strangely the film is extraordinarily captivating and stands up well against the flood of similar films from the Eighties. Without attempting to over-complicate matters with preposterously impractical plot-twists unlike so many other slasher films, writer and director Mark Rosman seems to be completely aware of the limitation of the material. He obviously sought to provide genre fans with a simple slasher based more on character development/interaction rather than an overly implausible storyline and, one can argue, that he accomplished almost everything he set out to do. Granted, the characters were nearly entirely clichéd and there were sporadic moments of insignificant dialogue but even so, there are no more faults with this slasher than with one of the other supposed elites of the sub-genre - 'Friday the 13th' (1980). In fact, one could even be of the point of view that 'Friday the 13th' is made to look inferior by 'The House on Sorority Row'. 'Friday the 13th', although fairly unnerving in places, was always rather slow and attempts to build tension occasionally fell flat because the direction and excessively methodical approach to building this tension forced the movie into featuring inherently tedious sequences. On the other hand, 'The House on Sorority Row' may be lacking in any real scares, but the movie is paced and directed well meaning that there are very few scenes that end up being tiresome. It is doubtful that anybody would be immersed in this movie to the degree that one could become engrossed in Bob Clark's 'Black Christmas' (1974) or Michele Soavi's 'StageFright' (1987) but there are certainly enough pleasant aspects for the average slasher fan to be impressed to some extent.The acting performances, while of no real distinction when compared to similar movies, were of a high enough quality as to not negatively affect the movie in any real way. The performances were all of standard B-movie quality but helped to make the movie nonetheless. Despite a silly plot-twist towards the end, 'The House on Sorority Row' is recommended to slasher fans and casual horror fans looking for something a little obscure. An impressively written and directed slasher film which despite a run of the mill premise and occasional flashes of scrappy dialogue is able to impact on the viewer and become an enjoyable experience. My rating for 'The House on Sorority Row' - 7/10.</fullReview>

From start to the end there are obvious mistakes through out this film, look closely i counted about 15 things that contradicted the scene before. The acting seriously sucks big eggs and the storyline was so dumb it's unbelievable. The first scene shows the lunatic mom give birth and is told her son is dead, but hang on wait, he was living in her attic for 20 years and she didn't even know. Don't even bother!

		<fullReview>The House On Sorority Row is one of my favorite slasher films of the 80's and i beleive that I Know What You Did Last Summer ripped this film off big time. Its about a group of sorority girls that accidently murder their house mother. After disposing her body they are stalked by someone who witnessed their crime. its not overtly gory but the death scenes are great and convincing, there is plenty of suspense and you are always kept hooked. It is well worth seeing for all slasher movie fans. Its also intersting to see future actors in their first roles like Harley Jane Kozak (Aracnaphobia) and especially Eileen Davidson who plays Kristen Blake Black on Days of Our Lives. See it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing about this slasher flick in a reference by Randy in "Scream 2" I just had to see it. I borrowed it from a friend and was pleasantly surprised. I suddenly compared it to a recent slasher pick, "I Know What You Did Last Summer". You see, the story picks up where 6 sorority girls who are about to graduate decide to play a prank on the house mother who is cranky and weird...and wouldn't let the girls have their party on campus. But accidently the girls kill the house mother and don't want to get into trouble so decide to dump the body somewhere and never speak of the incident again...later on in the movie someone "who knows" what they did to the house mother comes back for revenge, sort of like "Friday the 13th Part 2" or "Scream 2", the killer has a good motive, it all has to do with family. I won't spoil the ending for you but...you'll never guess who the killer is...I loved it. Have Fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downright boring and mundane Slasher.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently revisited this one after years of not seeing it, but after seeing the remake, I thought it was best. I've seen a lot of positive reviews from fellow Horror fans calling it clever and humorous, well the only thing I got out of this was pure boredom. I didn't care about any of the characters, I didn't care for the sly humor it had, nor did I get any thrills from it what so ever. The best scene by far has to be the opening with Mrs Slater and the miscarriage with her baby, that actually had a little bit of suspense in it. I actually get a kick out of some 80's horror slashers because some of them are delightfully cheesy, but this tried to be ahead of it's time and turns out just plain dull in my opinion.Bottom line. Poorly acted, no scares, no likable characters along with a dull pace, sink this one rather quickly. The remake was no great shakes itself, but at least it was funner to watch. 80's Horror fans may wanna check it out, due to curiosity reasons, but I wouldn't advise it.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic from the golden age of slasher pics, The House on Sorority Row is one of the better psycho-killer movies that followed in the wake of Halloween and Friday the 13th.Directed with surprising style and confidence by first-timer Mark Rosman, this horror film tells the story of a group of sorority girls who accidentally kill their house mother when a prank goes horribly wrong. They decide to hide the body in a stagnant swimming pool (an idea lifted from Les Diaboliques?). Then they begin to die one by one?The cast deliver convincing performances ensuring that tension is kept fairly high throughout the 91min running time, and Rosman's assured direction keeps the film ticking along nicely between death scenes. In fact, it is the death scenes themselves that keep this movie from being wholly successful. The murder scenes, usually the raison d'?tre for this type of film, are not overtly gory or particularly inventive and may disappoint the real gorehounds looking to see some splattery effects. That gripe aside, there is enough to recommend about this horror flick to make it worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great slasher, a good contender...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This decent little slasher movie from 1982 is one of the best of its kind, neatly produced and directed with finesse by Mark Rosman. There are two slightly different versions available in the UK, the first was the original release under the alias, HOUSE OF EVIL, which was cut by three seconds and had a slightly different ending. The second and easiest to get a hold of is the more recent budget DVD version that contains the full print, as it was unleashed overseas. It missed the boat slightly with audiences and therefore was soon forgotten, only managing to be distributed via a small label. However it should be noted that this is a fine example of its genre that has just the right amount of gore, suspense and scares. It starts with black and white footage set in 1961. A pregnant woman, who we soon find out to be Miss. Slater (Lois Kelso Hunt), moans in agony as she wriggles anxiously in bed in a dimly lit room. Dr. Beck (Christopher Lawrence) arrives and quickly sets to easing his patient and explains that there `might be a chance'. A little later, the woman awakes from her sedative; her eyes greet the medic's as he watches over her. `Where's my baby' she inquires impatiently. The solemn doctor shakes his head sympathetically, `I'm sorry Miss. Slater'. Her hysterical screams shatter the tranquil night sky? Skip to present day and that same woman is now a housemother to a small sorority. We are then introduced to seven young girls who have just graduated and are almost ready to leave their classes to journey into adulthood. There's Kathryn (Kathryn McNeil), Vicky (Eileen Wood), Liz (Janie Zido), Jeanie (Robin Meloy), Diane (Harley Kozak), Steevie (Ellen Dorscher) and Morgan (Jodie Draigie). The girls are planning an illicit party in the house but we learn that Slater is by no means the fun loving kind and she wants the girls out of the house immediately and there's no way in the world that she's going to allow any celebrations under her roof! The gang choose to stay a few more days anyway and tension begins to rise between them and the middle-aged housemother. It boils to a head when she catches Vicky fornicating with her boyfriend and she slashes the girl's waterbed with the sharp end of the cane that she always carries with her. Vicky swears that she'll get revenge and the next day they decide that a good old-fashioned prank is the best way to avenge her embarrassment, all except Kate that doesn't much agree with the idea but plays along reluctantly. If you haven't already guessed, the prank backfires and Slater ends up weighted down and dumped in the murky pool! Scared and confused, the girls decide to hide the body and carry on with the party so no one gets suspicious until they can decide what to do. Later that night the get-together goes ahead as planned, but about halfway through, a reveller is murdered with that aforementioned cane. It looks as if they didn't kill the elderly nut after all and now she's a little more than annoyed. Will the girls make it through the night without falling prey to the cane-wielding killer?This movie manages to add all that's needed to make it the closest contender to the fear created by Carpenter in HALLOWEEN. There's a touch of whodunit and a well-portrayed journey into terror as an unseen psycho murders the girls remorselessly. There's a mixed bag of performances on offer, with McNeil satisfying mostly as the virginal heroine, only weakening in places towards the climax. Wood shines as ?queen bitch' Vicky and although Lawrence is fine as the solemn Doctor, Hunt camps it up as the unruly sorority mother unsatisfactorily. It looks great on DVD with bright colours and decent lighting at night. This version includes the complete murder of Vicky, which originally missed her getting hit in the eye with the cane. There's also the classic decapitated head in the toilet and the use of child's toys being found before the victim's demise. Yes, that old chestnut that was later evident in both CURTAINS and BODYCOUNT. The score is also an eerie operatic success that haunts the initial shock factor throughout.Rosman's direction is polished and extremely credible. He places the camera in similar situations as Scott Spiegel did with INTRUDER at times, really excelling himself with his perfect timing for horror filmmaking. Most of the murders are shot using shadow work, the best being when Vicky is butchered and we get to see the killer for the first time, only he's shrouded by silhouette and complimented by a creepy night sky. Towards the end when Kate is sedated she begins having strange hallucinations, seeing the bodies of her friends and Miss. Slater appearing and disappearing in front of her. Later she sees the eyes on Jeanie's decapitated head open and stare up at her, it's good work from the FX team too. He also isn't overly keen on gore so we only get brief flashes of blooded corpses, but just enough to satisfy all you bloodhounds. The suspense created during the heated chases is riveting and he doesn't waste time attempting popcorn jumps, instead he works patiently to build a surrounding terror that grows. He had previously worked with Brian De Palma whose tutorage is evident throughout, mostly in the use of the score and the length of his shots. After this he began working on the fairly decent zombie flick MUTANT in 1984, but walked out early into production only to be replaced by John Caroos. I'm not sure why he left, but it was his last dabbling with the horror genre.Although the plot is hardly original, it was an obvious inspiration for the more recent I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and was also mentioned in SCREAM 2. This is probably the best depiction of the over-crowded ?prank that backfires' plot outline and should be remembered for that accolade. It makes good use of the clichés that weren't overused at that time, especially with the open ending and the killer donning a clown costume in the closing finale. It looks as if a sequel may have been a possibility if the film was successful enough, but it's probably better that it didn't escalate into a series, I mean, most slasher franchises generally don't take long to loose steam and fall into horrid mediocrity. If you're a fan of slasher movies there's really no excuse not to own a copy of THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW, especially now it's available on a budget priced DVD. It's a great example of the genre that certainly doesn't fail to satisfy. Although it looses pace a tad in the middle, it doesn't take long to build it back up and you'll definitely be impressed by some of the polished direction. If all the genre pieces from this period had been portrayed as well as this one, it probably wouldn't have died such a slow and agonising death. I really can't say any more to recommend this to you; if you liked HALLOWEEN then you'll like this. It's as simple as that. Do yourself a favour and order it now?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better ones from the 80s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the wake of how popular the teen slasher movies had gotten after "Halloween", the genre was already dying down by 1983. However, House on Sorority Row is a gem, not great, but much better than what is typically seen here. "I Know what You Did Last Summer" definitely had very heavy influence from this movie. A group of sorority girls accidentally kill the owner and try to dump her body, to never be found but of course that is not the case, and they are murdered one by one. Very typical, strictly by the numbers slasher film. Nothing really exciting about it, but its watchable just to pass time or for fun, if your in the mood for a slasher.I don't think I need to comment on the acting quality in movies like these but I will just mention we see Eillen Davidson("Days Of Our Lives" star) in one of her early movie roles. Interesting to see how many stars actually start their careers in slasher flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right from the beginning, you know this is a cheesy 80's slasher flick and you have to watch it with that in mind. It's no Academy Award winner. However, if you watch it to the end, it delivers some pretty awesome murder sequences and one or two decent scares that will remain with you for a few days.I particularly enjoyed the last five minutes or so, when we learn who the killer is. The bathroom scene is wicked cool and so is the clown scene. I actually shivered at the clown scene. It's surprisingly scary and I wasn't expecting it. There is a decent amount of blood and violence in "The House on Sorority Row." That all being said, this movie is only recommended for the most devoted horror movie fans, and particularly to those of us fond of the 1980's. The girls in the movie are not your typical movie star types, but that's not to say they aren't good looking. They are just more 'average' and I think it makes the film both more believable and more fun. The actress who plays Vicki went on to star in a bunch of soaps and you might recognize her. The wardrobes are ridiculous, but again, are truly nostalgic of the decade.6 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another classic of the genre that is next in line for a re-birth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a good week for the slasher genre. What with My Bloody Valentine 3-D doing impressive business at the box office and the special edition DVD of the original feature providing fans with all those eagerly anticipated gore scenes, this has been the best seven days for the category since the release of Scream in 1996.I thoroughly enjoyed watching the special edition of MBV and it motivated me to dig through my collection and re-visit a few other cycle entries that had been gathering dust on my shelves. It seems to be the latest trend to remake eighties slasher movies and The House on Sorority Row looks set to be the next celebrated feature to receive an updated re-birth.If titles such as Madman and The Prowler were rivals to the gore-led Friday the 13th films of the early eighties and were inspired by Sean Cunningham's visually graphic depiction of the slasher formula, then Mark Rosman's bizarrely under-rated entry took its lead from Carpenter's 'less is more' approach. Sorority Row does not boast a bunch of outrageously gory kill scenes and its bogeyman does not sport an audacious mask. It does, however, offer a slick suspense-fuelled runtime of classy directorial embellishments and down-to-earth and believable characters.In order to get revenge on their unforgiving house-mother, seven sorority sisters plan an audacious prank. Unfortunately, the joke backfires and the elderly owner of the house ends up dead. The youngsters do their best to cover-up the 'accident', but it seems that someone witnessed the killing and begins to stalk and gruesomely slaughter them. Who could be behind the murders? Slumber Party Massacre is generally recognised as the key sorority slasher, which is a shame, because The House on Sorority Row is much stronger and infinitely more deserving of that status. From the off we see that this is a cool and classy thriller thanks to Rosman's razor sharp direction and some tightly edited scares. The film successfully juxtaposes the innocence of child-like imagery such as clowns and dolls with the dementia of a revenge-fuelled maniac and creates a deeply macabre atmosphere. There's some chilling flourishes spaced frequently throughout the feature, which include the victims finding toys before they are slaughtered and the classic 'decapitated head in the toilet' trick.The director skilfully mimics John Carpenter's use of shadow-play to build suspense and the bogeyman remains mysteriously shrouded in the darkness of his non-identity. Perhaps one of the film's key strengths is the realism of its characters. Many of the latter Scream-inspired slashers would fail because of their persistence in attempting to make a cast of purely beautiful people seem factual. Let's face it, we don't all look like glamour models and we don't all have a rich mummy and daddy a phone call away, so how can we relate in any way to a story depicted using that methodology? Rosman recognised this and instead of a giving us a synopsis full of brainless-bimbos, the characters here are natural and in effect, not without their flaws.Rosman had previously worked alongside Brian De Palma and was the Assistant Director on Home Movies from1980. He learned a lot along the way and some of the stylish photography was particularly impressive considering that this was the twenty-four year old's feature début. The hallucination scenes towards the climax are creative horror-imagery at its finest and the operatic score is at times pulse-raising. That final scene, which sees the killer raise from the shadows in creepy clown attire, is as iconic as anything from the life-span of the genre and the fact that the heroine is heavily sedated only adds to the plausibility of her chaotic state of mind.Credit also must be given to the cast who carry the plot comfortably and Kate McNeil was superb as the easily-manipulated Katharine. Eileen Davidson puts in a good stint as Vicky and the dramatics remain competent right the way through. Like many eighties slashers, the final version that was released was not as the director had intended and an extension to the ending was filmed and re-edited just before release. Let's hope that one day we will get a special edition disk with all the deleted scenes restored. Rosman has stated in the past that he was not a particularly big fan of horror cinema and that he made this feature just to get a foot on the Hollywood ladder. That's somewhat tough to believe as House is a movie that's well-aware of its genre trademarks. The links with Halloween are too numerous to be coincidental and its doubtful that such stylish horror-imagery could be conveyed by a half-hearted auteur. The fact that Rosman is executive producer on the upcoming remake of this feature must prove that he still has a place for the genre somewhere in his heart.Whether the remake will be a success or not is debatable. So far the casting decisions have both bewildered and disappointed. One of the key attributes to the strength of the original Sorority Row was its realism and the sympathetic motive of its bogeyman, which if lost in the re-imaging, could prove detrimental. We can only keep our fingers crossed that Rosman will not allow his greatest feature to be ruined by a cash-hungry studio, because The House on Sorority Row is deserving of so much more.Easily one of the best of the early eighties slasher flicks; if you haven't already seen this suspense-marathon, you need to be asking yourself why not???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible, horrendous HORROR CLASSIC!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, whoever was quoted saying "In the style of Halloween" was clearly stupid, because this is in no way in the style of Halloween.Okay - lets get this straight.The House On Sorority Row is indeed a cheap, bad slasher/horror movie, but it knows this and understands where it stands. Everything is bad! The special effects (If you can call it that), the plot, and of course, the worse thing of all - the so called "acting". But It's so bad, that you find yourself actually liking it, a guilty pleasure if you will. One of those films you watch when you wanna get a good old laugh with your friends on a Friday night watching a bunch of DVD's.The plot is fairly simple. There is a big old Sorority house. The girls hate the house mother. They play a prank on her. It goes wrong. They try to cover it up. Then suddenly body's start to pile up - that's basically the whole movie.There are so many laughable moments in the movie - it's too funny for words. For instance. The house mother - I don't know the actress who plays her, but it's not even her voice in the movie. She is lip syncing to someone else's voice, and poorly I might add. Also, one of the sorority girls "Morgan" who I can only assume slept with the director to get the part, is indeed the most terrible actress I have ever seen on screen. Cringeworthly bad.All in all even though The House On Sorority Row has it's flaws (big understatement) it's still a classic 80's horror flick. If you're looking for a bad horror movie with bad acting and terrible effects - this movie couldn't be more perfect.If you want a creepy, old horror movie. Pass this one quick!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of this film lead me to believe that it might be trying to cash in on the success of Wes Craven's influential shocker 'The Last House on the Left', but instead; this film is merely yet another entry in the overpopulated and frankly dull eighties slasher tradition. It actually gets off to a decent start, as we are introduced to a bunch of sorority girls and an old woman; their overbearing house owner, who frowns on parties, boys, swimming in swimming pools and just about everything else that young girls like to do for fun. The start is nothing special, but it leads you to believe that you might be in for a decent slasher flick as shortly after, the girls decide to play a prank on their house owner. The prank has 'worst idea ever' written all over it, and it's not long before the girls have ended up killing the old woman and hiding the body in the pool. It also happens to be the night when the girls have decided to throw a big party, but things go from bad to worse when it turns out that someone saw them killing the old bag, and is now taking it out on the girls and their guests.I suppose the most disappointing thing about this film is the fact that it's lacking in the two areas where slashers usually succeed. There is no actual nudity in the film; which is a shame given the obvious opportunity to feature lots of it with the sorority setting. But perhaps even more shocking than that is the almost complete lack of gore. The first seventy minutes are practically bloodless, and when blood is finally shed it's both too late and there's not enough of it. There are a few well executed kill scenes, but seeing the murderer go round executing people with a sharp cane gets older quicker than it should due to the lack of the red stuff. And then there's the fact that the identity of the murderer is both glaringly obvious and completely implausible - and adding to the film's woes is the fact that we never really see the murderer's face, which is a shame in itself considering the person's past history. All in all, it's pretty derivative stuff - anyone that has seen a handful of slasher films will have seen everything here before, and the many missed opportunities help to make House on Sorority Row even more of a disappointment.</fullReview>
