		<shortDescription>Tracy is a chilling Hyde...Bergman is brilliant...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years I knew that Fredric March had won one of his Oscars for DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE back in the '30s and always assumed that because of this his performance was superior to Spencer Tracy's.But having just seen the Tracy-Bergman-Turner version, my opinion has changed. Whereas the make-up for March makes him look like a cheap monster in a Universal thriller and almost Simian, Tracy achieves a distinctly chilling effect simply through posture and facial expressions alone with a minimum of make-up. His first encounter with the barmaid Ivy (Ingrid Bergman) is beautifully done with both of them registering emotions as they play against each other--Tracy with a wicked gleam in his eye and Bergman trying to hide her fear. She creates a really sympathetic character, especially when she realizes the extent of her degradation. Her scenes with Tracy where he is sadistically taunting her remind one of the cat-and-mouse game she played with Charles Boyer in "Gaslight". The B&amp;W photography realistically captures Victorian London after dark with its swirling mists and street lamps. All of the performances are first rate except for an uncertain Lana Turner who has a pallid role and can do little with it.The only flaws are the film's length--it takes too long to tell the tale with its long-winded speeches--and the leisurely pace under Victor Fleming's direction makes the horror more muted than it need be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bold Experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was probably too soon for Spencer Tracy to have tried a remake of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Ten years was not long enough for people to forget Fredric March's Oscar winning performance from the Paramount classic of 1931. This version of the Robert Louis Stevenson horror novel drew for Tracy some of the few bad reviews he ever got as a player because it was too soon. Time has been good to this film and we can see the differences in interpretation.The Jekyll character that Tracy creates is a soft spoken guy, a lot like Father Flannagan. He's a medical doctor, more interested in research than in a practice. Before Sigmund Freud ever coined the terms ego and id to describe man's duel nature of good and evil, Stevenson had those same notions about man's behavior and incorporated them in his novel.The Hyde character was a bold experiment. Tracy was probably the player in Hollywood who disliked makeup the most. Yet for this film and for few others, he allowed himself to be made up ever so slightly to suggest the evil Hyde. It was a far cry from the simian appearance of Fredric March's Hyde and Tracy got criticized for it. Retrospectives now are kinder to him and his method of interpretation.Stepping into the female roles played by Rose Hobart and Miriam Hopkins in the March version are Lana Turner and Ingrid Bergman. Lana Turner although later she played quite a few sexpots was at this stage of her career playing very winsome proper young ladies and not doing a bad job of it.Ingrid Bergman plays Champagne Ivy, probably one of the most luckless characters in fiction. Ivy was not in the original novel, she was in the play that was adapted from the Stevenson novel and she's come down to us ever since. This poor girl, no better than she ought to be meets Tracy as Jekyll and he's attracted, but engaged to Turner. When he becomes Hyde, the beast within him remembers and stalks Bergman mercilessly ending in tragedy all around.Besides March and Tracy other actors who've tried this most difficult of parts are John Barrymore, Jack Palance, and Kirk Douglas. Only the best can and are willing to tackle Jekyll and Hyde. And there ain't no doubt that Tracy is one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic. The best version of the story. Tracy at his Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to disagree with the comment "For all you Tracy fans only", and also with the comments that suggest the 1931 version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is far better.First of all, I am not a Spencer Tracy fan - at least I didn't consider myself as one. Yes, the word dull came to mind. But after seeing the superb 1941 version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I found myself wondering if anyone could have played Dr. Jekyll and especially Mr. Hyde any better than him.In the 1931s original a handsome, wimpy Dr. Jekyll transforms into an ugly, retarded Mr. Hyde. While this Mr. Hyde hardly resembles his alter ego Jekyll, except for neediness, I do not find that as a strong, interesting controversy in the film. Fredric March was a great actor, but in this film with this script different actors could have played the parts of Jekyll and Hyde and it wouldn't have made any difference. Awkward, still boring film.I was expecting so much, but stopped taping this pretty soon into the film. The psychology is awful (I am not suggesting that all films should emulate "real" life, but all films should be "real" in a world of their own, whatever it is.) I had seen the 1941s version earlier, and boy, it doesn't have a dull moment. I started watching this for Lana Turner, and there she is, looking pretty. Yes, she should have played the part Ingrid Bergman took, but you can't have it all all the time. Perhaps Ingrid Bergman was the girl to play the waitress. I truly enjoyed her masochistic portrayal of the bad girl.Yes the film owns a lot to the original - filmed on same location, same choreography? The makers of this film had a decade to learn from the mistakes of the original and turn it around with better lines and nuances.With one look from Spencer Tracy, a trouble maker changes his mind. "I'm sorry governor". Imagine Fredric March, in his monkey make up, doing that? He would have been laughed out the club, or not get in at all.To add the grade to 10, Peter Godfrey as the butler. The end of this film is truly spiritual, merciful and frightening at the same time. And all of this is accomplished without any phony art stuff, as they would have tried these days.A true classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spencer Tracy is magnificent in this, doing Mr Hyde basically with changes in behavior and agility rather than heavy make-up. He scared me to death when he vaulted over a railing and down a couple fo flights of stairs.This is more of a thriller than a horror movie and done long before it became fashionable to throw tons of money and big-name performers at horror classics in order to produce blockbusters that were once just silly.This supposedly cleaned-up version has Hyde asking Ingrid Bergman if she likes him because he's a little bit Jeckyll or Jeckyll because he's a little bit Hyde.So many people are fussing that this movie turns the prostitute into a bar maid. Folks, in that part of London at that time, bar maids WERE prostitutes.I find any moster more scary with no facial hair or deformities added. This Mr Hyde could well exist in real life. In fact, he DOES exist in real life. Once in a while we manage to prove it and put him in prison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the March version, but pretty good, anyway!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike Universal, MGM was never a studio associated much with out-and-out horror films (A notable exception: 1932's great "The Mask of Fu Manchu," with Boris Karloff, Myrna Loy, and Jean Hersholt). But, when they did make them, they made them with the legendary MGM class and gloss. And such a one was the 1941 version of Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." Unlike the March version, this wasn't a particularly scary film, but more of a suspenseful one. As befits the director who made "Wizard of Oz," "Red Dust," and "Gone with the Wind," Victor Fleming turns the story into a thinking man's horror film, and succeeds brilliantly.As to the cast, Spencer Tracy, like Frederick March, was effectively cast against type for the part, and delivers a good, understated performance. His Hyde is very much the Hyde of the book, an evil, decayed version of Jekyll himself, rather than a monster. This last was accomplished by Jack Dawn's equally understated makeup. Lana Turner, and Jekyll's fiance, Beatrix, is little more than pretty set decoration. Let's face it, she wouldn't really prove she could act until "Peyton Place" and "Imitation of Life" in the late '50's. But Ingrid Bergman, now, that's another story! In one of her first U.S. films, she delivers a brilliant performance as Ivy Peterson, the Cockney barmaid unwillingly cought up in Hyde's insane reign of terror. Her scenes with Tracy, both as Jekyll and as Hyde, fairly crackle with energy. These are two comsummate pros working together, and they don't disappoint. In the only other supporting roles of any importance, Donald Crisp, Ian Hunter, Barton McLane, and Sara Allgood all aquit themselves beautifully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Cast Carries a Slow-Moving Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of the classic "Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde" story is more slow-moving and psychological than most. Rather than emphasizing the more horrific elements of the story, it relies on a good cast to bring out the ways that the characters and their relationships are affected by the doctor's weird experiment. It's not the version to watch if you are looking for excitement or horror, but as a more psychological approach it mostly works.Spencer Tracy plays the dual leading role, and does pretty well at creating two distinct personalities - the transformation uses only minimal special effects, and relies on Tracy to make the characters convincing. Lana Turner and Ingrid Bergman work well as Beatrix and Ivy, and the rest of the cast members are also all very good. What the film lacks in excitement it makes up for in making Dr. Jekyll's world believable.If you're already familiar with the story in its more horrific versions, this would be worth a look if you're interested in a different take on it. It's probably not the place to start, though, if you don't yet know the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ponderous - certainly not scary - but beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a thoughtful interpretation of the Stevenson story but is very rarely emotionally engaging. The theme seems to be sexual repression, with Hyde coming from Jekyll's repressed lust. As Hyde takes over we witness some extraordinary and very graphic Freudian imagery such as Bergman and Turner, naked, pulling a chariot containing Tracy and his whip, and Bergman being screwed out of a bottle by a corkscrew! Amazing. But the horror of the story is never realized and there is too much philosophical chat.Tracy is terrific in the lead, but his make-up for Hyde is too subtle to be effective. The transformations require him to stand completely still which makes them a bit dull. The final transformation is quite an achievement however. Bergman could have been great but her attempt at a cockney accent seriously detracts from her fine emotional interpretation. Lana Turner is awful as Tracy's true love. But the rest of the cast is very strong - especially Donald Crisp.The film also contains some fine Fleming touches, including his beautiful slow pans over magnificent sets and crowd scenes. The cinematography is excellent - make sure you don't watch the colorised version - and foggy Victorian London is recreated stunningly. This film never rises to the horror of the 1920 or the 1932 versions but still has much to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The MGM Experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Less a horror movie than a lavish excursion into an elegant costume drama MGM-style, this version of Robert Louis Stevenson's novella still manages to hold itself well due to the presences of the three leads, Spencer Tracy, and two rising female stars ? Ingrid Bergman, and a very young Lana Turner.The story behind DOCTOR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE is that Spencer Tracy wasn't one of the actors to be considered for the role, but because he knew that his looks were too masculine to be taken for a matinée idol, he tackled the dual role in his own way, but on viewing his own performance it seems he overacted whenever he was on screen as Mr. Hyde, and the makeup didn't exactly help. Nevertheless the actor he was he tackled the role and this is the performance he gave: far from his best, but not altogether unwatchable.If anything, the culprit to blame is the direction in itself, which here is of no mention other than it's plainly bad. There is almost no atmosphere, no trepidation that Jekyll is delving into uncharted territory and unleashing his monstrous side with devastating results, and an extremely laughable sequence in which Hyde crazily flogs his horses which bear the heads of Bergman and Turner. With so much subtext to the material, this is almost its bastard incarnation, wooden and lifeless, a footnote in Tracy's, Bergman's, and Turner's acting careers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think what made Spencer Tracy so good in this role was that his prior movies showed the actor as he seemed to be, a nice guy. As Dr. Jekyll, he is a caring and understanding doctor, but when turning into Hyde we see a performance unlike any Mr. Tracy has played before. Hyde is all evil, totally delighted by being menacing with no regard to anyone else. For this reason I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good thriller, without the gore. The rest of the cast is excellent, especially Ingrid Bergman as Ivy, who is the subject of Hyde's sick amusement. This is a chilling movie, made in black and white which seems to add to the suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Film of the 1940s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MGM did a stellar job of producing a high quality Horror film, putting together director Victor Fleming (of "Gone with the Wind" fame) and stars Lana Turner, Ingrid Bergman, and Spencer Tracy. This film demonstrates that horror doesn't have to be campy, low-budget schtick. Like 2000's "The 6th Sense," 1941's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" actually respected the horror material enough to demonstrate the heights to which a major studio could take the genre.The film takes us to darker places than we dare imagined existed at good ol' MGM, home of the happy-go-lucky family musical. We see the confident, handsome, Jeckyll dissolve into a cruel, crass, foul-minded Hyde with Tracy's masterful performance.Bergman and Turner also turn in gritty, splendid performances with their less-than-life affirming characters. Rather than playing it for sci-fi thrills, this interpretation of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel focuses more on Tracy's losing battle to tame the demon of Hyde. The result is a riveting parable on the banality of evil (all the more visceral in retrospect, given the film's release at the brink of World War II.)The Film Snob, Lee Cushing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than it's reputation would have you believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen many Spencer Tracy films, but he isn't one of my favorites. He was rarely convincing. Couldn't buy him as Portuguese in "Captain's Courageous," less convincing in "Tortilla Flat" as a Mexican-American, too old for his role in "Bad Day at Black Rock," and not believable as a Cuban in "The Old Man and the Sea." He was better in comedies like "Libeled Lady," and "Adam's Rib," but where he really shined was as doctors. He plays opposite Hedy Lamarr in "I Take This Woman," a not very good film, but with a fine and believable performance by Tracy as the doctor in love with her. His finest performance, however, is "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," a film often unfavorably compared to the '31 film. Frederick March is on par with Tracy as an actor. He too overplayed, but Tracy could reach a higher level when he was in top form, and there is no better example of this than the two "Jekyll and Hyde." Part of the problem with the '31 directed by Rouben Mamoulian was the concept for Hyde, a hairy Simian type beast. March does the best he can with that mouthful of teeth, but his Hyde is too much a monster and less human than the Tracy. This is where the '41 directed by Victor Fleming, excels. March overplayed Hyde, and his Jekyll had many corny moments. What Tracy brought to Jekyll was believability as someone in the medical profession, someone who even before transforming himself, somehow conveys a perverse longing to visit the dark side.March never scares me like Tracy. What Tracy brings to Hyde is subtle and insidious. Remarkably evil. You can see it in his eyes, in his smile, in how he uses his voice like a snake constricting around Ivy. Tracy's scenes with Ingrid Bergman are uncomfortable to watch because of the hideous way he plays with her sense of well-being. These same scenes were in the March version, but don't create the same pathos. Miriam Hopkins was a fine actress, and she did very well opposite March, but she's no Bergman. Neither was the character Ivy in the early film as well conceived. Hopkins' Ivy is a somewhat unhappy tart, and her tease of Jekyll at the beginning where we see her swing her leg back and forth is more a conniving entrapment than Bergman's playful Ivy. The 1941 version is far more emotional because of Bergman's Ivy. Her Ivy may be a tart, but Bergman convinces us she's got a sweet inner core deep within. When she is terrorized and murdered by Hyde, it's hard to take. The girl Hyde destroys in the '41 has a steeper fall from grace, and her end is more pitiable. The scene where Ivy comes to visit Dr. Jekyll and shows him the wounds inflicted on her back by Hyde has more resonance than the earlier film. This is not because of Hopkins, who is on a par with Bergman in that scene, but because March lays it on thick. Tracy's guilt is more palpable, and we want to believe him when he tells Bergman's Ivy that she will never see Hyde again. When Hyde does return to Ivy, his appearance is all the more hurtful for we, like Ivy, wanted to believe Jekyll. I do prefer the '31 gas lit London and its enclosed, more claustrophobic, rickety streets, but the fog enshrouded London of the '41 is suitably moody and depressing. Years ago I saw a screening of the '41 with a friend who was put off by how depressing it was. Yes, this is true. "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is a very dark, depressing story. Hyde kills Ivy, he kills his fiancé's father, and he actually kills Jekyll as well. He's a vicious brute that brings calamity wherever he goes. I've seen both films many times, but the '41 is the one that continues to pull emotion. This is due to Tracy and Bergman, as well as Fleming's direction. Mamoulian was a great director, but Fleming was his equal. The score by Franz Waxman is beautifully tragic, something missing from the '31. In the earlier we have Bach's Toccata and Fugue as a segue to the famous POV sequence reveal of Dr. Jekyll. The Waxman score works in the song "Can You See Me Dance the Polka," and it becomes a taunt for Hyde to invade Ivy's soul. "Champagne Ivy" in the '31 doesn't have the same gaiety. The '41 has some laughable symbolism during the first transformation of Jekyll riding a carriage and whipping his horses, which become Bergman and Lana Turner (the fiancé). This stands out as a bad decision by the screen writers. Fortunately, that sort of thing is not repeated. The '31 has more of it. There's the statue of the angel embracing a woman that we see as Hyde kills Ivy, the cat attacking the bird when Jekyll is overwhelmed by Hyde in the park and the boiling cauldron at the end. These are just as heavy-handed. The park scene in the '41 is improved by Jekyll's whistling suddenly becoming Ivy's song, the suggestion Hyde is taking over. Much better.The '31 is lauded for it's transformation scenes, but the makeup is obvious, particularly the painted nostrils and the use of filters to reveal the make-up. Tracy depends more on his performance. He brings believability to both Jekyll and Hyde. There have been many versions of this story and I've seen most, but the Tracy remains my favorite. It's main drawback is it's similarity to the '31, but in just about every case, the '41 has more impact. If you haven't seen the '31 see the '41 first, then go back and see the older. You'll see how much subtlety gets lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two great actors, one role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A close look at the credits for both films will show that the 1941 "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is more than merely a remake of the 1931 version. The screenplay of the later film was literally based on that of the earlier, and there are scene-by-scene and, in places, word-for-word duplications. Both are excellent, with my own preference going to the 1941 and Spencer Tracy. His performance is amazing, and so subtle that it's frequently dismissed as inferior work. To the contrary, it's every bit worthy of an early graduate of the Actors Studio. Spoilers follow.The highlight of the film is the astonishing scene when Jekyll first changes involuntarily into Hyde. He's walking the sidewalk in the fog, whistling a Strauss waltz he earlier danced with his fiancée, played well in a throwaway role by Lana Turner. Without meaning to his whistling changes to the polka sung by barmaid Ingrid Bergman, whose performance is nearly a match to Tracy's. He stops, a confused look on his face, then walks on whistling the waltz. Again it changes to the polka, and he stops again, wiping his brow, confusion again on his face. Now unsure, he starts to walk again, and can only whistle the first notes of the polka. He stumbles to a park bench and changes into Hyde. Hyde looks about and then hurries over to the barmaid's flat, where as Jekyll he's just told her Hyde will never come again. Ivy is celebrating with champagne. In a brilliant mirror-shot we see her look of horror as the door opens and Hyde enters. The rest of the scene is simply unforgettable, between the deranged Hyde and the terrified Ivy, realizing her fate is at hand.There are nice directorial touches in both films, and both tell the story very well. Many will prefer the more straightforward, showier 1931 version. For myself the 1941 is supreme, with Tracy delivering one of the all-time great screen acting performances. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Large Screen Version of DR. JECKYLL AND MR. HYDE?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1931 version of DR. JECKYLL AND MR. HYDE was directed by Rouben Mamoulian, and it starred Fredric March in the dual title role. It won the star the Best Actor Oscar, the only time that award was won for a horror film role (or a science fiction part). Mamoulian experimented at the start, and in one key sequence with the "I am a camera" technique, wherein the viewer was treated like he was seeing things from the perspective of the character of Jeckyll. Jeckyll himself was supposed to look like an early form of prehistoric man - nearly an ape. It's still a good performance, but many feel it is too stylized.Ten years later MGM decided to do the property again, this time with Spencer Tracy. Tracy actually decided to follow a more classical approach to the role. He eschewed the make-up that March (and in the silent film, John Barrymore) used for the evil Hyde, and used a combination of facial contortions and lighting to change his appearance from the good doctor to his evil counterpart.One would like to say that it works. It worked pretty well in 1888 for Richard Mansfield in his celebrated stage performance. But Mansfield could play with the theater lighting to create the physical change on stage. It was an amazing stage effect. It can't be done as well on film (or at least in a 1941 film - computerization might help today). Tracy's grimacing face does not look much different from his serious, good natured face for the Doctor. Even with the lights concentrating on his eyes it still doesn't look that different.The result is that the audience has to make a logical jump and say that there was a physical change, in order to accept the story line. Otherwise, everyone would say that Jeckyll and Hyde is the same guy in the movie.Fortunately Tracy's acting allows us to make such a logical jump. He was a terrific actor, and he certainly uses a subtlety in his evil that is unnerving. Except for his Arnold Boult in EDWARD MY SON he never portrayed as evil a character.The best scene to catch Tracy's Hyde at it's best is when he is visiting his mistress Ivy. She had been hoping he would not come, but she was drinking when he arrives - to steady her nerves. No wonder - Hyde is like a cat toying with a mouse as he plays with Ivy. He plays the piano and keeps discounting various things that he and Ivy could do if they leave the apartment (as she would hope - if they are in public she has a better chance for help). But he keeps finding reasons not to do things, so that (in his opinion) it is better for them to stay at home. And even at home, they have limited options. "You could read to me," Hyde sweetly says, "But we do not have the book!" A later scene where he surprises a sleeping Lana Turner on a park bench, leering at her, is also unnerving. You never see Tracy like that in other films.Bergman's Ivy is to be compared with Miriam Hopkins in the earlier film. Both realize that Dr. Jeckyll is sexually interested in them, and both secretly hope to catch him (not realizing that he has caught them in his bad personality). But Hopkins always seemed prepared to act like a prostitute (in the 1931 film she readily shows off her leg for March's Jeckyll). But Bergman is more tragic in a way. She has a job as a bar maid that she is serious about (Hopkins was more of an "entertainer"). Bergman's Ivy is friendly but seemingly careful, and unfortunately she falls under the gaze of an unscrupulous man.Interestingly in the 1931 film Hopkins was singing a version of an actual tune called "Champaign Charlie is my name", changing it to "Champaign Ivy is my name." She sings it happily at first, but when March demands her singing it, she sings it haltingly and frightened. Bergman sings a jaunty number, "Do you want to dance the polka?" at the bar, but is forced to sing it (as Hopkins did the other song) in a broken version for Tracy. Interestingly enough, when Michael Caine appeared in 1988 in a two part television film about Jack the Ripper, the music in a scene involving three of the Ripper's prostitute victims used "Do you want to dance the polka?" as background music, and I believe it was not a 19th song at all, but composed for the 1941 film.Rose Hobart played the role of General Carew's daughter (Jeckyll's respectable fiancé) in the 1931 film. There was nothing especially interesting about her (except she was pretty), so she did not do much in that film. But Lana Turner was was a rising star, and her part got built up a bit with some scenes alone with Tracy. She also appears in a sexual fantasy sequence as one of a pair of "horses" (with Bergman) that Tracy is riding. And there is that "leering" sequence where Tracy as Hyde frightens her. Turner did nicely in the role, although Bergman's part was more interesting.The supporting parts are equally good, with Donald Crisp as the doomed father of Turner, Aubrey Smith as the righteous Bishop Manners (who is thrown momentarily by a noisy Barton MacLane in his congregation, jeering at the Bishop's homilies about Christian goodness), and MacLane himself in the brief sequence as the insane man with no compunction about doing evil.I like Tracy's version - on most points it is better acted than the 1931 version. But March's make-up, no matter how strange it looks, still is more acceptable than Tracy's dependence on light and shadows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unresolved problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is impossible to watch this movie without comparing it to Reuben Mamoulian's 1931 Paramount version. I prefer the earlier version, but this one does have certain advantages.When Mamoulian's movie was made, sound movies were barely four years old - and it shows. It wasn't simply a question of technology. The aesthetics of sound films were different: the structure of the story, the rhythm of scenes; the use of close-ups, etc. had all changed. Mamoulian's film is very accomplished, but is still on the cusp of this change and Fleming's film is undoubtedly a smoother, more confident piece of film-making. Similarly, Tracy gives a genuine movie performance. Frederic March may have won an Oscar, but his Jeckyll has the declamatory style of the theatre so characteristic of very early sound films.However, it also has disadvantages. In 1931, the censor had less power than in 1941. Mamoulian was able to overrule many of his objections. He still had to be fairly discreet, but he could be somewhat more explicit than Fleming about Jeckyll's sexual frustration.More importantly, instead of going to the book for inspiration, MGM simply re-made Mamoulian's movie - scene by scene. As a result it inevitably feels a bit stale in comparison. This was also a missed opportunity, because whatever its merits (and they are many) Mamoulian's film had not really solved the problem of how to tell this story. Fleming simply reproduces its shortcomings.The book is basically a mystery. A lawyer encounters the loathsome Mr Hyde and learns of his connections with Jeckyll. Various other strange events occur. After Hyde commits a savage and unprovoked murder, the lawyer starts to investigate. Meanwhile, Jeckyll deposits a letter with him that must not be read until his death or disappearance. Eventually, the lawyer tracks Hyde down to Jeckyll's laboratory where he is found dead. This takes up 9 of the 10 chapters of the book. He reads the letter, which explains the mystery.Both movies dispense with the mystery and go straight to the letter. What makes Jeckyll's confession so compelling is how it documents his gradual slide into 'addiction'. Initially, Hyde is a means by which he can indulge in his vices without shame, remorse or consequences. But each time he does so, Hyde gets stronger and his behaviour gets worse. Eventually, Jeckyll loses control altogether and Hyde can appear of his own accord. In despair, he commits suicide.The core of the book, therefore, is Jeckyll's first person narrative. The cinema is no good at the first person and both these movies tell Jeckyll's story from the normal third person perspective. But Jeckyll has no one he can talk to about his experiences, so we lose most of his motivation and much of his growing anguish. This movie implies that his initial experiment was motivated by a desire to heal, but we are given no reason why he continues to take the transforming drug and see little of his power struggle with Hyde. We see the initial transformation, during which nothing happens (as in the book) then, on the second transformation, we get a long scene with Hyde in the bar and an even longer one of him terrorising and brutalising Ivy, separated by a short scene of Beatrix with her father. As a result, Jeckyll disappears from the movie for 25 minutes - Hyde has taken over the story.When Jeckyll does turn up again, Hyde's actions have become so appalling that we no longer understand Jeckyll's position. Does he know what Hyde has been doing? In the book he does, but in this movie we are not sure. If he knows, then he is a callous, hypocritical monster, who is as bad as Hyde. But if he doesn't, why does he take the drug at all? Both movies shy away from a crucial feature of the story. Jeckyll enjoys being Hyde! Without this realisation, the story may seem to be fairly simple and clear-cut, but it actually makes no sense.I doubt if there is any way to tell this story effectively without a voice-over narration. Jeckyll has to tell the audience directly what he is thinking and feeling. In 1931, the voice-over was probably not even technically possible. By simply copying this movie, Fleming misses a crucial opportunity to improve on it.I would make one final observation. In this version, Hyde's make-up is much more subtle than in Mamoulian's film, but neither is really satisfactory. Mamoulian's simian throw-back could barely pass as human, but in this movie there is no way that Ivy could fail to recognise that Jeckyll and Hyde are one and the same.Both movies are trapped in a convention that probably goes back to the very first stage productions and was reinforced by Barrymore's bravura transformation scene in the 1920 movie: traditionally, one actor plays both parts. There is no warrant for this in the book. Hyde is very different from Jeckyll (and is actually much smaller, especially in the beginning). This convention was not challenged until Hammer in the Sixties, but I feel that both of these movies would have worked better if a second actor had played Hyde. The lead actors would then have been spared the agony (March) and the embarrassment (Tracy) of that Hyde make-up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many versions of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic of "DJ&amp;MH" come and go, the one with Spencer Tracy is the absolute favorite of mine. I just love the trick camera work of this one. Where Dr. Henry Jekyll becomes the revolting and sinister Mr. Edward Hyde. The translation of the novel was well made, and as I recall, the way Hyde looked at himself in the mirror, really made my blood curdle. When Hyde went to the bar and be spilling the pounds all over, man that is one man I wouldn't be around. The dinner scene is great, and the church scene is really good as well, the only scene that really tops it was when Hyde kills a man with the cane that belonged to Jekyll. That to me is really going too far. Turning from one man into another is a game one person shouldn't play, there's always going to be a price to pay. And Jekyll had to pay it. When they showed that Jekyll was transforming into Hyde, the police never wasted any time. The book is everything, the movie is a classic. It is everything a novel lover should have. 5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MGM Gloss Meets Jekyll and Hyde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when you cross Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with MGM gloss? Spencer Tracy, Ingrid Bergman, and Lana Turner in this boisterous, not-so-subtle Freudian-laden adaptation of Robert Lewis Stevenson's tale of the good and bad in all of us. To begin with, I'll admit this doesn't have the perhaps intelligent and thoughtful means about it, than its predecessor does. This film more or less tells the story in a straight forward fashion, but is more showy and somewhat superficial without centering too much on the serious, disturbing aspects of Dr. Jekyll's actions. And, they don't have Spencer undergoing such a physical change as Fredric March did. Having said that, I think this version is much better, in that all the elements come together to make a better package. It has an almost reverent affection for its subject matter, and is more emotional in terms of characters and how they relate to each other, especially Ingrid as Ivy and Spencer. This adaptation is a little longer than the original and seems to take its time with its characters and excels in bringing the viewer there to the time and place and being in the moment, you might say. And, to watch Ingrid Bergman act is worth the price of admission alone. She originally was to be play Lana's role and Lana was to be Ivy, but Ingrid felt there was more meat to Ivy's character and asked for the change and obviously got it; boy, was she right. But, it is a bit hard to take his cruel treatment of her. It seems like Tracy's Hyde is just plain mean, evil, and sadistic. Then there's Lana Turner, who's given a throwaway role, with not much to do, but what she does, most men will be watching on the edge of their seats for. And, then there's dependable character actor Donald Crisp as her father, and Ian Hunter as Jekyll's friend. If you want MGM's grade A treatment splashed all over literature brought to life on the silver screen, then this is for you. Tracy and Bergman at their best, and Lana never looking better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent translation of the original story to screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one approaches this movie to compare it to the previous (1931) version of the same story there are bound to be some negative comments. But if one goes back to the original story, this movie becomes the ONLY true translation of the original novel to the screen.Robert Louis Stevenson intended his story to be a portrayal of a staunchly virtuous man who slowly degraded himself spiritually to something less than human - a sort of psychological self-destruction. Stevenson was very reluctant about using the mad-scientist angle and stated that he felt the potion drinking was "just so much hugger-mugger."This movie is a perfect encapsulation of Stevenson's original vision. Dr. Jekyll is a staunchly virtuous man who, despite warning from both clergy and friends, feels that he has the strength to tackle the secrets of the soul. Alas, he has not that strength and finds himself strangled to death in the coils of the serpent he unleashes.Granted there are some bad things about the movie: Tracey could have been a shade more emotional, and it would have been nice if the proper accents were used (a london dance-hall stageshow being done with a Mae West accent????). But the fact that Tracey is able to show the transformation using only the power of the actor rather than the makeup makes this the most exceptional film of its type.Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in Victorian England in 1887, a wealthy doctor by the name of "Dr. Jekyll" (Spencer Tracy) has begun experimenting on animals to determine if it is possible to separate good qualities from those determined to be bad. When he discusses his research at a dinner party his ideas are met with a great deal of consternation, especially on the part of his fiancé's father, "Sir Charles Emery" (Donald Crisp). In fact, Sir Charles is so concerned that he decides to take his daughter, "Beatrix Emery" (Lana Turner) with him out of the country in order to separate the two and give him some time to think about whether the wedding should go forward or not. In the meantime, Dr. Jekyll has grown frustrated with the progress of his research and decides to administer his experimental concoction on himself. Suddenly he turns from a charming and considerate person into a malevolent being called "Mr. Hyde". To make matters worse, with Beatrix gone he sets his sadistic sights on a young barmaid named "Ivy Peterson" (Ingrid Bergman) to satisfy his brutal and abusive nature. Now, rather than detailing the entire plot I will just say that the director (Victor Fleming) does an excellent job of capturing the dark and gloomy ambiance that this movie depends upon. And while both Lana Turner and Ingrid Bergman turn in very good performances, it is Spencer Tracy who really makes this film so successful. Definitely recommended for fans of classic horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for the first time a few days ago and really enjoyed it. I must say I was a little surprised by the bits of "erotic" imagery. I wonder what people thought of that back in 1941. The performances by Ingrid Bergman and Spencer Tracy were very good. Ingrid is mesmerizing and beautifully effervescent. Her strange accent though is at first hard to comprehend. (Is she supposed to be Swedish, Irish, Cockney or what?) It's also fun to see how they managed the special effects - if you look closely at any one of the action scenes involving Mr. Hyde, there are many very obvious stunt doubles and other endearing "mistakes". I also thought it had just enough philosophical underpinnings to make it not just a old fluff "horror" movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see a lot of comments calling this version a pale substitute to the March version. I disagree. The scene with Spencer Tracy throwing the grapes into Bergman's face was way scarier than anything March did in his monkey make-up. Tracy looked like an evil version of Jekyll, rather than like Fred March with a monkey mask on. However, Bergman once again proves to be one of the most over rated actresses from the golden age of cinema. Her horrible cockney accent coupled with her looking like she always needed more sleep took away from Tracy's masterful performance. His Jekyll actually seemed like a nice guy, while his Edward Hyde was downright BAD. Now, I'm looking forward to watching the Barrymore version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Version of Classic Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with the deficiencies: cheap makeup and special effects, marginal sets and costumes. And perhaps my bias against Spencer Tracy.I've never liked Tracy as an actor, although I'll be the first to acknowledge his best work. He has always struck me as paternal, smug, self-righteous and ponderous -- although that may be because he was type cast.IMHO this is his best film, because it shows not only his typical character (Dr. Jekyll) but that character's doppelganger (Mr. Hyde). ~I've always wanted to use that word in a review~ Tracy is not afraid of playing a very sinister, menacing character. (I wish more directors would have given him that chance). He plays Hyde as a jet-propelled, leering, vicious fiend -- and is convincing. When he is Hyde, he looks like a very horny James Whitmore -- on speed. He is very unsettling. Perhaps Tracy should have done more horror movies.What makes the film is simply the powerful and touching performances of Tracy and Bergman. Bergman simply glows with life. Although the Freudian implications are not explored in depth here, this version is absorbing and sometimes mesmerizing.</fullReview>

You get those two and Spencer Tracy, who's almost always interesting, and you have three good leads.What's lacking are the special-effects which are needed in a horror story like this. With modern special-effects, better sounds and cameras, it would have made this - and other horror films - scarier.Still, they did a decent job here in regard to Dr. Jekyll's transformation into Hyde, but the movie needs more suspense and horror, and a tighter script if it's going to be about two hours long. Still, there's Bergman and Turner, both in their prime, looking about as good as they appeared and that's almost enough for me to continue watching this a few more times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MGM spared no expense for this lavish production of the oft-told Jekyll &amp; Hyde story (it had been filmed with the excellent Frederic March in the lead role(s) in 1931) with Spencer Tracy (uncharacteristically) taking the honors of portraying the memorable scientist experimenting with the notion of separating good and evil so that man could be free from the ill effects of the latter. Instead, the experiment, when reduced to a liquid form in a flask unleashes the scientist's dark side, and as each night continues, as does Hyde's control over Jekyll. Soon Jekyll's life begins to unravel, while Hyde remains an increasingly powerful nuisance, out and about in London to be a rotter, a malcontent, and a fiend. Was it truly worth it?The sets are a feast for the eyes if you love seeing 1887 London brought to life as only Hollywood could do in the 40s. Tracy is a curious casting choice for such a character, but it lead to Marsh achieving the Oscar, something that wouldn't happen again for a horror film until Hopkins rightfully won the golden man statue for Demme's Silence of the Lambs.Lana Turner is absolutely gorgeous as Tracy's fiancé while Ingrid Bergman (ridiculously) is "glammed down" for the part of a street-wise "lady of the night", a free-spirit who takes an immediate shine to Jekyll, although he views their flirting and near-cavorting as an experiment to test his wild side. His experience with Bergman's Ivy motivates Jekyll to not abandon his research, even though Beatrix's (Turner) stern father (Donald Crisp) demands it. Soon Jekyll is takes a swig of the experimental fluid and Hyde rears his ugly face and foul presence. Bergman is too lovely and movie star goddessy for the part of Ivy, and from her first scene on, it is hard to suspend disbelief when we see her, no matter how she tries to use slang and present herself as poverty row. Turner is cast because she is such a beauty, and the role really only requires her to be the concerned beloved of the doomed scientist. However, the performances of Tracy and Bergman are first rate. Why Jekyll/Hyde is such a plum part is it is just right for an actor's actor due to the duality of personalities duking it out for supremacy. You get a chance to portray two distinctive characters: one virtuous while the other is hideous. Victor Fleming (Gone with the Wind; Wizard of Oz) being attached to a horror film is rather a big deal. I think, though, critically this film version of Jekyll/Hyde will be looked at (and perhaps the 31 version, too) as a literary melodrama and less like a horror film. Tracy even wanted to not physically transform (in a way, removing the less respected "tacky B-movie horror" trappings many highly regarded thespian and Big-Time Movie Star types considered beneath them), but I think there's an importance in showing the wretchedness that Hyde represents manifest itself internally into an external monster. Even if he didn't want the makeup and disheveled hair/eyebrows, the work does add gravitas to Tracy's performance. He gravels his voice, too, when talking in the form of Hyde, and his appearances, much to Bergman's horror, really pop on screen. You can just imagine the dread that Ivy must feel, and Bergman, the pro that she is, truly conveys the fear, increasing psychological deterioration, and wearying stress her character endures thanks to Hyde's hold over her. She's as damned as Jekyll is thanks to his meddlesome scientific curiosity and drive to succeed in the separation of good and evil. As in other adaptations of the Robert Louis Stevenson novel, Hyde becomes too strong while Jekyll eventually succumbs to him. The final scene is a humdinger as Jekyll tries one final time to keep Hyde from emerging, failing miserably.What a great period for "costume dramas" and Gothic horror benefited from studios dedicating money and intrigue to the evocation of period London on many an occasion. One great set piece has Jekyll out walking London streets/sidewalks as the ever thickening fog threatens to suffocate him, while street lights just keep the shadows from enveloping him is a sublime Gothic work of art. Soon becoming Hyde, seeing him move about at night, Victor Fleming brings an energy to his direction; in particular, the sequence where Hyde harms Ivy and flees her flat, using his cane to ward off those trying to stop him, while flying about with only survival on the mind. This film spends a great deal of time with Hyde while Jekyll pines for the return of Bea when her ill father has whisked her away to parts of Europe. The use of dissolves for the transformations are decent enough. Discussions on what Jekyll believes and is dedicated to are met with criticism, but it doesn't stop him.I think this will be of interest to Tracy fans just because it is atypical of what he normally starred in. Same for Bergman and Turner. Of course, a film that allowed Bergman to sink her teeth into "tormented victimized women" parts and prove the caliber of actress she always was. Like Gaslight and Notorious, this is the kind of film that gave her a part with some meat on the bones even though the kind of street character it represented was maybe a stretch. She rises to the occasion, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror Lite-Wimpy Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What the code wouldn't let them present with this third version of the Robert Louis Stevenson tale takes away the impact. Despite the MGM gloss, this ends up being flat, some severe miscasting and a lack of sufficient horror partially to blame as well. In spite of some of the reviews regarding leading man Spencer Tracy, I find him perfectly fine in the role of the scientist who turns into a creature of the night thanks to his own potion. Perhaps a bit understated, he doesn't rely on special effects to turn into the mad monster who haunts lady of the night Ingrid Bergman. The transformation is much more physical, slightly protruding teeth and enlarged eyes, allowing Tracy to think his performance than act it. In a sense, this makes him equally as memorable as John Barrymore and Fredrich March with whom Tracy would later co-star in "Inherit the Wind".Bergman gets an A for effort in the sense that she really does strive to become a low-class strumpet but unfortunately is far too lady-like in her interpretation to become believable. Lana Turner is pretty window dressing but not much more as the class equal girl the good doctor loves. She does well, however, in her one scene with Bergman. The supporting cast is fine, and director Victor Fleming does well under the circumstances. At least this version has a few musical interludes and none of the pretentiousness of the silly Broadway musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After drinking a magical elixir during an experiment on behavior control, a scientist discovers it turns him into a raving lunatic which causes deadly problems for the residents of his conservative London community.This was a rather hard-to-place horror film, mainly due to the fact that this just spends so little time actually dealing with horror elements that it's really hard to generate any sense of fear from the proceedings since it spends so little of it's overlong length dealing with them. With the first transformation taking place around the hour mark, we're left with tons of scenes of him talking with all sorts of people, from his fiancée to her parents and his medical partners about their daily lives and so on, which is just endless, boring and not at all relevant for a horror film. Even still, when the change does come it hardly does anything impressive with it, instead turning him into a lecherous old man rather than a diabolical killer, and the transformation's appearance isn't a radical departure at all from most men and doesn't really seem to be appropriate to inspire fear. There's a few times towards the end where it generates some kind of energy, but it's really too little too late to save this bland, boring hardly-horror film.Today's Rating: Unrated/PG-Mild Violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Louis Stevenson's novella "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", first adapted as a play in the 1900s and filmed as a silent in 1920, is ironed out here for upper-crust audiences of 1941--this is no horror movie. Perhaps Fredric March's Oscar-winning turn as Dr. Jekyll in the 1932 version helped to shape the vision and performances, as Spencer Tracy's portrayal of the mad scientist of gas-lit London is played strictly for prestige. Hoping to isolate good and evil individually in the mind of man, Jekyll acts as his own guinea pig and ultimately finds evil the predominant force inside himself. Two striking (if somewhat outrageous) dream sequences are the visual stand-outs, which accentuates the main problem: this story should be told mostly in visual terms, yet director Victor Fleming relies too much on the text. Ingrid Bergman lets her hair down as a lower-class barmaid, but she's as unconvincing saying "ain't" as are the townspeople who greet each other with "'ello, Gov'nuh!" This is mid-Victorian London by way of Hollywood, U.S.A., and while the production is elegant, the movie rarely comes to life. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sanitized Remake of Fredric March Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the third version of the oft filmed Robert Louis Stevenson story of a man's battle with his good and evil personalities. Although I consider the Fredric March version filmed ten years earlier to be better, this is nonetheless an entertaining film. Spencer Tracy takes on the title roles in this version with Ingrid Bergman playing the tragic bar-maid (not prostitute) Ivy Peterson and both are great in their roles. Dr Jekyll (Tracy) is a successful high society doctor who is engaged to Beatrix Emery (the very young and very beautiful Lana Turner) whose father Sir Charles (Donald Crisp) is skeptical of Jekyll's trying to prove that man's soul has two sides...one good and one evil and thus places doubts on his daughter's future happiness. One night while returning home with his friend Dr. Lanyon (Ian Hunter), they come upon bar-maid Ivy Peterson (Bergman) who is being beaten by an unruly patron. Jekyll comes to her aid and takes her home. Ivy is immediately attracted to the suave and debonair Jekyll and tries to seduce him. Jekyll repels her advances but secretly harbors a desire for her. Meanwhile, Sir Charles having become disillusioned with Jekyll's theories, takes Beatrix on a trip to the continent. Jekyll becomes distraught and buries himself in his work. One night he decides to try a formula he has created to separate good and evil personalities on himself. What emerges is a grotesque and brutal personality whom he names Mr. Hyde. Hyde immediately remembers the alluring Ivy and seeks her out. He literally takes over her life and sets her up in a classy apartment and keeps her there "for his own purposes". He brutalizes her to the point the she fears his every appearance. When Sir Charles and Beatrix return from their trip, Sir Charles agrees to an early marriage feeling that Jekyll has finally come to his senses. Jekyll then vows not to become Mr. Hyde again. But unfortunately, he makes an uncontrolled transformation on the street after having assured Ivy that Hyde would no longer bother her when she came to see him earlier. Naturally Hyde goes straight to Ivy's apartment and confronts her on what she had said about him to Jekyll. She tries to escape but to no avail. Jekyll realizes that now he can no longer control Mr. Hyde and goes to Beatrix to break their engagement with tragic results. Tracy's makeup is far less monstrous than that created for Fredric March ten years earlier. Director Victor Fleming goes for exaggerations of Tracy's features and the playing up of the psychological differences between Jekyll and Hyde. The first couple of transformations are played as dream sequences involving good girl Turner and bad girl Bergman. We don't see the actual transformation until well on into the movie. Of note is the fact that although the story is set in late 19th century London, most of the cast speak without British accents. As talented as Ingrid Bergman was, her Cockney bar-maid accent is laughable. Also Jekyll's charitable work with the poor is barely mentioned in this version. In addition to the above principals, look for Barton MacLane as man gone mad, Sara Allgood as his distraught wife, a clean shaven C. Aubrey Smith as a bishop and former silent movie comic Billy Bevan as Mr. Weller a lamplighter. Tracy and Bergman make this an enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde (1941): Starring Spencer Tracey, Ingrid Bergman, Lana Turner, Donald Crisp, Ian Hunter, C. Aubrey Smith, Barton Mclane, Peter Godfrey, Sara Algood, Frederic Worlock, Frances Robinson, Denis Green, Billy Bevan, Forester Harvey...Director Victor Fleming, Screenplay Jon Lee Mahin Based on Robert Louis Stevenson's classic 19th century horror tale, this 1941 Victor Fleming version is possibly the most psychological and less violent/scary of the many Dr Jekill/Mr Hyde movies. Director Victor Fleming had two unforgettable classics under his belt by 1941: 1939's Gone With The Wind which he co-directed and The Wizard of Oz, both films in stunning Technicolor. This black-and-white, low-budget (at least compared to the previous films) film stars Specer Tracey, immediately before starring opposite Katherine Hepburn in "Woman Of The Year" which would introduce American audiences to his great partnership with Hepburn. Tracey portrays Dr. Jekyll with a "British stage actor" approach, and consequently makes him more real and complex. Apart from being torn between his bestial, evil side "Mr. Hyde", he is torn between two women: the beautiful but modest and conformist Victorian lady Beatrix Emery (Lana Turner) with whom he is engaged and the bar maid Ivy Peterson (Ingrid Bergman). With two brand-name actresses in one film, Lana Turner and Ingrid Bergman, this love triangle is all the more delicious. Both actresses are doing great work (Lana Turner steps down from her "sex appeal" allure to portray a modest and demure Victorian lady and Ingrid Bergman portrays the vamp) and Spencer Tracey's performance is exceptional. The more gruesome horror aspects (in the novel and later films he is a cold-blooded killer and rapist) are never present in this more quiet but sinister film. It's powerful message, of man's dichotomy and struggle between good and evil, is brilliantly handled. This is a fine document of 1940's cinema as well. Anyone interested in how horror was filmed in this time should see this film and besides, it's great in so many other aspects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Version Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This M-G-M 1941 version of the classic Robert Louis Stevenson story is cinema at it's greatest and is largely overlooked possibly because of it's depth. This writer has never seen a more malignantly evil Mr.Hyde played to his truly wicked best by the great Spencer Tracy. Tracy's film is essentially a slowed down and very carefully thought out remake of the 1932 Frederic March version.In the Tracy version, there is very unique casting by allowing Ingrid Bergman to play the slutty Ivy while Lana Turner plays the proper and rich Beatrix. In this film,Tracy's Dr.Jekyll is a man deeply in love with the proper Lana Turner whom he is denied even the ability to show affection for in public by her prudish Father played by Donald Crisp.It is at a dinner party that Tracy's Jekyll takes the guests into his confidence by telling them all about his scientific work in trying to separate the evil side from man's good.However,everyone at the party is stunned by Tracy's frank ideas of the good and evil in mankind.Later Dr.Jekyll and his friend Dr.John Lanyon(Ian Hunter)are walking through an area of London where they meet Ingrid Bergman's well played Ivy who's being attacked by two roughnecks.The doctors chase them away and then take a presumably hurt Ivy back to her rooming house.It is only Tracy's Jekyll who's invited into her room where he examines her and is tempted by this sexy woman. Tracy's Jekyll is a brooding character who works in a Gothic laboratory night and day with his chemicals to create a new formula for separating good into evil and evil into good.This first appearance of Tracy's Mr.Hyde is relatively unremarkable, but there is a difference.Tracy's Hyde looks somewhat different with a full head of dark hair,his eyes have a wild look about them,while his nostrils are flared and his teeth look different.His voice is gravelly as he stares into a mirror(as Hyde) and asks with a gleeful excitement, "can this be evil?" Jekyll's fiancée(Turner) is taken to Europe for an uncertain amount of time by her untrusting Father,as the brooding Jekyll who while missing his love takes the chemicals again and but turns into a more physically different Mr. Hyde.This time Mr.Hyde goes out among the public by going to a risqué show at a music hall/pub and sees Ivy working there. Hyde insists Ivy drink with him,she does, he starts a fight,gets her fired and afterward,he begins keeping Bergman's Ivy in rooms that are finely furnished for his own pleasures as Mr.Hyde.Mr.Hyde seems to get whatever he wants ...even if it's at the expense of viciously hurting others.Ivy's girlfriend is shocked to see wounds left by Hyde's cruel pleasure across her friend's back. Shortly afterward,Ivy goes to see Dr.Jekyll about her nerves and the wounds on her back.It's at this point that Jekyll promises Ivy that Hyde will never again bother her.Jekyll stops taking his formula,his fiancée and her Father return from Europe and plans are made for their immediate marriage.As a finely tailored Dr.Jekyll(in top hat and tails) walks to his fiancée's home for a dinner to announce their upcoming marriage,Tracy must stop and sit on a park bench and unexpectedly becomes an even more deranged looking Mr.Hyde!He jumps up and runs toward an unknown destination. The destination is Ivy's apartment.Where he kills her.Tracy's Hyde has no way of turning back into Jekyll so he turns to his friend Dr.Lanyon by writing him a note and begging him to go and get specific chemicals from Jekyll's laboratory and who he should give them to. As soon as Lanyon returns to his home he's met by a more deranged looking Hyde who now has wildly dishevelled hair,darkened teeth,wrinkles around his eyes and refuses to tell him where Jekyll is.Hyde is forced to drink the chemicals in front of Dr. Lanyon and Lanyon watches with a shock as Hyde turns back into Jekyll. Says Lanyon,"you've committed the supreme blasphemy!" Jekyll admits that he has no control over when he will turn into Mr. Hyde now. Later,he visits his fiancée's home explaining to her that they must end their relationship.He leaves going out into the garden where his now ex-fiancée lays crumpled on the steps crying hysterically.We see Tracy's Jekyll almost leaving the garden then he turns and goes back to her.All we see of him now are his hands,shoes, legs,and the lower part of an Inverness cape he's wearing. We see those parts of him as his hysterical Beatrix crawls over to him,grabs his hands and holds them while she continues to weep.But she looks up at her beloved who smiles at her with the horrible face of Mr.Hyde looking every bit like he's escaped from a classic Universal Chiller with dishevelled dark hair,animal-like teeth and wild,evil -looking eyes. She screams for her Father as she faints in Hyde's arms.Immediately her Father runs out onto the patio,Hyde throws the girl onto the patio and begins to tussle with her Father.He ends the Father's small show of force and throws him into the garden.Hyde jumps on top of the Father and beats him to death with his alter ego's cane...breaking it in the process. Later when the police arrive with Dr.Lanyon to investigate the murder scene,it is the Dr. who tells them that Jekyll did it.The police and Dr.Lanyon go to Jekyll's and even find a normal looking Dr. Jekyll who is standing weakly in his laboratory. Lanyon approaches Jekyll and announces,"... that he's the murderer!"But Jekyll stands in front of his friend,police and butler as he declares,"I'm not the murderer!I'm Dr.Henry Jekyll!I'm Dr.Henry Jekyll!I'm Dr.Henry Jekyll...!"The entire time he says this Tracy's Jekyll is turning back into Mr.Hyde.Hyde runs through the laboratory busting glass with a makeshift club. Finally,Hyde grabs a dagger off of his laboratory wall as he walks towards Dr.Lanyon!Lanyon shoots Hyde and his corpse turns back into Dr. Jekyll. Victor Fleming directed Spencer Tracy and Ingrid Bergman in this Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seen on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater in 1964</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1941's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" has long been the version most people see first, because MGM for many years suppressed the 1931 Paramount version with Fredric March, which I too consider superior to this one for its pre-code flair. That is not to say that this is weak by any stretch, as both films are approached from a different perspective in regard to Edward Hyde, March the less likely, primitive Neanderthal Hyde, Spencer Tracy the more realistic, psychological rendition, utilizing little makeup in his chilling, unexpected interpretation. This one takes its time, Hyde making his initial appearance 35 minutes in, and while the pacing never really flags, it does seem to go on a bit too long. Lana Turner compares favorably with Rose Hobart, but it's still a rather thankless role in either version. Ingrid Bergman looks and acts very well (even with her charming accent), but the script doesn't allow her the same latitude that Miriam Hopkins enjoyed. As Lanyon, who exposes his friend Jekyll as the fiend he is, Ian Hunter previously appeared opposite Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff, and Vincent Price in 1939's "Tower of London" (as King Edward), while in one of his last films played another physician in 1960's "Doctor Blood's Coffin." This version of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" made two appearances on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater: Sunday June 7 1964 (paired with Saturday afternoon's "Fiend Without a Face"), and Saturday July 24 1965 (followed by second feature 1943's "Revenge of the Zombies").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of the Stevenson classic story doesn't hold a candle to the 1931 version but it has a lot to recommend on its own. The main complaint about it is that it doesn't feel like a horror film but more a psychological drama or thriller. Spencer Tracy's Hyde is less monsterish than Fredric March's. But this is more in keeping with the story they wanted to tell with this version, which is a focus on the psychological rather than the physical. Still, Tracy does a good job.Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner were originally cast in the other's part but switched to offer Bergman a chance to play against type. This works to great effect, in my opinion. Turner is a sweet, lovely angel here. A far cry from the glamorous femme fatale we think of her as today. As for Bergman, her sexy performance as Ivy is the standout of the film. One of my favorite roles of hers. The movie's a bit slow and probably won't please monster fans but it's a good movie with fine performances and nice direction. It really only suffers by comparison. Judged on its own merits it's very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Handsome but Dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second screen version of the Stevenson novel to come out of Hollywood is glossier than the first but not an improvement. It is a handsome but somewhat dull production. The main problem is that the plot moves at too leisurely of a pace, and the interactions among the characters are not interesting enough to sustain the narrative through nearly two hours. Tracy looks rather comical as the grinning Mr. Hyde, but he does not embarrass himself in this silly role. Bergman seems to be having a lot of fun as the prostitute that Tracy is attracted to and pursues her in his Dr. Hyde persona. Turner is young and lovely in an undemanding role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable interpretation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is (loosely) based on the 1886 novella "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" by Robert Louis Stevenson. The original novella is rightly recognized as a classic but this particular adaptation is considered inferior to the 1931 version starring Fredric March.In the movie, Dr. Henry Jekyll (Spencer Tracy) believes that man's evil side can be controlled through medicine so he conducts experiments to that end. When his proposed patient dies prematurely he decides to test his potion on himself. As a result, he transforms into the evil Mr. Hyde, who terrorizes barmaid Ivy Peterson (Ingrid Bergman).If you've read the novella then you'll see that the movie takes some liberties. Chief among these is the insertion of a pair of female characters, played by Bergman &amp; Lana Turner. The story is sexualized a bit as a result but this doesn't really add much to the film (at least with the sanitization necessary for Code approval). I also felt that Jekyll's plight wasn't as profound as in Stevenson's story but that may be just a matter of personal opinion.In any case, the acting can't be faulted. Spencer Tracy's all wrong for the role of an English doctor but he's electric as the sinister Mr. Hyde. Ingrid Bergman, meanwhile, delivers an impressive performance that possibly ranks as the film's best. Rounding out the leads, Lana Turner looks stunning though her character doesn't make much of an impression.This was director Victor Fleming's first film after helming both "Gone With the Wind" &amp; "The Wizard of Oz" a couple of years earlier. His visuals aren't nearly as sumptuous here, though they are respectable. It's also worth noting that the film received three Oscar nominations in technical categories: best cinematography, editing &amp; music. I found neither of these aspects of the film particularly outstanding, though.Ultimately, I much prefer the original story to this adaptation though I fully understand why it wouldn't work on screen. What we do see here constitutes accomplished filmmaking but the picture is somewhat lifeless on the whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone knows the story: kind Dr. Henry Jekyll (Spencer Tracy) drinks a potion that turns him into vicious Mr. Hyde. When I first saw the movie, I thought that the Hyde character looked like Danny DeVito's interpretation of The Penguin in "Batman Returns". Spencer Tracy does quite well with the role, as do Lana Turner and Ingrid Bergman as his love interests Beatrix Emery and Ivy Peterson, respectively. What's really weird nowadays is to think that "I Dream of Jeannie"'s Gen. Peterson (by whom I mean Barton MacLane) played Sam Higgins. But anyway, it's a well done interpretation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel. And obviously, Gen. Peterson is not related to Ivy Peterson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The studios could pull some pretty low tricks sometimes. When MGM went into production on their version of the classic Robert Louis Stevenson, they bought up the rights the Paramount's 1931 edition, for the purpose of destroying the negative and with it, their competition. Commercial rapacity is potentially more ruthless than censorship or simple negligence. Luckily, they didn't succeed in rooting out every copy so the older film is still extant. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem they paid too much attention to providing a worthy successor.With such a uniquely tricky part as Jekyll/Hyde, casting is a matter of precision. MGM went for the "safe" bet of thrusting their most talented male lead into the role. And Spencer Tracy is undoubtedly a superb actor, but that doesn't mean he can do everything. Among the things he can't do is be convincingly English. Of course, mastering an accent isn't everything, but when you see him in top hat and tails, strutting around a mock-up of Victorian London, hobnobbing with Ian Hunter, and it's STILL the same old Spencer Tracy, a distinctly corny atmosphere descends on the proceedings. But if you think Tracy is bad as an English gent, wait 'til you see Ingrid Bergman as a cockney lass! She is actually acting very well, but when they give her lines like "You aren't half a fast one, aren't you " (sic) with her thick Swedish accent, you can wave bye-bye to any remaining traces of credibility.But of course, the real question is not if Mr Tracy makes a good Jekyll. Does he make a good Hyde? Erm, no. The make-up department have dabbed his face a bit, and Tracy bares his teeth and widens his eyes, but really he still just looks like Spencer Tracy on a bad hair day. He does a pretty good job at being menacing, but major plot points revolve around Hyde being unrecognisable as Jekyll, so again we see believability gurgling away down the plughole. Compare this to the 1931 equivalent, where Fredric March turned into a hairy, subhuman and very un-Marchlike beast. Comparisons are odious, but then so are many aspects of this film.Still, the 1941 version is not without its merits. The screenplay is by John Lee Mahin, a name on many classic pictures, and he has done a nice job here. In the original novel, the narrative is from the point of view of an acquaintance of Jekyll, and the horror derives from the mystery of this strange character Hyde. All the major film versions (including the silent one with John Barrymore) tell it from Jekyll's own perspective, perhaps because the makers in each case felt the story's secret was too well known. In my view, this weakened those earlier film versions. Mahin puts elements of horror back into the plot by focusing much more on the plight of Ivy than on Jekyll's transformations. Hyde's terrorizing of the innocent barmaid takes on the quality of an abusive domestic relationship, and is very effective.Picking up on the horror tone is director Victor Fleming. Fleming had never done a horror before, although bits of Wizard of Oz are certainly creepy, and he adapts to it well enough, with lots of low angles and stark imagery. He keeps a kind of aloof distance in the scenes featuring Tracy as Jekyll, whereas scenes with Hyde are full of mean close-ups. He excellently handles the tension-filled meetings between Tracy-as-Hyde and Bergman making great use of the cramped space of Ivy's flat (which incidentally is unfeasibly lavish, but otherwise a fine bit of set design by Cedric Gibbons and Edwin Willis). When Tracy sits at the piano there is a long take with Bergman sitting nervously in the background, and then suddenly we are thrown into close-ups against blank backgrounds, the camera wheeling round with the actors in a truly chilling moment.But ultimately, the quality of the monster is a major factor in a horror movie. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was a critical and commercial flop. The grand irony is that MGM's purchase of the Paramount version means today the two appear side by side on the same DVD (produced by Warner Brothers, who now own large chunks of MGM's back catalogue) and viewers can decide with ease which is the better. Or should that be "least bad"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just re-watched the Spencer Tracy version. Now I'm more positive than ever that it can't hold a candle to the 1931 Fredric March version for me. I've still managed to give it two and a half out of four stars though, because if it is to be considered on its own without ever having seen the 1931 classic to spoil it, it's still a pretty good movie. But when comparing it to the Rouben Mamoulian film, here are my quibbles: Tracy is a fine actor but is unbelievable and miscast as a too-modern Jekyll; he even says "Yeah" to his butler at one point. Everyone pronounces the name as "Jeh-kull" instead of "Gee-kull". The makeup on Hyde is practically non-existent (it's hard to believe that people cannot easily recognize this Jekyll when he's Hyde!), and while Tracy's performance is better when he's Hyde and he pulls it off, he is no match for Fredric March's Oscar-winning turn as the sadistic madman.The scenes between Hyde and Ivy feel too long and stretched out. Miriam Hopkins' Ivy has it all over Ingrid Bergman in every way. So much of the dialogue is the same or very similar to the 1931 film that I don't even know why they bothered with the remake, and it's a sin that the studio felt it necessary to take the older movie out of circulation and hide it; but I guess that's the only way the 1941 film could work and not be compared to its superior. But I will say one thing --- Lana Turner here is much hotter than Rose Hobart. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Two Jekyls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1932 Fredric March film deals with a sensational duality of spirit, psyche, and physical appearance. The 1941 Spencer Tracy film is a more tempered, pathetic and dull story of sadism. The character of Ivy (played by Ingrid Bergman and expanded in scale) is tormented and tortured before finally killed; it is a role reminiscent of Gaslight with no relief for the brutalized Bergman. The weight of the suffering Ivy character is different and, hence, so is the story.I addition, the second film has little drive. The desperate love and thwarted longing in the March version serve as different sorts of engines for the Hyde character's animal desire. The conflict presented by the delayed wedding and the disapproving future father-in-law set the torment and drama in motion. Of the two versions, the 1932 film feels more like an allegory for the temptations and gluttony of addiction, as well as for the duality of man and the battle of the id and ego. March is at his handsomest and in the Jekyll/Hyde role he embodies both Dorian Gray AND his picture: the ideal and beauty of March's Dr. Jekyll make the good and evil metaphor that much stronger. The 1941 Spencer Tracy film, though subtler, feels more like a psycho-melodrama. Plus, the film is surprisingly listless in places; the script is a snoozer. Luckily there is some gorgeous photography now and then (Hyde running down the foggy street).Along with the pedestrian script, the startling fact is: Tracy is amazingly uninteresting in this role. It was said he didn't want the part and, as it turned out, he was right. I've read that March called Tracy up after the remake was released and thanked him: "I haven't gotten such good reviews in years."PS Interesting post production sound goof: when Bergman removes the foil on the Champaign bottle there is a loud "pop". When she then removes the cork: silence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A VERY toned down remake of the 1932 classic. Dr. Jekyll (a badly cast Spencer Tracy) develops a formula that turns him into the evil Mr. Hyde. He terrorizes a barmaid (Ingrid Bergman also miscast) and tries to control himself around his girlfriend (Lana Turner). He destroys the formula but finds himself changing without it and he can't control it.A commercial and critical failure and it's easy to see why. It looks great--very elaborate sets--and has some nice direction but that's it. The movie moves far too slowly and gets boring. Tracy was totally miscast. He looks miserable and he looked more funny than frightening as Hyde. Bergman is also badly cast as the "bad girl". Turner has nothing to work with. Slow and dull. Tracy and Bergman hated it too.

		<shortDescription>Pallid Remake of the 1931 Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1941 version of Robert Louis Stevenson's dual personality tale is like a waxen apple. It looks lustrous and enticing but it lacks flavor and sustenance. The crew responsible for DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE, including art directors Cedric Gibbons and Daniel B. Cathcart and set decorator Edwin B. Willis, create a lavish and attractive Victorian London setting but director Victor Fleming fails to breathe life into this film.Part of the problem is that the setting looks TOO lavish and attractive. Even the lower class sections, where Mr. Hyde (Spencer Tracy) entraps the flirtatious barmaid Ivy Peterson (Ingrid Bergman)convey a polished veneer. How can horror be effectively generated in such gleaming backdrops? A greater problem is that the movie is a remake of the 1931 Rouben Mamoulian version. Mamoulian could effectively demonstrate that Hyde represented the raging libido repressed in Jekyll because at the time he made this version, the Production Code was not rigid. By the time MGM gave Fleming the task of directing the 1941 version, the Code held an iron grip on the film industry. Thus Dr. Jekyll (Tracy) is extremely restrained in his love scenes with Ivy and his fiancee Beatrix Emery (Lana Turner). Fleming tries to illustrate Jekyll's sexual frustration through allegoric dream sequences. But the symbolism employed (Jekyll whips horses that transform into images of Ivy and Beatrix, Jekyll rips off Ivy's head like a cork in a liquor bottle) is too ridiculous to be effective.Then there is the miscasting of Tracy in the title roles. As Dr. Jekyll, he is too American and plebian in his manner to convincingly play an English gentleman and he is too earthy and unrefined to convincingly play a scientist. As Mr. Hyde, he glowers and snarls but lacks an aura of evil, thus emerging more of a crank than a demon. Of the other major actors, only Ingrid Bergman displays any vitality. She projects a coarse sensuality that even the Code cannot suppress. Unfortunately, her Swedish accent hampers her Cockney characterization. The other actors merely go through the paces.The 1941 version is sufficiently disappointing on its own. But it's all the more disappointing when comparing it not only with the 1931 version but with the original novel as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite original enough on its own but a good adaptation nevertheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Real problem with this movie is that it basically is a 10 year later remake of the movie "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" from 1931. It uses all of the best moments from that movie in this one with as a result that this movie feels lacking in true originality and creativity on its own. Still the movie is a well made one, that certainly is worth watching.The movie is not told in the most arousing pace. The movie also doesn't always handle the story well. The inner conflict between Dr. Jekyll's good and evil side is not always notably well present. Because of all these reasons, the movie is also lacking in true tension and mystery. The movie remains interesting enough to follow but it isn't terribly creative or imaginative all. A bit of a disappointment from the director who brought us "The Wizard of Oz" and "Gone with the Wind" before.The movie is good looking and at times its cinematography is really superb. It provides the movie with some great and spooky genre sequences, which on their own are unfortunately not enough to carry the movie to an higher level. The movie is made in a typical '40's style. Everything is cheap looking, mainly its sets, but it serves its purpose all nevertheless. It's effects are acceptable, although the make-up effects are perhaps a bit too simple. It actually made me realize how brilliant the effects and make-up effects in the '31 version all were.The movie has some big names in its cast. Can't say that I'm too happy with the choice of Spencer Tracy for the role of Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde. First of all, he was too old looking for the part and further more he doesn't play Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde always convincing enough. He isn't monstrous/villainous enough as Mr. Hyde which makes his character falls flat at times. Overall he also has a very old fashioned way of acting which doesn't really suit this movie right. Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner are both good and well cast as the leading ladies and they still put some life into the movie its story and characters.I know I probably sound very negative about this movie but that's just because the '31, of which this movie is an obvious remake, is so much inferior. This movie doesn't add enough on its own to the long list of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde movies.Still the movie is quite good enough on its own. The story remains interesting and compelling and the movie features some well executed sequences, which is thanks to the professional directing and actors involved. The story is well told, even though it has some missed opportunities in it.I recommend you watch the '31 version instead, nevertheless this movie still remain good and pleasurable on its own, to consider this a movie well worth watching.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My disadvantage it seems, is that I haven't seen the 1931 version of Jekyll and Hyde with Frederic March, so my only other point of reference is with the 1920 silent film starring John Barrymore in the title role. The story line in this film slightly varies the characters and situations, and that's probably the case with all of the movie adaptations, of which there seems to be quite a few.I don't know if Spencer Tracy would have been the best choice for Jekyll/Hyde, he doesn't seem to have the demeanor or countenance for a film bordering on horror. However I thought the on screen transformation of the character was done well enough given the era, much like Lon Chaney Jr.'s character Lawrence Talbot turning into the Wolf Man the same year, 1941. Even so, the difference in appearance wasn't exaggerated enough to cause someone like Ivy Peterson (Ingrid Bergman) to be oblivious of the fact.The one thing that bothered me though occurred not once but twice in the story. The first time was when 'Hyde' called on Ivy while her friend Marcia (Frances Robinson) was present, the second time when Ivy was alone in her apartment. With all the worry she had to deal with wondering if Hyde would show up again to torment her, wouldn't it have been a good idea to keep her door locked?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie, but not formidable. Tracy gives a difficult and good performance. Ingrid is sexy and gives a great performance too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde" is a strange movie of MGM as the studio was dedicated to glamorous films and not horror or Gothic movies. So the film has a glamor mixed with terror. This is not bad. It's a nice combination. I can not say that it's a great movie. It's good, but not stunning and it's a bit long. The action could develop quicker or maybe more things could take place. I saw the film first in a European language (Hungarian, I think) with subtitles in my language and it did not help.However, I watched the movie a second time in English. I liked more. I saw it again and I enjoyed it even more. It's one of those movies that gets better and better with a new view.I've never seen the 1931 version in order to compare the performance of Fredric March with Spencer Tracy but I like Tracy's work. His Hyde doesn't need excessive make-up to be scary or convincing. Tracy scares as Hyde and, at the same time, can be lovely as Jekyll.Ingrid Bergman is gorgeous. Perhaps more beautiful than in Casablanca. I like to see her hairstyle in the Victorian style, as in Gasthlight. The accent bothers but gives a certain charm. Her performance is good and there are formidable close-ups. No actress is more luminous on a film in black and white as Ingrid Bergman. Her first close-up is very beautiful. It shows her face turning around for Tracy as she adjusts her hat on her head. Similarly, when Hyde comes back home without her expecting, the close-up of her tired face is also stunning (sexy is not a characteristic I associate with Bergman but she proved it she can be).Lana Turner doesn't have a very deep role on the movie. I love this actress. She is very beautiful. More than in "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and almost as beautiful as in "Ziegfeld Girl". I admire Turner very much since she is able to interpret the sweet girl just as well as the femme fatale. Cheryl, her daughter, in the book she wrote about her mother, says Turner was sad for not playing opposite with Bergman, except for the dream scene in which the two are whipped by Tracy. Although the role of Beatrix is flat, the scene where she cries for Tracy is very emotional. I almost cry. She is very good. The scenes with Bergman don't make me feel such a strong emotion as the scenes of Turner. Her beauty didn't allow people to see that Turner was a competent actress. Turner's beauty is greater than Bergman's. But not the charm. Bergman shines.The story is good but I think it could have been more explored (more things, please, more happenings, more plot).It also bothers me that Jekyll doesn't feel any remorse for what he's doing to Bergman.The actor who plays the father of Beatrix and the actress who plays the friend of Ivy (Bergman) have good performances, as well as the rest of the cast. Photography is the best of the film: the opening scene with the church tower, the lovely and exquisite sceneries as the greenhouse where Tracy dances with Turner, the mysterious streets with the fog, the original laboratory. This is an essential movie for Tracy and Bergman's fans, for their hard performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good adaptation of a classic story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exactly 10 years after the release of Rouben Mamoulian's 1931 version of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" (starring Frederich March), MGM studios decided to make a new adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's famous novel. Attempting to make a sumptuous and impressive adaptation, the studios gave the job to their most famous and successful director at the time, Victor Fleming, who by then counted two of the most important films ever made in his resumé: "Gone with the Wind" and "The Wizard of Oz". In order to make his adaptation the definitive version of the novel, Fleming had the most successful actors of the time at his hand: Lana Turner, Ingrid Bergman and finally, Spencer Tracy in the dual role of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.Set in the 18th century, the film tales the story of Dr. Henry Jekyll (Tracy), a young and successful physician, who has developed a theory to separate the two sides of the human soul, the "good side" from the "evil side", in an attempt to free mankind of the constant temptation of the dark side. However, the scientific community and even his friends think he is being too ambitious, so Jekyll decides to test his theories and experiments himself, awaking his inner dark side, the sadistic Mr. Hyde, a cruel and vile man, who is decided to cause pain in Jekyll's life focusing on the two women he loves the most: his fianceé Beatrix Emery (Lana Turner) and a woman he once helped, Ivy Peterson (Ingrid Bergman).While it was intended as new adaptation, writer John Lee Mahin based a lot of his screenplay in the 1931 version (in turn based on a play), making the film an exact remake of Rouben Mamoulian's film, albeit with certain differences. The main chance is the fact that Mahin focuses his story on the attraction Jekyll/Hyde feels towards two very different women as the main theme of the film. Jekyll's love to Beatrix is tainted by his lust towards Ivy, and this lust is what gives Hyde enough power to overcome Jekyll. This subtle, yet important change makes Fleming's film to become more a drama about a bizarre love triangle, although it does keep the horror elements intact.As the script verges towards melodrama, Fleming takes this on his advantage to make his film in the same spirit of his better known love stories. Lushier and sumptuous, Fleming's movie is more straight-forward than Mamoulian's experimental and artistic version, and despite giving more importance to the love stories, it's definitely less sexual than the 30s film (mainly because of the enforcement of the Hays code). The bigger budget allowed Fleming to make an elegant and classy period piece, that complemented by an excellent musical score by Franz Waxman, allow a bigger immersion into the movies' story.Very criticized on its initial release, Spencer Tracy makes a competent performance in the dual role. The comparison with the superiors Barrymore (of the 20s version) and March (f the 30s film) truly make shim look poor, but in all fairness, Tracy did justice to the character, and his choice of subtler make-up is also adequate. While Tracy is unconvincing at times, Bergman is the truly jewel of the movie, as while her role is small, she makes it her own and demonstrates her amazing talent. Lana Turner is less fortunate, but she delivers an effective performance as Jekyll's beloved Beatrix.This film has been very harshly criticized, specially as it compares unfavorably with Mamoulian's previous version, but Fleming's film is not really as bad as that may make one believe. While it's true that it's more a drama than a horror film, the movie manages to be haunting (mainly because of Tracy's take on Hyde) and really entertaining. Fleming's restrained approach works excellently with the period melodrama take on the script, and while nowhere near Fleming's most celebrated works, it's appropriate for a compelling romance story.I must admit that personally, I find Mamoulian's version a triumph not only of the horror genre, but of cinema as a whole, however, the 1941 version of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is by no means a failure. Victor Fleming's take on the story is a classy period piece that will definitely be pleasant for fans of 40s films, specially for fans of Spencer Tracy and Ingrid Bergman. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As The March Version, But A Fine Film In It's Own Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the 1941 Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde with Spencer Tracy after viewing the 1932 Pre-Code Fredric March version first, so my opinion of this film was always going to be dented a little in comparison to the earlier work. Ultimately I favour the March film over this, but the MGM version is memorable and worthwhile in it's own right.Tracy's Hyde is a lot subtler than March's Hyde, and his Jekyll is a lot less theatrical. Tracy's typically understated acting style is appealing in his handling of Jekyll, as he makes the scientist a more pensive, sympathetic character than March's 'mad doctor' performance. However, Tracy looks decidedly uncomfortable throughout the film despite turning in a very good acting performance. It is one of his strangest roles, and apparently he detested himself in the film, fearing his career would be ruined. It wasn't ruined however, and this is an essential film for Tracy fans.The make-up for Hyde in this is very good, very subtle. Tracy's Hyde is perhaps more chilling because his appearance is a logical extension of Jekyll's, rather than March's simian-like creature. The transformation sequences are handled excellently, and I do feel that Fleming's version demonstrates the duality of human nature better than the Mamoulian film. By making Hyde's features less exaggerated and monstrous, Fleming conveys that badness is lurking below the surface in every man- even the calm, measured Tracy.Ingrid Bergman is fantastic as bad-girl Ivy, who represents Jekyll/Hyde's suppressed desires and longings. Her attempt at a Cockney accent is quite bad, but Bergman was always the best at displaying the complex emotional state of her characters, and she does it so beautifully here. Turner, not a favourite of mine, has some reasonably good moments as Beaxtrix, Jekyll's good-girl fiancé. It's a role written in such a way that Turner could do little with it, yet she does make an equally sympathetic character as Bergman's Ivy is.The major issue that hampers Fleming's production is it's complete lack of atmosphere. This is where the Pre-Code version, in all its raunchy glory, vaults over the 1941 film. The MGM studios had typically bourgeois values when it came to film-making, hence the brightly lit, elaborately decorated sets and overall glossy feel. While March and Hopkins' encounters are raw, brutal and sexually invigorating, Tracy and Bergman's feel rather staged and uncertain. Also, the Hayes Code impacted heavily upon the MGM version. Many of the scenes from Mamoulian's work (indeed, most of them- some of the dialogue is word-for-word) have been re-made and watered down to a saccharine Victorian costume melodrama, which takes away much of the energy and vitality of the film. Tracy and Bergman's 'garters' conversation is dull and forced compared to Hopkins' and March's very suggestive, sexually-charged sequence. In terms of entertainment, I think that the 1932 version definitely comes up trumps. This one suffers from bad pacing throughout, which leads to boredom and a duller production.The March version also was, for it's time, a cinematic marvel of daring brilliance.This film deals with the psychology of Stevenson's original work better, and has a definite religious element running throughout. Also of note is the Freudian imagery employed in a number of key scenes. Tracy's Hyde whipping horses that turn into the women in his life, the naked Bergman and Turner, is a visual highlight. Fine supporting work from wonderful C.Aubrey Smith and Donald Crisp is another reason to take a look.This film pales in comparison to the older version, but it is nowhere near as bad as some have previously labelled it as.See it and enjoy.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting a more chilling picture. The Hyde character is very interesting but I didn't feel he got enough attention, he simply wasn't horrific. The make-up was poor, I wanted to see the horror, a more chilling look.This picture isn't a horror film, it doesn't scare but it features thoughtful characters. Spencer Tracy is quite good here, he plays both roles well. Ingrid Bergman is pretty amazing, her performance has plenty of range, just watch her with Hyde. Lana Turner is uninteresting, not a lot to offer really. The story itself is a little to light, I think the direction required more horror but I don't that was ever the intention.The photography is excellent, the fog is perfect.A good film but I wish there was more horror. The performances are excellent, especially Bergman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingrid Bergman ain't no cockney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr Jekyll (Spencer Tracy) has some ideas about good and evil that don't go down too well amongst his peers. He suggests that everyone has a pure good side and a pure evil side within. He secretly shuts himself away and experiments and formulates a potion which he drinks himself. Uh-oh....he's turned into Mr Hyde. Time to rampage about in an evil way. There are two love interests - Dr Jekyll's fiancée, Beatrix (Lana Turner) and Mr Hyde's obsession, Ivy (Ingrid Bergman). Can Dr Jekyll succeed in surpressing his evil side...? This film is a little too long but nevertheless keeps you watching. The best of the cast is Donald Crisp who plays "Sir Charles" the father of "Beatrix". The worst performance is that of Ingrid Bergman. Whilst she has a face that portrays suffering and intensity very effectively, she unfortunately tends to overact in parts which makes her appear neurotic and crazy - and she does not convince as a cockney barmaid. She's way too sophisticated to be a slag and her dialogue does not ring true even though she tries by throwing in the word "ain't" all over the place. Bad casting.The film keeps you watching with anticipation but it has some empty patches. It also strikes a chord with everyone as we recognize ourselves in both Jekyll (when we're normal) and Hyde (after a few drinks).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman intoxicates; Tracy terrifies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The performance of Ingrid Bergman is the highlight of this version of the Jekyll and Hyde story. In the version directed by Rouben Mamoulian about ten years earlier, Miriam Hopkins, in the same role, also managed to steal most of her scenes. But due to the loving embrace of the camera under the direction of Victor Fleming, Bergman blossoms here in a way that is absolutely intoxicating. It was not typical for an actress to emote so nakedly and in such a sustained manner in Hollywood features of that time. Bergman later won an Oscar giving a similar performance as the victimized wife in George Cukor's GASLIGHT. Spencer Tracy as the two title characters admirably insisted on eschewing the extreme makeup applied to Fredric March in the Mamoulian version, but there is still enough of it on his face to make it clear that there is more to Hyde than mere acting. Lana Turner as Jekyll's innocent fiancée does very well and looks delectable. None of the three leads attempts much of an English accent, but C. Aubrey Smith as a bishop, Donald Crisp as Turner's father and Ian Hunter as a doctor supply that atmospheric element. The general look of this project betrays its MGM pedigree: the London streets and interiors have the antiseptic, high-lit look so common to productions from that studio. But despite the unconvincing faux London of the 1880's, the viewer is held captive by the terrifyingly nasty performance of Tracy as Hyde and the expertly staged, suspenseful action scenes that carry the story to its climax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>although Spencer Tracy zeroes in on his dual role with perfection, the rest of movie does not and what we get is really just a bland retelling of an otherwise classic tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Victor Fleming's adaptation of the classic Gothic tale of Jekyll and Hyde features a well-cast Spencer Tracy, gorgeous black-and-white cinematography, an intriguing music score and visual effects, and certainly looks good, it also suffers from a great many flaws and the worst of these is a significant lack of energy. It's not necessarily a bad movie. I felt it was mediocre, but it's not bad. It's just no "Gone With the Wind" (1939). Not even close.Spencer Tracy is widely considered one of the greatest actors who ever lived and looking at his performance in this retelling of the classic story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, one can see that this podium is well-deserved. Some have sniffed that he was too old to play the part and maybe he was, but does that matter? What I really admired was how he could brilliantly balance his dual role. How MAD and SICK he could look when playing the always-conniving Mr. Hyde and then all of a sudden revert back into the kindly, harmless-looking Dr. Jekyll.But while Spencer Tracy is brilliant, the rest of the movie, including Victor Fleming's directing, is not quite on par. At nearly a full two hours in length, the film runs on for much too long due to the fact that most of its scenes are lengthy and ponderous and do not seem to have an idea of where it's going. There are many scenes where Spencer Tracy, as Mr. Hyde, is taunting Ingrid Bergman in one of the strangest performances of the legendary actress's career, that could have been fascinating and breath-holding, but instead really seem to overstay their welcome and even begin to water down Tracy's mad intensity as the madman. Also, the movie boasts many scenes of Tracy changing from Jekyll to Hyde and back and uses a clever use of fading, sort of like the Wolf man, and this is interesting the first time. But when it happens repeatedly over and over again, with fades going on for sometimes more up to a whole minute, well?you get my point. In the end, Victor Fleming's retelling of Jekyll and Hyde is nothing great, but it's not significant or particularly interesting either. And although Ingrid Bergman was one of the finest actresses of all time, here I think she miscast herself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't say I thought much of it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is set during the year 1897 in London where scientist Dr. Henry Jekyll (Spencer Tracy) has come up with the notion that in all of us there exists a 'good' &amp; 'bad' persona, he also has the idea that he can develop a serum which can separate the two &amp; theoretically leaving only the 'good'. In his laboratory Jekyll invents a serum which he tests out on himself, the results are startling as Jekyll becomes engulfed by his evil alter-ego Mr. Hyde (Tracy again) who likes to beat, intimidate &amp; frighten local Cockney hooker Ivy Peterson (Ingrid Bergman). Meanwhile Jekyll's fiancé Beatrice Emery (Lana Turner) is taken away by her protective father Sir Charles (Donald Crisp) as he doesn't like Jekyll. Depressed Jekyll spends his time working but Mr. Hyde begins to take over which leads to madness, deceit &amp; murder...Directed by Victor Fleming I can't say this film particularly did anything for me. The script by John Lee Mahin was loosely based on the novel 'The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' by Robert Louis Stevenson &amp; while I have not read the book apparently this version (as most) doesn't seem to follow it that closely, for instance neither Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde are given any kind of female love interest &amp; in that sense the script turns what is essentially a tale of horror into a romance which in this case I found rather dull. For a start there can't be too many potential viewers out there who don't know or at least have an idea about the basic story already, the good Dr. Jekyll invents potion which turns him into the evil Mr. Hyde, simple. So in that respect this will hold little in the way of surprises for anyone &amp; before anyone says this was the 'original' version there were at least eleven (!) prior to this with the first dating back to 1908 so while I admit I haven't seen any of them I'd imagine this is nothing more than a rehash of ideas &amp; themes from previous films a concept for which these days films get slaughtered for. Having said that it's watchable, the character's are OK, it tells what is basically a good story in a decent way although I did think at almost two hours it was a bit to long &amp; way too slow.Director Fleming does OK, obviously you have to take into consideration that it was made 65 years ago &amp; a lot of things have changed since then. I didn't think it was scary, in fact Tracy's Mr. Hyde make-up when viewed today seems rather funny. It goes without saying there's no violence or anything likely to offend.Technically the film is very good, it's well made with nice production values &amp; a decent Victorian feel to the sets &amp; decor. Looking at it I'd have thought it would have had a decent budget. The acting was OK, no-one stood out to me &amp; Tracy wasn't nasty enough for me as Mr. Hyde.Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is an average time waster if your stuck for nothing to do on a Saturday afternoon with the kids, I'm sorry but that's how I felt about it. Not as good as it reputation may suggest...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good, though so close to the 1931 version that this one doesn't seem all that necessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the fortune of seeing BOTH this version and the 1931 Frederic March version only about a week apart. Because of this it gave me an excellent chance to compare and contrast them. And it also gave me a chance to see that the two films were extremely similar--so similar that the later MGM film seems more a remake of the 1931 film and not an adaptation of the original book. There was much more similarity between the movies than the book. And, while they both are good, I would definitely say that I preferred the earlier version.Since the 1931 film was made during the so-called "Pre-Code" era before the guidelines of the production code governing morality in pictures was enforced, it is a more "earthy" and sexually charged film. In this earlier version, March develops the chemical formula simply out of curiosity and a desire to "sow wild oats" without detection. In other words, since Mr. Hyde looked more like a half-man/half-chimp, he could whore around without getting caught or ruining his reputation. The 1941 version had much nobler intent, as nice-guy Dr. Jekyll created his elixir in order to separate the good and evil aspects of our personalities so we could live purer and more wholesome lives without our subconscious evil desires impeding us! In addition, since the 1931 version was pre-Code, it tended to show more skin and imply more about sex, whereas the 1941 version showed Hyde more as a sadist. In general, the 1941 version was a little bit tamer and more "family-friendly", though I think both are fine for older kids.There were a few negatives I noticed in this otherwise well-made film. One was that Hyde looked almost exactly like Dr. Jekyll. This MIGHT have been a daring and intelligent way to take the movie (though certainly NOT in keeping with Robert Lewis Stevenson's book)--showing the "monster" as looking like a sloppy man, but a man nevertheless. However, this makes no sense, as Ingrid Bergman (the woman Hyde desires) already met Dr. Jekyll BEFORE meeting Hyde and yet couldn't see that they were the same guy! At the very least, she should have thought they were brothers! But, to go to Dr. Jekyll and complain about how abusive Hyde was just seemed silly.Also another quibble is with the choice of Ms. Bergman as the earthy barmaid (in the 1931 version, she seemed more like a prostitute than a member of the working poor). Changing her part a bit wasn't the problem, but that Ingrid sounded like a Swedish lady trying to sound Cockney--which is what she was! At times, she forgot the accent altogether and at other times she just sounded kind of weird. She was a wonderful actress, but the casting decision was dumb.As far as Tracy goes, he was fine as Jekyll, but there were times when it was obvious that you were watching a stuntman instead of Tracy. The scenes just weren't done very well and you can't blame Tracy for this but the director. Just watch the scene in the hallway after Hyde's confrontation with Bergman--it's pretty obvious that the guy jumping about isn't Tracy and it doesn't look much like him.One observation about Tracy. I've recently read a biography about him and choosing him to play the lead was pretty interesting because in real life, Tracy definitely had a "Jekyll and Hyde" personality. When he was sober (which apparently wasn't often enough), he was a sweet guy, but when he drank he was abusive and very reminiscent of the dreaded Hyde. I wonder if anyone at the time noticed this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another decade, another Jekyll &amp; Hyde classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With an interval of approximately ten years each time, classic horror cinema brought forward no less than 3 essential versions of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". This extremely fancy and well-budgeted MGM version definitely features the biggest names, but it's actually LESS convincing than the silent version starring John Barrymore and it certainly is not a patch on the absolute best adaptation, the Oscar-winning 1931 milestone starring Frederic March. Nonetheless, this is a very stylish and beautifully filmed drama that fans of classic horror cinema can't allow themselves to skip. Director Victor Fleming (who previously made "The Wizard of Oz") loyally follows Stevenson's story of the good but overly ambitious doctor Jekyll who transforms into a homicidal monster after experimenting upon himself. His intense attempts to separate the "good" and "evil", that supposedly home inside every human being, bring out the hideous alter ego of Mr. Hyde, who terrorizes a young prostitute. It's rather disappointing how the screenplay almost automatically and exclusively equals the "evil" of man with sexual repression. You can never really symphatize or even support Dr. Jekyll's theories about the human mind simply because he himself only seems to use them to still his perverted sexual hunger. The transformation-sequences are atmospheric enough, but a little too long and less stunning than the ones in the silent version, made 20 years before! Spencer Tracy plays a respectable double-role, but the gorgeous Lana Turner is a little miscast as the cherubic and exaggeratedly docile fiancée. Ingrid Bergman is terrific even though she hardly looks like a cheap barmaid/prostitute.</fullReview>

What's shocking is that this version is toned down. The violence, intensity and sexuality is turned way down, which I would have thought would be the other way around.

The story is the same, as educated and civilized Henry Jekyll, obsessed with the dual nature of man, experiments with a serum to control the evil side in all of us, but instead it backfires, as it overtakes him instead, turning him into Mr. Hyde, who proceeds to cause havoc, terrorizing barmaid Ivy Peterson(played by Ingrid Bergman) who still finds herself transfixed by him, though he treats her horribly.

		<fullReview>As clichéd as it might sound, remakes are rarely better than their originals, and this remake is no exception. The thing is I much prefer the 1931 film with Fredric March which was stylish, exciting and erotic and March was absolutely outstanding. By all means this version is worth seeing, but it does have a number of problems.Starting with the good things, the production values while not as stylish are fairly impressive with gorgeous cinematography and some effective looking sets. The screenplay does have some nice touches, and Donald Crisp is brilliant as Sir Charles Emery. Victor Fleming(Gone With the Wind, Wizard of Oz) does a decent job directing and the music score sets the mood well, but... despite all this there is something missing.I think the film's main problems are the length and pacing. The film is a little too long, but I think the pacing was more of an issue. Some scenes are very slow and ponderous. Also the focus here is less on the horror of the situation than the doctor's emotional turmoil, and this is done to little dramatic effect here. While Crisp is brilliant, the other performances are variable. Spencer Tracy's split-personality performance here is somewhat uneven, what I mean by that is that while he was fine as the good hearted Dr Jekyll, despite the impressive and scary transformation montage I for one found him too restrained as Mr Hyde. Ingrid Bergman disappointed me, she is a beautiful and great actress and here while she looks luminous her accent leaves a lot to be desired. Then there is Lana Turner, I am not a massive fan of Miss Turner to be perfectly honest, though she was beautiful and haunting as Milady De Winter in The Three Musketeers, but she is rather bland here. I am probably alone here but I also thought the ending was a bit of a let down.Overall, disappointing and inferior, but worth watching. 5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What we have here is a very poor rendition of the famous R.L. Stevenson story. The first hour is incredibly dull with absolutely no character to it or dark, scary quality at all. Spencer Tracy's Mr. Hyde is merely a sort of creepy manipulative jerk, nothing particularly frightening about him until maybe the climactic last 20 minutes or so. Things do heat up pretty well in the final scene. If only the rest of the movie had even a pinch of that energy.The one outstanding element of the film is the stunning beauty of Lana Turner in the role of Jekyll's fiancé. Just, wow. The second female role is played by Ingrid Bergman. She does a fine job as usual but her character's situation is somewhat muddled. Other reviews have referred to her character as a prostitute which if true would make a lot more sense but thats never in any way really defined in the movie. She just seems to be a bar maid. I don't know if this was just a Hays Code era obfuscation or what, but it leaves some questions in the plot.UPDATE: Now having seen the other two major film versions (Fredric March version and John Barrymore version) I can safely say this is by far the worst version. This movie is nothing but a stale lifeless remake of the 1932 Fredric March version. Many of the scenes are nearly identical except with all the life sucked out of them. The 1932 version easily stands among other pre-code horror as a classic of the genre where this ill-conceived remake is an all around dud. One of the problems is that Jekyll is supposed to be this bright, talented, honorable young man with a promising future. It's part of what creates the contrast between Jekyll and Hyde and creates the tragic arc of the plot. Unlike Barrymore and March who fit that part very well, Tracy is not particularly young or bright in this role. Also, March's Mr. Hyde was a purely terrifying monster and Barrymore's was a nefarious skulking villain, but Tracy fails to make any significant impact with his comparatively tame attempt at bad behavior.</fullReview>

This most recent viewing had me enjoying the film more than I ever had in the past but there's still no question that it's a mess all around. With such a large studio as MGM, a hot director like Victor Fleming and a cast that includes Tracy, Ingrid Bergman, Lana Turner and countless great character actors, there's really no excuse for the film turning out the way it did but when you've got an aggravated star refusing to wear make-up then you know you're in trouble. I understand that Tracy was wanting to do something deeper, more serious than a monster movie and that's fine but the execution here simply wasn't good enough. People joked back in the day that when they visited the set they couldn't tell who Tracy was playing because he looked the same all the time. This causes a major problem in the film during one of the most important scenes. It's when Bergman comes to Jekyll seeking help from Hyde yet she can't tell that they're one in the same even when they look 100% alike. Bergman is clearly the best thing about the film as she does a wonderful job with the emotionally damaged character. Turner is as charming as ever and we get some nice support from the likes of Donald Crisp, Ian Hunter, Barton MacLane, C. Aubrey Smith and Billy Bevan. As for Tracy, I think the film would have benefited from someone else. He's clearly not enjoying himself and that greatness you're used to seeing from him is simply missing here. His Mr. Hyde is one of the most forgettable of any version I've seen. This MGM version really contains zero horror elements, which is fine but if you're going to try to do something different then you really need to do it right or else it just feel uneven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but not as good as the 1931 film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is MGM's glossy, scene-for-scene remake of the earlier, shorter, and rather better 1931 film starring Fredric March and Miriam Hopkins. Tracy does well in the dual title role, the kindly, but quite mad doctor and his beastly other half. Ingrid Bergman is the sexy barmaid who becomes the wretched Mr. Hyde's prisoner, and Lana Turner is Jekyll's pretty fiancee. Despite some serious miscasting(Bergman should have played the Turner role and Turner should have played the Bergman role), this is an agreeable retelling of the Robert Louis Stevenson story, but it isn't the classic the 1931 film is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bunny and the Rat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A scene in this movie has Dr. Jekyll experimenting his formula on a formerly fluffy rabbit and a formerly biting rat--a funny scene in a cute way. Overall, this is a very tame adaptation. It's far removed from Robert Louis Stevenson's original novella; its source is the 1931 film, which itself came more from the stage rather than the book. The lawyer Mr. Utterson, the original protagonist, is completely gone here, and Jekyll and Hyde's relationship with the barmaid (not prostitute, nor dancer) becomes even more of the center of the story.Compounding the loss of many of the more interesting elements of the original story, this 1941 version is missing the innovative camera-work that made the 1931 film stand out. There are some low camera angles here, but nothing chancy. Instead, there are close-ups highlighting Spencer Tracy and Ingrid Bergman's speeches--artificial Hollywood fluff. For their first meeting at the music hall, notice the lack of background noise once they begin their conversation in earnest.The Dr. Lanyon character is worthless here; Ian Hunter doesn't look shocked, nor is he outraged when he sees the transformation. In another scene, Lana Turner chases after Tracy as though she were Scarlet. It's one of the few moments in the film that I found deft: when Tracy comes back to Turner, he has changed from Jekyll to Hyde, which works well with the low camera shot at his feet. Other than the first one, which features a fantasy of Jekyll whipping two horses that turn into the two female leads undressed, the other Jekyll-to-Hyde metamorphoses are lousy. They might as well have occurred off-screen, as Tracy's facial contortions and the expected special effects aren't that interesting to watch with a static camera.Moreover, Tracy's Hyde is too handsome--lacking any animalism or deformity; only his bad manners prevent him from being good company. As well, he looks too much like Dr. Jekyll--just a little more wild-eyed, with bushier hair. This version has too many bunnies and not enough rats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. 'Hays'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's always been a good deal of discussion about the first two sound versions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and why they're so different in tone and theme. The original sound version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, released in 1931, didn't have to contend with the censorship of the Hays Code which was imposed on the movie industry in July 1934. By the time this version of D.J.A.M.H. came to the screen in 1941, the Code had virtually eliminated most overt sexual themes in American film.The Freudian theme of 'sex' as the 'root of evil,' so visually and rhetorically apparent in the 1931 version, is muted in this remake by Victor Fleming.Interestingly enough, this interpretation is far closer to R.L. Stevenson's novel than 1931 version directed by Rouben Mamoulian. Nonetheless, the 1931 version is far superior - Mamoulian simply had a finer script, more freedom and better actors. Spencer Tracy, one of Hollywood's most over-rated actors, can't hold a candle to Fredric March's early academy award winning turn as the good Dr. Jekyll and the very bad Mr. Hyde. And Ingrid Bergman always looked much better the saint than the sinner. Miriam Hopkins in the same role for the earlier film played a much more realistic and earthy 'lady of the evening.' Lana Turner, as Tracy's virginal love interest in this version, is no more than lamppost - albeit, a pretty one. Rose Hobart in the earlier film captured with perfection the sensuality of a Victorian bride-to-be in heat.If you watch the 1931 film and then this one, back to back, you can definitely see the thematic shift to the more socially conforming view of sexuality imposed by the Code. Give it a go, it'll be worth it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better than some versions, not as good as others. The 1932 version is far superior in almost every way. MGM's lush remake has its moments, but it is decidedly not a horror movie. Sort of like the remake of PHATNTOM, with Claude Rains, MGM downplays the horror element in favor of a glossy production. Hell, you want a scary Mr. Hyde, see the 1950s Abbott &amp; Costello version starring the one and only Boris Karloff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Them of sexual frustration separates March from Tracy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some reviewers have said that Spencer Tracy gives a measured and thoughtful performance in what is considered to be an interesting psychological study of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Yet, what is Tracy's mild mannered and low-key Dr. Jekyll really after in this film? What are his needs and what are his problems? He seems to have a few ideas about the nature of good and evil in every man and he's doing some experiments to further explore this theory. Oh yes, he also has a pretty girlfriend he's going to marry one of these days and for the most part he gets along pretty well with her father.Now, let's clap an eye on Frederic March's Dr. Jekyll. Here's a man who's so sexually frustrated that he's going to put his fist through the wall any moment, unless his future father-in-law lets him marry his daughter Muriel within about the next 15 seconds. Muriel is played by Rose Hobart, who's superb performance is often overlooked because of the great job done by Miriam Hopkins as Ivy Pearson. Muriel knows that Jekyll is on fire for her, and constantly battles her father to move up the wedding. In contrast to the fairly good relationship that Tracy has with Donald Crisp, who plays Sir Charles Emery, the father of Beatrix, (Lana Turner) the relationship March has with Haliwell Hobbes as General Carew is full of tension and heated arguments.Also, where as Tracy conducts his experiments with all the gusto of reading a book by the fireplace, March as Jekyll is young, vibrant and enthusiastic. He's so excited about his experiement, and while Tracy was going to give the potion to a hospital patient initially, March always intended to be the first to try it. Once Mr. Hyde is on the scene, it becomes clear just how more focused the March version is in comparison to the Tracy version. Tracy's Hyde is nothing more than the run-down, sadistic side of Jekyll. But Frederic March's Mr. Hyde is clearly the sexually liberated side of Jekyll. March's Hyde is not going to be put on indefinite hold by the Victorian convictions of General Carew. No, he's going to have some sex right now, and off he goes looking for Ivy Pearson. When he discovers she's not home, he's quick to ask a neighbor where he can find her. In comparison, Tracy's Hyde does not go to Ivy's home, but to a dance-hall, and by a trick of chance, discovers Ivy working as a barmaid in the place.March's performance is also more moving emotionally when he is on his way to his engagement party. When Tracy begins to change into Hyde in the same scene, he seems confused and a little troubled, but doesn't seem to know what's actually happening to him. But March senses what is happening to him in the last seconds before Hyde takes over, and goes through tremendous suffering and moans aloud as he fights in vain in an effort to keep Hyde back. The theme of sexual frustration always runs true in the March version. As Hyde, when he ridicules Jekyll in fron of Ivy, he calls him a hypocrite for conforming to Victorian morality instead of indulging his lust with Muriel before their marriage vows. When Tracy's Hyde needles Jekyll, the focus is more on his vain effort to protect Ivy, and not on sexual frustration at all, since that really isn't pushed as an issue in this later version. Although Tracy gives an interesting performance in the dual role, his Dr. Jekyll is too laid-back and subdued to be convincing as a daring scientist and his Mr. Hyde is little more than a bully and a mischief maker. The Frederic March performance is more powerful, and the film as a whole is more focused and full of tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spencer Tracy didn't like this film...and it's clear why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great original story. Great actor in the lead role. Yet, the film was a critical and monetary flop, and Tracy disliked it more than any other film he made.So, what do I think? Well, it's difficult for me because I think Tracy is one of the two great actors of American cinema (the other being Cary Grant). So I know that I am predisposed to like the film. Of course, perhaps the issue is that for most of his mid- and later career, Tracy finessed his performances with understatement, and maybe this was not the film in which to be subtle. Add to that that director Victor Fleming seems to have also wanted a restrained version of the story...well, it's all pretty restrained.Interesting to note that the cinematography here is excellent, while some of the background was rather fake looking...odd since this was a rather big budget film. There's some very interesting imagery when Jeckyll turns himself into Hyde...a few scenes make be a bit surprised that the Breen Office approved it.As for the performances, Tracy wanted to film this without any makeup, but the studio did not feel that worked, and I'm not sure that the Joker-like smiling cad he would become when under the influence was right for the part, either. But then again, a cartoonish Dr. Hyde would have been way over the top. So, Tracy's performance is disappointing, perhaps because this was a very poor role for him. Originally, Lana Turner was to play the tramp that falls prey to Mr. Hyde, and Ingrid Bergman was to play the prim fiancé. Bergman successfully requested the roles be reversed, and it was a good decision. Each plays their part well, but it's difficult to see how Turner would have been as successful as the tramp.Notable supporting roles include Donald Crisp as Lana Turner's father, Ian Hunter as Dr, Jeckyll's friend, and C. Aubrey Smith as the bishop. A fine cast, and Crisp was particularly effective.It isn't that's this is a bad film; it's a bad Spencer Tracy film...and apparently he knew it. Although, now that I think of it, I've yet to see a good film adaption of this story. I give this film a weak "7", with a "7" being my "average quality film". It's worth watching, but it's not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nominated for three Oscars, this film contains an all-star cast: Spencer Tracy (Boys Town, Captains Courageous), Ingrid Bergman (Murder on the Orient Express, Anastasia, Gaslight), the 20-year-old Lana Turner (Peyton Place), and Donald Crisp (How Green Was My Valley).Losing the subject upon which he was to test his formula, Dr. Henry Jekyll (Tracey) decides to try it upon himself. We all know the results.I was definitely impressed with the fantasies racing through his mind during the change.

		<shortDescription>Good Performance From Spencer Tracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not possible, I suppose, to comment on this film without having to make the comparison to the 1931 version that starred Frederic March in the title role (or even the 1920 silent version with John Barrymore - but I haven't seen that one.) In fact, comparisons are probably both unavoidable and appropriate, since in many ways the '41 movie seems based more on the '31 movie than on Stevenson's novella - especially in the addition of a romance for Jekyll and the identification of Hyde's lusts as being sexual and sadistic in nature - neither of which points are present in Stevenson's work. (Or perhaps both are based on the '20 version?) In this version from 1941, Spencer Tracy certainly held his own against March. Their portrayals were quite different in many ways. I thought Tracy was superior as Jekyll, while March probably portrayed a more overtly evil Hyde - and I'm referring to his performance rather than merely the heavy makeup in the earlier version, which was mercifully absent in this one. That lack of makeup in fact probably gives Tracy a bit of an edge in the acting department with Hyde as well. Without that heavy makeup Tracy had to play Hyde more through nuance and emotion and voice, and he did well with it. The more human looking Tracy version of Mr. Hyde was also probably scarier than the earlier "quasi-monster" characterization, if only because Hyde did seem more human, and therefore somewhat more like the guy next door. In the end, it's probably a saw-off between the two. Where the '41 version falls down a bit is in the female leads. Ingrid Bergman was good as the barmaid Ivy, whom Hyde becomes obsessed with, but she didn't match up to Miriam Hopkins' portrayal of the character, and Lana Turner seemed to me to be far less central to the story as Jekyll's fiancé Beatrix than Rose Hobart was in that role, although I'd give a slight edge to Turner's acting over Hobart's rather dry performance. It's also worth noting that in the decade between 1931 and 1941 someone must have decided that sexuality could not be portrayed too overtly, because this movie I thought had far less sexual innuendo than the earlier version, which in its own way (and given the times) was quite risqué.Overall, both are good movies. On balance, I'd probably give a very slight edge to the '31 movie, but Spencer Tracy's turn as Jekyll/Hyde should not be missed by anyone with an interest in the various movie adaptations of the story. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent but inferior remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually a pretty decent movie but after seeing the 1931 version with Frederic March and Miriam Hopkins it seems quite superfluous. The scenario follows the earlier version quite closely yet scene for scene the earlier version is always sharper, better written, directed and above all, cast. In his own way Tracy is as good as March, the real difference is that March was 34 and Tracy 41, and the part really requires a younger actor. Tracy seems less brash, more mature, but that's partly a function of the script, where the characterization seems tailored for Tracy's more mature presence. Much less is made of Jeckyll's impatience at the delay in his marriage, so important a part of the motivation in the 1931 film. As far as the role of Ivy is concerned, Bergman overall may be a better actress than Hopkins, but when it comes to sluttiness, she's out of her league. There's a very erotic scene early in both films, a little toned down in the later one, though not as much as you might think. Hopkins performance here is unforgettable, but Ingrid's? I can't really fault her acting but I was embarrassed watching her, like seeing one's sister in the role. Yes, Lana Turner and Ingrid Bergman really should have switched roles here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was not what i expected it to be. The plot was slow moving and hardly any of the events from the text made it into this adaptation. In the book neither Jekyll nor Hyde show signs of interest in women, yet in the film they do. In Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde, all of the characters were bachelors,and there was no mention of any love interests or attraction towards women. Also, the film left out poor Mr Utterson the narrator and one of the most important characters to the story. Tracy's performance as Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde did show he was capable of playing a dual role. It was Ingrid Bergman's portrayal of the totally made up Ivy Peterson that made the film worse. Although her acting was good at times, the character was not believable and her poor attempt at a cockney accent was moany and laughable. Special effects were not convincing but that's what you would expect for 1941. It could have been a more interesting film, if you weren't allowed to see the transformation always taking place.Read the book. It's a lot better</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be called "Jekyll and HAM".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this version on cable last weekend. As a kid staying up late to watch horror movies in the '60s, I remember being supremely disappointed with the Spencer Tracy version.Now, as a 40 year old I can explain why. Tracy was an over-rated actor. He is horrendously miscast here as the complex, tortured Dr. Jekyll and and the sadistic Mr. Hyde. He hams his way through the film like a bull in a china shop. When he changes into Hyde, he musses up his hair and wears some ridiculous looking false teeth that could be in a polident commercial! "OOooo-SCAAaaaree kids!" as Count Floyd of SCTV would say. Tracy was good as a light comedian opposite Hepburn, but he's way out of his league here. And Director Victor Fleming has to share some of the blame too, for making an entirely unsuspenseful film. It's really ashame, since the film has a couple of great things going for it-Ingrid Bergman and the cinematography. There are some beautiful fog bound, gaslighted streets. The atmosphere is suitably creepy and gothic. Bergman's perfomance is top notch as the "bad girl" who is tormented by Hyde. Maybe they could now digitally remove Tracy and focus on her?? The film could only be better. It's a great example of how unlimited budgets and big stars can actually make a film worse. It's easy to deride Ed Wood for making crappy films on a zero budget-what's amazing is that he was able to make them at all. It's equally amazing to see a film like this, by a major studio in its heyday, with a huge budget but absolutely no finesse or suspense. I'm going to go out on a limb here and recommend the 1968 TV version of Jekyll and Hyde starring Jack Palance and directed by Dan Curtis. It looks a little dated, but Palance is quite a tall, menacing Mr Hyde, as compared to Tracy's short, chunky delivery guy. In the Dan Curtis production, he and Palance achieve a real feat. Near the end, the two characters really do seem to be blending into one, with Jekyll taking on more of Hyde's demeanor even when "normal". On much less of a budget, they created a far better horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spencer Tracy is arguably the greatest actor of all time, but this movie was directed all wrong for him. The "monster" make-up detracts from, instead of adds to, the horror. Tracy would have done a much better job scaring us if he had been able to just use his amazing acting skills. I think he felt uncomfortable in the make-up; hence, the performance is well below his high standards. Ingrid Bergman is the best part of this movie; she really does a great job as the poor abused woman. Not a horrible movie altogether, but it could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely awful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This overlong and slow movie is inferior in EVERY possible way compared with the 1931 masterpiece. Spencer Tracy (the most overrated actor in history) was badly cast, he was too obviously American and too rough to play the handsome 30ish doctor and he was too old for the part at 41. I had never seen him so hammy before. He looked no different as Hyde, how people wouldn't recognise him is a real joke. It's hilarious how Tracy was supposed to never be eating anything when he just looked short and fat. Lana Turner gave a typically bland and forgettable performance, but Ingrid Bergman was absolutely AWFUL as Ivy (a barmaid in this version, instead of a prostitute). Her attempt at Cockney is worse than Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady" and she doesn't look at all attractive with her large nose. Peter Godfrey and Ian Hunter were not even in the same ballpark as Edgar Norten and Holmes Herbert. Despite the big budget, the transformation sequences and studio sets are very poor. The one and only redeeming feature is Donald Crisp, who is excellent as the prospective father-in-law.0/10. Avoid at all costs, and stick with the 1931 masterpiece with Fredric March.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent film, but I prefer an earlier version...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"When you went to see the good doctor, before you left you said... I almost thought, well what did you think? Maybe that you saw a little bit of ME, Hyde in him?" This is another adaptation of the play based on Robert Louis Stevenson's story of a doctor who invents a potion which will separate the good and evil parts of human nature in a very physical way.Ingrid Bergman is an actress I love to watch, but this was not, in my opinion, one of her better performances and she is no where near as convincing as Miriam Hopkns was in the 1931 version. The switch from a prostitute to a barmaid from the 1931 version and the pure innocence she portrays just don't seem to fit. Hopkins was much more a character who had been used by the world and was a lot more racy. I just don't buy it with Bergman. When Hopkins first meets Hyde, her revulsion is absolutely clear. When Bergman meets Hyde, she is uncertain, but not clearly repulsed. She is just too refined for a working class barmaid.Spencer Tracy does a great job as Mr. Hyde, and I like that he is able to do it with minimal make up. While I prefer Fredric March's (and John Barrymore's in the silent version) performance, his over the top make up takes away from the overall effect. Tracy portrays a more subtle version of both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but shows the contrast between these two characters well.Lana Turner plays her role well, but she is not given as much time or latitude in the script to really stand out in this movie.Still, the cinematography and the settings in this movie are excellent and overall, it is not a bad film. Of the three versions that I've seen, I think I prefer the 1931 version the best. This one is similar to the 1931 version but seems to emphasize the drama, downplay the horror and is not as overtly sexual and the 1920 silent version is very different from both with more emphasis on horror. All of them are worth watching, but if I were to watch only one, I'd pick Mamoulian's film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, I'll jump through rings of fire to see a Spencer Tracy movie. He's great! He is one of my favorite actors, and the kick is, I only started seeing his movies, oh, about 3-4 years ago. (I'm 31).. So I was very excited to see this version of the J and H story.This version features Tracy as the dual roles with Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner in supporting roles. Tracy does an admirable job here playing a heavy, and the makeup job, while it looks too much like Lon Chaney in the original version, still adds a little more menace. It would've been more interesting though, to have his acting without the benefit of the makeup that would've been interesting. Turner, Admittedly is not used much, only acting pretty, but Ingrid Bergman is just great as the Barkeep, who maybe IS a lower class barkeep, but, YES, she has a heart of gold, and sure does shine with each scene she is in. Bergman and Tracy sure have chemistry together, and there's a great scene with Tracy as Hyde just doing a fantastic spook out job on Bergman.As I have not seen the original version with Chaney, it's pretty hard to compare them, but the movie is pretty watchable, and does get a passing grade from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'll no doubt already know that this is severely limited by the poor acting skills of Tracy and some of the tiresome script necessities that set up key situations. For instance we have to sit through a half hour of explanation for why the betrothed are separated.But here's what you will be rewarded with: --Terrific sets, just terrific. I shudder when I enter an MGM film, expecting a sort of competent ordinariness in the background, but these sets are very well engineered for subliminal effect. Not comically Gothic, but richer than anything human could be.--Except for Ingrid Bergman right before "Casablanca." This was her favorite role and it shows. I don't know what it is about screen beauty, why it works and how a successful actress can enhance it. But this is a pretty amazing experience, seeing her this way. Her demise is disappointing because we imagine she could have carried off something more explicit than disappearing behind a sofa.--The third seduction of this is how the story has been changed. As written, it was what it announced itself to be, an interior battle between two halves. Because it was literature and the writer knew how to do it, you really could enter the mind at stake and relate to the strife. This adaptation moves it all outside the mind as it must as a movie. (There are several scenes where our doctor is late for a performance, either a play or dinner.) Its been adapted so that the war is between good and evil as embodied by two women: one is blond, good, respectable, obedient. Played by a nitwit and one wonders why our good, rich doctor would ever envision a life with this nothing.The other is gay, open, adventurous, vulnerable, the Bergman character. She is manipulative in an immediate, shallow sort of way. This woman will always give pleasure in her being and often be hurt, we know. She is so seductive, so inherently good, it muddles the movie because it is she we all want to be with, to protect.Directed by the guy nominally involved with "Wizard of Oz" and "Gone with the Wind." Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>
