		<fullReview>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is Paramount doing Universal better than Universal did themselves. While this was a cash-in on the genre success of the smaller studio, if all bandwagons were this well made then cinema would be a much richer experience.Oh, it's dated of course. A form of stiff melodrama where women still said things like "Darling... I wish this moment would last forever" and men replied "Oh, I love you... be near me always." And I love how the camera coyly veers away during the kissing scene. An odd dialogue gem is Dr.Jekyll (Frederic March) proclaiming: "We'll be so gloriously happy that even the French will be jealous of us." Look out too for Edgar Norton as Poole, offering advice to Jekyll when told his fiancée will be away for a month. "I beg your pardon, sir," he says, "but may I suggest that you ought to amuse yourself?" Yes, the dialogue is overblown, but in a wonderful, glorious way. Like a great stream-of-consciousness from the pen of a man who sees screen realism as just a petty distraction.But what really works is the innovation of the film, almost dripping off the celluloid. I don't know if those wipes from scene to scene, the fades and the first-person perspective were originated here, but they're used superbly nonetheless. Often the frame hesitates between wipes, carving the illusion that so much is going on simultaneously that one screen cannot house it all. And the single take transformation (As Hyde says, "What you are about to see is a secret you are sworn not to reveal" ? it's tinted lens effects were kept hidden for many years) is absolutely magnificent, even 70 years on.Every single shot is worked out with a mind to an unusual angle, or a unique way of framing things, but never so that it's showy. Often the main action will be taken via longshot, the camera choosing to focus on a sole candelabrum in the foreground while the scene plays out. It's subtexts of bare backs; cleavages, thighs and garter belts are also quite racy for the time. Look how even when Jekyll has left Ivy behind, her seductively rocking leg is merged with the next scene for nearly half a minute to indicate temptation is lingering in his mind. Outstanding.The sets, too, are unparalleled, street settings often running to several levels and making a mockery of the rival studio's sub-realist fare. The outdoor segments set to rain are exquisite, and look out for an amusing scene ? the first between Miriam Hopkins and Hyde ? where they engage in an accidental spitting competition. As he says the phrase "pig sty" an unintentional (?) spray of saliva coats his co-star, while a large globule of phlegm hits him in return as she says "Buckingham Palace."Weirdly, the Doctor's name is pronounced "Gee-kul", not the commonly held "Jek-ull". I've always thought Jekyll seemed a creepier name than the passive-sounding Hyde. Maybe that's the point, and the duality of such a concept is passed forward by many shots of Hyde seeing his face via a mirror. March is not without the wit to add humour to his other persona (who resembles more Dick Emery's comedy Vicar than anything truly horrific), and is in equal terms expert in both pathos and menace. His physicality in the role also cannot be overlooked. Not only that, but you get the real feeling that you're joining March on a discovery; with each new turn of plot as much a surprise to him as it is to us. This is a real loving performance, a far cry from the "take the money and run" sensibilities of The Wolf Man.Hyde has his violent moments, threatening to glass a man with a broken bottle ? "His face was made for it" ? and intimating rape. It's a showstopping performance and there's even one scene where Hyde appears to break the fourth wall ? yet he's looking through the camera and into the next room. Mere technicalities are beneath the thoroughly insane Hyde. "I shall go only as far as the door, and the sight of your tears will bring me back" he hisses to a terrified Hopkins with double-meaning menace.With it's literary script that encompasses both Bach and Shakespeare, it's a lovably fluid, fast-paced piece. Sometimes it's not always subtle ? take the scene where Hopkins tells Jekyll he's got "the kindest heart in the world" and asks him for a bottle of poison "so I can kill myself, sir." But look at the anguish on March's face as the guilt of his alter ego's actions bleed through. If only all films could be made with such care and love in their craft. Absolutely Tremendous. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch It for the Camera Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happened to movies in the late 30's and early 40's? Why did they become so stale and stagey? "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" would be considered downright antique to many of today's casual filmgoers, but it feels so much more dynamic technically and thematically than many films that came out later in its decade. The answer, of course, is that this movie came out before enforcement of the Production Code, at which time artistry in films--both style and substance--took a nose dive.This film is worth watching for its stunning camera work alone. It doesn't suffer from any of the awkwardness other films working in the early years of sound do. The camera's always moving, there's terrific use of light and shadow, and the scenes showing the transformation of Jekyll to Hyde are seamlessly filmed in what appear to be uninterrupted shots, leaving you to ponder the sheer physical behind-the-scenes mechanics of them.But this movie isn't just more technically advanced than films later in the decade; it's more adult in content too. No filming of this story ten years later (I've not seen the Victor Fleming version for comparison) would dare add the level of sexuality that this story does. Fredric March is very good in the dual role, and when he transforms into Mr. Hyde, you can see that it's everything within his power not to rip the dress right off whatever female he happens to be with and mount her right there. I'm not exaggerating; the film is really that frank.Creepy good fun.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Renewed Sight for the Listening Camera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As this film demonstrates, director Rouben Mamoulian (Applause (1929)) and cinematographer Karl Struss (Sunrise (1927)) were two of the great innovators in renewing the role of the camera for the talkies. Lesser talents began the talkies much the same as silent films began: with a static camera. The sound is still creaky, as usual, with awkward silences, but it's not bothersome. The editing isn't always seamless here, either, and, at times, makes the film seem unpolished, but that, too, is minor. This is the best version of Robert Louis Stevenson's novella "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", in my opinion, and that has very little to do with the actual story adaptation, which comes more from the stage, anyhow. It's the role of the camera that's remarkable.I don't mean to say that this adaptation is of little interest; it's especially interesting when compared to the novella and its other adaptations. The 1920-John Barrymore version features a more grotesque Hyde and a stiffer Jekyll. Here, Jekyll is, at first, full of gaiety and youthful exuberance. That's more faithful to the novel, but also reflects the filmmakers' intentions and the changes in Hollywood. The 1920 film was bolder in content in some respects; it was a mood piece of horror and atmosphere. The fogy lamp-lit slums of London are still realized vividly in this one, but much of the feeling in them is lost. On the other hand, the mirror motif comes out more here, which corresponds nicely with the doppelgänger (or doubles) theme inherit in the story. This 1931 film is of the classic Hollywood era. The added emphasis on the romance between Jekyll and Muriel is a result. This version is about more than the story, though; the major focus is in the camera-work.The film begins with about three and half minutes of long point-of-view takes, with a mobile camera, from the perspective of Dr. Jekyll. It establishes the camera as an active participant in the film, rather than merely a static recorder. Throughout the picture, the camera continually moves--from slight zooms, dollies, pans and tilts to dance-like tracking shots during the party sequence. Additionally, some extreme close-ups show only a character's eyes. A POV shot during Jekyll's first transition into Hyde turns into spinning memories, which is in addition to the special effects that allow for transformations that are seen with fluent, unbroken rhythm from the camera's eye.The camera positioning is varied, as well, and some shots are extraordinary just in their positions. The photography exploits the sets to greater effect occasionally, and the filmmakers position props with the camera especially well and in rather thematic ways that apply to the story. Yet, the photography is most brilliant when not subject to much scene dissection: long takes that are unbroken and add more fluency to the already tight plot.One could say this is showy film-making; even the transitional effects seem to draw attention to themselves: lengthy dissolves that linger as superimposed images (such as the image of Ivy's legs over the image of Jekyll and Dr. Lanyon's debate) and wipes that create brief split-screen shots. But, the camera is the most essential part of film-making (along with editing), and it seems negligent to subject it to a role of impotence--to just recording an enacted play. This 1931 "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is a cinematic artwork and shows what film should be concerning the role of its most basic apparatus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beast Within Remembers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing that years before Sigmund Freud was writing about stuff like the ego and the id, Robert Louis Stevenson, a great writer, but not a man of science, was able to grasp at what Freud later said about human behavior. There lurks in all of us a beast capable of doing great evil, that man's civilized self is forever trying to control.Henry Jekyll, London society doctor, is engaging in experiments to prove that theory. He's a gentleman in every sense of the word, engaged to a proper English girl played by Rose Hobart here. It's funny, but in none of the adaptions of this story is it ever explained what could be in the potion that Jekyll concocts and drinks. But drink it he does and Jekyll becomes the simian like Mr. Hyde, evil incarnate itself.Another reviewer pointed out the film is actually based on a play adapted from the novel and done originally on stage by Richard Mansfield in London. In that play the character of Ivy, a girl no better than she ought to be attracts the attention of Jekyll when he stops a man from assaulting her. He takes her up to her flat and she makes an effort to seduce him. He resists, but the beast within remembers.This film becomes one of the first to deal with the phenomenon of stalking. Miriam Hopkins is a comely Ivy and Ivy herself is one of the most luckless characters ever created in fiction whether she was in the original story or not. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde made movie audiences and critics start to take Fredric March seriously as actor. Up to then he had played a variety of lightweight parts on screen. Even so Paramount after this still insisted on still casting him in those roles after he won an Academy Award for Best Actor. When he got free of that studio contract March got the parts he was so capable of. When MGM wanted to remake the film for Spencer Tracy they bought not just the rights from Paramount, but the film itself. It was not seen for many years and the VHS version I have of it has an MGM opening logo, but the cast at the end says Paramount. Kind of unusual to say the least.I do disagree with the application of the term science fiction to this story. Hyde is a beast. But he's not something created by nature or man, nor is he an alien from another world. We all have a Hyde within us, it's how well we control him in our selves, and how well as a society we control the Hydes that would do us harm that deems whether we survive as a society or not.Hyde is very human, with no superhuman powers and no created weaponry. Takes an extraordinary actor to play Jekyll and Hyde and do it well. Only the best take a crack at it like John Barrymore, Spencer Tracy, Jack Palance, and Kirk Douglas. And March is one of the very best. See for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A neglected masterpiece. When I picked up the two sided DVD I was excited because the Fleming/Tracy version is on the order of a guilty pleasure. But I soon realized that I had never seen the 1931 version. This is a film that lingers in the memories of many film goers as still photographs of Frederic March in his makeup. Watching it was a revelation. The same changes to original content - Jekyl's bride-to-be and her family - continue to wear wearily on the production, but nothing could prepare me for March's work. As often as we've seen "transformations" - this one is the BEST. Then young lion director Rouben Mamouilan pulls out some dandy tricks. And the sexually charged atmosphere before the Hayes code - was well - sexy as hell. Do yourself a favor and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>March's Hyde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An exceptional cast and intelligent direction seals the quality of the first 'talkie' version of Robert Louis Stevenson's tale. Often hailed as the best of the many screen adaptations of the story, director Robert Moumalin exploits the symbolic potential of the tale as well as boldly tapping into popular Freudian trends concerning sexual repression. The result is not a by-the-numbers rendition but an effective interpretation with quirks and dimensions of its own. Yet the film belongs to Frederic March who scooped an Oscar for his sensational dual role. Although as Jekyll he unfortunately has to trade flowery romantic dialogue with Rose Hobart, there can be no disputing the menace of his Hyde, with his simian-like appearance, top hat, cloak and cane, who turns cockney hooker Miriam Hopkins' life into a nightmare. It's a breathtaking transformation both physically (thanks to stellar make-up and special effects) and artistically and is undoubtedly the centrepiece of this excellent vintage classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite the Book BUT Mesmerizing Performance by March and Innovative Direction/Camera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all the existing film versions of Robert Louis Stevenson's "The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde" (1886), this 1931 Paramount offering starring the incomparable Frederic March is probably the best. None quite follow the original book, whose tale is actually told backwards in a way. The book does not follow a series of linear events that lead to the so-called "transformation". Instead, rumors of a strange man surface between two characters in the very opening. We learn about Hyde first before Jekyll, which is not the way any film adaptation has ever told the story.Still, the present film has a lot going for it. At the forefront is Frederic March in the classic dual role of good and evil. When he first becomes Hyde, I thought another actor was playing the role, it's that good! Another distinctive aspect is the camera work which must have been extremely innovative for its time. The opening moments are shot with a first person perspective. The transformation is done relatively seamlessly considering CGI effects had yet to be invented. There are other moments of shadows and dark corridors. The atmospheric fog that permeates the entire film is worth the price of admission.As stated by other reviewers, some of the dialog hearkens back to an earlier era of the Vaudeville Melodrama. Characters didn't just love each other, they loved each other for eternity! Still a fine film all things considered, dated perhaps in places, but still March's performance is unbeatable, and definitely deserved of the Academy Award for Best Actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Landmark Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Louis Stevenson's classic tale of split personality has been filmed before in 1920 with John Barrymore and in 1941 with Spencer Tracy, but Rouben Mamoulian's expressionist 1931 version stands head and shoulders above the rest. First of all, you have Fredric March, whose tour-de-force performance as the good-natured Jekyll and the monstrous Hyde earned him the Best Actor Oscar. Second, the camera work by Karl Struss brilliantly captures the mood of the story. And lastly, the transformation sequences set an enormous precedent for the later monster movies. It all blends together to form one of most amazing horror movies of the 1930's. Even today, it still has the power to mesmerize and send chills down the spine of even the most hardened horror fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read Stevenson's famous novel, but this film is adapted from a play which is supposedly a lot different anyway. The story is really not especially great. A scientist makes a potion that turns him into a total spazz. The spazz version ruins Dr. Jekyll's romance with Rose Hobart and tortures a loose woman, played by Miriam Hopkins. The film turns out to be completely amazing, however, thanks to the lead performance, by Fredric March, and the elegant direction by Rouben Mamoulian. Every time I see March in a film, I become more impressed by his range. Of course, this is a perfect vehicle to demonstrate one's range, and he excels as both Jekyll and Hyde, though his Hyde is what most will remember. Looking at his filmography, Mamoulian directed relatively few films for a director of his era (not to mention talent). I need to see more, most notably Love Me Tonight, but he will always be a genius in my book for Queen Christina. His direction of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is beautiful and nearly flawless. A lot of the film is made from the direct point-of-view of Jekyll, and he uses a first-person technique that works brilliantly. Between March and Mamoulian, the general silliness of the story is completely made up for. March's female co-stars, Hopkins and Hobart, are quite good, as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first is the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently picked up a DVD with both copies of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde one starring Frederic March from 1931 and the latter with Spencer Tracy in 1941. What I found interesting is how great the special effects were as Jekyll transformed into Hyde. It was amazing considering that it was 1931. Miriam Hopkins was vivacious and appealed nicely to the dark sexual side of Hyde. This version gave a fleeting glimpse of skin that would not be seen post code. But that is not the appeal the real attraction is March who is stellar in his portrayal of both characters. The pennance Jekyll does as he laments his murder makes for a neat ending and his transformation as he dies back to the good doctor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best adaptations of this story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When speaking about horror films from the 30s, almost invariably the conversation moves around Universal Studios and the remarkable movies it released on that decade. However, Universal was not the only studio that released a horror classic, and while 1931 is often remembered as the year of Tod Browning's "Dracula" and James Whale's "Frankenstein", it was also the year of another horror classic that deserves a mention: Rouben Mamoulian's amazing version of Robert Louis Stevenson's "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". titled simply "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", the film was previously adapted with good results in 1920 with the legendary actor John Barrymore as the main character, however, Mamoulian's version is nowadays considered the definitive version of the novel and Paramount's answer to Universal's efforts in the horror genre.Adapted by Samuel Hoffenstein and Percy Heath, the film successfully translates the theme and mood of the novel although (like the previous silent version) does some changes to the plot. Still, the basic story is the tale of Dr. Henry Jekyll (Fredric March) a successful doctor who is convinced that he can isolate the evil in human's soul. As he drinks a potion he invents for this purpose, he sets free all the evil in his persona becoming Mr. Hyde, a brutish man who exists only to make evil. Now, Dr. Jekyll will have to face the consequences of letting Mr. Hyde out.From the brilliant opening scene (one of the most amazing uses of subjective camera) the film becomes a captivating experience thanks to the very artistic style that Mamoulian gives to the film. A former Broadway director, Mamoulian responds to Universal's famous expressionist art direction with a brave and intelligent use of the camera. It's amazing that in this his third film Mamoulian already shows a domain of this new language, leaving an influential work still relevant to this day. The way the film is edited is also another of Mamoulian's impressive creations, as he plays with the subconscious via transparent merging of images, and a lot of sexual imagery (a bold move even for a pre-Hays code film).Hoffenstein and Heath's adaptation of the story has now become the best remembered version of the novel, mainly because it translates remarkably well the story from paper (written from the point of view of one of Jekyll's friends) to visuals (making Jekyll the lead) with better results than the 1920s version. Just as brave as Mamoulian's bold use of sexual imagery is the sexual innuendo that fills the script, and is also one of the films that are not only horrific in imagery, but also in words. Hyde's words have a powerful psychological impact that more than 70 years later still give the chills when pronounced by March.And this takes us to Fredric March's performance as both Jekyll &amp; Hyde. While it's certainly difficult to beat the legendary Barrymore, March really succeeds in making an equally impressive performance by making his own interpretation of the character (his Hyde seems less sinister, but considerably more aggressive, primal and brutal), giving the final touch to Mamoulian's outstanding version of the novel. Another highlight is Miriam Hopkins' performance as Ivy Pearson, a prostitute that becomes the focus of Hyde's most violent actions. Hopkins really transmits the fear that this man creates and in a frighteningly believable performance becomes our eyes in the chaos. Rose Hobart and Holmes Herbert complete the cast, but none reach the high levels of perfection that both March and Hopkins achieve.Being a fan of the silent version with Barrymore I was expecting a very disappointing film, so my surprise was huge at discovering that not only this film equals the first one in terms of acting, it's an overall superior film in many other aspects. Mamoulian's film is a jewel on the level of the more famous Universal's films, and possibly outshines them too as it's a proof that with inventive and creativity one can create a great film despite the low-budget. The 1931 version of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" really lives up to the hype of being "the definitive version" of R.L. Stevenson's famed novel.It's sad that Mamoulian was literally fired from the movie industry in the 60s, after being one of the most inventive (although less prolific) directors. Still, his knowledge as Broadway director and his enormous creativity played an important role in the films he directed, and "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is probably among the top 5 of his career. 10/10. Definitely a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most significant horror film of 1931? Some say "Dracula" or "Frankenstein." I think "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is another surefire contender</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the titles "Frankenstein" and "Dracula" are the most popular surefire contenders for the most revolutionary horror film of 1931, I would strongly argue that the adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's story "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is another title to be considered. This film is not only significant in the fact that it's one of only two movies for there to be a tie between two actors in receiving the Academy Award for Best Leading Actor, but it's revolutionary in its visual effects and Fredric March's portrayal of a ferocious two-sided madman and the effect he has on the people around him as he jumps between sides.It's because of this film that many are familiar with the story of Jekyll and Hyde. And why shouldn't it be? The film uses the original Stevenson story only for inspiration and foundation and instead uses its own imagination to create something new and yet surprisingly powerful in its entertainment. Is it scary? No. Not by today's standards anyway. But is it haunting? Yes. It haunts you in the same way that Count Orlok haunted you in "Nosferatu" (1922). The vampire didn't scare you in that film. But the image of a tall, pale rodent-like humanoid stalking about a castle hall after a petrified protagonist lingers on in your memory. As does the memory of Fredric March as she transforms from a handsome young scientist into an ape-like monster that begins to hound and possess a helpless young woman played with great enthusiasm and energy by Miriam Hopkins, most of whose performance had to be cut from the film due to censorship and therefore cost her the possibility of receiving an Academy Award nomination. Fredric March is equally brilliant as Jekyll and Hyde. The film also stars Rose Hobart as Jekyll's fiancée, Halliwell Hobbes as her suspicious father, Edgar Norton as the comical, stammering butler and Holmes Herbert in the one role that I think should have been developed a little more for the character does have impact in the last third of the story.Now I saw this film after I saw the 1941 remake with Spencer Tracy and for those not familiar with that film, let me just warn you to see this movie first. The remake follows the same story almost as if it were by the book and recreates a lot of scenes, but it does not deliver the same impact even though Tracy is almost as great as March in this film. It's only half the movie that this truly entertaining 1931 horror opus is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Come back, won't you ?. . . Oh, yes, you can."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very impressive - and, as other commentators have pointed out, surprisingly sexy - adaptation of the classic tale.Dr. Jekyll (the great Frederic March, an Oscar winner for this) is a scientist who has dedicated himself to discovering a way to separate the "good" and "evil" sides of human nature. His stated goal is to make it possible for all people to be rid of their "evil" side for good so that it will "trouble them no more"; this, in turn, will give the "good" side freedom to reach its full potential.Jekyll is engaged to a beautiful young woman named Muriel (Rose Hobart) whose father insists they wait for marriage. Jekyll is in love with (and let's be honest, hot for) his fiancée and wants to marry sooner, but his intended does not want to hurt her father's feelings by going against his wishes, so he agrees to wait for her.Meanwhile, Jekyll has met a local tart named Ivy (Miriam Hopkins, spectacularly sexy and decidedly non-waifish). He hears her scream - it appears, although we don't see what actually happened, that she has been hit and knocked down by a man - and he carries her up to the loft she lives in. After getting a good look at her handsome benefactor, our Ivy decides to turn on both the "poor-me's" and the sex appeal, of which she has plenty, especially in bed wearing nothing but a garter. (The scene contains no nudity but innuendo and tension aplenty). When he finally tells her he has to go, she calls out the words I have used as the title of my review to him.In the meantime, his tries a new potion he has concocted on himself. This leads to his first transformation into "Hyde", who, in this version, is portrayed as somewhat ape-like, suggesting an evolutionary throwback (always allowing for the theory of evolution). This character could care less about the mores of the society around him. Hyde's first emergence is cut short before he can cause any trouble by the arrival of his alter-ego's manservant.But Muriel and her father have gone away, and Jekyll soon gives in to temptation, drinking the potion again. This time, he DOES go out, and immediately seeks out what Jekyll wanted but denied himself - Ivy. He finds her at a seedy music hall where she performs/hangs out, invites her to his table, and comes on like the Cro-Magnon he is, scoffing at men like his alter-ego who "like your (Ivy's) legs but talk about your garter", referring to the fact that Jekyll had warned Ivy earlier that her garter was tight enough to cut off her circulation.Ivy is soon (and not exactly willingly) "shacked up" with Hyde, refusing to leave or try to find help for fear of him. But Hyde reads in the paper that his fiancée and her father are coming back, and informs Ivy that he will have to leave her for a time, but, "If you do one thing I don't approve of while I'm gone . . . the least little thing, mind you . . . I'll show you what horror means". Their goodbye scene is one of the most chilling in movie history, perhaps as close as any filmmaker of this period would ever come to an actual "rape" scene.Jekyll is reunited with his fiancée and future father-in-law, and is able to convince the latter not to make them wait so long for their wedding.He goes home overjoyed, but not for long. You see, he sent Ivy fifty pounds cash as a way to try to make amends for his treatment of her as Hyde. But she appears in person. She doesn't want his money -Hyde would only hurt her if he found out she had it- she wants help getting out of the trap she is in with him (at one point, she shows Jekyll her back, and although we are not shown the actual wounds, she says, "Pretty, ain't it? It's a whip, that's what it is, a whip!).Jekyll, feeling more ashamed than ever of his behavior as Hyde, gives his word to Ivy that Hyde will never come back; she can keep the money without fear.Feeling better - after all, he has made amends to Ivy, he will soon be married to his fiancée, and he is rid of Hyde, or so he thinks, Jekyll goes for a pleasant walk in a park. But he sees a cat stalking - and, although we are not shown this, presumably killing and eating - a bird, and this brings out the predator within himself again. After another transformation, Hyde seeks out Ivy and, after a horrific scene in which he confronts her over going to Jekyll for help, kills her.Jekyll reads in the paper what he has done (we are led to assume, I think, that he has no memory of his actions as Hyde)and decides that the only "peanance" he can offer is to call off his engagement (not to mention that he now feels he must leave Muriel for her own safety).But he transforms yet again - it's worth noting here that March is able to portray this transformation with his back to the camera as he peers in at the sobbing Muriel, simply through body language - and goes back into his now ex-fiancée's house. Hearing his daughter's scream, her father comes running in and is killed by Hyde.It all ends in a police chase and the death by shooting of Hyde/Jekyll.Worth a look, definitely.Cheers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'll show you what horror means"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rouben Mamoulian gives us an erotic, scary vision of man as beast, illustrating the dangers of sexual repression with a hairy paw. He has at his disposal the great Karl Struss, whose photography helps crystallize the symbols of lust and virtuous chastity. Mostly lust.Fredric March's Hyde stands yet as one of the most terrifying beasts ever captured on film, his hair a silverback gorilla's mane, his teeth protruding like shards of broken china, his broad negroid nostrils a stark contrast to Jekyll's pretty aquiline features... but the eyes: March always has the eyes of a degenerate, no matter what he plays. This is the chief appeal of his urbanity, this lurking hint of monstrousness, and when Hyde is unleashed, crying "Freedom!", the eyes dart with hideous delight, and we squirm to see the thing within, without.Hyde's sudden entrance to Miriam Hopkins' parlor, his silent glare from the landing, the catlike menace of his approach to the cowering women... this is what horror means. Nispel, Roth, take a lesson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre-Code Jekyll/Hyde With The Amazing Fredric March!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is viewed by many to be the best cinematic re-telling of Stevenson's original work, which is a tad odd as very little of the novella remains. The concept of the duality of human nature is still present in March's Dr Jekyll/Hyde, but a whole lot of sex and daring visual effects have been added to Stevenson's controversial Victorian work. The result? An excellent and entertaining film that will stay in the mind for quite some time.Fredric March, one of the best actors of all time, won the Academy Award for playing the dual roles. It's not hard to see why- March is excellent in this one, and plays both Jekyll and Hyde with enthusiasm and vigour. It's a very theatrical performance by today's standards. but what a fun performance it is! March shows his incredible acting range here.March's Jekyll is a repressed Victorian doctor who is interested in both separating the two sides of human nature- 'good' and 'evil'- from each other, and quickly marrying his rich fiancé Muriel Carew (Rose Hobart). A slight hitch in his plans- Muriel's father insists that the two lovers must wait eight months before they are married, so they can wed on the anniversary of his own wedding. It's a rather laughable concept actually, but it serves it's purpose as the pre-cursor to March's wild rampage as Hyde. It seems the primary reason Jekyll wants to marry Muriel is to bed her, and when he can't do that, he takes a concoction of drugs and turns into the simian, sexually uninhibited Hyde.March's make-up almost destroyed his wonderful looks forever, so it deserves a mention here. Looking at through today's CGI-trained eyes, March's Hyde is ridiculously overdone and more comical than scary. Tracy's 1941 Hyde is a much subtler figure, which suits the narrative better in some ways. However, Mamoulian effectively conveys to the audience in his version that Hyde is having a lot of fun, is liberated in his personal and sexual freedom, hence the 'comical' aspects. March, amazing in both comedy and drama, plays him at first like a free-wheeling puppy, eager for discovery, than as a real monster as he degenerates both in appearance and behaviour. The simian make-up suits the notion of Hyde being 'semi-evolved' in nature, so it all works out in the end.Miriam Hopkins is the Cockney slut Ivy who Jekyll good-naturedly attends to at first, then brutalizes her as Hyde. March's first encounter as Jekyll with Hopkin's Hyde is a erotically-charged, provocative affair. Jekyll's primal instincts and his need to unleash them, quickly, are displayed in his overt sexual interest in Ivy. She's a girl who knows the value of sex, too, as she sexily strips for him after he makes a suggestive comment that her garter is perhaps too tight. For those interested in film history, take note of these powerful scenes between March and Hopkins- they would help bring on the Production Code in a couple of years. A sexually aroused Jekyll is grabbed and kissed by an explicit Ivy while she lies visibly naked in bed, something that would be absolutely banished from films in just a few years.Hopkins turns in an excellent performance in this one, very convincing as the 'Tart With A Heart' Ivy. She's a brazen, sexual creature, complete with brassy blonde hair and cleavage, yet she's also sympathetic . Her situation with Hyde (where she is 'kept' by him) is borne as much out of economic necessity as it is out of total fear. And total fear is what Hopkins does best here- her scenes with March ravishing her as Hyde are among the best in film history. She's a cheap, tragic figure and provides an interesting contrast to the 'other side' of Victorian society reflected in Jekyll's fiancé Muriel.Hobart is rather weak in a role that is, admittedly, poorly written. She has a one-dimensional role, and Hopkins is given much more opportunity to shine. Interesting to see March and Hopkins battle it out, acting-wise. Mamoulian builds an amazing atmosphere here with some studio-bound, yet very Expressionistic sets. Lighting is used to great effect, and the camera work was revolutionary for it's time. The subjective camera-work at the beginning where we see the action through Jekyll's eyes was innovative (a little shaky, but innovative all the same)as were the wipes used constantly to juxtapose Ivy and Muriel. The garden party scene with March and Hobart has some oddly fascinating shots, with Mamoulian focusing on the lover's eyes and foreheads when they are professing their love. Symbolism is used nicely throughout, with a number of prominent statues and paintings depicting naked women. The fire-and-brimstone hell imagery of Jekyll's lab is also a clever visual effect- Jekyll is truly a man about to 'boil over'.The transformation sequences are amazing for their time, and March acts them so well. Much of the dialogue spoken is melodramatic and rather hokey, yet we have some great lines. There's some rather fascinating religious overtones to March's Jekyll who is looked upon as a God-like figure by a number of characters. The crippled girl's cry, with hands out, to Jekyll 'I can walk sir!' is one of religious ecstasy, and Ivy looks upon him as a saint who can save her from Hyde. Alas, that cannot be. Hyde is a sinner as Jekyll is a saint, and we know exactly what he does with Ivy when the scenes fade to black.I consider this better than 'Dracula' or 'Frankenstein' (both 1931 films) for Mamoulian's stylish direction, the presence of viable female characters, the brilliant camera-work, and the acting of March and Hopkins.Not the original source material, but a darn good film that uses the female characters and the addition of sex to underline the dual side of man.</fullReview>

I collect pictures, figures, models, etc. My family isn't quite sure what to make out of me, thats OK. I'm 44, and today was the first time I saw Fredric March in the classic Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. What a blast !! His performance, in my opinion, can only be compared to Karloff in Frankenstein. The make-up is incredible, and the special effects are superior to most any film of the era. The split screen effect used is far ahead of it's time as far as anything that I can remember seeing.I'm really not much for words, but if you love or even like classic horror, and haven't seen this one, what are you waiting for!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and brilliantly told story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody knows the famous Universal classic monster movies "Dracula" and "Frankenstein", which both are also from 1931. Not nearly as many people known or have seen this movie, that in my opinion is just as good and worthy of the 'classic' status as both of those two movies.This movie quite surprised me honestly. I expected this movie to be good but not that good, as it turned out it was. It's a great story told with lots of creativity. It makes the story tense and compelling and the action even spectacular. The story itself on its own is already great but it becomes even better and more powerful through the way it is told in the movie.Above all the movie is a very beautiful one that is filled with symbolism and creatively put together sequences. The entire movie has some great looking costumes and settings and is brilliantly filmed. Especially the cinematography is fantastic. The movie is filled with sequences that are shot from Jekyll's point of view. It provides the movie with some very special moments, although those sequences seem pretty random to be honest. The best moment with this is the begin sequence, which lasts about 4 minutes (although it obviously has some cuts in it) and is shot entirely from Jekyll's point of view and it has some creative moments in it, such as use of shadow and mirror look. It's not that realistic looking but it's creative and refreshing nevertheless.The story is about the eternal battle of good versus evil, only this time set in the mind of one person. The sequences were the main character switches between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are well balanced, with as a result that both characters, which are the same but yet so totally different, work out just as well. It makes the drama feel realistic and sensible and the 'horror' tense and unpredictable.The movie certainly benefits from Frederich March's performance, as both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He plays both the characters totally differently and at times it's hard to believe both characters are performed by the main character. He is very believable in both parts, which are completely different from each other. He plays Dr. Jekyll sensible and Mr. Hyde deliciously villainous and monstrous. Also the other actors play fine. Rose Hobart perhaps goes a bit too over-the-top but Miriam Hopkins on the other hand was great. Of course the make up effects and camera tricks are extremely outdated by todays standard but they are at least not as laughable as you would expect. Especially the make up for Mr. Hyde looks quite good.I also was surprised by this movie its sexual tension and references. Miriam Hopkins shows quite some skin and does some daring things. Overall the sequences with Hyde and Ivy, the name of the Mirian Hopkins character, are dripping with sexual tension. Quite amazing for an 1931 movie and it came quite unexpected for me. But it makes the movie all the more refreshing and original. "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is far from your standard '30's monster movie.Normally '30's pictures end quite abruptly without a real big-bang and are a sort of a let down. Not "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". It's ending is tense, action filled and even quite spectacular.It's a very creative and refreshing movie from director Rouben Mamoulian, who directed quite some good movie's in the '30's and '40's but still is a sort of forgotten director. Just like the other 1931 monster movies "Dracula" and "Frankenstein" this is an absolute must-see, that at least is just as good, if not better at certain moments.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a "sexy" pre-Code version and explores a different type of Dr. Jekyll</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, NONE of the Dr. Jekyll movies I have seen do justice to the original novel by Robert Lewis Stevenson. The biggest problem with any of the movies is that in the original book, the reader had no idea that Jekyll and Hyde were the same person until the end of the story (they were much more physically different than in the movies--Hyde was significantly shorter). This mystery-suspense element is missing from all the movies and probably can't be done anyway, since so many people are familiar with the plot. It's really too bad, as this really made the book so wonderful.I have seen several versions of the Dr. Jekyll movies--even the pretty obscure television version with Jack Palance. This Frederic March film is definitely unique, though, because it was made "Pre-Code" and as such is a much more sexual movie--and this makes it better in some ways than the other Jekyll movies because the doctor's motivation for his experiments take on an added dimension. The film is all about the dangers of sexual repression, as the good doctor is very, very sexually frustrated. It seems he is ready to marry his lovely fiancée NOW, but her stuffy and asexual father won't allow them to marry until a suitable period has elapsed (10 months)! When Jekyll's friends and butler suggest he "go out and have a good time", he truly can't, as in his day a gentleman's reputation was super-important. As a result, he creates the Hyde persona so he can sleep around and not face public ridicule!! This is so, so different from other Hyde films and is sort of like a combination of the classic tale with Freudian views of repression and sex! As far as the rest of the film goes, it is very competently acted and directed except for one minor problem. Towards the end, the film seems a little too melodramatic when Jekyll breaks off his engagement to his fiancée--they just "laid it on a little too thick". Otherwise, an interesting and compelling psychological portrait about sexual repression.FYI--Oddly, Jekyll's name is pronounced "Gee-Kil" throughout the film. It seems the more traditional "Jek-il" that we are more familiar with was popularized in the Spencer Tracy version of 1941.PS--About a week after seeing this film I also saw the 1941 version again for the second time. Overall, the 1931 film is definitely better because it takes more risks and because the 1941 film seems like an almost direct copy at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>March Shines In Early Talkie Effort Of Famous Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a decent early effort (first "talkie" movie presentation) at the famous Robert Louis Stevenson story, this time with Frederic March in the lead role, which he plays well.The romance parts with March and Rose Hobardt are somewhat corny. The ending features a tremendous action scene with a very nimble "Hyde."It was interesting to hear Jeckyll's name pronounced Gee-kle, with the long "e." I've never heard it pronounced that way before or since.I thought March was better than Spency Tracy in the 1940s film but you couldn't beat the women (Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner) in the latter version. The ladies here were okay but no match for Bergman and Turner. The same can be said for the film as a whole. It was worth seeing, but not worth owning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film, with an outstanding Fredric March</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is a wonderful split personality tale from Robert Louis Stevenson, and out of all the film versions I have seen, this is the most stylish, exciting and somewhat erotic. For one thing the direction is efficient, and the screenplay is intelligent and sophisticated. Also really impressive are the stylish cinematography and the completely convincing make up.But the acting was what really drove it; Fredric March, what can I say? Absolutely outstanding, thoroughly deserving of the Oscar, he was great as the good hearted yet ambitious physician Dr Jekyll especially in the truly touching moment where he breaks down in front of Muriel, but he is even more impressive as the animalistic Mr Hyde with the help of the very impressive single take transformation scenes. Miriam Hopkins is a smouldering Ivy, at first she is all fun and lovable, then towards the end she is close to heart breaking. Her chemistry with March is simply great. Rose Hobart is fine as Muriel, perhaps she could have done with a little more screen time, but she did very well with what she had. As Dr Lanyon and Poole, Holmes Herbert and Edgar Norton are excellent.Overall, a brilliant film, that is stylish and exciting. Personally, and I may be alone here, but I was disappointed in the remake, by all means it is worth watching, but I found it inferior to this film because I thought it wasn't as well made and as well acted. Anyway that is a different story. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A conservative view of science.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1931 film adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde takes the author's fable and utilises it on the one hand as a means to create a work of art. However, on the other hand the author's fable is utilised as a means to take a conservative swipe at existentialist free thinking science. As such it suggests that science without the control of a moral code has the potential to morph into a hideous monster. But, as Jeykll (Fredeeric March) suggests; in a utilitarian statement; science needs to make mistakes in order to advance for the good. By such a method science becomes a questionable subject for conservative values, thereby forcing dilemmas (relavant today) as to whether genetic modification and cloning are synonymous with good or evil.This film adaptation of Stevenson's fable also suggests that all men are innate misogynistic monsters who are capable of domestic abuse, rape and murder of women. But as Ivy Pearson (intelligently portrayed by Mirriam Hopkins who gives just the right amount of fear to an otherwise histrionic part) suggests; women sex workers are a legitimised target for such evil. They are (from a conservative perspective) immoral, undeserving nonentities, and as such without society's respect, and thus no protection. In this respect Hyde is an ironically justified character because he rids society of women who work in the sex industry. Ivy's character is juxtaposed with Muriul Carew's (Rose Hobert) virtuous 'lady'. Because she subscribes to man made moral values she gains the utmost respect of Dr. Jekyll. In this respect the film suggests that men's behaviour is subject to women's actions. Moreover, it highlights the double standards men have regarding women.Another underlying theme in the film is that of drug addiction - opium use was prevalent in Victorian society, which was according to the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle the narcotic of choice among English gentleman in the 19th Century, as explained via his fictional character Sherlock Holmes. Here the film deals with the negative affects of drug addiction. Drug addiction as the film suggests makes monsters out of gentleman, thereby making excuses for men's negative behaviour towards women. While this is a well made film its character Dr. Hyde's appearance has a B movie like quality which is comedic, and is no doubt what influenced comedy adaptations of Stevenson's fable, such as Abbot and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1953). This is not intended to detract from the artistic direction of the film by director Rouben Mamoulian, which is brilliant in that it makes way for experimentation with the then new fangled cinematic technology. (Of course 'experimantation' is within the heart of the film) As such Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) is a blueprint if not a lesson in how to use cinematic technology imaginatively to create a masterpiece. Kudos also goes to actors Frederic March, (deserving of his Oscar) and scene steelers Miriam Hopkins and Edgar Norton, the latter as Jekyll's valet Poole.In sum, Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) is a creative, imaginative work of art, which is cleverly utilised to critique scientific experimentation; drug addiction, and to examine ideas of morality, while confronting society with its double standards towards women.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fredric March shines in this early screen version of the enduring Robert Louis Stevenson story which explores the duality in all of us. Dr. Henry Jekyll (March) is a scientist advancing such an idea which doesn't sit well with his peers. Naturally, when he dares to pursue such heretical fancies he will pay a price: his Mr. Hyde is an ugly brute who completely gives in to all of mans' basest impulses, and this gets him in deeper and deeper trouble. When watching this adaptation, one can hardly fail to notice the style and innovation brought to the camera work, the editing, and the scene transitions, as we get an early version of what's come to be known as split screen. The film even begins with what we know as the subjective camera technique where we see things from a characters' perspective, in this case Dr. Jekyll, and it's at least a couple of minutes before we switch to an objective view. The Expressionist cinematography was done by Karl Struss. The way that the transformation scenes are done would be revisited in such later films as "The Wolf Man", and the convincing makeup is done by Wally Westmore, an under-rated and overlooked makeup effects man from this period whose work can also be seen in "Island of Lost Souls". Director Rouben Mamoulian and the screenwriters, Samuel Hoffenstein and Percy Heath, are able to inject their material with a ripe amount of sex, as this was done in the pre-Code days. Musical performer and actress Miriam Hopkins shows quite a bit of leg, for one thing. And in scenes where she must contend with the beastly Hyde, there's an undeniable amount of uncomfortable sexual tension. The actors are all superb, and it's very noteworthy that March should have won a Best Actor Academy Award for his performance(s) as it's not that often the Academy acknowledges horror films for this aspect. March is believable every step of the way; when he's Jekyll you can't help but like him, when he's Hyde he just creeps you out. Hopkins is equal parts touching and saucy, and Rose Hobart is appealing as Jekylls' bride to be Muriel. Holmes Herbert, Halliwell Hobbes, Edgar Norton, and Tempe Pigott comprise the rest of the solid supporting players. With all of this going for it, the '31 production of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is worthy viewing for fans of the classic black &amp; white horror films who want to discover the kinds of things that filmmakers could get away with before the Code started stifling their creative efforts. This story has of course been done many times since, but this would be the ideal adaptation with which to start. It's available on a flipper disc from Warner Bros. that pairs it with the 1941 version starring Spencer Tracy, so one can have an interesting time comparing the two films. Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Much ahead of its time in human study and highly controversial in its content' is what can be said about the novel by Robert Louis Stevenson set in the 19th century London. In spite of its huge popularity among the screen adaptations, it could not see a better silver screen form than this one, directed by Rouben Mamoulian, a pioneer of innovations in the early years of sound in Hollywood. Since the novel appeared sensational, the movie also had to meet this very requirement. Mamoulian's movie (his third film) is still considered by many as the definite version of the novel because it does not condense itself within a mere horror genre but, as Harry Evans (1932) observed, it is an 'old dual personality thriller.' And here, the character that attracts our attention is Dr Jekyll who does not turn into Mr Hyde but, adventurously, finds 'Mr Hyde' within himself and, curiously, sets him free. Illusion of happiness or sheer tragedy...Is a man one or two? Reasonable fact or schizophrenic hallucinations? Can shadows be bigger than reality? Can you play your own life on a special piano that fate appears to be? Can curiosity lead you to disaster? Can sensation distort true science and the adventure of science make you a 'god' on your own and of your own?It is interesting how we get to know Dr Jekyll from the very beginning. Actually, from the credits with the mysterious tunes of Bach's Toccata (a very meaningful piece of classical music), Dr Jekyll appears to be absorbed by his 'ego' intensified visually by the wonderful use of 'subjective camera.' Notes in a book, hands playing the music, image of his devoted servant Poole (Edgar Norton), face reflection in a mirror (yes, MIRROR is a key artifact for understanding the plot)...narcissistic a bit? Perhaps...but what comes then is crucial to what follows: the memorable journey to the conference hall, the speech and 'miracles' that make him a 'Christ-like' healer/impostor. Yet, he is a rather sympathetic guy whose nature may, however, be defined by one key aspect: CURIOSITY. He is a curious scientist who wants goodness for humanity, who is ready to examine the many 'secrets of the human body in sickness and in health' and aims at something sensationally controversial: separate 'good' and 'evil' within a man. Soon, however, it occurs that miracles of science may make a scientist go further than man should go. Freedom becomes anarchy, good - spiritual and evil - animalistic. And that is where a true drama of a man may lie!FREDRIC MARCH, the actor whom Mamoulian found both 'wonderful' and 'intellectual' gives a poignant performance of a psyche torn apart, a man 'dying of thirst' but 'denied water' and taking irrational steps to submit himself to 'the monster he created' from within himself. It is important these lovely transitions mark his previous rebellion against established order in society and result in a neurotic, insane, beastly manifestation of lusts of the very inner self. He loves Muriel (Rose Hobart) and is going to marry her but...her father steps in and advises to WAIT in the conventional spirit of 'decent observance.' 'Unknown wears your face,' is what he says to his beloved having discovered that in Muriel. Consequently, perhaps, his curiosity of science would turn into genuine love to this woman...and yet... this requirement of 'decent observance' does not merely make him wait but find an easy going way - a woman where absolutely different feelings take over and become a prelude to the 'Hyde' creature. Let me highlight this contrast of women more clearly.Mamoulian himself said that he based much of his vision upon symbols. Not only are they used in the innovative camera-work that most scholars address when reviewing the film but they are truly clear in the contrastive depiction of two women, one that appears to be a target of Dr Jekyll and the other, the target of Mr Hyde. Muriel manifests love (with reference to the bizarre script, she 'opens the gate for him to another world') while Ivy (Miriam Hopkins) fans the flames of lust; Muriel develops the mature man while Ivy lets out an inner beast. Where there is seduction, sooner or later suppression occurs to be. Therefore, Hyde kills the mindful symbol of lust while sets free the mindful symbol of love and sacrifice. That would not be achieved if it were not for the performance of Miriam Hopkins. Patricia King Harrison beautifully defines her as 'deliberately sensual' Meanwhile, she has some delicious pre-Code scenes and truly a power scene in Music Hall.CAMERA-WORK: This Jekyll vs. Hyde contrast is also accurately depicted by two-dimensional picture that marks the torn psyche, subjective camera, the use of mirrors, the close-ups of eyes and hands (carnal factor). We can say that camera in DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE is a significant communicator of psychology. Here, I would recall the unforgettable cat vs nightingale scene. The reference to classic Keats's words make the tension even more appealing. Jekyll is a man while Hyde is an animal. The entire technical awe of the film is best manifested at the transition scene where the director put his own heart into it in a practical way. The camera-work achieves its pinnacle at the juxtaposing images. One of such is Ivy's rocking leg that manifests Dr Jekyll's mind filled with temptation.If DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE had condensed into mere horror, it would be nothing more now than a relic of cinematic history with, perhaps, some technical curiosities but many laughable scenes, too. Its psychology, however, makes it so appealing after these decades. Very nearly a masterpiece as an outstanding product of the Pre-Code Hollywood.Finally, let me quote Patricia King Harrison who observed memorably: "What Mamoulian was able to do in this film is show the simultaneous existence of good and evil in Jekyll before it erupted into the drug-induced schizophrenic manifestation of Mr Hyde."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fredric March Tour de Force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fredric March is Robert Louis Stevenson's title character. Dr. Henry Jekyll, who wants to delve into the mind of man and see if the evil side can be separated from the good side. Costarring Miriam Hopkins as the barmaid, Ivy Peterson, this film is a lot more serious than its remake and is constructed with more thought in regards to the evil side, that is always there simmering underneath the faces we see in others and in the mirror. We open with Fredric's evil side looking out but not being able to dominate and do what he wants. Then, we see the doctor trying to help a girl walk and how he relates with his patients. It makes the viewer think he could have been a great doctor of the people, if he really wanted it. Fast forward to the physical change and appearance of a "Mr. Hyde," who is ecstatic to be free, laughs with glee in the mirror, loves the rain, and is now able to do what he wants to for a change. He looks like a beast. I'm not going to get into every detail, but I don't think I had ever seen this before, or if I had it had been years, and I was very impressed by the structure of the film and its film-making techniques it used in telling the story. Besides that, Fredric March is the whole show, as we see him before and after the metamorphosis. Watching him was fascinating; I think he was more in character, than Spencer Tracy was in the 1941 remake. The only downside or negative thing I have to say about this film is the casting of the ladies. While I like Miriam Hopkins as an actress, I don't think she fully captured the role of "Ivy" and Rose Hobart (who?) as Dr. Jekyll's love interest, Beatrix, was pretty forgettable. Lastly, I'll say that, as the film comes to its inevitable conclusion, we see in the laboratory a pot boiling, some feet away from Fredric March, symbolizing the omni-present dark side in all of us, and a part of us we may never really come to grips with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of all Jekyll and Hyde movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 classic "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" has inspired countless story, movie and theater adaptations. I have personally seen more than dozen different movie adaptations of this story (if that is a proof of undying love or utter sadness I'll leave for you to decide) and I can honestly say, no later adaptation can overshadow this 1932 Paramount Pictures production, simply titled "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde".The basic story is pretty much a common knowledge already but let's put up the basics: Dr. Henry Jekyll is a young and successful scientist living in late Victorian England. He is greatly admired by the students of science because of his new and revolutionizing theories but, for the very same reasons, looked down by elder scholars and his colleagues, amongst them his good friend Dr. Lanyon. Jekyll is engaged to be married to a lovely Muriel Carew, daughter of Brigadier General Sir Danvers Carew. While Jekyll and Muriel want to get married, Carew disapproves their eagerness and makes them go through a long engagement time. Jekyll deals with his frustration by working day and night with his private research. One night he invents a chemical formula which in theory should separate the good and evil in man. Jekyll tries the drug and transforms to a brutal, cruel and absolutely evil "Mr. Hyde". Hyde soon sinks his claws on Ivy Pierson, a prostitute who becomes victim of his dark pleasures having simply been in a wrong place at a wrong time.This is not the first time story of Jekyll &amp; Hyde has been turned to a film. A notable silent adaptation had already been made in 1920 starring John Barrymore and that had already established the setting of women in the story: one "good girl" of upper class for Jekyll, one "bad girl" of lower class for Hyde. However, this film version far succeeds the previous ones and, I dare say, all or most of the later ones as well.The collaboration of director Reuben Mamoulian and cinematographer Karl Struss is technically flawless. The moving camera, ambitious point-of-view shots and definitely the still impressive transformation scene (where Fredric March was already wearing make-up but it would come visible only when changing the filters in front of the camera lens) were all ahead of their times, making this one of more liveliest and impressive 1930's horror films (probably most impressive along with RKO's "King Kong" and Universal's "The Bride of Frankenstein"). The foggy streets and Gothic architecture set the mood perfectly, making London appear as labyrinth like maze.The film also has a great deal of hidden meanings in it, that weren't clear for me when I first saw it (granted, I was only 12 or 13 then). The scene with Jekyll and Muriel in garden, telling how they can't wait any longer to get married, may at first seem like an innocent scene between two young people in love, but it also means they're two young people tired of waiting to get it on like rabbits. Especially watching Muriel in this light (a young innocent looking daddy's little angel) is quite startling and bold for its time. Also, Mr. Hyde's apelike make-up may seem a bit over the top, but it's actually really fitting when thinking of the time the story takes place. In Victorian England Darwin's evolution theories had caused quite an uproar when thinking man has evolved from an ape. Giving Mr. Hyde the apelike look establishes how Jekyll is a man of science and reason who doesn't believe everything bible says like the older established people did. Releasing the evil in him Jekyll proves Darwin's theories by taking a step backwards in evolution.When it comes to actors in Jekyll and Hyde movies, it's obvious the whole movie depends of getting a good actor to play the dual roles. Fredric March deservedly won an Oscar and Favorite Actor Award in Venice Film Festival (where this movie was also awarded as Most Original Story) for his part. As Henry Jekyll, March is ambitious, excited and full of passion for his work, but also reserved, dignified and frustrated. He makes a great character development when Jekyll is forced to realize he has no control over Hyde and becomes beaten, desperate and tormented. The scene where he breaks down in front of Muriel is truly touching moment. As Hyde, well, he is everything Hyde is expected to be; impulsive, sadistic, cruel animal with very obvious sexual desires. The finest part of March's work is that he truly makes you believe he is two different persons. Aside of Jean-Louis Barrault no other actor has managed to make me think "is he really playing BOTH parts?" ever.Other actors are totally left in March's shadow, but they're not exactly bad either. Rose Hobart has just too little time to make Muriel really interesting (aside of the already mentioned garden scene) but Miriam Hopkins is fantastic as the unfortunate Ivy. She starts out as a really funny and lovable girl who just wants to have fun and it's heartbreaking to watch how Hyde breaks her spirit and drives her to the edge of insanity. The scene where she cries for Jekyll to save her, making him listen the horrors he has inflicted on her, shows both March and Hopkins at their best, and the great chemistry they have.Long story short: Reuben Mamoulian's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is the best version of Robert Louis Stevenson's story. While there have been very good adaptations later also (most notably Jean Renoir's French version "Testament of Dr. Cordelier" and Terence Fisher's "Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll") this is the one to tower above them all. Atmospherically and technically great, with fantastic transformation scene, screenplay that for once improves the original story and a fantastic performance by Fredric March, make this movie one of the best 1930's horror films to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dr. Jekyll Is Not Himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This tense and suspenseful 1931 version of Robert Louis Stevenson's famous story is easily the best of all the countless Hydian forays out there. Directed with flair and imagination by Rouben Mamoulian, this 3rd classic horror entry from 1931 (after Dracula and Frankenstein - see my reviews of these movies for details) easily joins the pantheon of all-time great horror flicks.The story is almost too well-known to warrant mention: but briefly. In the late 19th Century Dr. Henry Jekyll (Fredric March), skilled surgeon and chemical experimenter, finds a way to separate the good and evil sides of the human personality. Sexually frustrated at having to wait such a long time for his marriage to his fiancé, Muriel (Rose Hobart) -cauldron bubbling over in his laboratory as if we didn't get the point - Jekyll rescues a, ahem, barmaid during a ruckus, and finds himself drawn to the open eroticism of Miss Ivy Pearson (Miriam Hopkins), a woman he dare not consort with if his reputation is to remain intact.It isn't long before Jekyll can stand it no more, and, taking a potion of his own making, becomes the ape-like Mr.Hyde, free to carouse and terrorise the Victorian nightlife. Of course he makes straight for Ivy.Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde is remarkably suggestive for the time, and we are left in no doubt of Hyde's sexual brutality off camera. We get a brief flash of semi-nudity as Ivy disrobes for Jekyll, and later she shows him the scars of Hyde's whip. Indeed the scenes between Hyde and Ivy are genuinely disturbing even today. Director Mamoulian brings off the transformation scenes with great aplomb, whirling his camera a full 360 degrees around the set, and cleverly using filters to bring out the onset of Hyde. It's startling stuff, nowadays we'd get some CGI disaster (see Van Helsing).In truth March is histrionic as Jekyll, but makes a fine Hyde, and many scenes linger in the memory - Hyde, newborn, letting the rain fall on his face, the murder scene. His remarkable simian agility.For several decades the film lost about 15 minutes of footage, trimmed by the prudish censor for a 1936 re-release. MGM also bought up Paramount's negative and left the film in the vaults, to avoid competition with their dull 1941 re-make. Now happily, all is restored, and the viewer can savour this horror masterpiece in all its glory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>R L Stevenson's "Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde" has been adapted many times for the cinema or television, often in versions which bear little resemblance to the original text. This early version does not always follow Stevenson's plot faithfully, but it does at least do it the courtesy of taking it seriously, unlike a number of later adaptations. The British-made "Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde", for example, in which Jekyll turns into a sexy young woman, treated the story as an excuse for an odd mixture of horror, camp comedy and soft-core eroticism.The central character is Henry Jekyll, a young doctor in late-Victorian London, who invents a potion which, he believes, will have the effect of separating the good and the evil sides of the human personality. The potion works, but not quite in the way which he intends. Jekyll, in his normal self, is a noble, idealistic figure who works selflessly to treat poor patients without accepting payment. When he drinks the potion, he turns into a brutal, lecherous monster, to whom he gives the name Hyde. Jekyll and Hyde are not only different in personality but also in looks. In this film, Hyde is distinctly simian in appearance, probably reflecting an early interpretation of Darwinism which held that the evil side of man's nature was a vestige of an earlier stage in his evolutionary history.This theme of dualism is also present in the treatment of the two main female characters, Jekyll's fiancée Muriel and Hyde's mistress, the music-hall singer Ivy. Muriel represents the noble, angelic side of human nature. Ivy is not evil in the way in which Hyde is evil (she soon comes to fear him and the violence of which he is capable), but she nevertheless represents the carnal, earthy side of the human personality.The film was made in 1931, in the very early days of the talking cinema, only three years after the first all-talking picture, "The Lights of New York". The style of acting is, as one might expect from a film of this date, very theatrical, more exaggerated and stylised than in later films. (Frederic March, however, copes very well with the challenges of his double role). The coming of sound brought with it the challenge of finding a new acting style to replace the mime of the silent days, and before distinctive cinematic acting techniques evolved the theatre was the obvious starting-point for the new medium. The dialogue is often even more overblown and theatrical than the acting styles. One feature that is well done is the transformation scenes where Jekyll changes into Hyde and back again; proof that effective special effects were possible long before the invention of CGI.Another feature which sets the film apart from those made only a few years later is its relatively frank treatment of sexual matters, considerably franker than would have been permitted after the introduction of the Production Code in 1934. I doubt if the Hays Office would have been impressed by some of the scenes between Hyde and Ivy and would not have looked favourably on a film which strongly implies that there may be a link between criminality and sexual repression. The name of Jekyll's alter ego was obviously chosen by Stevenson as a pun on the words "Hyde" and "hide", and in this version Hyde is clearly the incarnation of the hidden side of Jekyll's own personality, particularly of his sexual instincts which have to be repressed during his lengthy engagement. (He and Muriel are very much in love and hoping to marry as soon as possible, but they are prevented from doing so by her strict father, General Carew, who has his doubts about Jekyll's suitability as a son-in-law).Another reviewer stated that he did not regard this film as science fiction. In my opinion that is exactly what it is- science fiction and horror are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Not all sci-fi deals with space travel- the genre has a wider scope and covers all scientific or technical innovations which might conceivably affect society in the future. Modern science does not have anything that can transform the personality in exactly the same way as Jekyll's potion, but mood-altering drugs do offer an approximate parallel.This film is sometimes regarded as one of the great classics of the cinema. It is one of the few films to which "Halliwell's Film Guide" awards four stars (out of four), a rare distinction for that publication, which gives the great majority of films either one star or none at all. I would not rate it quite so highly, but it is an interesting example of an early talkie and a reminder that even in its infancy the cinema was capable of dealing with weighty topics in an intelligent way. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #060: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>060: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) - released 12/31/1931; viewed 5/28/06.KEVIN: I entirely expected Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to be a completely standard phoned-in studio horror film. What I didn't expect was a disturbing and innovative psychological thriller. I've never seen point-of-view photography so far, and the film is filled with more special effects than any film since Thief of Baghdad. The scenes where Jekyll transforms into Hyde are especially creepy and in-your-face. Unlike most horror movies, I've actually read Robert Louis Stevenson's original novel. The novel is structured in such a way that no film could ever simply be a straight adaptation of it. So each film takes a unique approach, usually giving us the story from Jekyll's perspective, which the novel doesn't do until the end when he dies. The makeup in the film, although kind of cheesy, works to make Hyde look nothing like Fredric March's Dr. Jekyll. Hyde's appearance looks somewhat de-evolved (similar to how he's described in the novel), and March's performance is a bit over-the-top, but nonetheless effective. Both Miriam Hopkins and Rose Hobart also turn in memorable performances as the objects of the divided doctor's affections. Hopkins' performance of Ivy is an excellent demonstration of the film's paranoid themes that evil could be lurking anywhere you go. Each version of Jekyll &amp; Hyde must delve into the philosophical and moral implications of Jekyll's experiments, as they are a motivating factor for him. Here, the doctor makes some compelling points about the benefits of better understanding and isolating the good side of man from the evil side, but his theory does raise some disturbing questions. He claims that with such a split, the good side would be allowed to thrive, while the evil side could "fulfill itself" and trouble man no more. What do you mean "fulfill itself"? Does he mean for a man to satisfy his bloodlust quota and move on with life sin-free? Surely if the good side is able to thrive, so will the evil side, which is exactly what we see in the story.DOUG: We close out a glorious?glorious I tell you!?year at the movies with this horror show from Paramount, directed by Russian import Rouben Mamoulian. I'd never heard of him before, but he's directed a lot of classics like Love Me Tonight and Porgy and Bess. From this film, it's clear he was a good director who, along with his cinematographer Karl Struss, did innovative things with the camera while everyone else was still figuring out what to do with sound. The p.o.v. shots are awesome, and really help the movie stand out. No one was doing p.o.v. shots at this time. I look forward to seeing more from this guy later on. Like the Universal horror shows, this one takes most of its material not from the book, but from the play. Fredrich March plays a very convincing dual role as Dr. Jekyll (which everyone pronounces JEE-kill in this film for some reason) and the evil Mr. Hyde, though he overacts a lot, especially playing Hyde. Nonetheless, his performance fits right in with the other great horror movie bad guys of the day. He does a decent job speaking around those gigantic Hyde teeth; I think they should have done without them. Miriam Hopkins and Rose Hobart turn in excellent supporting performances as Ivy and Muriel. I hope in later adaptations of the story, we get more of a sense about how when Jekyll turns into Hyde, he actually enjoys the release of being Hyde, which makes the transformation very difficult to fight, and also, maybe, the reason why Jekyll doesn't just kill himself. I also wanted to see something about how Jekyll can't ever get rid of Hyde, because once those impulses taste freedom, they can never be put back again.Last film: Mata Hari (1931). Next film viewed: Tarzan the Ape Man (1932). Next film chronologically: Shanghai Express (1932).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a racy pre-code strip tease by Hopkins, an Oscar for March</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fredric March won his first Oscar for this 1932 version of Robert Louis Stevenson's "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde". His second Oscar was for 1946's Best Picture "The Best Years of Our Lives". His portrayal was widely acclaimed. Skeptics wondered if he could replace John Barrymore in the public's mind as the definitive Jekyl/Hyde impersonator. He did! Not even Spencer Tracey's under-appreciated performance in MGM's 1941 remake with Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner could stand up to the popularity that March's performance gained. Unfortunately, March's version could not be seen for decades as MGM had buried the film in the vaults. Years later, what stands out in the pre-code film is the portrayal of Ivy by the outstanding Miriam Hopkins. Oscar nominated for the first full Technicolor film, Rouben Mamoulian's 1935's "Becky Sharp". Miriam would never win an Oscar, but she will be remembered for her roles in "The Heiress", "Trouble in Paradise" and "These Three" (The Children's Hour); and for her battles with Bette Davis during the making of Old Acquaintance and The Old Maid. As Ivy, Miriam sits on a bed facing the camera and lifts her skirts and petticoats, showing as high as the skin above her garters! It cuts away to March as Jekyl, losing the struggle with his sexual urges. It cuts back to Hopkins, naked with her bare back and side shown to the audience. Her naked leg is superimposed as Jekyl leaves the building, Ivy on his mind, the lust burning his soul -- so much as to make him want to discover a way to separate his good self from his evil desires. Most people know the Jekyl and Hyde basic plot of a Doctor experimenting with unimaginable results -- Jerry Lewis and Eddie Murphy both had popular versions of "The Nutty Professor". The film is worth owning. It is available now on the DVD with both the 1932 and 1941 versions. BUY IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rouben Mamoulian's DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE is one of the truly great horror films of all time. The story has been filmed more than any other in the horror genre, but it is Mamoulian's approach to the material that makes this one stand out. Mamoulian explores the west's overrated belief in free sensuality. His version of Dr. Jekyll, (Frederic March) is a sexless, Victorian man of reason, who wants to run wild. And so he does, but only after he concocts a special scientific cocktail that unleashes his lower nature. Mamoulian depicts Hyde as a semineanderthal brute, and March delivers on that characterization.When one takes the time to watch March's performance (his Jekyll is sacharine saintly, his Hyde moves like a lurching simian marionette), it's not hard to see why it won the Academy Award that year, while other milestones like James Whale's FRANKENSTEIN and Todd Browning's Dracula weren't even in the running. DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE is a work set apart. It's racy in ways that film in 1930s United States rarely got to explore, it's bold in it's portrayal of upper middle class society, and its opening sequences are dreamlike and surreal in a way that really suck the viewer in. The audience is asked to take in the world the way Jekyll sees it for the first ten minutes of the film, and the camera-work cements in place Jekyll's abstracted reference. The scene in which Jekyll persuades a charity ward girl that she can walk unassisted is eerie precisely because of the way the camera follows her stilted, semi-joyous gait and restrained happiness. The angle of the shoot tells us Jekyll is looking at the rest of us the same way an entomologist would look at an insect.Mirian Hopkins as the ill-fated Ivy manages to break through every stereotypical interpretation of the East End floozy that cinema has been burdened with. She's a movie "bad girl", but not one with a heart of gold, rather, Ivy is opportunist and craven. She is not one of Charles Dicken's "noble poor", and that's why her character works. She is fleshy, sensual, sweet, what Jekyll wants, and what he certainly cannot obtain from his "finished" and equally alienated fiancée Muriel Carew, portrayed here by Rose Hobart. Being a man from the upper classes, however, he's not allowed to explore what he really wants, but only what is socially acceptable. Or, "it simply isn't done", as his fiancée's father, Sir Danvers Carew (Haliwell Hobbes) would say. Hence, the looming mayhem. The wild man and woman must be set loose,by hook or by crook. And so it is, armed with a club and an intelligence distorted through a funhouse mirror.The novella of Robert Louis Stevenson is mutated, but that's the name of the game in film. Still, all the liberties taken by screenplay authors Percy Heath and Samuel Hoffenstein make sense. Is it scary? Yes, in its portrayal of the social traps we allow ourselves to be blocked into. That's some spookshow, and Stevenson knew it, and Rouben Mamoulian knew how to work with that observation, and that's why this film will hold its own decades from now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a brilliant rendition, impressive for its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rouben Mamoulian's Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde is a brilliantly original adaptation of Stevenson's classic novel. In terms of technicalities, this film is brilliant in showing the transformation from human to monster, specifically of a tall handsome and clean-cut man to a dwarfish ape-like figure. The first person camera angle in the opening scene is equally impressive for its time, as it provides viewers with a mirror reflection of Jekyll's appearance through his own eyes. On a more aesthetic note, the producer's portrayal of Sir Danver's home during the engagement party recreates nostalgia for the past decades. The conservative apparel of the men and women are accurately reflective of the conventions of the time period. However, the most significant aspect of this film is its addition of female characters that were nonexistent in the novel. Interestingly, Mamoulian's interpretation of the conflict between the id and ego seems to include women, indicating their powerful effect on a man's eternal happiness or irreversible downfall. Despite the producer's superb rendition of this classic novel, I still highly recommend reading the novel before watching the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive classic film version of the Robert Louis Stevenson novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally on DVD! Warner's DVD features both versions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the classic 1931 Rouben Mamoulain version, and the 1941 Victor Fleming version. First off let us start with the 1931 version. Although dated by today's standards of high-tech filmaking loaded with CGI trickery to distract from mediocre storytelling, this has always been my personal favorite telling of the Stevenson novel. Loaded with symbolism some subtle, and some blatantly obvious, the movie zips along at a nice pace. Fredric March (who won an Oscar) chews up the scenery quite nicely altering between kind and benevolent Dr. Jekyll, and immoral and unscrupulous Mr. Hyde. Some have noted that when the Hyde persona emerges that Mr. March looks like a grotesque parody of Jerry Lewis on bad steroids - sadly this true - however keep in mind of the era in which this film was shot, and for what it's worth Mr. March almost suffered permanent disfigurement because of the painful make-up applications. These were the days before Dick Smith and Stan Winston. The film also boasts a fine supporting cast especially by (back then hottie) Miriam Hopkins as the ill-fated "Champagne Ivy" who oozes with sensuality and delivers a performance on par with March's. Furthermore the film is really elevated by Mamoulain's solid direction, and incredible cinematography (Oscar-nominated) by Karl Struss, which features even by today's standards some great (a first) P.O.V. shots, wipes, and dissolves. The transformation scenes are very effective and convincing, and still hold up very well for first time viewers. Also of noteworthy mention is the fact of how severely the movie was censored after its initial screenings for being too explicit in its sexual and violent overtones, timid by comparisons of what we see and hear today, but quite shocking to the ruling class (Christian and church groups especially) back in 1931, that caused the film to be shorn by 18 minutes of footage - now restored.The 1941 version however is also good especially for Ingrid Bergman's tour-de-force performance (which she would top three years later in "Gaslight") as the fatal beauty of Hyde's jealous lust. Spencer Tracy dispenses with the heavy make-up that Fredric March had to endure and tries for a more low-key, yet just as sinister and evil Mr. Hyde - many think he was miscast as the lead - however that is a question of taste, also the same can be said about Lana Turner's character being too beatific. However on the plus side the film has an amazing dream/ nightmare scene with Bergman and Turner as centaurs being driven by whip-wielding Spencer Tracy. The Oscar-winning cinematography by Joseph Ruttenberg is lush giving the film a wonderful atmosphere - especially the foggy gaslight lit streets. A great (also Oscar-nominated) score by Franz Waxman is the icing on the cake. Although a bit sluggish in its pacing this is still a worthwhile entry in the classic horror genre.Warner's DVD also includes a really insightful (and not redundant) audio commentary track by author/film historian Greg Mank for the 1931 version, but unfortunately none for the 1941 version - the only bonus for that version is the original theatrical trailer. Also since this a Warner DVD it wouldn't be a complete tribute without including the Looney Tunes short animated "Hyde and Hare" in which Bugs Bunny is adopted by none other than Dr. Jekyll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply astonishing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Louis Stephenson's classic novella has been one of the most popular sources of inspiration in cinema. Ever since the silent era, numerous adaptations of his tale have been translated into movies. Mamoulian's film, however, still is the greatest and most expressionist version of them all. Perfection is every possible way and a truly stunning visual experience. A downright brilliant opening sequence (in which you get a entirely subjective introduction of the main character) sets the tone of what will be one of the most impressive horror films ever made. Dr. Jekyll is a gifted and enormously devoted scientist who strongly believes the human mind exists out of two separate sides and gives dedicated lectures about this subject. Yet, he also is a frustrated lover and his future father-in-law doesn't allow him to marry his daughter sooner than initially agreed. So he gives free reins by transforming into his `evil side' ? Mr. Hyde ? and terrorizes a beautiful, young prostitute. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde often is a sadistic and shocking movie, seeing the basic undertone simply handles about sexual frustrations! Especially compared to other 1931 horror classics (like Frankenstein or Dracula), this film is much more raw and definitely ahead of its time. Frederic March puts down an exquisite double-role and the Oscar he received for it was a righteous choice! Another proof to claim `Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' belongs to the absolute milestones in horror is the visual power of the film. The transformations Dr. Jekyll goes through in order to become Mr. Hyde are amazing! Especially the last one? You get it by now?a must-see film experience with gigantic entertainment value!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dark and intense adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This early talkie takes Stevenson's novella and turns it into a study of the destruction which comes from animal tendencies taking over human ones - Jekyll is disturbed by the constant delay of his marriage to Muriel (Rose Hobart) so he draws out his 'bad' side, Mr Hyde, and goes in destructive pursuit of good time girl Ivy (Miriam Hopkins).As Jekyll and Hyde, Fredric March is superb, whether as the malevolent and intense doctor, or the repulsive and debauched reptile he makes himself become through his dangerous experiments. It is sexual tension which causes many of the problems in this pre-Code fantasy; filmed largely in the shadows of a make-believe London where our hero/anti-hero wanders at will. The cinematography is largely beautifully done, especially when shots swoop down into dark places and focus on the most difficult scenes (for example, those involving Hopkins).This is an excellent version of the oft-told tale, and Rouben Mamoulian's direction is spot-on (as it was in his slightly later Queen Christina). March deserved his best actor gong for this classic performance/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first talkie version of the oft-filmed R.L. Stevenson tale, and still quite watchable seven decades later. Rouben Mamoulien directed this one, and it is really more of a literary adaptation that happens to have "horror" elements than a true horror film. Fredric March as Jekyll/Hyde leads a first-rate cast that includes Miriam Hopkins, Rose Hobart, Edgar Norton and Holmes Herbert. As the bland, moralistic Dr. Jekyll, March is no more than adequate, but as the evil, scheming Hyde, he is triumphant. The first transformation scene is still a shocker, as Karl Struss whirls his camera around the laboratory, finally stopping with Jekyll staring into the mirror, as his features change literally before our eyes. Handsome Fredric March was clearly was having a field day playing the crude, ugly monster that Jekyll had turned himself into, as he leaps and frolics, dashes down alleys, tortures a beautiful "entertainer" (read: prostitute), doing all the things the kind doctor would like to do but is too fearful to admit, even to himself, that he desires.As a moral tale, which to a large extent Jekyll and Hyde is, this must seem quaint to Gen-X'ers and modern audiences in general. The notion of the separability of good and evil, and the extremes of inhibition that Victorian folk would go to in order to maintain their "respectability", have by and larger passed into history. Most people nowadays admit that they're a mess, or are the very least that they're flawed, prey to strange impulses, and at times a little mad. Though most of us wouldn't care to say such things in public, this appears to be understood, which is perhaps why Bill Clinton was not tarred and feathered after his confession of having lied about having sex with "that woman". People understand. They don't come out and say so, but they do. (Whether this is a good or bad thing I'll leave to the moralists and Bill Bennetts among us.) Such was not the case in the nineteenth century, when Stevenson wrote this story; and not so in 1931, when this version of it was filmed. A good deal had to be implied.Even so, this was a pretty racy film for 1931. For a major production, it is surprisingly small-scale. Hans Dreier's sets, excellent though they are, seem at times almost too cramped for the movie. The cast is uniformly excellent, especially Edgar Norton as Poole, the butler. Miriam Hopkins is perfect as the pathetic Ivy. Her cockney accent is variable, but you get the general idea. I especially like Holmes Herbert as Lanyon, whose quiet, authoritative presence nicely suggests that perhaps he has demons, too, and that where he differs from his friend Jekyll is that he has learned to live with them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank goodness for Turner Classic Movies for showing this gem!Much of the movies shown on the cable channels are either un-watcheable, or worthy of being turned off within the first few minutes.Here though we have a genuine masterly picture of a classic tale.The story:Science genius believes he can isolate mans' good and bad sides. Frustrated in his love life he experiments with a potion and becomes thereafter a monster at some times(Mr Hyde), when otherwise he is a good guy: Dr Jekyll.Shows the dangers of taking drugs to give oneself a "high" as sooner rather than later the addiction takes over!This is an excellent movie with the lead male and his two "love" interests stealing the show.Gripping and compulsive viewing throughout, and current film-makers ought to take heed on how to keep audiences enthralled.Deserving top marks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really a Modern Tale About Control</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read several film books that describe this movie as a masterpiece of horror, I decided to take a look. While it certainly is a horror movie with a supernatural element, it is less horror story and more about the state of humankind, especially the male of the species. Frederic March as Hyde is so riveting, so powerful, and so grotesque in his id driven manifestations, that one can't help but watch his every move. Despite his disfigurement, he knows only the sexual and lustful drives that have been released through the experiments. He is vengeful, controlling, and virtually unstoppable. I was amazed at March's athleticism. I felt the spectre of this creature dominating every scene. I felt for the victims of his obsession. Mamoulian creates dim atmospheres and a series of claustrophobic settings that contribute to the threat. Jekyll has lost control and can't pull Hyde back.What I saw in this movie, was what I hear on the news. "She was killed by her live in boyfriend after a turbulent relationship." I'd swear that nine times out of ten when I hear about a murder of a woman, it's some unstable brutalizer who she once welcomed into her home. Jekyll released this through his experiments. Stevenson knew the nature of the impulses of humankind, and knew that buried beneath many of those charming men is submerged the Hyde of this movie. I love the Barrymore film, but I think this is the best of all the versions of this story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic horror film and Miriam Hopkins sizzles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This take on the classic Robert Louis Stevenson story is classic in its own right, and works on many levels. There's the obvious psychological component to the story, with Jekyll representing the ego/superego, and Hyde the id. We also have the theme of the scientist tampering with nature with an altruistic goal, in this case to rid the psyche of the bad side, become 'super-good', and achieve more, but with a disastrous result that quickly gets out of his hands. But perhaps most importantly, we have the sheer horror of a man unchecked by morality, who is 'free' from constraint, and who promptly rapes, brutalizes, and murders before running off into the foggy London night. He's not an unthinking animal, however ? he has all of his cognitive abilities, speaks, and uses logic to elude capture ? and this, combined with film sequences that are shot from Jekyll/Hyde's perspective, amplify the fact that this villain is within us all, which is the greatest horror of all.As an aside: isn't it interesting that while Dr. Jekyll clearly contains the two sides of man, the good and the evil, the female characters in the film seem to be neatly one-dimensional: Muriel (his fiancée, 'good'), and Ivy (the dancehall girl, 'bad'). And that after he's taken the potion, he gets darker in addition to becoming uglier and needing some serious orthodontia? But I digress. Frederic March is fantastic as Jekyll and Hyde, and won an Oscar for his performance. He plays the lecher without mercy, and leaps around during some exciting chase sequences. The scene where he shows up in Ivy's mirror after she's been assured by Dr. Jekyll that he's gone for good is frightening. Dr. Jekyll thought he could make that promise before he realized that not taking the potion was no longer sufficient to stop the transformation to Mr. Hyde, and that mere impure thought could now bring it about. It's hard to put the lid back on once Pandora's Box has been opened.Miriam Hopkins shows nice range as Ivy, first absolutely sizzling in a scene where she tries to seduce Dr. Jekyll, a scene ending with her swinging her bare leg from a bed, giving him a serious ravage-me look, responding to his saying he can't return playfully with "oh yes you can", and imploring him to "Come back soon, won't you?....Soon...Come back." Yowza. Later, she's suitably horrified by Mr. Hyde, who does have his way with her, and abuses her without mercy. (she only shows the whip marks to Jekyll, we neither see this happening or the marks themselves ? but it's enough to make us shiver) That dangling leg is left superimposed on the screen for some time while Dr. Jekyll walks off with a colleague, exclaiming ""Can a man dying of thirst forget water? Do you know what would happen to that thirst if it were denied water?" His marriage to Muriel has been delayed at her father's request; the suggestion is he's sexually frustrated, and after taking the potion, he makes a beeline back to see Ivy.Aside from special effects that are outstanding for the time period, and which hold up well today (particularly the first transformation), the film adds some other nice touches. Dr. Jekyll's organ playing is brief but adds a manic and morbid tone, as the film cuts to a candelabra, a statue, a bust, and a tight shot of his servant's face in succession. At one point, Dr. Jekyll is in the park, hears birdsong, and quotes Keats' 'Ode to a Nightingale' ("thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird! No hungry generations tread thee down?") ? before seeing a cat advancing along the branch to silence that song. Later, as Hyde strangles Ivy, they slump behind a bed, revealing in the background a replica of Canova's 'Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss' which director Rouben Mamoulian leaves us with until Hyde gets back up.The movie has some pretty dark content, but it's asking questions about man's nature, and this version is balanced and moves along well. Definitely a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through experiment a scientist reaches the dark side of his character, unleashing hell on the women in his life.Early talkie with a lot of novelty in the use of the camera. Opening scene is about 3 mins of first person POV, with a bit of shaky cam. There's time-lapse special effects, plenty monkey-jump stunts, and a really good shot of the villain being pursued by shadows. Screen swipes were clunky, many excellent close ups. Also a racy scene early on that shows the director's ambition, and some interesting cut aways to sex symbols.Negatives: stodgy dialogue, slow editing, and the completely conservative story. A lot of issues raised, but really we're stuck with a sanitised fairy tale where the status quo must be restored. Britain (ie. America) - land of opportunity where nothing changes.Performances were overworked, but that may be down to the dialogue. Some really bad accents, and an unconvincing version of late Victorian London.Music nothing special - a bit of Beethoven (not Bach) at the start on an irrelevant organ.Overall - interesting, but slow story and dull moralism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the different versions of the Jekyll and Hyde story that I've seen, this is hands down the best. One of three influential horror classics to come out in 1931 and the only one not released by Universal. The other two being Dracula and Frankenstein, of course. Fredric March deservedly won the Academy Award for his performance. That's a rarity for a horror film, then and now. Miriam Hopkins is dynamite as Ivy, a prostitute rescued by Jekyll and later forced to become Hyde's plaything. Ivy's first meeting with Jekyll is one of Pre-Code Hollywood's raciest scenes. Good support from venerable character actors Holmes Herbert and Halliwell Hobbes.It's a visually amazing movie for 1931, with great sets and impressive camera-work. Director Rouben Mamoulian creatively uses virtually every trick in the book to great effect. As much as I love Dracula and Frankenstein, from a technical standpoint this film runs circles around them. The transformation scenes are decades ahead of their time. The makeup for Hyde gives him an apelike appearance that's frighteningly gruesome. Those teeth! Yikes! The script dives headlong into the psychological elements of the Stevenson story that have made it so timeless. The monster in Jekyll is the monster in all of us. Also represented by Mamoulian's use of first-person point-of-view in many scenes, essentially placing the viewer in Dr. Jekyll's shoes. The theme of sexual repression runs throughout the film. The driving force behind Jekyll's taking the formula that transforms him into Hyde is his lust for Ivy and frustration over having to wait ten months to be with his fiancée Muriel.It's a classic, plain and simple. I can only imagine how powerful it must have been to see it in a darkened theater in 1931. It blew me away seeing it for the first time over 60 years later. It grips you from the opening moments and doesn't let up the whole way through. Exciting, atmospheric, and intelligent. A definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Halloween Horror Reviews #17)It is hard to believe that such a refined and dynamic film as this came out of this early period in horror. The harsh emotions, the creepy imagery and sets, all massively ahead of their time. The themes and ideas of the novel remain respectfully intact here, nowhere near as diluted as they would have been expected to be.Fredric March is truly incredible as both Jekyll and Hyde. The emotional range is stellar, the physical investment from the actor is truly admirable and quite spectacular. Miriam Hopkins also offers a chilling performance in her role, captivating the audience with her simple yet effective displays of fear and bewilderment. Between these two actors, the film becomes a powerhouse of great early sound acting and a real marvel to watch 82 years later. The supporting actors also do a fine job, but are ultimately overlooked and passed over by the main stars.The set design and lighting are both also stellar, perhaps some of the best examples of such things from the early sound era of horror. The lamp lit streets, the chaotic laboratory and the jolly pub, these are all great sets and give the film a vibrant charm of its own.In conclusion, this is a near perfect film and an outstanding accompaniment to the classics of Universal. A sadly often overlooked gem here.</fullReview>

This is one of those films where most of the horror is subtle - the idea of this looking hideous man-creature Mr. Hyde on the loose.The story is, in it's way, similar to 'The Invisible Man' and 'Frankenstein' because we have a scientist that is considered to be insane for creating monsters yet their intentions started out good.Dr. Jekyll's beliefs in the good man vs the evil man lead him to experiment with the concept. By doing so, he created the strong, primitive Mr. Hyde. Dr. Jekyll represents the brain and the good side of man while Mr. Hyde represents the brawn and the evil.I love these older horror films - they are still some of the best, most creative movies ever made.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive 'Jekyll and Hyde' movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the definitive and unsurpassed screen adaptation of R. L. Stevenson's story, brilliant in every aspect. It begins with a complex 3-min. scene entirely filmed in first-person camera, which sort of foreshadows the first transformation scene, also shot in first person (seen in a mirror) with magnificent makeup effects achieved by means of a subtle change of filters before the camera lens. March excels, both as an increasingly desperate Dr. Jekyll and as an ape-like Mr. Hyde (under heavy make-up). M. Hopkins, often an over-actress in other movies, plays her role to the hilt but never inordinately, and interacts marvelously with March in the most intense, dramatic sequences. Mamoulian's direction is subtle, rich in complex imagery and expressive details. After M. Hopkins' extremely daring (for 1931) strip scene, her naked leg is seen swinging from her bed, and, in a lap dissolve, remains in sight by superimposition for some 20 seconds into the following scene, as if still teasing Jekyll innerly. Extensive use of wipes is made, and the wipe often stops momentarily, splitting the screen diagonally where two different scenes are related (often the two ladies: R. Hobart and M. Hopkins). Statuettes in the set decoration contain an important symbolism (for instance: when Hyde kills Ivy, the camera closes on a statuette of Cupid kidnapping Psyche). The boiling cauldron is also symbolic: it explodes when Jekyll despairs in his lab, and is also seen on the foreground in the very last shot of the movie, as Jekyll dies. Note also the cat that kills the bird (the killing is obviously not shown on screen), triggering Jekyll's transformation into Hyde, and Hyde's beastly joy in the rain. No music is used except for Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor heard in the main title. ? All in all, this picture is a superlative cinematic accomplishment.</fullReview>

He develops a serum to potentially rid humanity of its evil side, but this backfires, as Jekyll turns into Mr. Hyde, a crude, violent(and ugly) man who nonetheless vents all his pent-up desires and rage, dispensing with any pretense of being civilized. Hyde meets up with attractive singer Ivy Pearson(played well by Miriam Hopkins) whom he treats horribly, though she finds herself transfixed and terrified by him. Jekyll then tries to rid himself of Hyde, but it's too late...Superbly acted and directed film was the best version, really making the motivation of Hyde(Jekyll's sexual frustration) come to the forefront. Sophisticated and intelligent film, with fine make-up. Lacks a certain polish, but otherwise first-rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made at the height of the horror craze, this is both great drama and frightening grand guignole.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of this first sound version of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic horror tale of man's desperation to find out the truth about good and evil, you only hear the voice of Dr. Henry Jekyll (Fredric March) as he prepares to go to a meeting to address his fellow scientists. This makes the narrative of the film all the more special, because you know that once Jekyll turns into Hyde, it will be all the more terrifying. The first visual of Dr. Jekyll makes the viewer forget almost everything they already know about the story, his youth and energy seemingly harmless. When Jekyll asks for his lover Rose Hobart's hand in marriage, his prospective father-in-law (Halliwell Hobbes) demands he wait months for the right moment. Jekyll's already turning into Hyde without actually taking the formula, his anger brewing towards the pompous Hobbes inside himself.When Dr. Jekyll meets the pathetic Miriam Hopkins, the film goes into a strange pre-code mode of sexual energy between March and Hopkins, her voice haunting him as she repeats "Come back to see me", obviously intent on seducing him, having already seemingly done so as she flashed her naked leg at him. Even without the secret formula, Jekyll is enticed with animal magnetism, and his transformation reveals desires that were already there, not brought out simply by another personality. When Mr. Hyde appears, he's quite chatty and engaging, even if horrific looking with his mop of hair and over-exaggerated teeth. This Hyde isn't a total monster, but there's little conscience to him. He's more sociopath than psychopath, and it is obvious that he has a sexual energy that can never be satisfied which will result in violence.These elements make this version fascinating, and in watching the 1941 version, found that sadly missing. Great performances can't hide the missing intentions of the original author's story, and it is obvious that like Edgar Allan Poe's "The Picture of Dorian Gray", the leading character (here in the Mr. Hyde persona) is a sexual predator. Artistically speaking, as directed by the masterful Rouben Mamoulian, this film is also stunning to look at, every element of it suspenseful right up to the final revelation.Considering that this was made at Paramount where drawing room comedies and musicals were the specialty and not over at Universal who was having great success with their Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff chillers, this is all the more unique. Many of these original horror films were fortunately missing the elements of camp which would become all the more evident by the mid 1930's even in such masterpieces as "The Bride of Frankenstein" and "The Raven". By mixing romance and horror (and only having enough comic bits to keep the viewer amused), the results make this a Gothic thriller that today's horror buffs should study where the result of the dangers were implied, not thrown in the viewer's faces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece about sexual repression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great film! Wonderful, solid old fashion storytelling, timeless in both theme and exposition. The maintitles bursts Toccata and Fuge in d minor by the psychocosmic composer Johann S Bach. That choice of music alone stands well to present one of the 5 greatest horrorfilms of the 1930's. Then we are taken for a ride in a respected mans POV until we are met by a mirror. That nice Jekyll! We hear him having a speech that sounds like he is speaking of LSD or some similar psychoactive drug that he wants to use to release the bad side of/ inside Us. That reminds me of how LSD was used in psychoterapy during the 60's. Even here in Sweden till 1973, to release traumas or bad habits. Jekyll is presented as being an urgent man, a human soul with lots of fire burning. Passion. And he loves Muriel. They are so rampant they sit and glare into each others eyes, saying -I love you, I love you sooo much, oh how I love you! Not because the screenwriter is a fool, but because we are suppose to understand that the only way they can make love before marriage in that Victorian age, is to fantasize together.. ..gosh. Poor young people!This is one of the earliest sound horror films, made as it is side by side with Dracula, Dr X and Frankenstein, this film experiment with sounds where the other films have pretty much nothing but stagesounding talk. Jekylls first experiment is a swirling experience with flashbacks of faces and voices with that panting and moaning sound from his breathing, and the loud pounding of the heartbeats....Jekyll has a very nice chemistry with Ivy. And when Hyde have Ivy in her arms both Fredric Marsh and Myriam Hopkins show us what true strong acting is. He is horrible. She is tortured mentally. The sex element is so clear in this film that it hurts and it makes this film probably the first horror film to deal with sex,(Ivys bare leg is a pendulum of seduction in Jekylls subconsciousness), just like say, Cat People 11 years later... but not like this. This is not hinting at sex. This is showing us what he thinks about. Isn't it interesting how surprising many films made before the censorship code in 1933, appear? I watched Ben Hur from 1926 and saw decapitated heads rolling on a ship and a womans bare breasts. Violence and sex was something we were not able to watch for along time since that code. Cameraman Karl Struss never shot Frankenstein or Dracula, but he could make a film look so good. Concerning the transformation scenes, even *SPOILER* the special makeup paint and camerafilter effects was unknown to audience and critics for decades. And the film was considered LOST for 30 or 40 years!Unbelievable! The only weaknesses in the film is due to some crude jumpcuts which otherwise would have shown us a little more evil actions: Mr Hyde running being nasty in the dimlit streets of Soho, and his whipping of Ivy. A beautiful, but at the same time very uncomfortable portrait of a man and his mental, physical and sexual grip of terror upon a poor woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Robert Louis Stevenson story has become so ingrained in our subconscious (written years before Freud by the way) and culture that a day can hardly go by without hearing something about a "split personality". There are many actual movie versions of the story and this is the arguably the best. It seems a film possessed. Made in 1931 the camera hardly ever seems to stand still (very very unusual for the time considering the technical effort needed to employ these tricky turns). The transformation shots are impressive and realistic and there are other cinematic flourishes flashing and fighting for attention. All this is somewhat showy but that's the point. This film is not going to stand for anything but total involvement by the audience. It pulls you into the story, not through subtle narrative or the literal literary storytelling better suited for the printed word than this visual art form, but by the sheer power of the medium. It all works magnificently and the pre Hays Code sex adds another point of interest. This is a film lovers film and a movie buff's buffet of treats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fredric March's on-camera/in-camera transformation from sophisticated socialite into a heavy-breathing caveman (done, in part, with the help of some outstanding makeup, courtesy of Wally Westmore) is just one of the many flourishes that makes THIS the definitive man-into-monster movie. The subjective point of view shots are another. In terms of performances, March's is a tour de force turn worthy of ANY acting award; nor should we overlook the lovely Miriam Hopkins as the barmaid "Ivy," whose pitch-perfect performance is a great counterpoint to March's madness; their interplay is most definitely of the sexploitation variety, but ably handled by director Mamoulian (see, in particular, the scene following Jekyll's rescue of Ivy: as the good doctor strolls away, the image of the barmaid's suggestively swinging bare leg is superimposed over him; a deft touch). All of the action scenes are beautifully staged, as well. March really sells the transformation: unfettered by the constraints of civilization, his manner becomes almost animal-like; his senses seem keener, heightened (a true testament to March's acting ability if not Mamoulian's direction if not both); certainly his libido is ("What I want, I GET!"). His raw, raucous laughter only serves to underscore his change. In another fascinating sequence, the hysterical Ivy is calmed by Jekyll, who promises her that Hyde will no longer terrorize her. Here, there appears to be a VERY subtle change in Jekyll's pallor (the same technique that was used to suggest the early stages of his transformation), which suggests that Hyde is "listening in." (This COULD just be the quality of the VHS tape I have, but I don't think so: it's too perfect to be coincidence, and it jibes with everything that has gone before- and which comes after.) Some beautifully-timed edits in March's subsequent transformation add "character" to same (the scene in the park). Hyde also gets progressively fuglier as the movie unfolds. THE WOLFMAN (and WEREWOLF OF London and all the rest) owed much to Stevenson and the debt is here made crystal clear: bereft of magic, Jekyll uses his own concoction to effect his change; it also helps to make DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE relevant to contemporary audiences, especially here in the U.$., where an insatiable appetite for drugs has turned other countries into battlegrounds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Louis Stevenson's 1885 novella, "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde," has long been a favourite target for movie adaptations. Horror screenwriters evidently relished the film's twisted notion that within each man lurks the separate powers of good and evil, and the tale of one scientist's fateful tampering with nature {a theme pioneered by Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" in 1818} has surfaced repeatedly throughout the history of the genre. The first significant film adaptation of Stevenson's novel was released in 1920, in John S. Robertson's classic silent horror film, with John Barrymore given an impressively creepy performance in the title role. However, the definitive version of the story didn't arrive until a decade later, when director Rouben Mamoulian cast Fredric March in what would become the first of his two Oscar-winning roles {the other being 'The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)'}.At the beginning of the film, Dr. Henry Jekyll (Fredric March) is shown to be a kind and selfless man, if a bit eccentric. His dedication to the medical profession occasionally leads to the neglect of his beloved fiancé, Muriel Carew (Rose Hobart), much to the indignation of her militant father (Halliwell Hobbes). One night, on his walk home from a dinner party, Jekyll comes to the aid of a saucy bar-maid in distress, Ivy Pearson (Miriam Hopkins), who promptly propositions him {in a manner that would surely have conflicted with the Production Code of 1930, which was yet to be strictly enforced} The frustration caused to Jekyll by resisting primal temptation begins to accumulate, and so he attempts to develop a concoction that will effectively separate the "noble" goodness of Man from the primitive instincts of his animal self. Following the consumption of his drug, Jekyll's "evil self" is allowed to surface, and the repugnant, indecent and cruel Mr. Hyde is permitted free reign on the darkened streets of London.From the opening minutes of the film, it's apparent that there's something unique about Rouben Mamoulian, an Armernian-American director of whom I was unfamiliar. The first five minutes are told exclusively from the point-of-view of Dr. Jekyll, as he follows his butler through his extravagant mansion to reach a waiting horse-and-carriage. Along the way, in one particularly creative shot, Jekyll glances up at his wall-mounted mirror, in which we first catch a glimpse of the film's protagonist through his own eyes. This inspired trick, presumably using another room to masquerade as a mirror, shows an incredible imagination with the camera, and both Mamoulian and cinematographer Karl Struss deserve to be applauded for seeking new and creative ways to tell a story. Also worth noting is the film's extensive use of extreme facial close-ups, which initially seem to serve little purpose, but prove terrifyingly effective when the viewer is confronted with the hideous features of Mr. Hyde, seemingly just inches from their own face.The most astonishing scenes of 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931)' are undoubtedly March's vivid transformations. Though some of the later effects are clearly accomplished through successive cross-fades, the early conversions from Jekyll to Hyde are executed so faultlessly that audiences wondered for decades how they had been achieved. Mamoulian would eventually reveal that a system of rotating filters were chosen to match the make-up, and their removal or addition from the lens would effectively reveal or obscure March's make-up work. Though this film's Mr. Hyde is not quite as gaunt and haggard as Barrymore's version, March's portrayal remains an absolutely hideous creation, his darkened face and twisted teeth effectively creating a monster. Hyde's persistent cruelty is dominating and overwhelming, and the story reserves no mercy for the tragic Ivy Pearson, who is offered a glimmer of hope before being condemned to a violent death. March's Dr. Jekyll, likewise, is left without a flicker of nobility, his "good" self yielding indefinitely to the powers of Hyde's cold embrace, his grisly end eliciting nothing more than sheer pity, the sort one might show towards a dying feral dog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films of the 1930's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts out with a long continuous shot that puts the camera as the eyes of the unknown subject that is so inventively well done that you know this is going to be a great film from it's first few minutes. And it is. Russian born director Rouben Mamoulian had been an opera and theater director in New York before coming out to Hollywood as a film director for Paramount. This is is third film as a director and it is Paramounts answer to Universal's successful Dracula. Based on the story by Robert Louis Stevenson the screenplay was adapted by Samuel Hoffenstein and Percy Heath. Cinematographer Karl Struss was nominated for an Academy Award for his remarkable photography on this film. Hoffenstein and Heath were also nominated for their screenplay and Fredric March in the role of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was nominated for and won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Mirian Hopkins and Edward Everett Norton are among the cast. Mamoulian would go on to make such films as Love Me Tonight, Queen Christina, Mark Of Zoro, and Blood and Sand but made his film output dropped off in the 1940's with only a handful of films and into the 50's he made only two films and was fired from two more and by 1959 his career was over even though he lived until 1987. This is an excellent film and certainly one of the best of the horror genre films of the 1930's. I would give this a 9.0 out of 10 and highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie--how about a restored version?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught a brand new print of this at a revival house back in the 1980s. It was just great--the acting was superb (Frederic March and Miriam Hopkins especially), the film had superb direction with ground-breaking use of close-ups, double screens and POV shots and had a surprising amount of cruelty (the scenes where March mentally tortures Hopkins are almost impossible to watch), implied torture and flashes of nudity. Also this was one of the first horror films to ever win an acting award (March got Best Actor). That didn't happen again until "Silence of the Lambs" in the 1990s.Sadly, the only print available today is in dreadful shape. I just watched the first half hour before I had to turn it off. The film has more than a few jumps in it, there is severe editing (the sequence where March puts Hopkins to bed is cut to ribbons) and the picture quality is poor. Surprisingly, TCM showed this and they're usually very good about getting good prints.How about an uncut restored print of this? It's a great movie and deserves better.UPDATE: Saw it on DVD. The print looks GREAT! The flash of nudity from Hopkins is still missing but that's a minor complaint. Well worth catching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The creativity of this production is amazing. The film includes an extended first person POV shot at the beginning that would have been almost impossible at the time. The creature's make up and the transformation scenes are really stunning. I'm still not sure how the transformation was done. Crossfades, wipes, and montage (all new techniques at the time) are used artfully to help tell the story and to give psychological insights.Technical matters aside, this is an elegant film. Mamoulian uses parallel images of several of the actors to create new and interesting connections between the characters. Pay special attention to his use of mirrors. The hints of spouse abuse and the Freudian theme of the battle of the id and ego also make this film a psychologically complex one. This is one film adaptation that, at least in some ways, transcends the text upon which it was based.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never confuse this with any other version of the Stevenson classic. Only John Barrymore's is nearly as good. The sexual theme is much stronger than in the book but still subtle enough to go over the heads of today's younger audience, which needs more obvious detail. Fredric March's performance transcends the horrifyingly simian makeup. (My sister is still convinced two actors played the part.) Miriam Hopkins is a delight. For its time, the photography and direction were very unique and are still very effective. An interesting side-note is that March almost didn't get the role because the producer dismissed him as a "comedian." This is a horror film for the intellect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jekyll vs. Hyde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Robert Louis Stevenson's iconic story, this horror film focuses on a scientist who develops a way to transform into a Neanderthal-like man with animalistic impulses. It is an interesting concept with lots of dialogue about evil existing inside everyone and repressing one's base desires, but the real standout element here is the filmic style. The film features innovative point-of-view camera- work that frequently tracks and pans. Then there is a superb lethargic dissolve of a woman's leg to show how ingrained the image is our hero's mind. Plus there is a great bit in which reaction shots between two lovers gradually zoom in closer... and the list goes on. The film is so technically advanced that it is still impressive by standards today; only the over-the-top makeup effects (complete with buck teeth) disappoint. With so much attention dedicated to the look of the film, it is perhaps unexpected that the story sags a little. Absolute no romantic sparks exist between Fredric March and Rose Hobart, which makes his pining to marry her a little hard to buy, and a subplot with a wanton Miriam Hopkins (not part of the original story) only works slightly better. When the film concentrates on March though and his increased difficulty of keeping Hyde under wraps, it rarely missteps. As alluded to, the film has a lot to say about dualities with the nature of humankind and the visuals are absolutely top notch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Sexual Repression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The novella THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE by Robert Louis Stevenson has become of a classic of horror literature. As a result, it has become fertile territory for Hollywood to mine this book again and again as numerous versions have been filmed, while still dozens of other films borrow heavily from its' themes and central premise. Most in the critical community, though, would agree that this is the best version of the Jekyll and Hyde story and I would wholeheartedly agree.The film is shocking for its' time in history, before the censorship codes would prevent Hollywood from making movies like this for decades to come. Still, even when compared to other pre-code horror, this movie attempts to go places that no other horror film does in terms of its' raw portrayals of sexual aggression. Dr. Jekyll is, after all, a good man. A scientist of some intellect, we meet him as he's on his way to speak to a crowd which has gathered to hear his ideas. The lecture he gives is of the possibly of splitting man in two. While many in the audience have a laugh at him as they take him literally, Jekyll is speaking not of a physical splitting, but of a splitting of personality. The story doesn't need much more exposition than that, as we all know the tale by now. Eventually, Jekyll succeeds in his experiment to disastrous results, as he unleashes the beast within himself.That's where this version succeeds so triumphantly. Where other versions from this era, including the Spencer Tracy version a decade later, hint at the sexual repression, this movie makes it the central focus. Jekyll is obviously struggling with the morals of his society, as well as an overbearing future father-in-law, as those forces conspire to keep him from wedding his love and, thus, from releasing his sexual frustration. When he splits Mr. Hyde from his personality, Hyde becomes a primal force of sexual aggression, doing all of the things that Jekyll cannot. Hyde goes straight to a prostitute that Jekyll could only innocently flirt with and takes it to places Jekyll could never go. Initially, he "keeps" her in luxury to win her favors, but the evil in Hyde begins to torment and abuse the woman. Eventually, Jekyll loses control and Hyde begins to destroy his life in more ways that one.Fredrich March won an Oscar for his role and it is well deserved. He brilliantly pulls off both sides of this man. He is charming, intelligent and loving as Dr. Jekyll, as much as he is crude, evil and deviant as Mr. Hyde. One might believe they were two different actors, he puts that much effort into wildly disparate personalities. March's physical acting as Hyde is excellent, as well. He takes on an almost simian nature, as he regresses to an earlier evolution, free of society's morals, but also of it's refinement.The makeup goes a long way to portray this, as well. They give March the look of a Neanderthal, complete with animalistic teeth. A big part of that makeup is the transformation scenes, which are very well done for the time, a decade before Universal tried anything similar in THE WOLFMAN, March undergoes a gradual progression from man to animal through some excellent camera-work. While we are on that subject, the camera framing by Mamoulian is spot on in helping to lend weight to this movie. The POV shots that he continually explores help the viewer put themselves more firmly into the shoes of Jekyll. We, often, see things in this movie from his perspective, so the audience is all the more invested in Jekyll as his life falls apart under the influence of the evil Hyde.Universal was the king of horror in the 30s, but could easily stand amongst those horror classics and gives us another outstanding movie villain from the golden age of the horror film.</fullReview>

I can understand it's horror but it just was so unexpected and frightening! I really applaud Fredric March for playing two characters throughout the whole movie. It was quite shocking that he was hospitalized after involving in this film. The reason could be the makeup whenever he had to play Hyde since it did report that his face was sort of disfigured. He was such an excellent actor and I'm only discovering him years later lol! This movie definitely deserved an Oscar, why can't Hollywood just leave it alone and not do too many adaptations?!

		<fullReview>It's one of the most famous pieces of literature ever written, a genius piece of story telling from the trippy mind of Robert Louis Stevenson. That it has consistently been ripe for film and stage adaptations, and continues to be so since it first surfaced in written form in 1866, is testament to what a devilishly intelligent piece of work it is.This 1931 version, directed by Rouben Mamoulian and staring Fredric March, may not be 100% faithful to the source, but it's arguably the finest adaptation to screen, led by a superb performance from March and featuring technical guile by Mamoulian and his team. It's wonderfully stylish, and coming as it did before the Hayes Code, it's sexy and dangerous, awash with terrifying cruelty, with the subversive and Freudian psychological beats making for a Gothic horror classic.Split personality a go go, inhibitions cast asunder, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is priceless. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . it's a fatal mistake for "One Percenters" to think they don't need guns was never better illustrated than in this 1931 version of DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE. The second title character represents the Rich, able to do whatever they want (with no qualms of conscience), as long as they remember their personal firearms. Dr. Jekyll is meant to portray the Rich in their weak moments, when they forget that God gave them what they have to live it up, with the right to lord it over the other 99% of people who have NOT been so blessed by Divine Providence. Namby Pamby concepts such as "fairness," "charity," and "good will" creep into the picture here whenever Dr. Jekyll takes over Fredric March's body on-screen. However, when Hyde is running the show, things are simpler; as Hyde says to dance hall gal Ivy, "You see, I hurt you because I love you; I want you; What I want, I get." None of Dr. Jekyll's mealy-mouthed Shilly-Shallying for Hyde! Unfortunately, a jealous Ten-Percenter with a gun--such as Jekyll's "friend" Lanyon, in this story--can neutralize an unarmed One Percenter, even one as smart and strong as Hyde. Lanyon and his legion of bamboozled bobbies shoot down Jekyll\Hyde like a dog in his own home. This would NOT have happened to Charlton Heston! (I've heard that three Detroit home owners have fatally shot three home invaders and wounded one in the Motor City in the past two weeks; none of this trio of castle defenders was as smart, rich, or strong as Mr. Hyde. However, as other Detroiters are too poor to afford personal firearms and ammo, don't forget to help them out by supporting your local chapter of B.A.N.G.S.--Broke Americans Need Gun Stamps.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dr. Jeekyl, I presume</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde starring a young and excellent Frederic March as the doomed doctor. Miriam Hopkins is Hyde's woman, and Rose Hobart plays Jekyll's well-bred fiancé. Interestingly, though I've seen the Spencer Tracy version and the Broadway show, I had never heard Jekyll pronounced "Jeekill" until this film.Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is the famous story by Robert Louis Stevenson about a scientist who believes in man's dual personality, that of good and evil, and experiments with a concoction that can bring out the dark side of humanity. Unfortunately, he learns that, once the devilish Mr. Hyde has emerged, Jekyll can't easily keep him sublimated. In this version, Hyde is unbelievably horrible-looking, a cross between an ape and a human - the makeup is magnificent and actually what you would see in a horror movie. The film, directed by Rouben Mamoulian with camera work by Karl Struss is way ahead of its time. It's early days in talkies, but the use of morphing, split screens, and most of all, a moving camera. When talkies first came out, the camera was in a box in its same position throughout a movie. Hitchcock took the camera out of the box, and the sound man walked off the set. Here, the camera moves quite fluidly. and at the beginning shows the audience activities from the viewpoint of Dr. Jekyll without showing him. Positively brilliant.Miriam Hopkins as Ivy, the victim of Hyde's abuse, is young, lovely and sexy. Supposedly there is a nude scene in the film, which had been cut when I saw it, though you do almost see Hopkins' entire breast. Always an excellent actress who came to Hollywood with vast stage experience, Hopkins became known for portrayals of strong women and eventually moved into character roles. As a terrified prostitute, she is very convincing.Frederic March gives an excellent performance in the acting style of the day, which was a little melodramatic. With so many actors coming to Hollywood from the stage, when this film was made, these actors' technique before a camera had not yet been perfected. March is an ebullient, happy Dr. Jekyll and a sinister, evil Hyde. He won an Oscar for his performance. Contrast that to Spencer Tracy, who, when Somerset Maugham visited the set of the '40s film asked, "Who is he now? Jekyll or Hyde?" It really had to do with the fact that Tracy did not use much makeup for Hyde, depending rather on a change in lighting; also, the film itself is less stylized."Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" did not capture the London atmosphere of the 1941 movie, nor the eroticism, but it has an atmosphere of its own, with Jekyll's large house and chaotic laboratory, and an overt sexiness that the censors ultimately would crush. A real must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scientist cleaves good and evil into two characters, both himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frederic March is Jekyll (the English say it with a long ?e) and the debased Hyde, the two split asunder by impious science. Jekyll is his own good angel, in the sense that he is naturally charitable and loving, and Hyde is the darker side, the cruel animal impulse latent within. While Jekyll is a perfect gentleman, with a finely-chiseled face, good clothes, and excellent manners, Hyde is a simian monster, exulting in doing what Jekyll would never do. He's vulgar, ill-spoken, and cruel for the pleasure of it. The transformation of one into the other is well-done, though the Hyde make-up is a bit disappointing. Hyde looks like a cross between a movie ape, a Neanderthal, and Jerry Lewis wearing a set of bad teeth, and while March inhabits Hyde, he pants and grimaces, his mouth never at rest. The best thing in the movie is Champagne Ivy (Miriam Hopkins), a girl who's no better than she should be. Hopkins has twinkly eyes and a sauciness about her so that she seems mischievous as she's being naughty, not degraded. The photography is very good, especially the use of low camera angles and some expressionistic shadows. The story itself is painfully trite, borrowed by Robert Louis Stevenson from Mary Shelley?the man of science who presumes to play god, punished by his own creation. There's an essential imbalance in the conception as a whole, since Hyde is all bad, and Jekyll is mixed, like the rest of us. After all, it is Jekyll himself who has the hubris to use science to defy human limitations, and Jekyll who returns to the potion again and again. Hyde, it could be argued, is still latent within him, and perhaps the potion only triggers the reorientation-transformation--and this would explain why transformations occur without the potion. As both Jekyll and his stick-figure colleague say, Hyde *is* Jekyll, and when Hyde dies, as he must because he has killed the sparkly Ivy, so Jekyll too must die. Still, it's a classic, well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde on the same day that I watched a Chinese war movie called Musa the Warrior. When I was watching that, I watch a man in full view pull a spear out of his stomach as blood came out. The camera was relentless, it showed everything, leaving me and my ignorant self to wonder how they pulled off that cinematic trick. Then I watched Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde starring Frederic March (who looks so much different than he does 15 years later in Best Years of Our Lives). As I watched the frequent transitions into Mr. Hyde and the looking-dead-into the mirror, I again found myself wondering how they did it. This movie, an original, never equalled horror masterpiece made in the same year as Dracula and Frankenstein (the same can be said about both of them), is full of cinematic wonders. It starts off captivating you, as it shows you everthing from the point of view of Jekyll for the first five minutes, including looking into a mirror. Then there are the transformations into the beast, which were remarkable for that time in history. It's true that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde does not reach the chill factors that Frankenstein and Dracula do, but this is a sad movie full of sad themes. It's true that, as one poster said, Mr. Hyde looks like a cross between King Kong and Jerry Lewis, almost uncannily. And it is also true that the dialogue is overdone and talky. But Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a marvel because of its performances and for its cinematography. It films things and uses methods that just weren't used often back then. This might have been an excellent silent movie with its camera work and without its dialogue (oh sweet! i love you, my sweet, sweet love!). Yes, as a silent movie it might have been perfect. As a talking picture, it's a sweet sweet love.My grade: 8/10</fullReview>

Miriam Hopkins's performance is equally impressive, providing sympathy for a character she didn't want to play, and her 'strip' scene is as erotic as could possibly have been done in those days. The directing and pacing may seem 'primitive' to today's audience, but I prefer the 'staged' action of the '30's to the slickness of the '40's and '50's, or the hyper- emotional style of the more recent horror revivals. -coy_dog0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the many movies made of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde based on the novel by Robert Louis Stevenson, this 1931 version is the best I have ever seen. It is sometimes referred to as being made in 1932 but actually opened on New Years Eve 1931. You know you have the right one if it stars Fredric March, Miriam Hopkins, and Rose Hobart. This horror classic should rank as an equal to the better known Frankenstein and Dracula movies also made in 1931. The special effects are great, as are other innovative photographic techniques that were used. They are impressive even today. Symbolism is used a lot throughout the movie both in word and photography. The acting is excellent and the characters they portray extremely interesting. For it's time this must have been considered cutting edge. I was lucky enough to get a DVD which included a special feature of commentary by film historian Greg Mank, a looney tunes cartoon, Hyde and Hare, and the 1941 version on the other side. It was one of my better movie purchases. The 1931 version is exceptional, a must see for any lover of classic horror films. This is a true classic, don't miss it. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone mentioned in a previous review that in this movie Mr. Hyde resembles Jerry Lewis. I noticed this myself when I viewed it tonight and I had not yet read that review. What strikes me is that, in Jerry Lewis's THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, the make-up for the professor before he transforms into Buddy Love is quite similar to Frederic March's Hyde make-up. The teeth stick out, the shoulders slope and a basic untidiness is the order of the day. The story for both movies is the same. A gentle intellectual becomes a sexual predator. But, in the Jerry Lewis version, the nice guy is ugly and the bad guy looks good. Jerry Lewis did his homework. The French, who love movies, probably noticed his tribute to the Frederic March DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE. The videotape I rented (of DR. JEKYLL AND MR HYDE) mentions on the back that seventeen minutes which had been censored have been restored. I wonder if these seventeen minutes were censored before the original release. I hope not, because audiences would have been cheated of pretty good drama. Miriam Hopkins as the luckless prostitute who encounters the nutty professor--Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde--really conveys her horror in a way rarely seen on screen again until the sixties. This was made shortly before the Hays Office came along and made reality a dirty word. It's fun watching Frederic March leap around his laboratory and freak out in Hyde(!) Park. He's a lot like the Loony Tunes caricature. If you're used to thinking of March as the eternal middle-aged business man, watch him in this. He looks impossibly young; improbably handsome and, after a dose or two, seriously unpleasant. He got the Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good and Evil in All of Us!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", adapted from the story by Robert Louis Stevenson, has been filmed many times. This version directed by the legendary Reuben Mamoulian, is considered by many to be the best of the lot. The story centers on a successful high society doctor, Henry Jekyll (Fredric March) who seemingly has it all...a successful practice, money, fame and an engagement to Muriel Carew (Rose Hobart) the daughter of retired Brigadier General Carew (Halliwell Hobbes). Jekyll also tends to the poor and preaches his theory of man's two sides..good and evil to all who will listen. One night Jekyll and his friend Dr. Lanyon (Holmes Herbert) come to the rescue of Ivy Pearson (Miriam Hopkins) who is being beaten by an "unsatisfied customer". Jekyll tends to her wounds in a very sexy pre-production code scene and then leaves with her invitation to return. Later, frustrated by General Carew's refusal to move up his wedding date to Muriel, and their taking of a trip abroad, Jekyll throws himself into his work. He continues to explore his two personality theory and develops a potion which he takes. What emerges, in a marvelous transformation sequence, is a hideous monster of a man which he dubs Mr. Hyde. Hyde remembers the lovely Ivy and seeks her out. He forces his intentions upon her, and virtually imprisons her in her own flat. When his fiance returns and her father agrees to an early marriage, Jekyll promises himself not to take the secret potion again. He even sends money to Ivy to atone for Mr. Hyde's brutality. Unfortunately, he reverts to Hyde once again and goes to Ivy's flat and murders her. He then realizes that he cannot ever return to normal and breaks his engagement to Muriel. After leaving Muriel in tears he reverts to Hyde once more and attacks her. Fortunately Dr. Lanyon and the police come to her rescue. Fredric March is simply outstanding in the titles roles. He deservedly won an Academy Award for his riveting performance. The transformation sequences and makeups for Mr, Hyde hold up very well even after all of these years. Miriam Hopkins is very good as Ivy, the girl from the wrong side of the tracks. She is very sexy and at the same time evokes audience pity as the love prisoner of the brutal Hyde. Rose Hobart is also good as the virginal Muriel. Edgar Norton also appears as Jekyll's man servant Poole. When MGM was re-making this story in 1941, they bought up the 1932 version from Paramount and kept it out of circulation for many, many years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The better film version of the tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over seventy years have passed since the initial release of this film, but the Fredric Marsh version remains the best depiction of this oft-told tale. Academy Awards are rarely given to actors for performances in horror films. Fredric Marsh won an Oscar for his performance in this film, and deservedly so. However, Oscar probably found itself in March's hands more easily than expected because, unlike the other classic horror films of period, this film is less a monster movie than a universal examination of the human heart.The average movie-goer doesn't have to worry too much about tampering in God's domain by bringing a corpse back to life or have to worry about someone trying to drive a stake into their heart, but who hasn't found themselves trying to conform their lusts or desires to socially- accepted norms. This film is blatantly sexual for a film of its time in its motivations. Jekyll is engaged to be married to a proper young woman played by Rose Hubert. His fervent but healthy sexual desire is thwarted by the woman's father who demands requires a long engagement. Too much of a gentlemen to compromise his fiancee, Jekyll is pushed over the edge when he meets a seductive prostitute named Ivy, Miriam Hopkins. He then decides to test his drug which will split him into two individuals, one good enough for his fiancee, one bold enough to indulge his unbridled lusts. Unfortunately, his dark personality, Mr. Hyde, isn't easy put away once released.Director Rouben Mamoulian deserves considerable credit for the film's success. His direction, while not quite as showy as James Whale's direction on the Frankenstein films, is both effective and inventive. His use of subjective camera foreshadowed John Carpenter's steadicam killer in "Halloween" by forty-seven years. His use of filters to create the first transformation is nothing short of amazing. Too bad he didn't work more in the genre.A must see in the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one pleasantly surprised me. I was duly impressed by the special effects and camera techniques Rouben Mamoulian used. The shadows and symbolism were ominous without being too hokey as they are in many of the older films. And the sexual connotations were amazing considering the time it was made and released. Horror films are not my favorite genre, and I have avoided watching this for years because frankly the story seems so well known after all those years of watching the Looney Tunes parodies of Jekyll and Hyde. But Fredric March was good in the role, and Rouben Mamoulian was a master director behind the camera. Two thumbs up, one for Jekyll and one for Hyde.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spencer Tracy's version was much better. You even liked Tracy's character and felt a bit sorry for him. Here, you don't really care about anyone - except for Champagne Ivy, that is, the classic Dickensian-type victim of poverty and underclass female vulnerabilities, played to the hilt by a ravishing Miriam Hopkins. I am a huge Frederic March fan but this movie was a huge disappointment to me. It must have been the times, the fact that talking pictures were still relatively new and special effects relatively new (in 1931), that this movie was considered so great in its time. And for March to have won for best actor (actually, tied with Wallace Beery, for Beery's role in the Champ), really boggles my mind. Maybe it's just me. I don't think this film aged well nor do I find the acting all that good - including March's, which I found stilted. Even his transformation scenes failed to move me. Even more important: I also question whether Mr. Hyde was Frederic March (and I know this suggestion is akin to heresy). Listen to Hyde's accent. Look at his nasal features and the shape of his face. I almost thought Hyde might have been played by Humphrey Bogart (which is not likely) but there's a peculiar and unique accent tinged with a British affectation and a vocal quality that I do not believe is March's and I believe it provides a huge clue as to there having been a different actor playing that role. Even the acting quality seems to take a nose dive when Hyde is in the picture (in other words, I believe March would have done a better job in that role). Mr. Hyde was also incredibly agile - like a monkey, or, more to the point, like a circus performer or Olympic-class athlete. His jumping about was - in my estimation - highly unlikely the actions of a Frederic March who (unlike Cary Grant, for instance) did not have an athletic background of this kind nor did he display anything like this kind of agility or talent in other films. This was, actually, my first question after seeing the film: just who played Mr. Hyde? (Did anyone else question this?) I tell you, it was not March. Miriam Hopkins is the only one in this film, for my money, whose performance was of an Oscar-type level. She was incredibly endearing and she came across with a realism I felt was lacking in the others' performances. There was too much "gee whiz" acting in my opinion, stylized horror movie posing, for this movie to be taken too seriously. March was very young here so I excuse his stilted acting on his relative lack of experience because in every other film I've seen him in, he was absolutely top-rate and brilliant. But I am sure my opinion is in the minority here, so see the film and judge for yourself. Clearly it's a milestone picture in Hollywood and should be seen, in that context.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and enjoyable but flawed version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attempting to finalize an experimental potion, a man's ingestion of the formula releases a monstrous personality that clashes violently with the society he lives in and those around him, forcing them to deal with the changes once and for all.This one was a fairly enjoyable if slightly flawed take on the story. One of the main problems to this one is the fact that the film's style of errant behavior on Hyde's part is to simply act like a raving jerk and simply browbeat anyone around him which is a product of the time period but simply doesn't make for any kind of interesting features nor make him someone we should fear at any cost. This is also due to the high number of scenes were he goes off on long-winded rants that just don't go anywhere beyond chewing up time and throwing the girl into a needless round of hysterics at the sight of the raving lunatic. Beyond this, there's a lot to like here, mainly in a far more worthwhile pace which makes this a lot more interesting than expected, a series of innovative ideas that allow this one some pretty enjoyable moments that are quite ahead of it's time and of course the astounding make-up job that looks quite shocking and terrifying during the first transformation and loses a little bit of it's power on subsequent views. Overall, it's certainly not the best version but is clearly enjoyable enough.Today's Rating-Unrated/PG: Violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stevenson published this story of a respected doctor who discovers an elixir that releases his evil self in 1886, at the height of the Victorian era in England. I don't know that anything could have been more expressive of the prevailing attitudes towards good and bad. As the thirty-year-old Sigmund Freud was discovering in Vienna, we repress our bad selves, our animal impulses, push them out of consciousness. There should be nothing around to even remind us of their existence. Furniture legs were covered with little skirts. The breasts and thighs of chickens became "white meat" and "dark meat." Lewis Carroll, the Oxford Don, couldn't possibly have known that his interest in little girls, for one of whom he wrote "Alice in Wonderland" and others of which he photographed in the nude, had had any prurient content.Stevenson realized this intuitively and that's basically what the story is about. Frederick March is Jeykll/Hyde. He's quite good as both. Jeykll, it's true, is a bit of a bore. He treats the harlot, Miriam Hopkins, when she has a bruise on her thigh, and she taunts him by slowly undressing in front of him and trying to pull him down onto the bed to kiss him. He laughs it off and leaves, the fool. When he discovers the potion that changes him into Hyde, he returns and sets her up in a private apartment for a while before killing her.March's Mr. Hyde is a different kettle of fish. Where his Dr. Jeykll is boring and repressed, his Mr. Hyde looks simian, sneers and shouts outrageously, and leaps around like an acrobat. It's as if March had loosed his repressed tendency to overact. And Hyde really IS repulsive, but the story is such that we never forget it's Jeykll who suffers the guilty hangovers and who pays the final penalty.There's some queer stuff going on in the photography of Karl Struss, the editing of William Shea, and the direction of Rouben Mamoulian too. Unusual use of first-person camera work, but an early version. It's as if we're looking through a telescope at what the character sees. Diagonal wipes, sometimes pausing in mid swipe, so that the image on the screen is split in two. An odd, high-angle shot through a candelabra of a woman sobbing. No particular point to these tricks. Mamoulian seems to be playing with the camera. More effective in adding to the drama is a shot of crisp shadows on a slum wall, the police running in pursuit of Hyde, reminiscent of a scene in "The Third Man." I don't remember the novel too well. I remember that Hyde knocks down a child with his cane, but does he really strangle his paramour? In any case, if it's not a masterpiece of cinema -- it borrows its effects from previous monster movies -- it's an interesting movie in its own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The three great classics of horror literature were released as films in 1931, Dracula, which came out as dull and deathlike, Frankenstein, which came off as well done, and Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, which came off as perhaps the best of the three.The story is known in popular culture. A scientist named Dr. Henry Jeckyll who is living in Victorian London, creates a formula that allows the evil side of his soul to take control of his body. This alternative self whom Jeckyll dubs 'Hyde' causes massive chaos before being killed.Since this movie was pre code, it features scenes that just a few years later would have been condemned as obscene. Particularly Hyde's brutal treatment of a girl, and his violently beating a man to death. It is quite shocking by the standards of the day! The script, acting, and direction are genius. In particular Frederick March's portrayal of Jeckyll/Hyde. Hyde is portrayed as a reversion back on the evolutionary scale, with an Ape like appearance. His behavior is not portrayed as evil, but rather, an embodiment of all the instincts and negative impulses lurking within us, really quite genius for the time, and March's portrayal brings that to life with a menacing, but natural performance when Hyde.His portrayal of the Jeckyll half, is also impressive. He brings the tortured, tragic man to life perfectly, but this is far overshadowed by the Hyde part.The direction is brilliant. Under a different director, the film could have turned out as just another horror like Dracula, but this director chooses to take a philosophical take on the story.The sets, particularly Jeckyll's laboratory set, are very well dome, as are the costumes, they do well in taking you back to the era. This may also be the first usage in horror movies of the famous organ piece often associated with Phantom of the Opera and horror stuff in general(most people probably know what I mean). it appears in the opening credits. The rest of the film doesn't have a soundtrack, which was the rule of the time rather than the exception, though there are several times in which Jeckyll plays a piano.However, I don't feel I've praised March as Hyde enough. He enjoys the suffering of others which brings us to the instinct to dominate others. His violent behavior can also be tied to that. March is just so great in portraying the negative impulses that I had to mention him again.So if you want a great movie from the era, check this out. It is much better than the others that year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stevenson, Richard Mansfield, the Autumn of 1888, and Frederic March</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three things of note happened with the Academy Awards in 1931 that were unique. For the first time in it's history the best picture of the year was a western, CIMMERON (which, though dated by today's standards, cemented the stardom of Richard Dix and Irene Dunne). For years CIMMERON would be the only western to win the best picture award (despite films like STAGECOACH, FORT APACHE, RED RIVER, SHANE, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID coming along). Then in 1992 THE UNFORGIVEN won the best picture award too, so now it looks like western may be allowable to compete more often. But science fiction is another matter. For in 1931 (for the only time in Oscar's history) an Oscar was awarded for a performance in a science fiction role for best actor. It went to Fredric March, that consummate actor, for Dr. Henry Jekyll/Mr.Edward Hyde. Perhaps because that year was the first time a category had two tied winners (the third unique event) March's performance remains the only science fiction performance to win - he tied with Wallace Beery for the latter's end of the road pugilist in THE CHAMP. This may explain why Boris Karloff was overlooked for Frankenstein, Imhotep (the Mummy), and Grey the coachman (THE BODY SNATCHER) in later years.Even today people try to differentiate between March's character and say Bela Lugosi's Dracula or Lon Chaney's Wolf Man. Yet it is a science fiction situation: Henry Jekyll does separate his personality with chemicals into good and bad components - just as Griffin (Claude Rains) separates his body from visibility with chemicals in THE INVISIBLE MAN. There is some snobbery here - Stevenson is not quite the same author as Mrs. Shelley, Bram Stoker, or even H.G. Wells. This is nonsense - all these writers worked hard at their craft, which is why they are still read (although Stoker's prose is frequently laughable). Be it as it may, no other science fiction figure has won an actor an Oscar (including Spencer Tracy for his performance as Jekyll and Hyde) since 1931.Stevenson later said that his idea came from the story of Deacon William Brodie, an Edinburgh carpenter and city official who was discovered to be a successful burglar and hanged in 1788. He had a nightmare about this situation, and turned it into the novella THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JECKYLL AND MR. HYDE.The original story is basically about how the unleashing of unfettered evil cannot be controlled or restored to normal no matter how hard one tries. In it, Hyde is responsible for severely (and unconcernedly) injuring a child, and for murdering a member of Parliament named Carew. Eventually he also causes the death of a friend of Jekyll's, who learns the secret to his own cost. But when Stevenson's story was turned into a successful stage play for actor Richard Mansfield (in 1887-88), the murder of an unfortunate "barmaid" (Ivy) was added, as was a marriage being planned for Jekyll and Carew's daughter (which leads to the murder of Carew). Mansfield was one of the great actors of his day, and with a minimum of make-up (and special lighting tricks) managed to change from the proper Jekyll to the evil Hyde every night before his audience.Possibly one person who saw the play in London was influenced by it that year of 1888. We shall never know now. The similarities in barbaric, carefree evil between Edward Hyde in the novella and play, and Jack the Ripper was very evident so a connection of influence is possible. It certainly adds to the story's continued fascination.March was made to look rather simian in his "Hyde" make-up. Sort of like the drugs he used made Hyde a throw-back to an earlier, ape-like creature (in the story Hyde looks younger than Jekyll, which is why he is not recognized by his acquaintances). His creature of evil is quite a violent type (see him jumping up and down when fighting, and enjoying it). It is not as subtly evil as Spencer Tracy's cat-and-mouse Hyde of ten years later (which, I must admit, I think is superior). Still, March holds one's attention throughout the film.Miriam Hopkins similarly shows a forward sexiness and a frailty as the doomed, unhappy Ivy. Witness how she is forced to sing the jaunty "Champaign Ivy is my name" tune (based on a popular song, "Champaign Charlie") into a nervous number when Hyde demands she sing it for him. The other performances are capable ones but not as good as the two leads. Mamoulian's direction is strong, although he does not stick to his "I am a camera" approach after the first twenty minutes of the film. All in all, it is worth a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting adaptation to Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This adaptation of the novel Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is quite interesting if you have read the book. The main differences between the novel and the movie are that the movie removes the novels narrator, Mr. Utterson. The movie also adds a female love interest for both Jekyll and Hyde which are not seen in the book. This is done for Hollywood's need for a love story. The ending of the movie is different then that off the movie but this only brings a different feeling of closure at the end. Over all this is a relatively good adaptation of a novel to a book and is a relatively good movie over all. I personally still enjoyed reading the novel cause it provides more of a sense of involvement in the story.</fullReview>

When Rouben Mamoulian was casting the film the greatest challenge was to find someone for the title role(s). Someone suggested Irving Pichel who had just been in the Paramount thriller MURDER BY THE CLOCK (try finding someone who has seen THAT one!). Rouben is alleged to have replied: "Good God no! I need someone who can play Jekyll and Hyde and Pichel could only play Hyde!" Of course Irving did go on to do many other things, including a supporting role in DeMille's CLEOPATRA (1934) and directing DESTINATION MOON (1951). Film critic Alexander Woolcott once quipped "Irving is rolling in dough making motion Pichels."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very entertaining horror film with some haunting bits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a great deal of sexual content. Not in the form of nudity or people moaning at one another, but it is definitely there; the swinging leg super imposed over certain scenes, the boiling pots and sexual frustration in the laboratory. When the lid shoots off the pot we all know what that symbolizes. Oh, my! Ivy is a woman and a clingy wrapping vine. This film was made before the sexual openness of the 1920?s had turned into the innocent 30?s. Oh ya, before the Hayes code. This is a pretty good movie. It takes the usual liberties in doing a film adaptation of a book, so don?t expect the exact same plot. The film is entertaining. The Jekyll/Hyde transformations are disturbing. At the same time there is so deeper artistic stuff, like the repeated references to bird. Basically it?s entertaining and analyzable, which is not terribly common. I recommend this film. It is one of the two film versions with sound and both are black and white, so if you are interested in watching an adaptation of Jekyll and Hyde, this is a good choice. Also you get the pre Hayes code violence and sexuality. Whoopee.</fullReview>

As Hyde, March resembles a monkey in appearance and a gorilla or ape in personality. As Jekyll, he resembles a dozen or so other actors from the early days of "talking pictures": a little stiff at times, and wearing too much mascara. All in all, he's believable enough, but the only truly exciting moments occur toward the end. The beast within is finally visible without a swig of his little old potion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good as a film, but not a good adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really understand the very good ratings for this film. Of course, as a film, it was quite good. The actor playing Jekyll was gorgeous and had a lot of charisma, the special effects were good for the time, and there were some interesting shots. Overall it was classy. However, I really loved the book and I am bitterly disappointed by this adaptation. I am not the kind of person who trashes a film adaptation just because they made a few changes to the book, because I think they can be necessary, but I don't like it when they make changes that alter completely the essence of the story. I hate the fact that they had to include so many women, and that in short, the whole film seems to imply Jekyll's main motivation was lust : his "fall" is partly provoked by the fact that he can't marry quickly and have sex with his bride, and when he becomes Hyde, the only thing he seems to be interested in is raping this poor woman. I also hated the way they changed the ending, I thought it was completely unnecessary and took away all the subtlety out of it.What I find really puzzling, is the fact that people always seem to trash recent film adaptations of literary masterpieces, supposedly because they betray the story by altering the original material. And yet, the more I look at older adaptations, the more I realize that usually they are a lot more unfaithful than the recent ones. They often change the plots completely and most of the time it truly alters the essence of the story. Still, these films are held in high esteem, and no one seems to notice that the flaws they denounce in new films are even more present in the old ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fittingly for a movie about a man who switches between personalities, 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' is a film that plays on two distinct levels: it's by turns riveting and dull. It's a well made movie, innovative at times, atmospheric and crackling with eroticism in some scenes; but it's also sporadically boring, full of melodramatic dialogue and the story doesn't stay compelling the whole way through. Frederic March is Dr. Jekyll, a scientist who discovers a formula that splits his personality in two, bundling his primal self into a new persona: Mr. Hyde, a devilish monster through which he can live out his darker desires. Although Jekyll is engaged to Muriel (Rose Hobart) and very much in love, Hyde is besotted with good time girl Ivy (Miriam Hopkins) and proceeds to force her into a relationship. Realising that he is damaging both his and Ivy's lives, Jekyll decides never to take the potion again ? but finds that Hyde has becomes too powerful to sweep under the carpet.There are many surprises in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the first being that the characters pronounce the doctor's name as Gee-kull, which sounds strange (and rubbish). What's also unexpected is how sexual the film is: we catch a glimpse of Ivy's breast as she sits up in bed, Hyde later kisses her on the chest, Dr. Jekyll is the horniest scientist in the history of cinema, there's the lingering shot of Ivy's leg swinging back and forth, and ? pretty strong stuff for 1932 ? disturbing references to mental and physical abuse, and even the suggestion of rape. The emotions on display are raw and dark; surprisingly so.March lives up to all that with a strong performance as Hyde. His Jekyll is a bit wet and not very interesting (which is the point) but despite the Tim Nice-But-Dim facial mannerisms, Hyde emerges as a thoroughly disgusting man. March's transformation is convincing: it's hard to believe the same actor is playing both characters, and he has real grace as he leaps about and darts through the streets. The Hyde effects, using different colour filters to show up different layers of make-up, are extraordinary. In one unbroken shot, Jekyll's eyes, lips and skin change colour, which still looks fantastic even now. The later stages of the transformation ? using pretty obvious cuts and dissolves ? don't work as well, My favourite bit in the movie is when Jekyll changes into Hyde outside Muriel's window, and we see only the silhouette of his body growing taller.The movie is cleverly directed by Rouben Mammoulian, who uses split screen effects, wipes and POVs to produce a movie that, in many ways, was ahead of its time. The camera-work, for instance, is surprisingly fluid and certainly makes for a far more visually interesting movie than most of the creaky horrors that were doing the rounds at the time. For all that, though, the movie is still rather dull. The scene with Jekyll begging Muriel's father to let them marry is tiresomely repeated way past the time when the point's been made, the pace is a bit slow and the slushy, sickening declarations of love between Jekyll and Muriel wear out their welcome after about ten seconds. In fact, do they actually talk about anything else? Less Muriel and more Hyde, that's what this movie needed.</fullReview>

Author Robert Louis Stevenson's scientist believes there is a natural good and bad side to every man and thus a whacked experiment ensues. Something goes awry though and horrendous crimes take place as March unwittingly creates a dangerous alter ego. Basically a poor man's "Phantom of the Opera" (the 1925 version) or "Frankenstein" (the 1931 version) that would almost work as well as a solo act as March gobbles up the scenery with dual over-the-top roles that carry the production as far as it can go and rescues the whole thing from 1930s obscurity. On a side-note, March actually tied with Wallace Beery ("The Champ") for the 1932 Best Actor Oscar. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I hate to admit that, at 43 years old, I've never read the book "Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde" and only know the most rudimentary details of this story, the bare minimum, namely that Jekyll and Hyde were the same person, with Jekyll being good and Hyde being bad. Beyond that I knew nothing.That being said, I can't compare this movie to the original book. I'd imagine somewhere between some to all of the original elements from the book are in the movie, but I have no clue. The only similar comparison I can make is Frankenstein, as I've read both the book and the movie. The book and movie were only barely similar. Not sure if that's the case with J&amp;H or not. Not sure if it matters, as this movie knocked me on my butt and left quite an impact! I also went into this movie *not* expecting to be horrified. Again, comparing the only other horror genre movies of the era that I've seen (Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein), I expected the "horror" to be tame enough by today's standards so as not to shock me. Was I ever wrong! I was intrigued with the movie from nearly the start (although the first 5 minutes of the movie were somewhat irritating, with the conceit of the movie being shot from Jekyll's viewpoint -- we only see him when he looks in a mirror). Luckily, the movie dispensed with this nonsense after 5 minutes, and I was able to settle in and watch the movie. (I have no idea what the director or photographer were trying to achieve with that effect!) I was fascinated by the premise of the movie (not a new philosophical viewpoint), that people are comprised of two souls, one good and one evil, and willingly went along with the story that Dr Jekyll found the right chemical composition to bring out his evil self. I found the story extremely riveting and repulsive all at the same time. The way Hyde treated Ivy was beyond disgusting. It was pure evil.At this point, I'd like to stop and say that the portrayals by both Frederic March (Jekyll/Hyde) and Miriam Hopkins (Ivy) were fantastic. When Ivy came to Jekyll to return the 50 pounds he sent to her, and she broke down and begged him to help her, falling to the floor, clinging at his legs, saying she'd be his slave if he wanted just as long as he helped her, I was stunned to find myself sobbing uncontrollably and being truly afraid and frightened for her. What a powerful scene! Jekyll promises Ivy that Hyde will bother her no more. Jekyll thinks he's in control, and I was praying to God that he was, but also trembling with fear that he wasn't. When Jekyll spontaneously (without aid of the usual chemical concoction) turns into Hyde, I felt sick to my stomach. When he burst in on Ivy, well .... it was all quite horrible and frightening.The special effects of Jekyll turning into Hyde and back to Jekyll again were extremely weak, but did not detract from the movie. After all, this was 3/4 of a century ago -- special effects were quite simplistic, to say the least.The acting of Jekyll's fiancé, played by Rose Hobart, was wooden and unbelievable. The words themselves that were written for her to say would have been much more moving had an actress with actual talent uttered them.Hobart's bad acting and the occasional cinematographic conceits (the Jekyll viewpoint, the amateurish swipes and double screens) aside, this movie is amazingly powerful and truly a "horror" film 74 years after its making. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had always seen spoofs of the story, with characters like Bugs Bunny, Tweety Pie, and Tom and Jerry, but I had never seen the real story, which I didn't know was written by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. I knew of the basic plot of a man turning himself into a monster with the formula, but he did have an interesting reason to it. Basically Dr. Henry L. Jekyll (Oscar winning Fredric March, but for some reason his Oscar tied with Wallace Beery for The Champ) gives talks about separating the good and bad of people with experimentation, his partner obviously thinks it is crazy. Also, he has really strong love for Ivy Pearson (Miriam Hopkins) who has been engaged to for too long, he keeps insisting to marry before the date Brig. Gen. Danvers Carew (Halliwell Hobbes) has given, his own anniversary. Anyway, Jekyll invents the nasty formula, and it turns him into an ugly evil man, and he calls himself Mr. Hyde (also March, in camp make up). The one thing Hyde will not walk away from is the girl that Jekyll met one day, a prostitute, Muriel Carew (Rose Hobart) who he could have had a fling with. It has good make up, simple dialogue, creepy moments, murder, transformation and an almost deserving death ending. Also starring Holmes Herbert as Dr. Lanyon and Edgar Norton as Poole. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Adaption. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failed adaptation of the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rouben Mamoulian's, Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde film was interesting to watch since it seem like a very Hollywood adaptation, yet there was something missing. Mystery, betrayal and fear were the missing areas from the film. There is no secrecy in that most of the times films adapted from books have missing and added areas to make it more appealing to a broader audience. The film was good in that it added two female characters in the development of the plot that brought excitement and a feel of sexuality and had a younger an attractive Jekyll. The film is not an appropriate adaptation of the novel because it fails to maintain the elements of secrecy and betrayal that make the plot further attractive and interesting. The novel had those elements that made it entertaining and fulfilling and kept a constant feel of mystery and fear until the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dr Jeekyll</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not having read the book but the plot line, I wish any future remake would follow that plot line closely. The use of subjective and tricky camera shots seem to have no purpose, and the plot turns boring after a while. This film could have been made in 70-75 minutes, like any Universal monster movie of the period. There are also too many on screen transformations for my taste, one should have been enough. Mr Hyde's make up, particularly his teeth, is way over the top. As it is, the film is interesting in patches but I do not believe it is a matter of not aging well, it is simply overall not very well constructed. On the other hand, the art direction is excellent, with a nice reconstruction of London, and the laboratory, and March's performance is so good you believe another actor is playing Mr. Hyde. I also noticed some scenes that were hard for me to believe were done by March himself, which now I've found out were of course done by a stunt man. And yes, it's Dr. Jeekyll, I say!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>March is good but the film is dated and not as effective as the Tracy version a decade later. I am also afraid that the monster, Hyde, looks far too much like the later slapstick Jerry Lewis to cause anything but laughter, not fear, in more modern viewers. An uncanny resemblance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the most notable of the hand full of versions of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic. Dr. Henry Jekyll(Fredric March)consumes a concoction that transforms him into the crazed and sadistic Mr. Hyde. The difference and sameness between good and evil is blatant, creepy and feverish. March is outstanding in his Oscar-winning dual role.Also starring in this horror masterpiece are Miriam Hopkins, Holmes Herbert and Rose Hobart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We can control our actions, but not our impulses"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The early 1930s were truly the golden age of the horror movie. The scream flicks of this period were not the scariest or the biggest budgeted, but the era was unique and special in that the monster, the object of terror was almost always the star. The box office pull and familiarity of Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff was far more significant than that of Vincent Price or Christopher Lee a few decades later, and they never had to cede top billing to some dashing male lead or beautiful heroine. Frederic March was not a horror star, but as Jekyll and Hyde landed the first Academy Award for a performance in a horror, in the kind of role that it would later become unthinkable to honour in this way.This was a very transitional time for acting, particularly with regard to male leads. The couple of Best Actor winners before this (George Arliss and Lionel Barrymore) had been of the room-filling theatrical style that dominated the early talkies, beating the more reserved and naturalistic style that was slowly evolving. The fifth Academy Awards were the turning point, when Wallace Beery's warmly human turn in The Champ tied with Fredric March's gleeful scenery-chomping in this picture. Although I prefer Beery, I can see why March was equally lauded. While his Jekyll is nothing special, competent but still a little too hammy for a straight role, his Hyde is utterly engaging and watchable. He differs from the John Barrymore (1920) and Spencer Tracy (1941) interpretations in that he is not only animalistic but slightly childlike in his manner. Importantly, he is transformed enough not just through the make-up but in voice and mannerisms to make him genuinely appear as a completely different person. March as Hyde also adds the one genuine note of creepiness to a production that is short on atmosphere.This adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's novella makes several sweeping changes. The twin love interests of Ivy and Muriel were an invention for this version, but a more significant difference is in how the story is revealed. In the book, the tale is told through the eyes of the lawyer Utterson, who sees his friend Jekyll apparently harassed and blackmailed by the villainous Hyde, and we do not discover that they are one and the same until the final chapter. Perhaps because the concept of Jekyll's transformation was fairly well known by this point, the film relegates Utterson to a minor character, and instead follows Jekyll on his journey of scientific discovery and his struggle to control his alter-ego. Hence we lose the sense of mystery that was a great asset to the novella, but we gain a deep and disturbing insight into the process.Producer-director Rouben Mamoulian's aim seems to be to totally immerse us in the experience of Jekyll and Hyde, and thus employs some of the most extended and elaborate point-of-view shots ever committed to celluloid. This is a somewhat hit-and-miss tactic. It makes the first transformation scene truly exhilarating, but other times it just looks odd, particularly in the opening scenes, where it quickly turns into a distracting gimmick. This is the young Mamoulian all over. He paid absolutely no attention to the established rules of film grammar, had no sense of subtlety, and seems to have assumed that the more obvious and complex the technique, the more effective it must be. He sometimes has good ideas ? for example drawing our attention to the skeleton shortly before Jekyll downs the potion for the first time, but he has to do so heavy-handedly with a whip-pan. Perhaps worst of all are those annoying split-screen moments, one of which actually distracts from one of the nicest touches in March's performance ? his breaking in and out a run after his transformation in the park.Also, in spite of March's success, Mamoulian was generally a poor director of actors, one of the few coaches who appears to have encouraged excessive hamming. Miriam Cooper is mediocre, which was about the most she ever was, and everyone else is bad to the point of cringeworthy. However Mamoulian did hire the best when it came to technical crew. The cinematography of Karl Struss brings out the dinginess of the slums, while we can thank renowned production designer Hans Dreier for the bright idea of making Jekyll's lab a careful blend of scientific paraphernalia and Gothic architecture.Perhaps the biggest problem with this version of Jekyll and Hyde is that, unlike the classics being produced at Universal, it simply doesn't have the horror genre running through its veins. Prestigious, highbrow Paramount just didn't seem to get the camp creepiness of its smaller rival. And yet, it is true to the 30s horror form, for ugly and despicable as Hyde is, he (not Jekyll) is unquestionably the hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Adaptation Of The Story While Not Without Some Weaknesses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone knows the basics of the story (who doesn't know the story of Jekyll and Hyde) so any movie adaptation has to do more than tell the story - it has to draw the viewer in with a fresh or unexpected approach and it has to have good performances. This classic version of the story (the first "talkie" version of it) is a marvellous piece of work on both counts. The story here is crisp and moves along at a good pace, and director George Mamoulian uses a number of techniques (some more successful than others - I like the use of shadows, but thought the closeups of the actors' eyes did little) to keep the story moving. The story itself was generally exciting and full of very overt sexual innuendo - surprisingly so for 1931, but wholly appropriate - including a very brief (split second, in fact) almost topless look at Miriam Hopkins from the side.The performances here were to me highlighted by Hopkins' outstanding turn as Ivy Pearson as the unfortunate object of Hyde's lust. Frederic March won an Oscar for his performance as Jekyll/Hyde although I thought his performance quite mixed. As Hyde he was brilliant; as Jekyll I thought he came across as forced and artificial (although he does manage to capture Jekyll's angst over his loss of control over Hyde). Rose Hobart's take on Muriel - Jekyll's love interest - was, I thought, quite passionless and therefore lacking and together March and Hobart didn't create too much of a spark. March's Hyde make-up was also a bit over the top. Hyde came across as basically sub-human, looking a bit like a neanderthal or even a werewolf, with fangs and hairy hands included (and I thought a bit of a racist statement was being made when Jekyll's skin noticeably darkened whenever he transformed into Hyde.) To me, these aspects of Hyde detracted a bit from the movie.Still, though, even with some of those criticisms I have to say that this is probably the most enjoyable version of Jekyll &amp; Hyde that I've seen. It's well worth 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar Winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) *** (out of 4) Fredric March won an Oscar for his performance in this talkie version of the classic story. I'll say this at the start but I think March is one of the greatest actors in the history of cinema but I'd also say that I think this is the worst performance from him that I've seen. Even though it's his worst performance there's still some greatness that sneaks in at certain spots. I think March is very good coming off as a very threatening character when he is mentally abusing the Miriam Hopkins character. In pretty much all other times March comes off way too over the top, which leads to more laughs than scares. There are several sequences in the film where March's performance makes me laugh at laugh as if I were watching a comedy. This unevenness makes for a rather strange film that never works fully. I think Hopkins is the real standout here as she gives a wonderful performance as the tortured woman who caught Hyde's eye. The transformation sequences still look good but I think they made Jekyll a tad bit too ugly. Even with all the faults this remains an interesting film but I still prefer the 1913 and 1920 Barrymore versions.</fullReview>

In fact, there was no mirror - he is filmed through an empty frame. Unfortunately, in these "mirror" shots, no-one thought to move his parting over to the other side!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and sexually aware horror film suffers from overacting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern filmgoers catching 1931's `DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE' for the first time, are often astonished that a movie so old could be so sexually frank. The fact is that this relaxed attitude towards sex was commonplace within the film industry at the time. Early sound films quite often included sensual scenes and racy dialogue. Some, like 1934's `TARZAN AND HIS MATE', even contained outright nudity. All this came to an end in the mid-thirties however, with the creation of the `Hays Code', which was in essence a set of moral guidelines and restrictions which all major studios were forced to adhere to. This version of JEKYLL of course predates all this. The reason it is so entertaining is because of this ?sexual awareness' as well as some very inventive direction and camerawork. The film however is not without it faults. It's main drawback, in my opinion (and one that was common in early talkies), is the entire casts tendency (from Fredric March down to the smallest bit player) to overact. Secondly, unlike Spencer Tracy's portrayal of the same character in the 1941 version, there are no gray areas to this Mr. Hyde. He is portrayed by March from the outset as nothing more than a violent Neanderthal and he basically remains one throughout the entire film. The less than subtle ape-like makeup used on the leading man simply heightens this impression. These points aside, this film is I believe still more entertaining and thought provoking than all those slow-moving Universal Studio horror ?classics' of the same period. To this day, even with its faults, it remains arguably the best all around movie version of the classic story. For this reason alone it should be seen.Final Verdict: 7 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece at every level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fredric March was superb and thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar for this, by far the most exciting and cinematic version of the famous story. Miriam Hopkins should have been nominated a well for her excellent portrayal of Ivy Pearson, a London prostitute. Her accent was so good I wouldn't have guessed she was born in Georgia. Rose Hobart was also very good as Jekyll's fiancé and Edgar Norten is outstanding as his butler Poole. There is absolutely nothing at all racist about March's transformation into Mr Hyde, as he was supposed to represent the Neathanderal man. The pace, the brilliant gas lit settings and the transformation scenes are still extremely impressive. This masterpiece shows how much better movies would have been without the Hay's Code. Unfortunately it was followed by a much inferior, long drawn out 1941 remake with a too old Spencer Tracy, a Swedish Cockney played by Ingrid Bergman and a typically bland Lana Turner. Stick with this version.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Can a man dying of thirst forget water? And do you know what would happen to that thirst if it were to be denied water?" This is the second version of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story that I have seen in the last week. The first was John Roberson's 1920 silent version starring John Barrymore. And I intend to follow up with a viewing of Victor Fleming's 1941 version, which I have never seen but is on the same disk as this 1931 take.Dr. Jekyll (Fredric March) is a well to do physician, engaged to be married to Muriel Carew (Rose Hobart), the daughter of a crusty old general (Halliwell Hobbes) who wants them to delay their wedding by several months. This, of course, is frustrating to the young couple in love who want to partake in the benefits of such a union sooner rather than later. But Dr. Jekyll has invented a potion that will separate the baser and more noble parts of one's personality and indeed will physically transform the more noble part into a beast representing the evil side of man-Dr. Hyde (also played by Fredric March). And this side chooses to partake in the more sinful pleasures by visiting, torturing and attempting to enslave a prostitute, Ivy Pearson (Miriam Hopkins). But which side of his nature will conquer in the end, and at what price? Fredric March had a very strong performance in this film as both the benevolent doctor and the sadistic Mr. Hyde. As the latter, he portrayed an atmosphere of "menace" most convincingly. And the transformation sequences from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde, though now a bit dated, really are amazing special effects. March's Hyde relied more on make up than the earlier John Barrymore's Mr. Hyde. I think I prefer Barrymore's performance better, though I like this movie better overall.Miriam Hopkins also gave a grand performance as Ivy, and I am hard pressed to say whose acting I enjoyed more in this one. Her flirting with Dr. Jekyll early in the film and her clear terror of Mr. Hyde as it progressed more than convinced me. I was surprised to see as much sexual innuendo in this movie, though it fit well given the subject matter. This version also showed a surprising amount of skin-though tame by today's standards, it would have been quite racy at the time.Overall, this is a film well worth seeing if simply for Hopkins and March's performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good, evil, and the Looney Tunes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like probably many children born since WWII, learned about "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" through the Looney Tunes cartoons. For example, Sylvester was chasing Tweety, so Tweety hid in a bottle labeled "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". About a minute later, he emerged as an angry, giant, cat-hating killer.So, I finally got to see this movie version of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel. Granted, it was an old-style Hollywood movie, so many things seem kind of outdated, namely some maudlin dialogue. But overall, Frederic March does a good job as the eponymous scientist who accidentally brings out his evil side while studying good and evil tendencies in human nature. The first time that I ever saw the movie, I thought that Mr. Hyde looked like a monkey. Oh well. I guess that if absolutely nothing else, the movie remains a good lesson about where we shouldn't try to venture in scientific studies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting version of the classic tale with some drawbacks...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FREDRIC MARCH won his first Oscar for DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE and it is the kind of showy role that usually results in at least an Oscar nomination. Although he's a fine actor, this was 1931 and even the best screen actors had not yet toned down their performances from either the stage or the silent screen. There are moments when he's clearly over the top, by today's standards, and of course the exaggerated make-up by Wally Westmore (with the aid of special lighting filters) gives March a Simian countenance more suitable for a "Planet of the Apes" type of thing.Still, the actor has to be credited with giving a strong performance, full of athletic leaps as he attempts to get away safely from those trying to trap him. And it certainly helps that he gets strong support from MIRIAM HOPKINS as the cabaret singer who is frightened by his Mr. Hyde personality as well as his gruesome disguise.ROSE HOBART is a strange choice to play the society girl that March is romantically involved with. She's even more bland than Lana Turner was in the MGM version of the '40s, if that is possible. She offers no real passion to the part or charm and his infatuation with her never seems plausible. She would go on to play character roles for the bulk of her career.The mostly British cast does well by the script and the vintage B&amp;W photography simulating London interiors and exteriors is fine.In the Spencer Tracy/Ingrid Bergman/Lana Turner version, Tracy's make-up was never concealing enough--you could always see him beneath the bushy brows and the jagged teeth. It made you wonder why others around him didn't see through to Dr. Jekyll. March has gone to the opposite extreme, and therein lies the weakness in my opinion. He's too much in the other direction.However, having said that, it's a good enough version of the Stevenson story in view of the fact that it's strictly a film of the '30s in style and performance.</fullReview>
