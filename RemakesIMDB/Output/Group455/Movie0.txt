		<shortDescription>Granddaddy of Sound Tarzans Still Entertains...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TARZAN THE APE MAN was one of Irving Thalberg's 'pet' projects at MGM, an opportunity to take an existing franchise (Edgar Rice Burroughs' jungle lord had been a film staple since beefy Elmo Lincoln donned a loincloth, in 1918), give it 'A'-list production values and a 'name' director (W.S. Van Dyke), introduce charismatic actors as the leads (28-year old multiple Olympic champion Johnny Weissmuller and 21-year old Irish import Maureen O'Sullivan), and create a 'definitive' success for the studio.A success? Thalberg created a legend!Utilizing MGM's vast library of stock footage (primarily from 1931's TRADER HORN), a primordial Africa that was more pulp fiction than reality was created on the back lot, and veteran British character actor C. Aubrey Smith and 20s matinee idol (and future 'Batman' regular) Neil Hamilton were introduced, as James Parker and Harry Holt, adventurers questing after the legendary 'Elephants' Graveyard'. The arrival of Parker's daughter, Jane (O'Sullivan), a free-spirited, raven-haired beauty, complicates matters, but her stubborn refusal to lease, and confidence with the natives (shown as rear projections behind Smith and O'Sullivan) finally win the two men over, and soon the trio, accompanied by whip-induced native labor, are on safari.When a dying porter points the way to the Escarpment, a massive 'taboo' mountainous plateau protecting the Graveyard, the party has the missing piece to the puzzle, and begin an arduous climb to the top. (How a massive mountain range could be hidden, for so long, is not explained). After losing a porter, and nearly Jane, on the steep climb, the summit is achieved, and the famous Tarzan yell (a combination yodel/howl, created by MGM's sound department), is first heard. A treacherous river crossing, featuring stock footage of hippos and crocodiles, then costs the safari more bearers, with another yell saving their lives.All this leads up, of course, to Johnny Weissmuller's first appearance as Tarzan, observing the party from the trees. He is simply magnificent...tanned, slim, smoothly-muscled (as opposed to the brawny body builders later cast in the role) and nearly naked. He soon kidnaps Jane (he may be ignorant, but he's not dumb!), and the incredible chemistry between the pair is exhibited for the first time. While initially terrified of the savage (particularly as he pulls off her clothing parts to examine them), he doesn't 'have his way' with her, and she realizes he is far more sensitive than she'd assumed.Holt kills the ape guarding Jane (one assumes it is Kala, ape 'mother' of Tarzan, in the ERB books), and Tarzan screams in anguish at his loss. Displaying the racism prevalent in so many 30s films, Jane tries to defend her erstwhile kidnapper to her father ("He's WHITE!"), but the two hunters aren't buying it, and soon wound Tarzan, himself. Jungle animals spirit the bleeding jungle lord away...and Jane is soon at Tarzan's side, bandaging his head, and looking lustily at the big lug! When he recovers, the pair consummate their passion (in a scene tastefully off-camera), and are swapping names ("Jane...Tarzan...Tarzan...Jane").Tarzan returns Jane, and walks away, despite her pleas to return to civilization with them. The safari is soon captured by a height-challenged native tribe ("Are they Pygmies?" Jane asks; "They're dwarves," her father replies...uh, whatever...), and a gruesome scene ensues of the surviving members being lassoed and dropped into a pit with a giant gorilla (a not-quite convincing guy in an ape suit). Holt is knocked unconscious, Parker is mortally injured, Cheeta is tossed against a wall, and Jane swoons in the gorilla's arms (shades of KING KONG), then Tarzan busts in, to kill the ape and save them all. As the ever-available stampede of elephants mash the dwarves into pulp, Tarzan leads the dying Parker, Jane, and Holt to the 'Elephants' Graveyard', where Jane's father passes away. Holt returns to civilization (he would return in the sequel, TARZAN AND HIS MATE) and Tarzan, Jane, and a recovering Cheeta start an exciting new life together!Yes, the story is unintentionally campy, the 'apes', and animal fights, unconvincing, and there is blatant racism throughout the film. But as sheer entertainment, Depression-era audiences were enthralled. Weissmuller and O'Sullivan conveyed the kind of eroticism that pre-Code Hollywood was notorious for (and would reach even greater heights in the sequel), the action sequences were spectacular, and a new MGM franchise was born, that would produce six more films over the next nine years.Thalberg had again proven why he was considered the film industry's resident genius!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film, often eclipsed by its sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, Tarzan and His Mate is by far the best film in the wonderful 1930s MGM series. But you shouldn't therefore overlook its forerunner, Tarzan the Ape Man. This is also a great movie and has some fantastic moments. In particular, get a load of the lighting and the way in which the jungle's well-defined shadows are cast across Tarzan's (equally well-defined!) torso. Also worth watching, of course, to discover what Tarzan really says, as he certainly DOESN'T ever say 'Me Tarzan, You Jane'. While Tarzan and His Mate is often cited for its sexy content, this movie is also pretty hot in places; a beautiful pre-code film, which is a must for any Tarzan fan to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Weissmuller, an Olympic swimmer, was billed as "the only man in Hollywood who is natural in the flesh and can act without clothes." Maureen O'Sullivan was chosen for his mate, and the film concentrated on romance and ignored Tarzan's origins...It was in this movie, that Tarzan becomes the unintelligible, but very sexy man-ape that most cinema-goers recognize... The famous phrase "Me Tarzan, You Jane' was never spoken, but the film did include Tarzan constantly pointing to himself and then to Jane, enunciating "Tarzan - Jane."It was in this film that Cheetah the chimpanzee made the debut... The film was an enormous success, and Weissmuller's simple native hero became the forerunner of many subsequent versions...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One and Only Original That Started It All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tarzan The Ape Man",was without a doubt one the definitive "Tarzan" movie,and the first "Tarzan" talkie that started it all and it continues to go strongly to this day,a century after Edgar Rice Burroughs's most famous character was first introduced,generations ago. It also introduce to audiences Johnny Weissmuller who was an Olympic swimming champion and so forth and the introduction of actress Maureen O'Sullivan whom would star in all six pictures from 1932 to 1942. However,there have been numerous attempts to remake,update or improve on the classic story by Edgar Rice Burroughs(notably the pretentious 1984 Tarzan update of "Graystoke",directed by Hugh Hudson)on it,but have failed to near the original's entertainment value or even its technical quality,which still holds beautifully to this day.This was in fact the "original" of a long series of Tarzan movies starring Weissmuller and O' Sullivan that were made by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer,which in turn made Tarzan a hot commodity and its studio a Hollywood producing powerhouse of great entertainment. Dubiously faithful to the Edgar Rice Burroughs story about the humble beginnings to where Tarzan is introduced has been remade numerous times,but this is the 1932 original where Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan bring a class of style of wit to the roles and the results are absolutely brilliant from beginning to end. Then in 1934,MGM made a sequel entitled "Tarzan And His Mate" which was the second entry in the lavishly produced MGM Tarzan series. Weissmuller and O'Sullivan cohabit in an unmarried bliss before the Hays Code of the era moved them into a treehouse with twin beds. There is also the swimming scene,which until now has been restored from the original print which has been banned for years until MGM reissued this scene back into the film. The scene where Maureen O'Sullivan is swimming with Weissmuller,completely nude was in its day very noticeable and very restricted toward adult audiences. Among the challenges that they face in there private domain is against nasty white hunters,savage natives,angry elephants,hungry lions and maneating crocodiles."Tarzan Escapes",was the third entry in the series released in 1936. In this sequel,Jane(O'Sullivan)is tricked by evil hunters into abandoning her fairy tale life with Tarzan(Weissmuller). So the Ape Man sets out to reunite with is one true love,and as he sets out to get back with Jane,trouble ensumes. The third entry in MGM's successful Weissmuller/O'Sullivan series is still among the better Tarzan movies thanks to the leads,but the Hays Office made sure that Jane was wearing a lot more clothes this time around since this was also aimed toward adult audiences. The series from this point takes a three-year hiatus. Then in 1939,the fourth entry in MGM's Weissmuller/O'Sullivan series went toward the kiddie fare with "Tarzan Finds A Son" which was family oriented material and a little more tamer than the first two installments. However,Weissmuller and O'Sullivan returned to their roles after three years with the addition of five year-old Johnny Sheffield as "Boy". He's an orphan whose awful relatives hope he stays lost so they can collect and inheritance. Tarzan and Jane fight to adopt the tyke and when the new family are captured by a wicked tribe only an elephant stampede and Tarzan's call of the jungle can save them.Then in 1941,after a two year hiatus,the fifth entry in the series was really standard kiddie fare with "Tarzan's Secret Treasure". Tarzan saves an expedition from a savage tribe only to be repaid by having greedy hunters hold Boy and Jane hostage. They want Tarzan's help in finding a secret cache of gold hidden in the jungle. But Tarzan doesn't take kindly to threats against his family and teaches those evil-doers a lesson they'll never forget! This one was action-packed and it does show Weissmuller doing some of his own stunts. Then,in 1942,the last and final entry in the MGM Tarzan series titled "Tarzan's New York Adventure",marked Maureen O'Sullivan's final appearance as Jane. This one is so-so adventure with some very humorous moments when Tarzan meets the big city. When Boy is kidnapped by a evil circus owner,Tarzan,Jane and Cheta head out to rescue him.Then Tarzan shows off his jungle prowless by climbing skyscrapers and diving off the Brooklyn Bridge into the East River. This final Tarzan entry for both Weissmuller and O'Sullivan showcases some very interesting cameo appearances including one which features Elmo Lincoln,the screen's first Tarzan in a cameo appearance.After the huge success of the Tarzan films for MGM,Johnny Weissmuller continue to played The Ape Man in six more films for RKO Pictures which began in 1943 and ended in 1948,where Weissmuller's final appearance as the Ape Man concluded in "Tarzan And The Mermaids",before he would venture into a new medium---television as "Jungle Jim" in the early-1950's. He also played "Jungle Jim" in several theatrical films for Columbia Pictures. As for actress Maureen O'Sullivan,after the success of the Tarzan films,she would go on to star in several films including "The Big Clock" and "Bonzo Goes To College" opposite Ronald Reagan and so many more. As for Johnny Sheffield,he would go on to continue the role of "Boy" in five more Tarzan films with Johnny Weissmuller until 1949,when he went on to star in more than twelve features as Bomba Of The Jungle under RKO Pictures and would continue that role on television.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jane Parker goes into the jungle and meets the man of her dreams. A long running movie series is born.All kidding aside this is a really good adventure film of the sort that they don't make any more. The first of the MGM series, though not the first Tarzan movie, nor the only Tarzan film made during the same period (Edgar Rice Burroughs had deals with several producers) this is the film that broke box office records and spawned ten million "Me Tarzan, you Jane" jokes.The film was made to cash in the previous years Trader Horn, a jungle picture that MGM had produced. Wanting to feed a public that wanted more as well as to make use of the hours of location footage shot for that film. The ape man was the perfect choice.The plot has to do with Jane arriving in the jungle to see her father and then going of to find the elephant grave yard. Along the way is carried off by Tarzan and the rest is the movie. Its an exciting ride (especially if you forgive the creaky special effects and ape suits).A perfect film for a rainy afternoon</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarzan is a hit in movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Weissmuller,the former Olympic champion in swimming,makes his debut as Tarzan.The movie spawned a lot of sequels and Weissmuller continued as Tarzan for 11 more films during the next 16 years. I had seen this early and somewhat primitive talkie a couple of years back and found it hard to sit through.I decided I'd give it another chance and was surprised at how much more I enjoyed it.Weissmuller is stunning, he fits the part excellent and looks amazing.There's screen charisma by the thousands.Maureen O' Sullivan as Jane really made the role her own.The African footage, shot during the making of "Trader Horn" is exciting and must have been worth the ticket on its own back in the thirties.There's some bad rear-projection used,but it doesn't spoil the movie if you don't let it bother you. So enjoy this entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first of the MGM Tarzan films featuring Olympic medalist Johnny Weismuller in the titular role. It is new out on DVD, in a box set that contains the first six (out of twelve) that he would make. His co-star in these first six films (though I think she disappears in the latter six) is Maureen O'Sullivan, one of the greatest beauties Hollywood ever knew. They are the perfect Tarzan and Jane. Tarzan the Ape Man is extraordinary. The second film of the series, Tarzan and His Mate, is an acknowledged masterpiece of the adventure drama, but I'd almost rank Ape Man aside with it. It is beautifully done in every way, fun and exciting, but also at lengths gentle, charming, and downright erotic. There's a long scene where Tarzan and Jane play in the water. It's so sweet and so sexy. There's hardly any background music to the film, which sets it apart from many in its era that overused their musical scores. Long scenes are played out silently. There is no attempt to make up for a lack of dialogue. Of course, since this is the first time Tarzan meets men (at least white men), he doesn't speak much except for a few grunts to his chimpanzee buddies. It's quite amazing how much attention and care is put into the way Tarzan behaves, how he has become chimp-like. I also begin to notice with this film how good an actor Johnny Weismuller is. Tarzan the Ape Man is really a wonderful film. The new box set is absolutely a must-have. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love, Action, &amp; Adventure--will make you feel like a kid again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure I saw bits and pieces of "Tarzan, the Ape Man" on television when I was a kid, but I never really paid much attention to it. I just recently checked out the DVD from my local library, and I was amazed to discover what I had been missing all these years.This movie made me feel like a young boy, craving excitement and adventure. This first installment in the MGM Tarzan movies delivers big time. Yes, the special effects and interweaving of the stock footage looks a bit dated, but remember that this film was only made three years after the first "talkie" (i.e. a sound picture, not a silent movie). There are certain techniques that obviously stem from the silent movie days. But to me, this just adds to the charm.The animal footage is excellent. For the first time in a long time, I was actually on the edge of my seat during a movie. The CGI effects today are amazing, but they're so overdone (most of the time). The thrills and suspense in "Tarzan" are heightened, because you know everything you see is physically tangible, not an actor reacting to a green screen.I still don't know how they did some of those scenes without anyone getting hurt. Swinging from the treetops, wrestling with lions, wrestling with leopards, being chased by wild animals--all of these things make for great entertainment and adventure.I should also mention that the relationship between Tarzan and Jane is one of the most captivating I've ever seen in a movie. It's very understated, yet very sexy. Today, they would ruin the story by making the couple have sex after five minutes. But because the sexual chemistry is only hinted at, the entire relationship is one of Jane flirting and Tarzan pursuing. It just builds and builds. This romance actually has excitement to it. Definitely one of the best screen romances of all time.Despite a few minor shortcomings in the special effects of the time, this is a thrilling movie. Great adventure, great excitement, great entertainment. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre and sexy - should have been a silent film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has to be said - this is a very strange film. A proper young English lass is kidnapped by a white man who, for reasons never explained in this version, lives with the apes. She instantly falls in love with him and gives up everything to swing through the trees with him. Hardly the kind of thing America in the early thirties would have thought proper. Which makes this film quite subversive - and Johnny Weissmuller is practically naked! His beauty, particularly in body shape and skin tone, is special - but so too is the performance of Maureen O'Sullivan. With Weissmuller monosyllabic at best, it is left to O'Sullivan to convey most of the story - and she does it with great grace and charm - and quite a bit of sex!All that aside, there is some remarkable animal footage - sometimes with the actors and at other times with obvious doubles. There is a band of marauding pygmies (basically dwarves in black make-up) that has to be seen to be believed! The hardest things to take in this film though are its racism (the whites whip their black servants, and, when O'Sullivan's dad says that Tarzan has no real human feelings, O'Sullivan explodes "But he's white"!), and the rather fake animals used in certain scenes - particularly the men in ape suits. There is also some really bad rear projection. But, if you can ignore all that, there is much to enjoy and Cheeta the chimp is very cute.But it is in the silent action sequences that the film really flies. Too often it gets bogged down in static sound sequences - and there is the usual problem with early talkies of too little music. It makes me think what a great silent film this would have been. W.S. Van Dyke was a first-rate visual director with many impressive silent films like "The Pagan" and if we could now just sit back and watch this sexy action film without talking and sound effects, just a great music score, this film could well be considered a masterpiece. But then I guess we would never have heard Tarzan's famous cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarzan The Ape Man/Tarzan And His Mate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This week I also watched the first two entries in the MGM Tarzan series by way of Warner's elegant 4-Disc Set. I actually took some persuading to purchase these films (the very positive online buzz is what got me), and I finally relented some time ago thanks to a generous 20% sale on the part of Deep Discount DVD!Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised by them: solid (though primitive) production values, a bevy of exciting action sequences, and gleeful doses of eroticism and sadism made for great (if somewhat repetitive) fun. Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O' Sullivan created a wonderful (and spontaneous) rapport and generally inhabited their roles very nicely, making them the screen's definitive incarnations of these characters.TARZAN AND HIS MATE (1934; ***1/2) edges the original slightly because of the former's (necessary) tendency towards exposition: the sequel dives straight into action (though, curiously enough, it still takes quite a bit before Tarzan makes an appearance!) but also features lecherous villainy from Paul Cavanaugh and even takes time to develop the lovable personality of Cheetah (especially in a lengthy sequence where it is beset by assorted creatures while journeying through the jungle to alert Tarzan of the [invariably] impending danger)?and then, of course, there's that famous nude swimming scene! The lion-infested finale, too, is every bit as remarkable as the pygmy sequences at the climax of TARZAN THE APE MAN (1932; ***) ? if anything, it's even more ambitious.It's a pity, therefore, that the special effects (once considered ground-breaking) have not withstood the test of time: innumerable back-projection shots, the conveniently-placed (and thinly-disguised) series of trapeze which allow Tarzan to swing from one tree to the other, all-too-fake snakes and alligators, the rotoscoping of lions into a scene to make them appear as if they were fighting elephants, etc. Unfortunately TARZAN AND HIS MATE (and probably all the others that follow) took a ridiculous turn by having Jane mimic the famous Tarzan cry/yodel, which I felt to be an unwise decision on the part of the studio! Still, I do look forward to the rest of the series, hoping that they're at least as entertaining (even if reviews claim production values got progressively more lavish, and thus unrealistic, and the plots cornier).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weissmuller's The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie that kicked off the Johnny Weissmuller series of Tarzan pictures, which ran for sixteen years, through two studios, an adopted son and two Janes. Weissmuller is the best Tarzan I've seen. He was a champion Olympic swimmer rather than a trained actor, but was blessed with a wonderfully expressive face and had about him a kind of air of primitive moral authority that made him always interesting to watch, even when the plots were mediocre or far-fetched, as increasingly became the case as the series progressed. What's more, though Weissmuller's Tarzan may have been a so-called ape man, he was himself always touchingly human. Unlike today's action heroes, there was a sensitivity to Weissmuller. I know little of the man's personal life, but on screen he was always highly responsive to others and their needs, was alert to the nuances of human behavior rather than merely a macho man, and had at times a refreshing sense of humor that was somehow never cruel or demeaning. He was, in short, shorn of his jungle instincts, a perfect gentleman.As his long-time companion, Jane, Maureen O'Sullivan was perfect casting. Small and lovely, she contrasted perfectly with Weissmuller, maintaining her dignity and composure in even in the most dire of circumstances. She knew that Tarzan would always come to the rescue; that lions, apes and treasure hunters were no match for him, and yet she never took him for granted.The first two films of the series were the best, thanks in large measure to the Production Code not having gone into effect, which caused the series to eventually become "domesticated" and family-centered. There was a randiness to the early entries that works even today, as Tarzan and Jane were, after all, a couple, and the movies don't shy away from this. The Tarzan pictures were not Politically Correct, but they're not imperialist, either, and if anything feel at times like environmental tracts on the issue of leaving the jungles (and Tarzan) alone.It's probably best to watch the films in sequence, if possible. In the MGM period there was a degree of continuity, as one movie more or less picked up where the previous one left off. Weissmuller is more credible early on, though he's never less than good; and Miss O'Sullivan, who left the series when it changed studios, was always a huge asset. The Tarzan movies offer pure escapism of the most innocent kind. In the first film in the series we see the development of the Tarzan-Jane relationship, and there are plenty of thrills and chills along the way. The movie is obviously a back-lot production, but the use of stock footage lends it an air of authenticity. Also authentic is the rapport between Tarzan and Jane, who, in their heyday, rivaled Fred and Ginger and Nick and Nora Charles as one of the premiere couples of Hollywood's golden age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm going to be a savage, just like you".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I hearken back to my days as a kid, I can count on three heroes during my personal golden age - Superman, The Lone Ranger, and... Tarzan! I remember seeing this film back in the day, as I recall the business about finding the elephant graveyard. "Tarzan the Ape Man" reinvigorated the franchise for the first time in the talkie era; I was actually surprised to learn that this picture came out in 1932. I mark progress in cinema to a large degree by the stunning achievements of 1933's "King Kong", so in some respect, this was an ambitious film in it's own right.At the time, Johnny Weissmuller held sixty seven world records in swimming, and five Olympic gold medals. For me, he's the definitive movie Tarzan, wisely chosen for his athletic physique contrasted to that of bodybuilder types that would arguably hold sway today. Even if not a great actor, there's a naturalness to his presence in this film one might expect from someone portraying a savage.Then there's Maureen O'Sullivan. That early scene when she first encountered her father (C. Aubrey Smith) was a bit strange, with a crying jag that went a bit over the top. There are more than a few pre-Code moments that command the viewer's attention, the first being that venture into soft porn territory when she removes her dress and washes her face. Her father rather wisely wished to excuse himself; you're just going to have to see it for yourself. By the way, the quote in my summary line was uttered by Jane Parker, but to her father, and not as you would expect, to Tarzan.What got me hooked as a Tarzan fan back in my youth was the presence of all the wild animals, though watching today, I realize that a lot of the apes were actually men in monkey suits. There's also the issue of geographical integrity that Weissmuller's alter ego, Jungle Jim, encountered in every picture I've seen of that franchise. In this picture, Tarzan's first battle with a jungle cat brought him into contact with a jaguar, not a leopard as most viewers would suspect. Jaguars are only found in South America, so thumbs down there for authenticity. Or maybe I'm just being nit-picky.But hey, how about that battle with the pygmy (dwarf?) natives? That was as surreal as it gets when it comes down to your standard jungle lore. That along with the knife in the eye of the gorilla brute made for some heavy action without requiring a vine swing. I'm not sure if younger viewers today can appreciate all the stuff going on here when everything produced today seems to go for all action all the time. With Tarzan, you get back to a primitive minimalism, with life and death at stake in hand to claw combat. I can just hear the gasps of 1930's era movie goers when Tarzan hit the big screen.Finally, I can't finish this review without mention of Cheeta. Can you believe Cheeta is still alive as I write this? Weissmuller and O'Sullivan are long gone, as are all the other principals from the film. I keep checking every so often since I learned of Cheeta's longevity, but as of right now, though retired, he's still in the swing of things.Addendum - NOTE*** Cheeta passed away on December 24th, 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though there were Tarzan movies which preceded it, this one cemented the series place over the industry over much of the following two decades. While it is flawed in its dark cinematography and non-presence of its hero until a half hour into the film, the performances of Johnny Weissmuller &amp; Maureen O'Sullivan and their chemistry as Tarzan and Jane vaulted its popularity with audiences both male and female.Weissmuller, with his outstanding physique and appealing bulbous pecs, amply fills his tiny loincloth and portrays a commanding lead. Yet, still, his lack of a true bodybuilder figure as well as his near nudity added a vulnerability to Tarzan that has never been replicated.O'Sullivan, portrayed the delicacy and softness of Jane to the hilt. Though not as glamorous as many of the actresses of her time, her physical beauty would be revealed and appreciated over the following sequels of the series.As such, the series curried appeal from both sexes in its escapist fantasy realm. Men wanted to be like Weissmuller's Tarzan, in the barest of clothing and the ability to sweep Jane off her feet. Likewise, the ladies hearts surely swooned wishing they were Jane in this film, as she gently nurses an unconscious Tarzan in the jungle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Tarzan Met Jane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TARZAN THE APE MAN (MGM, 1932), directed by W.S. Van Dyke, the first of three movies bearing this title, arguably the best of the trio, introduces Olympic swimming champion Johnny Weissmuller to the role that made him legendary, and this is where it all began. While not the first Tarzan movie ever made, the Tarzan of the movies was first introduced during the silent era as TARZAN OF THE APES (1918) starring Elmo Lincoln as Edgar Rice Burrough's jungle hero. Few stories have captured the world's imagination as Burrough's fictional character, and who would have imagined the legend to remain popular long after its debut. With a few more Tarzan's carried over through the 1920s, as played by various actors, it is Weissmuller's carnation whom many remember best, actually Tarzan more according to MGM than Burroughs. The movie leaves many questions unanswered, giving no indication to Tarzan's origin - who is he and how did he get to be in the wilds of Africa? In spite of numerous changes from the book, TARZAN THE APE MAN became successful enough to spawn numerous sequels and imitators, thus keeping Weissmuller as the Hollywood swinger for twelve more movies in the next 16 years. The long reign of Tarzan began here, starting with the overly familiar jungle theme underscored during the opening titles that was presented as recently as 1931's adventure of TRADER HORN (MGM, 1931) starring Harry Carey and Edwina Booth, with excess footage filmed in Africa.The story begins where Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan), a young English girl, arriving in Africa where she comes to the trading post to accompany her father, Colonel James Parker (C. Aubrey Smith), and his young assistant, Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton), on an expedition in search for ivory that can be found in an elephant burial ground. After encountering near death experiences such as encountering dangerous animals, climbing large mountains and walking through narrow paths, and the fall through the deep canyon of several African native aids, the safari nearly reaches its destination until they hear the sounds of a jungle yell, followed by the disappearance of Jane. Jane, who had been whisked away by a white jungle man (Johnny Weissmuller), has taken his captive to his tree top home surrounded by apes. At first Jane is fearful of the man who calls himself "Tarzan," but in time, she calms down long enough in an attempt to teach him to speak her language. After Jane rejoins her father and Harry, Tarzan follows. Harry, who is in love with Jane, is jealous of her interest in this jungle man, and makes several attempts to get Tarzna out of the way by shooting at him, in spite of Jane's pleas. Holt's attempt only injures Tarzan, putting him out of commission for a while. Later, after Parker's safari is captured and held prisoner by a savage dwarf tribe, they find they are in great danger as they are placed into a deep pit, one by one, where they are to be sacrificed by Zumangani, a giant gorilla.This MGM production, which consists of rear projection photography featuring African natives, stock animal footage and villages, sets the pattern for future installments to come. Aside from Tarzan's realistic approach in killing animals either for food or in self defense, certain scenes come off on a graphic level, such as the climatic scene where Tarzan comes to rescue the safari by battling with the giant gorilla, and saving himself from being torn to peaces by throwing his knife in the direction that leaves the result to become quite hideous. Other than that, TARZAN THE APE MAN doesn't disappoint when it comes to action and adventure, with Weissmuller being the ideal choice as Tarzan, who doesn't make his first screen presence until a half hour from the start of the story. In spite of its popularity, TARZAN THE APE MAN had limited television revivals until the early 1980s when it became the first Tarzan movie of the Weissmuller series to be distributed on video cassette. It's interesting to point out that TARZAN THE APE MAN, which plays regularly on Turner Classic Movies, was the only movie in the entire long running series not to become part of the "Tarzan" package during the four year run (1997-2001) on American Movie Classics. In some certain parts of the United States, TARZAN THE APE MAN didn't play on the same TV channel along with the others, and yet this is actually part of the series but treated as an individual movie. Later displayed on DVD along with the five MGM sequels, TARZAN THE APE MAN has assured cultural status, especially with good stories, plenty of action, with Weissmuller and O'Sullivan enacting their parts to perfection. Next installment: TARZAN AND HIS MATE (1934). (***)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this film does have some disturbing elements such as openly accepted racist characters, violence towards animals and is very daring with Tarzan's abducting Jane and her eventually liking the idea of living behind proper society and running off with a wild man to live in the jungle...Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan are so terrific in the lead roles of Tarzan and Jane they keep you entranced in the film.

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous, offensive, and wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This would be a very interesting movie to study as a case of synthesis in film-making. A number of sets were made on the back lots and on location in California?some of the trees are recognizably California trees, perhaps the Eucalyptus imported long ago. And then they use stock footage shot in Africa, and perhaps a bit shot in zoos as well. In the early part of the movie the actors perform in front of back-projected film of Africans in traditional costume, gathering and drumming and dancing. The actors walk around the corner of the bamboo houses and stand in front of the people supposedly gathered for trading. In other scenes there is often intelligent intercutting between animal footage and live action?real alligators hurry toward the water and swim amongst real hippos, and then cut to a safe pond where mechanical crocodile backs churn across the surface in perfect coordination, like water ballet, as Johnny Weismuller swims his championship crawl. The mixture of actual apes (chimpanzees) and people in ape costume is perhaps the least convincing blend.The story is rather dim and missing key elements of continuity, but it doesn't seem to matter so much, since the main point of the film is to bring Tarzan and Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan) together. There's a crusty father (C. Aubrey Smith) determined to find the elephants' graveyard, and a stalwart colonial hero, Henry Holt (Neil Hamilton) who begins well but goes downhill as the trek through the jungle shows him to be a brute, and there are perhaps a dozen expendable black porters, killed along the way by falls from cliffs, arrows of hostile tribes, crocodiles, and some sort of captive gorilla-god. There aren't any left at the end of the trip, though all the white people survive. This isn't good.Weirdest of all is the appearance of the hostile tribe?they're not pygmies, they're dwarfs, as the father explains in matter-of-fact tones. Sure enough, it's the entire stock of Hollywood small people in black make-up. Tarzan and the friendly elephants take care of them.What is decidedly not pleasant here is the explicit racism, the profiteering and imperialist motives, and the callousness toward African human and animal life. Even Tarzan is guilty, for he dispatches several of the porters himself after Holt has shot one of his ape-friends. Jane tries to prevent Holt from shooting Tarzan by crying out, "He's White!" Not so much, according to the father, who deems Tarzan little more than an animal, and Holt sneers and glowers. And well he might, because he'd imagined Jane was his property.There's the other fascinating thing about this movie: the attraction between the nearly-mute, beautiful ape-man and the nearly-always-speaking, beautiful "civilized" girl. It can't be anything but animal magnetism, or, rather, pure sex. Weismuller spends the whole film nearly naked, and looking pretty good, and O'Sullivan indicates her potential sexiness when she changes clothes early in the film, pausing in her silky undergarments to laugh at her father's discomfiture. By the time her clothes get torn and she goes swimming with Tarzan, her curves and general loveliness become an integral part of the story. Tarzan and Jane are fascinated by each other, and can't stop staring. Tarzan is curious and innocent and hypnotized, and Jane passes through the obligatory stage of being frightened into an appreciation of Tarzan's character, beauty, and sense of identity in and with the jungle, and at last into a happy ease in her own sensuality. This last development allows her to stay in Africa as Holt retreats on the back of a borrowed elephant.This is a ridiculous and offensive movie, and it is also rather wonderful. The best moment, other than O'Sullivan and Weismuller at play in the water and all wet on shore, is when Jane is bandaging the wounded Tarzan's head and the young chimpanzee puts his arm around her shoulders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Weissmuller Swings Into Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>English explorer C. Aubrey Smith (as James Parker) leads an expedition into Africa's jungles, to find ivory in a legendary elephant graveyard. Spunky daughter Maureen O'Sullivan (as Jane) insists on going along, despite the danger; she is looking for a more savage lifestyle. Handsome Neil Hamilton (as Harry Holt), Mr. Smith's partner, falls in love with Ms. O'Sullivan, but finds unexpected competition from likewise handsome, but loin-clothed, Johnny Weissmuller (as Tarzan). Raised by monkeys, Mr. Weissmuller gets the urge to mate, when he sees O'Sullivan.This was the first "Tarzan" film starring Weissmuller, O'Sullivan, and "Cheetah" the chimpanzee; and, by the time the movie ends, they are obviously "going places" (in the Tarzan film series). A handsome and muscular swimming star, Weissmuller makes a perfect Tarzan. While showing less skin, O'Sullivan give the film its considerable sex appeal; especially when she tears her dress to mop Weissmuller's brow, goes swimming, and has Tarzan tickle her feet.Edgar Rice Burroughs' story of survival is downplayed in favor of the novel's sexual fantasy. And, it works like a charm. "Tarzan the Ape man" was not only a great Tarzan film, but also an excellent early "talkie". Of course, there is some silliness included (this was 1932). Director W.S. Van Dyke, film editors Ben Lewis and Tom Held, and photographers Harold Rosson and Clyde De Vinna excel. The film is briskly directed, tightly edited, and nicely photographed.******** Tarzan the Ape Man (3/25/32) W.S. Van Dyke ~ Johnny Weissmuller, Maureen O'Sullivan, Neil Hamilton, C.

		<shortDescription>Fantastic jungle fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1932, Olympic swimming champion Johnny Weissmuller donned loincloth (and precious little else) to swing into action for the very first time as Edgar Rice Burroughs' legendary jungle dweller, Tarzan, The Ape Man. Co-starring the gorgeous Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane Parker, the object of Tarzan's affection (or should that be 'lust'), this classic adventure might be lacking somewhat in the technical department, but is unbeatable in terms of sheer entertainment, offering plenty of delightfully un-PC action, a little risqué pre-Hays code sexuality, and a large dose of surprisingly nasty violence.In a bid to deliver as much gratuitous animal killing, native whipping, savage pygmy action and, of course, tantalising glimpses of a partially clothed O'Sullivan as he possibly can in 100 minutes, director W.S. Van Dyke avoids explaining the origins of his title character, opting instead to open the film as Jane arrives in Africa to join her father, who is leading an expedition in search of a legendary 'elephant graveyard'. This journey into the most treacherous, untamed parts of the dark continent inevitably leads to an encounter with the athletic ape man, who naturally takes a shine to the pretty Ms. Parker and whisks her off to his treetop hideout, where she is introduced to his extended family (a few genuine apes, and lots of blokes in bad chimp costumes).After some initial kicking and screaming, Jane calms down and realises that the wild man and his simian pals mean her no harm; unfortunately, big white hunter Harry Holt, hotheaded member of Parker's expedition and aspiring suitor to Jane, isn't so sure: when he tracks down and rescues the missing girl, he does so with guns a-blazing, killing one of Tarzan's hairy pals in the process.A now furious ape-man seeks revenge, killing a few dispensable luggage bearers before being wounded by the trigger-happy Holt (and then attacked by a few big jungle cats). Fortunately, brave Cheetah the chimp goes for help and Jane is soon at Tarzan's side, nursing him back to health by tearing strips from her dress and gently patting his head. Once her patient is fighting fit, Jane wishes to return to her father, and so our honourable vine swinging hero reluctantly returns her to the expedition, before loping back into the undergrowth.But when the expedition runs into trouble with a tribe of bloodthirsty munchkins, Tarzan is soon at Jane's side once again, kicking dwarf ass and leading a stampede of thundering pachyderms into the tiny terrors' village.Weissmuller, whose entire subsequent movie career would consist of similar adventure films, puts in a superb performance?strong, heroic and fearless, yet tender and compassionate when needed; likewise, O'Sullivan is impressive as the gutsy heroine who captures the heart of Tarzan (and the attention of most of her male viewers, I should think). These strong central performances, combined with Van Dyke's spirited direction, some impressive matte paintings, and lots of stock animal footage all add up to one hell of a fun time. At times, the action might get a little too scary for younger viewers?the sight of natives being thrown into a pit with a killer gorilla (another man in a suit?but a damn freaky suit!) is disturbing?but for older fans of jungle action, the fierce and frightening moments will only add to the excitement (I consider the Tarzan films to be precursors to the gory Italian cannibal films that were popular in the 70s).More fun can also be derived from Tarzan The Ape Man's less than perfect moments, which are full of unintentionally humorous elements that only add to the film's overall charm: the Indian elephants doctored with fake ears; Tarzan's trapeze swings thinly disguised as vines; the aforementioned shabby ape suits; and some terrible back projection that attempts to convince the audience that the studio-bound actors are actually in the wilds of Africa.Throw in more scary native dwarfs than you could chuck a spear at, an exciting hippopotamus attack (plus a few crocs for good measure), Tarzan wrestling a lion, and Weissmuller's trademark yodel, and you have one helluva rollicking flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ivory hunters James Parker (C. Aubrey Smith) and Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) are in Africa searching for a mythical elephant burial ground when Parker's daughter Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan) arrives unexpectedly. Despite her father's objections, Jane insists on accompanying them on their expedition. During their journey they are shocked when they see a half-naked white man (Johnny Weissmuller) living among the apes. The ape man kidnaps Jane and takes her to his home in the treetops, where she learns that his name is Tarzan.Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan is one of the most-filmed characters in movie history. Live action or animation, there have been tons of adaptations and they continue to this day. Well, for my money, none beats the Johnny Weissmuller series at MGM (and later RKO). They were exceptional adventure stories, sheer fun for young and old alike. Like most film series, the earlier movies in the Tarzan series are the better ones, starting with this first film. Olympic swimmer Johnny Weissmuller does a fantastic job as Tarzan. He was obviously cast for his looks and athleticism but he brings a sensitivity to the part that's unexpected. He plays him as a laconic man-child, innocent and peaceful until the things he cares about are threatened. That famous yell of Tarzan's is unforgettable. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and easy to fall in love with. Her performance is so effortless and real for this period in film. She elevates every scene and makes whoever's acting opposite her give more relaxed performances, as well. She has playful and at times sizzling sexual chemistry with Weissmuller. She also has a nice familial chemistry with C. Aubrey Smith. Their scenes have an authenticity about them that is rare to see but is appreciated. The success of the early Tarzan series owes as much to Maureen's Jane as it does to Johnny's Tarzan. Neil Hamilton, an actor most will remember as Commissioner Gordon from the '60s Batman TV show, does fine playing the part of the guy in love with Jane but can't compete with the rugged but kind Tarzan.Let's not forget this is a Pre-Code movie. Maureen appears scantily clad and even wearing a soaking wet thin dress in one scene. And, of course, Weissmuller wears nothing but a loincloth throughout. Being that it was filmed in 1932, there is some inevitable creakiness, an overuse of stock footage, and some spotty rear projection effects. But these things are minor negatives. The action scenes are great. Tarzan wrestling with an obviously stuffed leopard may seem hokey to many modern viewers, but it holds a certain quaint appeal for me. The animals are fun. Who doesn't love Cheeta? The matte painting backdrops are also nice. It's exciting romantic escapism with a good cast and solid direction from Woody 'One Take' Van Dyke. Followed by many sequels, the first of which is even better than this classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Tarzan Movie With Weismuller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It might be difficult to imagine what audiences who saw this film in 1932 thought of it. Cinema's state of the art at that time was so different than today's. We can count on the fact that many viewers had read Edgar Rice Burrough's accounts of Tarzan and were measuring the film against their expectations based upon reading the imaginative stories.When this film was released, fourteen Tarzan books had already been published and the series was still ongoing. In print, Tarzan's exploits had ventured far from the original story and, perhaps, lost some of their original charm. "Tarzan the Ape Man" would have been measured against the original story.This was the first Tarzan film starring Johnny Weismuller, the American swimming champion. He seems the perfect specimen for the part--lean, athletic and, of course, able to swim like a fish. He was paired with Maureen O'Hara. Her portrayal of Jane is disarmingly sweet and the perfect complement to Weismuller. The dialogue between Tarzan and Jane is very limited in this film, so gestures and looks say what words cannot. They share a primitive electricity.In the first part of the film, Jane arrives in Africa, joining her father and his team who plan to search for the "elephants' graveyard". The viewer is exposed to the wildness of Africa through Jane's eyes: tribal paint and strange customs, myths of forbidden "juju" that no one speaks of, primitive drumming, the sounds of wild animals at night (hyenas, lions, and some unknown sounds). A tribal search party threateningly approaches their encampment at night and then slips back into the darkness of the jungle (achieved by a clever dissolve).When the group of hunters--with their expendable bearers, of course--leaves to investigate unknown territory, Jane goes with them. Before we ever see Tarzan, his eerie yell is heard echoing through the jungle. Much has been written about the actual source of that yell. Was it Weismuller or a concoction of various sounds by MGM sound technicians (probably the latter)? In any event, I don't think it can be overstated how much its blend of human-and-animal helped create the mystery surrounding Tarzan in these scenes (and later continued to always bind Tarzan to his animalistic beginnings).In a similar way, the scenes of Tarzan swinging through the trees makes him seem almost superhuman and at home in nature.Eventually, Tarzan and Jane meet. Curiosity fires their connection at first. An animal attraction takes over.Some of the shots in "Tarzan the Ape Man" were made using rear projection. It is done as competently as was possible at the time. And it does lend an air of authenticity.Some of the animal scenes were made with stuffed animals or fake animals. This is just part of cinema at that time.The early scene where the hunting party traverses an escarpment is, of course, done with special effects, but the result is breathtaking and it creates the needed suspense as the party travels into the unknown.I can only believe that this film, which is fun to watch now, must have been significantly more enjoyable when audiences first viewed it. Lucky them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will share a film secret with you...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with a well-kept secret, but you have to promise to keep it to yourself since there are a lot of IMDb users, and they are all pretty nosey. Look at the star billing for this production in the IMDb billboard (main page). What do you see? Recall that IMDb gets their basic info on each film but sources directly related to the original release. Did you notice anything odd? OK, enough suspense. The answer is: Johnny Weissmuller is not billed as a star. Think about that. This is the first in a series that is both iconic and classic, that verily defines the term "action film" from this era; that was so commercially successful it not only created one of the first legitimate "franchises" in Tinseltown but led to 11 "legitimate" sequels (and a lot of dubious knockoffs, but that is not a topic for now). And the reason for the strange billing is, AT THE TIME THIS FILM WAS CONCEIVED, not only did the producers have no idea how it would catch on with the public, but the casting of Weissmuller, known merely as an ex-Olympian, and with no major dialogue in the role, was considered secondary, like a glorified extra. OK, now we have covered the big Reveal, allow me to opine that, within its class, this film (and the next one, TARZAN AND HIS MATE) are two of the best films OF THEIR KIND ever done, with superb acting, cinematography, story, and a very high fun factor. If you have not seen either (or both) prepared to be amazed. Final notes: the HAYES censorship code was still being "explored" at the time of these two films, so expect to be surprised at few scenes here and there you would not ordinarily expect from this period; and out of respect for the actors, I will merely suggest that these two films probably should not be compared to the 1940s analogues of the same name (by which time Weissmuller looked like he would have trouble climbing a flight of stairs yet alone a tree; and story lines like TARZAN in NEW YORK were beyond awkward.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarzan the Ape Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say I was especially surprised at how much I loved this picture! Lavishly produced by MGM with some spectacular sets and dazzling adventure sequences, "Tarzan the Ape Man" certainly won me over big time. Johnny Weismuller would be forever typecast and appear in numerous Tarzan films, as the mostly mute, but impressively built Ape Man, who could communicate with animals in the African jungle, wrestle and defeat the likes of lions and tigers, swing from trees with ease, and swim incredibly fast (this skill needed when giant crocodiles are coming after you!) when needing to. Maureen O'Sullivan, a stunning petite beauty, would portray British daughter of an ivory hunter (played by C Aubrey Smith) Jane Parker in several Tarzan movies after this one. I thought some of her playful scenes with Weissbuller were quite erotic, such as when she falls into his arms while they are swimming (or up in a tree) or is whisked off her feet by Tarzan to be taken to safety. Neil Hamilton is her other more "suitable" potential love interest (a fellow hunter and colleague of Smith's James Parker), Harry Holt, who expresses his strong feelings for her before Tarzan comes on the scene. You get all kinds of jungle animals in this production, such as zebra and rhinos, with that always-present threat of lions and tigers roaming about looking to attack and eat their prey. I was stunned at how realistic Tarzan's battles with tigers (and a lion) were. The elephant charge at the end when Tarzan calls on them for help when the Parkers and Harry are held hostage by a menacing group of African dwarfs, dropping members of their party in a pit with an enraged gorilla, rampaging through the village is awesome. That one scene where Cheetah the orangutan is fleeing from the pursuit of a determined tiger is all kinds of suspenseful, done with no musical accompaniment (we know that if Cheetah is caught and killed that Tarzan will not know that his beloved Jane has been taken prisoner by the dwarfs, adding extra tension to the scene). Perhaps a bit long in the tooth, but the filmmakers get in all the essentials fans would come to expect from the Tarzan series. Weissmuller is quite a hunk and O'Sullivan is definitely his equal in regards to attractiveness?I can see why the pair was in such demand to make more of these movies. O'Sullivan must be given credit for having to carry Weissmuller in their many scenes together because of the Tarzan character's inability to communicate with her through spoken language. Plenty of harrowing escapes such as one instance where Parkers crew are attempting to paddle their rafts across a river as rhinos draw closer to them (and one raft is tipped over, with one African slave becoming croc din-din).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meh. The original Tarzan has some historical appeal and watching it can be fun in a campy way, but it just didn't click with me, despite reminding me of the classic 'King Kong' in a few ways. The white man goes to the unknown, forbidden jungle in search of treasure. The natives jump around and dance to sacrificial rites. The explorers have no qualms about blowing things away with their guns, in this case, hippopotamuses, not dinosaurs. The young woman along for the adventure falls into the hands of a powerful being who can take care of her. Tarzan, like Kong, has to fight and kill other wild creatures that threaten them. They want to bring him back to civilization, but here is it where it diverges: Tarzan has the choice, and declines, and Jane has fallen in love with him, and wants to stay.Olympic champion Johnny Weissmuller was a great choice for Tarzan (my understanding is that Clark Gable was also considered ? yikes), and Maureen O'Sullivan has great chemistry with him, so what's the trouble? I ask myself, does the movie hold up? The worst of the scenes has the explorers very noticeably standing in front of stock footage of African tribesmen in the background. Ugh. The best has Tarzan battling a lion in what looks real, and we know it's not CGI. There are scenes that drag on, dashing through the jungle and bellowing his famous cry in places he could not possibly have done, such as when he's swimming, and O'Sullivan shrieking 'Tarzan' gets quickly jarring to the ears. There are other scenes that surprise us, like Jane falling off a cliff face shortly after a native has; the difference, she's on a rope, whereas his death is treated simply as property loss, with no recognition that he was a human being. We see the African porters whipped on more than one occasion to keep up. We cringe as we hear Jane trying to stop the others from shooting Tarzan by yelling "He's White!" The racism is certainly one of the film's problems, and is more than a little off-putting. The other is the plot, which isn't all that exciting, and I began looking forward to the movie ending about halfway through. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood. Maybe I would have preferred the sequel, where it sounds like the sex and violence was ratcheted up a notch. I don't know. Just, meh.</fullReview>

But Once the Safari gets Under Way on a Search for the Elephant Burial Ground, the Ivory Hunters Encounter Life Threatening Situations and Tarzan, the Fun Never Stops.The Climax is a Brutal and Violent War Among Giant Killer Apes, Dangerous Dwarfs, and Stampeding Elephants that is Still Exciting and Impressive Today. Ultra-Violent and Visceral it is a Scary and Nightmarish Highlight. Despite a Few Time-Stamped Flaws, and a Lack of Musical Score, there is So Much Here to Enjoy that the Shortcomings can be Ignored.

It looks as if some of the characters are walking in front of a movie screen.Johnny Weismuller was an Olympic Gold Medalist with no acting experience, and MGM really didn't want him, but they used him for this and four sequels to great effect. Weismuller went on to make more Tarzan films for other producers.It is always a pleasure to watch old films like this and see how far we have come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that this movie was made with little expectation that it would be profitable. The main idea was to use some expensive film that had been shot on location in Africa for "Trader Horn" but never seen on the screen. It's believable. There's not much evidence of effort having been put into the story or characters. A lot of animals chase each other through the jungle.Maureen O'Sullivan is Miss Jane Parker, the daughter of C. Aubrey Smith. They, an extraneous white guy, and their native bearers are on safari in a part o the Dark Continent where the hand of man has never set foot. They're searching for an elephant graveyard. You know, the place where moribund elephants wander to die among their ancestors' bones? That's how Jane puts it anyway. Why, there must be a fortune in ivory in all those tusks! Of course, it's the devil of a time getting the tusks out of the skulls. In Alabama the Tuscaloosa. I don't care. I refuse to put any more effort into a joke like that than the writers, Cyril Hume and Ivor Novello, have put into the script.And, man, have they butchered Edgar Rice Burroughs' original story and characters. I was addicted to them when I was barely a teen. They were implausible then. Now the story and characters are dumbed down so that a five-year-old can absorb them. Eg., the original Tarzan was a Viscount by birth. You won't find that mentioned here. Somebody might ask, "What's a Viscount?" And, if I remember, Tarzan spoke not only ape language, which apes don't have, but was self taught in English as well. And his English was as good as any Brit's. His lexicon encompassed words like "scarcely" and "width." However, having Tarzan speak English means writing more dialog, which takes time, effort, skill, and money. Better -- and easier -- to have Johnny Weismuller thump his chest, say "Tarzan," then thump Maureen O'Sullivan's chest, at the sternoclavicular notch, and say, "Jane!" There now. Isn't that easier than having him ask something like, "I say, actually, what is your sincere impression of this verdant paradise?" There are so many scenes of combat involving so many different kinds of animals, from hippos, lions, leopards, gorillas, and crocodiles to dwarf humans, that I lost interest after a while. My interest was piqued momentarily as Jane's dress was gradually ripped to shreds by the jungle shrubs, and when she deliberately tore some swaths off to make a bandage for Tarzan's head.That brings up another subject. I don't know what Tarzan thought of Jane, per se, but she evidently grows affectionate towards him after spending some time in his tree house. She comes up with something like, "Oh, Tarzan, you don't even know what a kiss IS, do you?" Well, he may not know how to kiss but he sweeps her up tenderly in his arms and carries her slowly off to his rude budoir. And what does Jane do, you ask? Protest? Hardly. She submissively buries her face in his shoulder and allows herself to be taken away. To do what -- make fudge?The next time we see her, it's day time and she's lying on a leopard skin rug in the tree house, wreathed in smiles of satisfaction. And, at the fade out, Tarzan and Jane wave good-bye to the departing remnants of the safari, content to seek happiness alone in the jungle. (Well, not alone -- all those elephants.) But without benefit of clergy, I might add. I ask you, what kind of movie IS this? Would you let your children watch this salacious filth? What do you suppose they'll learn from it -- that it's fun to swing from the chandelier? How to play doctor in the tree house? No, no. Take us back to the original, where Tarzan and Jane remain pure and Tarzan is articulate enough to say, "Now Tarzan will wage war on the miscreant Gomangani."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best of all the bazillion Tarzan films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the 1930s-1950s, there were a long succession of jungle pictures in theaters. And, for the most part, they sucked. These films featured grade-z actors and directors, significant use of bad stock footage (often of Asian or South American locations even though the films were supposedly set in Africa) and dumb writing. Because of this, after a while I stopped watching them--they are very dull indeed. However, MGM's "Tarzan the Ape Man" is an exception I am going to make--after all, instead of the usual poverty row studio, this one was made by the most prestigious studio on the planet. Instead of lousy actors, MGM pulled out their A-game with Maureen O'Sullivan, Neil Hamilton (at the time a big star--though mostly forgotten today except for his role as 'Commissioner Gordon' on TVs "Batman") and C. Aubrey Smith. And, not surprisingly, they cast a new actor as Tarzan--as it would be hard to accept an actor with an established reputation as a jungle savage! So, they obtained the services of Olypmic champion swimmer Johnny Weismuller to play the lead. I couldn't wait to see a good jungle film! Would this fit the bill? The film skips the story of the Greystokes being lost in Africa with their young baby who would grow up to be Tarzan. Instead, it begins many years later when an African expedition happens to find the young man---quite by accident. But before Tarzan meets the entire expedition, he meets Jane and they hit it off in some cute scenes.On the negative side for this film, there is STILL the significant use of stock footage--some of which clearly doesn't fit the film (such as the scenes where they show various tribesmen who are filmed in very different locations than where the action is set). And, unfortunately, there are some guys dressed up as chimps--something that just looked cheap (though these were a bit better than the usual chimp suits). There also is a fake crocodile that looked pretty silly (conversely, the fake hippos in this same scene were pretty good). And, because of all this, I just can't understand reviews that gave the film 10s. On the positive, despite the cheesy stock footage, the acting was lovely and the script very good. These were able to make up for a lot of the film's deficiencies. The mountain hiking scene is very impressive for 1932--and a very nice use of trick photography and matte paintings. Also, a few real animals were used on the sets--such as a hippo and baby chimps and fights with real live lions--not dead stuffed ones (which I HAVE seen in other Tarzan films). It clearly skimped a bit here and there, but also did have impressive touches a better budget would allow. As a result, the film is significantly more watchable than the usual jungle film--including many of the later non-Johnny Weismuller films. It's worth seeing, as it's among the very best of the Tarzan films--if not the best.By the way, the follow-up film, "Tarzan and His Mate", is a notorious movie. That's because it features a very, very risqué nude swimming sequence--one that ran afoul of the new toughened Production Code (in an effort to make movies more family-friendly. This very nude scene was anything but family-friendly)! And, by the time it was ready for release, the code was being strengthened--and these changes forced the scene to be severely edited. Recently, the edited footage has been restored--and it is rather hot--even by today's standards--and certainly not what you'd expect in what is seen as a kids' film. Both this risqué and the previous film excel, however, as they are quite romantic--something that CAN'T be said of other jungle epics!Also, in "Tarzan the Ape Man", they use Asian elephants. While I am usually a stickler for realism (especially since the animals often shown in jungle films are just the wrong species for Africa), I don't object to this in this particular case, as African elephants are a lot more dangerous and I wouldn't want the studio to use these beasts (though some circuses have--at much greater risk).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Is Tarzan Named "Tarzan"? And Other Interesting Questions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So why is Tarzan named "Tarzan" anyway? I found myself wondering about this from the moment that Jane discovered it. First, Jane was "Me" and Tarzan was "You" because Jane couldn't get him to understand anything she was saying, since he didn't speak English. That made sense. Except that when Jane finally convinces Tarzan that her name is Jane, she manages to get him to identify himself as "Tarzan." Well, who named him? He lives with apes! What need does he even have for a name? It's not like the apes, elephants, hippos, et. al. were greeting him every day with "how's it shaking, Tarzan?" Mystery, indeed. And how did Tarzan get that big, snazzy knife he uses to kill and skin animals? And why is the chimpanzee named "Cheetah"? And how can Tarzan do the Tarzan yell, while he's swimming through the water? Mysteries galore!Now, do I want to be really hard on this movie? No. I really don't. It is a classic, and it gave birth to a classic character. Well, that was really done by Edgar Rice Burroughs, but neither the books nor the 1918 silent version would have had the iconic Tarzan yell, so this did give birth to something. And it obviously struck a nerve, because there was a whole series of these movies dating into the 40's, a TV series, animated shows, later movies. So this worked. And this one is pre-code, and so shockingly "immoral" by the standards of the day. Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan is almost naked, and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane is at the very least suggestive, and we know darn well that "something" went on between these two. And there are lots of wildlife shots (albeit using stock footage) and quite hilarious (and at the same time disturbingly racist by 2013 standards) portrayals of African (and especially pygmy) natives.Technically, this also feels very old and dated. To mention just one thing - the actors interacting with fake natives on rear backgrounds. To mention another, many of the ape scenes obviously used people dressed in horribly unconvincing ape costumes. The story was also weak, and - as I understand it - takes huge liberties with Burroughs story. I think I read Burroughs story many, many years ago, but don't remember much of it. I accept the testimony of others in this regard. In the movie, the basic plot marching this forward is the search for an elephant graveyard, but that just really serves as a chance to introduce Tarzan. And Tarzan himself is a mystery. Burroughs, as I understand, explores Tarzan's history and background. In this movie, Tarzan is just there. In Africa, swinging through the trees! And, as Jane points out, he has human feelings - because "HE'S WHITE!" Yeah, there's that nasty racial overtone again.I won't be too hard on it. It was made in 1932, and it did spawn a whole series, and it is considered a classic. But it really didn't do a lot for me in all honesty. (4/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't seen Johnny Weissmuller's debut film Tarzan The Ape Man for many years so I was struck by the fact that Neil Hamilton and Maureen O'Sullivan got first billing with Weissmuller down the opening credits in an 'introducing' category. As if no one in America, let alone the movie going public didn't know who Johnny Weissmuller was.The fuss over swimming champion Michael Phelps is nothing compared to what Johnny Weissmuller's celebrity was like. In the Roaring Twenties when each sport seemed to have an icon that became a legend, Weissmuller was that for swimming. The records he set in the Olympics stood for many years, with today's athlete conditioning methods I can only speculate what he could do today if he were alive and in his prime.Still Louis B. Mayer was nothing if not cautious in protecting an investment in a non-actor to be a lead in a major film. He kept Weissmuller's dialog to grunts, guttural jungle utterings, and a few choice words that Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane teaches her new jungle man toy.With tons of footage left over from MGM's African location film of Trader Horn, Tarzan The Ape Man had all the background needed to make the film look good. It's fairly obvious that when you see shots of Neil Hamilton and Maureen O'Sullivan they're shot against a background of real natives. They never got further to Africa than Toluca Lake in the shooting.It's also obvious that Weissmuller couldn't act at all which was why he was only given grunts and dialog of one and two words. Later on he did become a competent enough actor. But quite frankly who cared when they saw him in a loin cloth.Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane Parker comes to Africa to visit her father C. Aubrey Smith and she finds that Smith and his partner Neil Hamilton are planning an expedition into some unexplored territory in search of the fabled elephant's graveyard. A lot of loose ivory to be picked up there without the danger of actually trying to kill the beasts. Hamilton's interested in her, but when white jungle man Tarzan rescues O'Sullivan, Hamilton doesn't have a prayer.Tarzan The Ape Man is still an exciting adventure film even to today's more sophisticated eyes. And Weissmuller and O'Sullivan's appeal as a romantic couple is timeless.All right so they haven't got the dialog from Romeo and Juliet, who cares?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jane Parker joins her father, James, and his partner Harry Holt in unexplored Africa to find the secret elephant burial yards where a fortune in ivory is awaiting. The explorers have a hard time going past a mountain range that the native consider taboo. When they cross, with some of the native guides dying on the way, they hear the calls of Tarzan swinging his way across the jungles. Tarzan kidnaps Jane and is instantly smitten with her, while Jane is terrified at first, but then sees something nice within him, and starts to teach him to communicate with him. Eventually Parker and Holt catch up to Jane, who rejoins them, but Tarzan once again captures Jane. Tarzan eventually returns Jane to her father and is shot at by Holt, who is losing Jane's love to Tarzan. Parker and company are captured by a band of native dwarfs who plan to sacrifice Jane, Parker, and Holt by throwing them into a pit with a man-killing gorilla. Jane sends Cheetah to get Tarzan to save the day. Decent movie, but not great. The film moves slowly at times (uncharacteristic for a Van Dyke film) and doesn't start to pick up until we see Weissmuller. The battle scenes with Tarzan and the killer ape at the end are worth the price of admission (even though the dwarfs look ridiculous). The performances are a bit wooden as well. Rating, 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good and fairly adult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarzan meets Janes. That's about it for the story. This film has plenty of problems. There's just hysterically funny footage of the actors in front of a badly done backscreen "interacting" with natives; some of the same footage is used again and again; O'Sullivan gives a lousy performance and is REAL whiny; there is blatant racism and animals are killed on screen. Still, these faults aside, it wasn't bad.For one thing this movie and its sequel ("Tarzan and His Mate") were made for adults. The fight scenes between Tarzan and animals (which look damn realistic) are bloody and violent and it's HEAVILY implied that Tarzan and Jane have sex. Also Weissmuller wears next to nothing--not that that's a BAD thing--the guy is handsome, young, tall and has a GREAT figure. And Jane isn't wearing much either. The sequel got even worse with more explicit violence and Jane having a lengthy underwater swimming scene totally nude. After that, the Production Code clamped down on them. So, this movie does have a very adult tone and was not aimed at children. Also Weissmuller is very good as Tarzan--he acts just like you would expect him to act. He's like a little boy just finding out things--just as the part should be played. He was just a little too grim--I was shocked when he actually smiled!This is not the classic I was led to believe it is--"Tarzan and His Mate" is 20 times better. Still, I did enjoy the film and give it a solid 7. Not really for the kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Book or Movies, which is better for Tarzan?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 10 years ago I initiated campaign to build and sustain a Website on the Internet. The reasons for this initiative were two, maybe three. Firstly, I made an unsuccessful career in Academia and University which bolstered for ten years or so my ambition and energy in the field. Second, I was unsuccessful as playmate and marriage candidate which left me a lonesome dove in middle age. Third, because I had always a large family around and was obsessed with the elderly and the procreation on my brother's side. So willy-nilly I departed with my illusions to become a hero in real life and plunged into the imaginary. In the time elapsed I realized that I have become not only older but wiser - that means, I understood that "globalization" is the state of art being connected while the previous level called "totalitarianism" was sponsored by isolated people and societies. Consequently, today Internet has become more important than Movies or Books taken separately and has exempted our culture for future 21st century.I now give realm to Tarzan and his author Edgar Rice Burroughs. The author (ERB) has been my favorite reading since my early age in the 1970s when I studied both Bulgarian and English languages. My mastery in those two languages is equal although I live in Eastern European country by default. In those years before end of Cold War my time was occupied by gathering Movies and Books and associating with Friends. Now in my 50s the last component is missing and I am left alone with myself and whatever artifacts of Culture modern age has to provide in order to survive. Otherwise it will disappear like Dinosaurs and World Wars.After those gloomy memories let me present my Tarzan collection (on 6 double-sided DVDs, 12 movies in total with Johnny Weissmuller). The guy was sort of a hero now-a-days people like Arnold Schwarzenegger have become. He has also similar biography saying he was born in America while in fact he came from Banat, Austro-Hungary (formerly). Weissmuller was trained swimmer and won 5 gold medals for US Olympic team (1924-1928). He then became a Movie star in 1930s and 1940s, keeping constantly in good physical shape because the Tarzan films expounded on the image of semi-naked white ape-man as apotheosis of American supremacy over Germans and other Human Races. Johnny Weissmuller died age 80 leaving the Tarzan legacy to other actors not one of which could beat his productivity or expressionism.Edgar Rice Burroughs adapted to screenwriters format themes from his Tarzan's novels (originally 24 books dealing with this hero). He also wrote several other series of books all of which dealing with imaginary worlds, the most popular being about John Carter of Mars (originally 11 books that follow adventures of dying Captain during the Civil War whose soul transcend on the Red Planet to become there a Warlord of galactic civilization). The recent movies on John Carter aren't half intriguing as the books themselves.Finally, have a list of the 12 original Tarzan movies with Johnny Weissmuller the way they appeared chronologically: TARZAN, THE APE MAN (1932) TARZAN AND HIS MATE (1934) TARZAN ESCAPES (1936) TARZAN FINDS A SON (1939) TARZAN'S SECRET TREASURE (1941) TARZAN'S NEW YORK ADVENTURE (1942) TARZAN TRIUMPHS (1943) TARZAN'S DESERT MYSTERY (1943) TARZAN AND THE AMAZONS (1945) TARZAN AND THE LEOPARD WOMAN (1946) TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS (1947) TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS (1948)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>061: Tarzan the Ape Man (1932) - released 3/25/1932; viewed 6/04/06.Gandhi is arrested by the British again. The 1932 Winter Olympics go down in Lake Placid, New York. The first daytime soap, Clara, Lu, and Em debuts on the radio. Six million unemployed in Germany. Japan and China fight over Manchuria. The son of Charles Lindbergh is kidnapped and a media circus ensues. Hattie W. Caraway becomes the first woman elected to the United States Senate.BIRTHS: Dabney Coleman, Piper Laurie, Francois Truffaut, John Williams, Milos Forman, Ted Kennedy, Majel Barrett, Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Taylor, Gene Shalit. DEATHS: Edgar Wallace, John Philip Sousa, George Eastman.DOUG: As 1932 gets underway, MGM unleashes the first of a long series of films starring Edgar Rice Burroughs' titular hero in Tarzan the Ape Man, starring Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane and Olympic gold medalist Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan. Big John looks good as Tarzan. He doesn't have to do much acting, just look wide-eyed, pose shirtless for the camera, and don't be afraid to touch Ms. Sullivan anywhere (I do love the moment when Tarzan grabs Jane's foot right out from under her). The scenes where he swings through the jungle are pretty cool, though they're clearly trapezes (did he do any of his own stunts?). Maureen O'Sullivan plays Jane. She gets to shoot a shotgun (and quite well at that), which surely made her a powerful female character in her day, but she's still a damsel in distress to me since she fills her luggage with her entire fall wardrobe, and for most of the movie she WON'T STOP SCREAMING! The best scenes are between Tarzan and Jane, particularly in the scene in the pond where she amuses herself with the fact that he can't understand her, while he looks over her with such childlike curiosity while touching her rather inappropriately and repeating every last word she says. There is some good action here, such as Tarzan battling a pair of lions (they look like real lions), but some of the effects look fake, especially at the beginning, when the Parkers walk in front of the row of natives, and it's clearly a processed screen; it looks so fake it's bizarre. The film is very uneven, switching between jungle scenes shot on set and choppy stock footage, with unconvincing effects and gorillas that are obviously guys in suits. I wasn't very satisfied with this, the first installment in Weissmuller's 12-film Tarzan series. I would like to check out the second film, Tarzan and his Mate, which I've read is the best.KEVIN: Olympic gold-medalist swimmer Johnny Weissmuller makes his debut as Edgar Rice Burroughs' titular hero in MGM's Tarzan the Ape Man. I doubt this is the best installment of the Tarzan movie series, but it's a cool adventure nonetheless. Some of the special effects are laughable, such as a scene at the beginning when Jane and her father admire a local tribe that is obviously a composite screen. Most of the apes look like guys in suits. Tarzan swings through the jungle on conveniently placed trapezes. But we do see Tarzan duking it out real live lions and tigers in between intimate scenes with Maureen O'Sullivan's Jane Parker. The character of Jane felt uneven to me. She's comfortable shooting a rifle and being outdoors, yet she brings along the entire east wing of Bloomingdale's with her on safari. The climax could've been better, (and easier to see), plus it's no fun watching the black guys get killed first. I look forward to the next adventure, Tarzan and His Mate. I'm sure the Production Code cracked down on the sexuality and the cruelty to animals in later films. Until then, welcome to the jungle, baby! Last film viewed: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931). Last film chronologically: One Hour With You (1932). Next film: Scarface (1932).</fullReview>

Tarzan is Johnny Weissmuller.A lot of people didn't know about Edgar Rice Burroughs when Johnny Weissmuller made Tarzan famous, and vice-versa, and provided future careers for a lot of people who could not act at all but could look okay in small costumes.JW was huge and athletic long before there were any real bodybuilders to do this sort of role. There were lots of stock players available to come on screen and make him look even bigger and more athletic.All he had to do was swim, parade around in his bit of cloth and smile at Maureen O'Sullivan.And 40 years later, elementary school kids were still saying, "You talk like Tarzan, walk like Jane and smell like Cheetah."A great many kids had no idea that a fight between a lion and a tiger could not have happened since the two animals lived on different continents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarzan - GOOD; Jane &amp; Others - PAIN IN THE BUTT......Watch The Sequels Instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, this is very unusual in one regard: usually the first movie in a long string of sequels is the best of the bunch. People are surprised when a sequel is actually better. With Tarzan, I thought this movie was the worst of the bunch, or at least the first six which comprise my Tarzan Collection DVD package. I will gladly watch the sequels multiple times but I am through sitting through this turkey, thanks to several characters.Well, let's start with the good news first:THE GOOD - Plenty of action with a lot of wild animals on display, even if they are just stock footage. You see lion attacks, crocodiles, hippos, panthers, you name it, and you see several of the different tribes of all kinds, including pygmies (called "dwarfs" in the movie.) Since this movie was made almost 75 years ago, I can't knock any of the realism because they didn't have it in the movies that long ago. They do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds. However, Weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape. He and O'Sullivan make a well-built handsome couple, if there ever was one in those Golden Years of cinema.The film has historical value (with so many sequels) in that it shows how Tarzan acquired Jane and his beginnings of learning the English language.The BAD - From the moment "Jane Parker" is taken by Tarzan almost every scene with her is Maureen O'Sullivan in hysterics, shrieking and screaming scene after scene. It's enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film. Thankfully, she calmed down in the sequels, but not in this movie. The movie also does no favors for "The Great White Hunter" image as C. Aubrey Smith, playing Jane's father, and Neil Hamilton, as "Harry Holt," the safari guide, shoot at every animal within sight, whether the beasts is threatening or not. These people are kill- happy, particularly Smith. On another note, it's too bad there isn't anything in here explaining how Tarzan got to be in the jungle in the first place. There is no history of him in here or footage of his growing up. He's just there when Jane and the group get to a certain point in Africa.</fullReview>

Oh, by the way, the savage (painted black) dwarves were beating Tom Toms and dancing to Native American war chants. I really liked that part.

		<shortDescription>Primitive studio-bound Tarzan filmed against stock African footage...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the film that started it all, this is a less than impressive start for the Tarzan films that became so immensely popular within the next decade. In fact, it's a downright disappointment.MAUREEN O'SULLIVAN spends most of the time screaming for or at Tarzan and becomes annoying after her first rescue to Tarzan's tree-top domain. Separated from the safari partners (C. Aubrey Smith and Neil Hamilton), she becomes adjusted awfully quickly to Tarzan's life style even though she screams at the playful chimps around her or any moving jungle animal. And there are plenty of them, although most exist only on footage culled from a previous expedition MGM made for "Trader Horn" a little earlier.The plot is almost non-existent. The safari is seeking the elephant's burial ground in their search for ivory, a device used in countless other Tarzan films. But the pace is agonizingly slow, as directed by Woody VanDyke, with a silent no-music soundtrack that fails to add further interest to an already slow-moving story and depends solely on jungle sounds for atmospheric effect.JOHNNY WEISSMULLER, of course, is entirely suitable and believable as the man on the swinging vines but his character is never developed beyond a few simple words. After a series of escapes, he and Maureen O'Sullivan end up on the high rocks together, watching as Neil Hamilton rides off on an elephant. The End.For the film that spawned one of filmdom's most popular series, this one is a yawner. Maureen is unflatteringly photographed in some of her close-ups, the make-up job being strictly early '30s with the tight hair and bow lips, although she was much more becomingly attired in the remaining films of the series. Her interaction with Tarzan and Cheetah is more annoying than entertaining though, and the less said about Weissmuller's wooden performance the better.Miss O'Sullivan's screams are exploited throughout, making Fay Wray's efforts in KING KONG seem tame by comparison. As the second romantic lead, Neil Hamilton does a nice, understated job as the safari leader.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand the feeling of watching an old movie aghast at its clumsy (ape-like?) embrace of gender/race/class stereotypes, but I think "classic" has more to do with how a work engages the imagination than with how intelligent it is. The stodgy prose of _Robinson Crusoe_ is almost unreadable today, but you can still get a summary of the basic plot from any reasonably aware kid on the street. The same is true with the Tarzan stories, which get remade over and over. Something about the myth of a white lord of the jungle has staying power. Maybe we'll learn something about American culture if we ask what chords the story rings--even if they turn out to be embarrassingly ugly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much of the narrative strength of Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel, Tarzan of the Apes, comes from the story of 'how' a young European man became Tarzan. (It's utterly implausible, but IS a good story). The 1932 movie version just plops this animal-talking white guy down in the jungle and this important part of the story is ignored. It's never explained; he's just there. Granted Maureen O'Sullivan and Johnny Weissmuller make an excellent Tarzan and Jane, but the story is a tad too escapist for this 21st century viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time hasn't been good to the first Tarzan of the sound period.A silly adventure story with a lot of back-projection of earlier location- shooting in Africa. Johnny Weissmuller does a good job in portraying the man raised by simians.It's a rather primitive role with barely no lines.Maureen O'Sullivan is rather annoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and nonsensical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the stupid "quaint African natives" travelogue footage with our badly-superimposed principals acting as narrators, to the horrible fake ears which transform docile Indian elephants into African elephants, to the utter lack of any logic at all, to Maureen O'Sullivan's incessant whining of "Tarzan! Tarzan!", there is nothing about this movie which deserves classic status.4/10</fullReview>
