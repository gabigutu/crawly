		<shortDescription>Generally acceptable remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This faithful, slightly overlong remake of the underrated 1943 Hitchcock thriller isn't nearly as bad as most people seem to think. It can't compare with Hitchcock's version, of course, but should it be condemned simply because of that? In a way, this film is similar to the 1979 version of "The Lady Vanishes"; both remakes lack Hitchcock's style but the stories are so strong that the films do manage to keep you absorbed. Mark Harmon is ideally cast as Uncle Charlie - in some key scenes I think he is even preferable to Cotten. The girl who plays his niece looks too old for the part and isn't nearly as engaging as the young actress that had the role in the original. This remake can't shake off a sense of uselessness, but it's still good-looking, well-mounted and generally entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive attempts to improve on a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I will be the first to accept that this remake does not have the craftsmanship of the earlier Hitchcock version, there are a few salient facets of the film that Hitchcock might consider to be an improvement over his version.The first attempt at improvement that TV director Karen Arthur and teleplay writer John Gay introduced as a magical addition was the masked ballroom dance that opens the TV film with its handsome lead player Mark Harmon enchanting the elderly widow. In Hitchcock's version the dance is shown fleetingly (twice), but the emphasis is on the lead character Charles avoiding the cops in a small hotel. Both are interesting opening sequences. But Karen Arthur needs to be complimented on choosing a fascinating alternative. In fact, the opening sequence of Arthur's version is the strongest element of the TV film.The second bit that is a startling difference between the two films is the insinuation of Arthur/Gay that Charles is not the real Charles but a masquerader while Hitchcock never seemed to dispute that it was the real Charles. Hitchcock even seemed to suggest a good child following a bicycle accident could develop into a devil with a distaste for wealthy widows.The third bit is Arthur's decision to cast Tippi Hedren in the film. Now Tippi Hedren had acted in Hithcock's "The Birds" and Hitch was known to have had a crush on Ms Hedren, according to historians. Hitchcock himself loved to refer to actors in previous films in later screenplays (Hitchcock's "Rope" includes a flippant remark about Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman in "Notorious"). Arthur seems to have followed the Hitchcock tradition in this casting.The fourth bit are the actions of the widow in the train towards the end of the film. I thought Ms Arthur did well in developing the vulnerability of wealthy widows to beguiling male charms. Hitchcock downplayed this element and concentrated on the lead character--and hence the shot of the widow on the train was brief.Though I liked Joseph Cotton in Hitchcock's film, I thought Mark Harmon's performance was not to be dismissed. All in all the film, Arthur's film is not better than the original but presents interesting new angles to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmm, so this is a remake of a Hitchcock movie? It would be absolutely moronic to compare the two movies in any way. There's really no point in doing so. Each has its own identity and they have no direct relation, they don't go together. The only thing this should be compared to is itself. And how does it stack up? Well, Diane Ladd was good, although, that whole early 50's perfect mom in the perfect neighborhood persona really got on my nerves. The father also annoying as he was just a spineless `yes, dear, whatever you say, dear puppet. Mark Harmon, on the other hand, he had it goin' on. Wow. He played the role of psycho strangler just excellently... he had practice (as Ted Bundy!) Margaret Welch played a little over the top but not bad in her role as Uncle Charlie's soulmate turned nemesis. Who'll win in the end and how? That was the question. There wasn't much mystery to this, just some dark suspense. A perfect movie it surely wasn't. It missed on several levels, I can't say exactly how but it left me unsatisfied at the end. All in all it was alright... My Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A flat remake of the 1943 Hitchcock film, which has has never been one of my favourites but did at least have atmosphere and decent performances, two elements lacking in this hopeless TV version. Mark Harmon replaces Joseph Cotton as Uncle Charlie, doted on by his family and his niece in particular. He turns up at their house to stay for a while, but beneath the jovial exterior may lie a dark secret - could he be the Merry Widow Murderer, on the run from the police? Don't expect the movie to crank up the tension. It's a bland affair, the story is loose and flappy, and pretty much every moment that worked in the original is bodged here. Harmon's performance gives too much away too early, draining the central tension of the plot. Meanwhile Tippi Hedren appears in a pointless cameo, one of two she made in films derived from Hitchcock originals (the other was 'The Birds II'). Ho hum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imagine your worst nightmare of a movie remake -- then imagine worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say enough about how bad this movie was. But due to space limitations I'll try to say a lot less. Can you imagine Mark Harmon stepping into Joseph Cotten's shoes? Neither could I. That's why I had to tune in to see what the result would be, and the result was? Fumble! Offsides! Out of bounds!Absolutely awful. But here's the thing - it has to be seen to be believed. If this pops up in your television listings, by all means tune in. Your friends will thank you for telling them about it.</fullReview>
