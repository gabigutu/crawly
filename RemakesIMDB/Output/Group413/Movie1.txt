		<shortDescription>The Master at his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I own the Hitchcock collection (14 films in toto), and while this isn't my favourite of the bunch ('Psycho' is one of my favourite movies of all time, and 'Birds' never gets old), I like to watch it every now and again to remind myself what it means to make a "suspense film", and why Hitchcock was and always will be the master of this craft.To give away even the slightest story detail would ruin it for new viewers, because it is essential that everyone begin with the wrong impressions of the major characters. This allows Hitch to pull off his famous 'twists' throughout the course of the movie, hitting you every now and then with something you simply weren't expecting.One of my favourite elements in the movie is the ongoing dialogue between Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn, avid mystery readers who are constantly discussing the best ways to murder each other. Apart from being a bit of comic relief in an otherwise very dark film, it also demonstrates how lightly people think of murder and murderers...until they encounter them face-to-face.My advice then, if you want to see this movie, is not to learn anything about it beforehand. Going in with no knowledge will increase the movie's initial impact, and will help you to appreciate why Hitchcock was the 'Master of Suspense'. This is a taut thriller with no gratuitous violence, foul language, or mature situations.(Hitch considered it 'a family film'.)Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncle Hitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Uncle Charlie did it for me. I mistrusted the uncle thing as a term of endearment ever since. Joseph Cotten is the perfect charming monster. Uncle Charlie's urbanity becomes his most frightening feature. So plausible. So real. Thornton Wilder was Hitchcock's partner in crime this time and it shows. The structure is Our Townish, the characters, deliciously rich. Patricia Collinge's performance is so spot on that you're longing for more. The scenes between Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn are how I imagine the story meetings between Thornton Wilder and Alfred Hitchcock. Teresa Wright's eyes tell the whole story from the audience's point of view, even if the audience is one step ahead of her. Brilliant, because in Joseph Cotten's eyes we find his need for redemption or are we falling in the trap of this master manipulator? We are torn, just like Teresa Wright. I've seen "Shadow of a Doubt" 3 or 4 times but every time you're forced to take the trip with the same amount of commitment. I've been toying with the thought of a remake, I've been doing this lately, although I hate the idea of remakes of great movies, this one is one of those that in the right hands could have a real impact. Using Thornton Wilder's original script as the Bible, Steven Sodebergh could do scrumptious remake for the new millennium. Tim Robbins as uncle Charlie, can you imagine? Natalie Portman as his niece. Joan Cusak and William H Macy as her parents. Wouldn't you go to see that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and brooding thriller from the master of suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is well known that this film is Alfred Hitchcock's favourite of his own oeuvre, and it's a big favourite of mine also. It is also well documented that for this film, Hitchcock stated that he "wants to bring violence back into the home, where it belongs" and he has certainly succeeded at doing that. Hitchcock spends much of the early screen time building up the family at the centre of the tale, and then allowing the violence to come to them, which shows Hitchcock's mastery of the medium as showing the story develop in this way makes the tale much more frightening than if we hadn't got to know the family at the centre of the story first. Joseph Cotten stars as uncle Charlie; a man fleeing Philadelphia to escape the law after marrying and then murdering several rich widows. He goes to stay with his sister and her family, which includes a husband, two young children and the eldest daughter; his niece and namesake; also called 'Charlie'.Hitchcock puts the focus of the story on young Charlie and her relationship with her uncle. This gives the story a frightening angle as it follows the classic tale of the strange uncle. It's also well done as young Charlie is shown to be the sweetest of characters, and when the dark uncle Charlie enters the fray, her sweet world is infected by nightmares, which also gives way to elements of the classic 'coming of age' tale to enter the proceedings. As if that wasn't enough, Shadow of a Doubt also exposes the trust we put in our loved ones, and how any person is likely to try and shift the blame, or ignore it completely, if their loved one has done wrong. This is shown by the way that young Charlie still attempts to cover for her beloved uncle even when all the evidence is pointing to him being guilty. Hitchcock has turned this thriller, which could easily have been routine, into a complex study of a family that retains it's interest throughout due to the multiple themes on display.Joseph Cotten was the absolute perfect choice to play uncle Charlie. His portrayal is picture perfect; he carries with him an atmosphere of dread and morbidity throughout, even when he's not doing anything wrong. A role of this sort is difficult to get right, as it's all to easy to underplay it so it isn't effective, or to overstate it so it becomes ridiculous; but Cotten gets the performance spot on. Teresa Wright, who stars alongside Cotten in the role of the other Charlie also does well and delivers a mature and assured performance that fits her character brilliantly. Some of the supporting roles look a little suspect at times, but on the whole the acting from the support is good enough.The ending of the film comes somewhat against the run of play and is maybe a little bit too over the top after the rest of the film, which is largely down to earth. However, it does work and a big ending isn't something I am in the habit of complaining about. This is up there with Hitchcock's best work and therefore is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliance From Hitchcock &amp; Cotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shadow of a Doubt" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most brilliant and most carefully-constructed films, and is further notable as one of the very finest performances of Joseph Cotten, in his role as "Uncle Charlie". Both the movie and the central character are thought-provoking and rich in detail.The film has an intriguing form that Hitchcock used a number of times (for example, in "Strangers on a Train" and "Frenzy"), that of setting up carefully constructed contrasts between two main characters, contrasts that in turn reflect a further complex of themes in the movie's broader setting and story. Here, the central contrast comes from the relationship between Uncle Charlie and his niece "young Charlie" (Teresa Wright). Their unusually close relationship creates tension and intrigue that go beyond the basic concern of the main story-line (which is, namely, whether Uncle Charlie is the elusive serial killer sought by the police). The uncle-niece relationship also mirrors a great many other topics explored by the film: most obviously the contrast between the small-town atmosphere of Santa Rosa, where Uncle Charlie has come to hide out with his sister's family, but also the complicated nature of the other relationships that we see. A fine supporting cast led by Henry Travers, Patricia Collinge, and Hume Cronyn help us focus in on hidden aspects of small-town family and neighborhood life."Shadow of a Doubt" is less known and celebrated than Hitchcock's 50's and early 60's work, and even than some of his 30's British films, most probably because it does not contain any of the director's famous set pieces, which were already a part of his pictures well before "Shadow of a Doubt" was made. After all, it is a movie about a suspected serial killer, and not only do we never see him kill anyone, he never even tries anything violent until much later in the film. But what "Shadow of a Doubt" lacks in the spectacular it makes up in tension and characterization, especially in Cotten's brilliant performance. He is by turns charming, calculating, suspicious, and menacing, a balance very difficult to maintain with credibility for an entire film. Cotten's skill and Hitchcock's direction make Uncle Charlie one of Hitchcock's most memorable characters.Though more slow-paced than most of the famous director's works, this is still one of his greatest, and should be very satisfying to any fan of Hitchcock, of Cotten, or of noirish/crime thrillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sometimes think that people who don't like this film, don't like it because you aren't bonked over the head by fancy special effects or being shown a bloody knife stuck in someone's back. Psychological thrillers take place in the mind, not splashed across the screen so you don't have to think but sit in your seat and watch all the pretty colors flash by!The acting is superb. Theresa Wright is a gem, and holds her own quite nicely against veteran actor, Joseph Cotton. What you need to look for in this film are the subtle cues given that build until Charlie suspects her beloved uncle is a murderer, and eventually even tries to kill her, not once but several times. Made when the world was at war, I find it especially disturbing to realize that evil could and can be anywhere. Even sitting around your own dining room table.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of his very best - I've loved it since I was a child!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shadow of a Doubt" may only be listed as #181 on IMDb's "Top 250" list, but in my opinion it far outweighs some of the films higher up on that list and is one of Hitch's very best films.Joseph Cotten plays Charlie, a crook on the run from the police. Left stranded and pursued, he decides to move in with his brother's family. His niece - who loves him and sees him as a sort of perfect role model - at first is excited that her Uncle Charlie is coming...but then things start to get strange. Charlie acts oddly and, at times, violent. She begins to become suspicious of her uncle as he becomes more suspicious of her own awareness.The ending of "Shadow of a Doubt" is classic Hitchcock and some of the best stuff he's done. The entire film is taut and suspenseful, well-filmed and realistic. It manages to focus on family ties and the struggles within the family itself while it also juggles the whole theme of an outcast family member.In the end, however, it's just a nail-biting thriller that - now over sixty years old - still reigns as one of the absolute best of its genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the greatest Hitchock classics of the 40's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ultimate master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock directed his fascinating masterpiece "Shadow of a doubt" at the age of 44 and it was a terrific improvement after the classic "Saboteur" which was definitely a great Hitch movie too, don't get me wrong here. Could it be more simple: this one just had a perfect story that really touched the audience and the whole wicked idea of finding out you have a killer uncle is most exciting when you think of it. It could happen to anybody, I'm sure. No wonder this was one of Hitchcock's own personal favorites. "Shadow of a doubt" may not be the finest Hitchcock-movie of the 40's, though. I admit I haven't seen all of them but I think "Rope" was ever better and "Spellbound" at least just as marvelous but it's safe to say this is one of the most stylish Hitchcock-movies of the decade. What a shame Joseph Cotten never became a bigger star because his powerful performance was one of the most memorable elements of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the standard Hitchcock stuff * MILD SPOILER*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shadow of a Doubt is classified as a Film Noir thriller. While I can see elements of film noir and elements of the thriller genre in this film, I think this film is more of a character study. It's a story about what happens when a soul-mate turns out to be somebody unexpected.The cast is excellent, and the lead characters - played by Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright - are very well imagined, written and portrayed. Both characters called for sweeping and dramatic personality changes which Wright and Cotten pulled off convincingly. Wright plays a very young woman (19-ish) living with her family and sort of depressed and aimless, while Cotten is her namesake and favorite uncle, Charlie. Uncle Charlie has come to visit and brought good cheer to the entire family, but shortly after his arrival, young Charlie begins to discover that Uncle Charlie has some sinister secrets. As the clues begin to add up to a coherent conclusion, Wright's character is forced to decide what to do about her growing, troublesome, understanding.In typical Hitchcockian fashion, the film toys with its audience for the first 3/4ths and does not reveal itself until its almost too late - playing on paranoia, misleading and ambiguous dialog, and terrific acting to create equivocation. However, as you will see, this is not the standard Hitchcock stuff - in the end it has more to do with the characters and what they do than the action and resolution of the ingenious plot.The Hitch' blows me away almost every time, and Shadow of a Doubt is one of his best. If you haven't seen it, you should. It's a very thoughtful and exquisitely executed character study about a very young and very bright woman, encountering the heavy side of life for the first time, and the choices she makes. Worth seeing for Wright's performance alone (easily Oscar-worthy), Shadow of a Doubt is a timeless piece of noir-esquire originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the kind of thing Hitchcock does, this is one of his best films. Not really a whodunit, for the identity of the [serial] killer's revealed early on.It therefore becomes a challenge to maintain high interest thereafter. This is done through fine performances, direction, photography and production values.Cast against type, Joesph Cotton is wonderful--a perfect ironic Hitchcock villain: charming, sweet-talking, and suave. The kind unsuspecting, vulnerable widows might be drawn to. Cotton's own personality works magic in bringing out all the nuances of personality in this role.One of the most talented of actors, Teresa Wright, is cast in the lead role. Her enormous talent and thespian integrity are put to the test here, and they triumph in a great performance. Like Cathy O'Donnell, another sweet, girl-next-door type, Wright's persona ran out early in Hollywood, and she was prematurely pushed into matronly roles. A shame, for there was none finer than Wright.The script and production is clean, concise, sharp and economic, and "Shadow of a Doubt" remains one of Hitch's greatest cinematic achievements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Average families are the best"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's style as a director was a bit like a train ? it ran perfectly well, but only along its own lines. He wasn't comfortable adapting his style to suit the material, but when the material suited his style he could do incredible things.Three years and five pictures into his Hollywood career, Hitch had been having some trouble finding projects he was comfortable with. He had made a couple of adventure thrillers in the vein of his late 30s British films, but the old magic wasn't there. Finally, with Shadow of a Doubt he came upon a project that was right up his street. It represents a welcome return to the domestic murder dramas that had given him his earliest successes (The Lodger, Blackmail), with a storyline ideal for Hitchcock. It is the purest example of murder in a "normal" setting, bringing the audience uncomfortably close to the killer, helped along with plenty of the grisly gallows humour that the Master loved.Hitch's British pictures had great charm and character, but they were often technically a little haphazard. By now though he knows exactly how to use the camera to manipulate the audience. He begins by carrying us into the story, sweeping in over the city through scenery both pretty and ugly, to home in on an average looking neighbourhood. From then on, every shot, move and edit is calculated to keep up the suspense and unfold the plot. Whereas those early films were swamped and sometimes spoiled by showy camera tricks, Hitch now uses those techniques sparingly, like playing a trump card. For example, he has Joseph Cotton look directly into the camera for a brief moment as he snatches the newspaper back from Theresa Wright. Another trick is to have the camera dolly back as a character advances, only at a faster speed than the actor is moving, which gives a very dizzying effect.Special mention should also be made of Dimitri Tiomkin's score. Tiomkin was the best composer Hitch worked with before Bernard Hermann, and one of the few who really understood how a Hitchcock film needs to be scored. His sparse string arrangements really capture that sense of spiralling terror without overpowering the scene and turning it into melodrama. He interpolates Franz Lehar's Merry Widow waltz at just the right level, making it noticeable but never overstated? throwing in just a bar or two at an opportune moment, sometimes disguising it in a minor key.We also have a great cast lined up here. This is among Joseph Cotton's finest performances, which is unusual because Hitch was not a brilliant director of actors. I believe the reason is that, although his soft, honest features meant he usually played clean-cut good guys (as well as making him the perfect choice for the friendly uncle no-one would suspect), he was actually at his best when playing villains. That air of affected friendliness, which gives way to a deadpan monotone, is ironically far more convincing than when he attempted to play genuine niceness. Theresa Wright also does a brilliant job of handling her character's transition from childlike innocence to knowing cynicism. The icing on the cake is a couple of spot-on comic relief supporting parts from Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn.It's quite appropriate that in his cameo for Shadow of a Doubt, Hitchcock is shown holding all the cards, because here he really did have all the elements working in his favour. It marks the beginning of his golden age and lays down the blueprint for such classics as Rear Window, Vertigo and Psycho. This is about as close to perfect as Hitchcock's pictures get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Cotten's triumphs; Hitchcock's film is not unconventional, but unabashedly gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that strikes many who come upon Shadow of a Doubt, one of this filmmaker's triumphs, is the knowledge that it was Hitchcock's favorite among his own films- and many watch it with very high expectations, getting shot down as well, making it one of his more under-rated efforts. True, it doesn't go for the immense macabre that lay in Psycho, The Birds, and Frenzy, but it is very effective in telling its stories, and giving us character to either love, or love to hate.The whole concept to the story is very appealing- a (painfully) normal suburban family gets a calling from a relative- Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten)- who wants to come by for a little while. The oldest daughter, also named Charlie (Teresa Wright), almost feels like a kindred spirit to her uncle, happy as can be that he's come to visit. Things start to unravel, however, when two detectives on his trail come into town, bringing to young Charlie to light what could be going down, or what might not be, or what is as clear as psychopathic day.It's actually of interest to compare this film to Psycho, I think, in how it's so akin to to how Hitchcock tells the story of the ordinary people of the world getting involved with a certifiable gentlemen. And, perhaps, one could argue (I might, up to a point) that Cotten's performance rivals that of a Perkins' Norman Bates leading male in the sense of subtleties of the suspense in the film. He seems so... calm so much in the film, and even when he shows his hand as to who he really is, there's a lot of depth to his personality. We may hate him, but he is an understandable, frighteningly recognizable monster. And it solidifies in my book that Cotten had a wonderful range in his work, when he could go from playing a Jed Leland in Citizen Kane to this film, and then on to The Third Man's Holly Martins. Here, he digs into the character and you'll either find it unconvincing in the 40's sense, or a knock-out. As for Teresa Wright, she finds some good notes as well in playing off of Cotten, even in the earlier scenes. And those kids are just the right icing to the cake the film cooks up.It may take a couple of viewings to really warm up to this film, or you may like it right away. But Shadow of a Doubt contains not only fine acting, but also some trademark Hitchcock camera stylizing. My favorites included a particular shot closing in from medium close-up to extreme close-up on Uncle Charlie when he's in a memorable monologue at the dinner table. Another is the use of the dark value on the characters when they talk outside. And, of course, a climax that is genuine in theatricality. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quiet, remarkable thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Top-drawer Hitchcock. It's got everything you'd expect from the director - although he's sparing with his usual tropes of tension-building. The story is strong enough without it.From the start there's something different about this film, something that one only really encounters in Psycho. Following the ballroom titles (David Lynch cannot possibly have begun Mulholland Drive unaware of this tiny, recurring set piece) we meet the first protagonist Charlie (Joseph Cotten). He's in a state closer to that of Camus' disengaged fumeur Meursault than any other conventional leading man. The rest of the film pans out in this ambiguous way. Whomsoever Charlie meets or has to engage with, his manner is wretchedly bipolar - either violent or ebullient. His is the world-wearied end of the family that he goes to visit. This much steadier, morally ring-fenced world has it's own version of Uncle Charlie in the eldest daughter by the same name. Teresa Wright (a dead ringer for Ellen Page) has all his sensitivity but none of his front-line experience of life. The film charts her awakening.A brilliant, adult and humorous film I found myself laughing out loud and close to tears - the unsullied joy of the family at the opening is disarmingly unaffected. It's also one of the most sexually electric films I've seen in a very long time. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten are excellent in slow-paced Hitch thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Using the small town of Santa Rosa, California as his backdrop, Hitch takes his time in unwinding a tale about a serial killer (Joseph Cotten) who comes to town on a family visit. Slowly the suspense builds as his niece (Teresa Wright) begins to suspect that he may be the Merry Widow killer who courts wealthy women for financial gain. Against the everyday small town life of its participants, the story unfolds in a leisurely way--perhaps too slow for today's taste. Admittedly, there are some dull stretches--but midway through the story the relationship between Cotten and Wright gets us caught in the story and we have to follow it to conclusion. Macdonald Carey, Hume Cronyn, Patricia Collinge and Henry Travers are all splendid in supporting roles. Hitch uses Agatha Christie's favorite device--telling a story of murder against a mundane setting. Tighter editing might have made this more watchable, but still highly recommended as one of his best earlier works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock does it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of his most chilling and memorable intrigues Alfred Hitchcock lays bare the myth of small town virtue with a perverse piece of Americana about a wholesome family unaware of the gruesome skeleton lurking in its closet. The arrival of everyone's much loved Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton, in his favorite role) is the catalyst to disaster, with eldest daughter Charlie in particular welcoming the arrival of her affectionate namesake as a relief from the humdrum routine of suburban life. But evidence soon begins to suggest the elder Charles might actually be a cold-blooded serial killer, and a lethal game of charades begins between uncle and niece: she knows the truth, and he knows that she knows the truth. The tension builds to an alarming climax, in a trademark sequence (another one for the Hitchcock highlight reel) showing the Master of Suspense at the top of his form. The film was shot in sunny Santa Rosa, California, where the shadows are darker because the sunlight is so much brighter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Hitchcock Comes to Middle America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been reported that the primary appeal of doing "Shadow of a Doubt" for Alfred Hitchcock was the idea of bringing a sense of menace to a small, every day American town. In that, this movie brilliantly succeeds. It doesn't join "Rear Window" or "Psycho" as one of my favorite Hitchcock films, but it has much to recommend it.Joseph Cotten didn't get many chances to play a sinister villain, but he's very good at it. His natural ease and charm work to his advantage in creating a smarmy character who you're never completely sure about. He has a lot of chemistry with Teresa Wright, who plays his niece and supposedly has a closer than normal connection with him. In fact, in typical Hitchcock fashion, their relationship in the early scenes of this film takes on a sort of creepy romantic quality that's never overtly addressed but is always there as subtext.As Wright begins to suspect that her Uncle Charlie might not be such a great guy after all--and may in fact be much worse than simply not a great guy--the balance of power shifts and she begins to play against him. One of the things I liked most about this movie was how strong a character Wright's Charlie is allowed to be. She's not a ninny, like a character in her situation would be in any number of other films. She doesn't swoon, cry and squeal helplessly. After Uncle Charlie tries to kill her by locking her in a garage with a running car, and she comes to looking directly into his face, she doesn't bite her knuckles as you might expect, but rather says with a cold hard determination, "Go away." It's very effective, and the whole movie is like that.It has a great supporting cast, both well cast and acted. There's not a throwaway character among the bunch, and everyone makes much of varying sized roles. Patricia Collinge is a stand out as Uncle Charlie's sister, whose radar is going off even as she doesn't want to believe anything sinister can be happening. Henry Travers is the father of the family...his attitudes toward Charlie change after he comes to the bank where he works and makes inappropriate jokes. It wasn't until the end credits that I even realized who Hume Cronyn was playing; I've never seen him so young."Shadow of a Doubt" isn't as obviously distinguished visually as other Hitchcock films, but it bears his unmistakable mark nonetheless. There aren't as many shots you come away from the film remembering as there are in, say, "Rear Window." But the whole thing has the feeling of being completely controlled from beginning to end. I really liked the way small-town America was portrayed in this film. It's not full of a bunch of rubes who say things like "aw shucks" and do silly things for us to laugh at. Hitchcock is skillful at showing the contrast between the small-town life of young Charlie's family and Uncle Charlie's jaded big-city life of crime. But he doesn't condescend or patronize.If you want to see higher-tier Hitchcock, you could do much worse than this film. It's got an engaging story, wonderful acting and complex characters, and a few scenes that qualify as genuine nail biters. Very good! Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Just An Unlce And A Niece. There's Something Else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no little known fact that Hitchcock was among the pioneers of the suspense thriller genre. With 'Shadow of a Doubt' he creates another suspensefilled chilling drama. I must be very careful with what I reveal of the story for it is important for the viewer to be'deceived' when they first 'meet' the characters.Starting with the look of the film, well things definitely aren't what they seem. I liked the setting of the town. It really captured that small-town feel. The music was a little over the top at times but then again it does add to the Hitchockian feel. Camera-work is exceptionally good.The screenplay is solid. I especially liked the dialogues and how toned they were. The comic relief is very well placed and it certainly had me laughing. The performances are remarkable. Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten are superb. Their on screen interaction is intriguing and brilliantly executed. Patricia Collinge is outstanding as the mother and sister. Hume Cronyn is very funny.I only thought that the portrayal of the two detectives was a little odd. They were quite stupid. In addition, the romance between the detective and young Charley felt rushed.So there are a couple of little flaws but 'Shadow of a Doubt' still is among Hitchcock's awesome pictures. Hitchock himself said that it's his favourite film and I can see why.</fullReview>

Although he seems a good man, his young niece (Teresa Wright)slowly comes to aware he is a wanted merry widow killer and he comes to recognize her malignant suspicions. The suspicious uncle Charlie gradually becoming stronger and mysterious. Meantime two detectives (Mcdonald Carey and Wallace Ford) are investigating. Further developments ensure an exciting climax on train.From the story by Gordon McConnell, the picture gets unlimited suspense in crescendo, tense, full of lingering frames and with the typical touches Hitchcock. Besides a literately and thoughtful dialog signed by Thornton Wilder and Alma Reville (Hitchcock's usual screenwriter and wife) though lacking humor . After his successful British films as ¨39 steps¨ and ¨Jamaica Inn¨ , Hitch was encouraged to go to America and promptly shot his first work in Hollywood hired by the great producer David O'Selznick ; later on he directed this excellent picture . Fine performance by Joseph Cotten as sunny and cynic uncle Charlie . Teresa Wright as shy and glad young is superb and enjoyable . Likable couple formed by Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn in his film debut , booth of whom speaking continuously about murders. And of course cameo role by Alfred Hitchcock , this time as a man on train playing cards. Atmospheric and perceptible music by the maestro Dimitri Tiomkin, including piano sounds . Sensational visual style in black and white cinematography by the cameraman by Joseph Valentine . This interesting movie is brilliantly directed by the Master Hitchcock, resulting to be his favorite personal. It's remade in 1958 in quite inferior remake titled ¨Step down to terror¨ by Harry Keller with Charles Drake, Rod Taylor,Jocelyn Brando and Josephine Hutchinson, furthermore a lousy Television movie. The motion picture is indispensable watching for Hithcock lovers achieving the maximum impact on his audience. Rating : Very good, engrossing and essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>......be like if some smiling killer showed up in Dennis the Menace's neighborhood I guess. I have seen many many of Hitch's flix, but somehow this one had eluded me til I got the DVD a couple days ago. So what did I think? Few things--it Does have a couple weaknesses: Droopalong pace, Charlie's inexplicable rapid 'Key to the City' rise simply because(why? He came in on a train and had some money? what gives?), and the implausible freedom given the, ummm, survey-takers in a private home. Riggggggghttttt.....What works? About everything else-Terry Wright's great fragile heroine, Cotton's smiling killer in a suit, the dithering Mother, 'Clarence' as the harmless helpful father, and of course fun bits by Hume Cronyn and the little bespectacled daughter. I liked that stuff.You gotta like as well the usual Hitch trademarks-clouds of smoke billowing behind a villain, near-fatal 'accidents' in the backyard around the home, some rather nasty things more than hinted at during the movie but never stated out-right.I have been wondering, for example, as sick as this sounds, was there an incestuous connection between the two Charlies? You def. know that Joseph Cotton harbors Very inappropriate feelings towards Young Charlie, some reviewers seem to think that this was more than just implied. There was def. a lot Wrong in that family below the surface, i know that.Anyways--good solid flick, well done all in all.*** outta **** or so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be Careful What You Wish For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Alfred Hitchcock's "Shadow Of A Doubt", suspicion and suspense develop side by side when fears start to grow that the arrival of a visitor in Santa Rosa, California, could threaten the tranquillity of the small town, the calm lifestyle of a very conventional family and also the life of a teenage girl. The story unfolds at a pace which is consistent with the sleepy surroundings in which it's set and contains moments of menace, misogyny, conflict and black humour. An uneasy atmosphere also prevails as it becomes increasingly apparent that beneath the community's respectable veneer something very dangerous exists.Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright) is a teenage girl who suffers extreme boredom living in an environment where everything is well ordered and predictable and she longs desperately for some excitement. The promise of this soon comes when her favourite uncle from Philadelphia arrives to stay with her family. Uncle Charles (Joseph Cotton) is a charming and successful businessman, her mother's brother and also the member of the family after whom she was named. Their names are not all that Charlie and her uncle share as they're also connected by a telepathic link and an example of this is seen when Uncle Charles gives his niece a ring and she starts to hum the same piece of music that he had on his mind at the time ("The Merry Widow Waltz").Soon after Uncle Charles' arrival, the family is visited by two men who work for a national polling organisation and they arrange with Mrs Newton (Patricia Collinge) for the entire family to be interviewed and photographed but Uncle Charles is clearly uncomfortable about this and refuses to cooperate. One of the men, Jack Graham (MacDonald Carey) later dates Charlie and confides in her that he's actually a detective who's checking up on her uncle as he's one of two suspects that are under investigation. Charlie is also then asked not to tell her family about the investigation.When her uncle hides a page from her father's newspaper, Charlie goes to the local library, peruses their copy and finds that the page in question carried a story about a hunt being carried out for the "Merry Widow Murderer". Furthermore she discovers that the initials engraved on the ring she was given by her uncle match those of one of the murder victims. A nightmare she has about her uncle running away from something, a speech he gives at dinner about his hatred of widows and his attitude to taking part in the survey, all serve to strengthen her strong suspicions that he's a murderer.Charlie's suspicions and the fact that she's unable to warn her family about the danger that lurks in their midst make her increasingly anxious and creates a conflict within her as she struggles to reconcile her contradictory impulses. Things get even worse however, when Uncle Charles realises what Charlie knows and as a consequence, her life is put in jeopardy.Knowing just how devastating it would be for her mother to find out the unpalatable truth about her favourite brother, Charlie readily cooperates with the detectives in a plan to resolve their case in a way which avoids scandal and saves her family from being disgraced by the associated fall out.The suspense in this movie is relieved periodically by some humorous moments which mostly arise from the exchanges between Charlie's father Joseph (Henry Travers) and his neighbour Herbie (Hugh Cronyn) who are both avid murder mystery buffs who enjoy discussing ideas for committing the perfect murder.The two characters at the heart of this story seem so strongly connected that they're almost like one entity within which good and evil, naivety and sophistication and also innocence and wickedness all coexist. This is symptomatic of the theme of duality which is present throughout the entire film and can be seen in the number of doubles featured (two Charlies, two detectives, two suspects, two attempts on Charlie's life etc).High angle shots are used effectively at certain points but the one in the library when Charlie has just discovered the information about the "Merry Widow Murderer" is outstanding. Similarly, interesting use is made of close-ups but the one which makes the most impact is seen when Uncle Charles makes his speech in which he viciously attacks the lifestyles and appearances of wealthy widows.The talented cast bring their characters to life convincingly and the events which follow Charlie's craving for excitement bring to mind the advice to "be careful what you wish for".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable, linear plot, and just plain bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh...how annoyed I was after watching this movie. Heralded as Hitchcock's finest, I was impressed by the IMDb.com score it received and I settled in for a wonderful film noir/suspense experience. What resulted was a blatantly boring linear plot w/many unbelievable plot points that were very annoying, and an unsatisfying ending. First I will mention the one great thing about this film: the plot which is superb in its own right although poorly executed by the "Shadow" in this case and the acting of Joseph Cotton. I watched Cotton in other films--very bland in "Gaslight" for example and thought he did an outstanding job showing uneasiness with the fear of being suspected as the murderous villain. So great acting range from him made the movie tolerable. This is about all the praise the movie deserves. The beginning reels you in with a clever and suspenseful look at Cotton hiding out in his rented room trying to avoid men pursuing him. The interest vanishes however in the viewer when Cotton arrives to California to visit/hide out with his family. What follows is the niece's attempt at discovering why her uncle (Cotton) is acting so strangely. Suddenly this innocent girl transforms into a Sherlock Holmes with an esp-like ability to guess/predict everything about her uncle's doings/identity. Other than Cotton, the rest of the acting is forgettable in the movie. Somehow w/no explanation the cops are hot on Cotton's trail!! He traveled from east coast to west coast and within a short time the cops know who he is and where he is?? The problem with this movie, is there is just no suspense; also I felt it was impossible that a smart criminal like Cotton was outsmarted by his young/innocent niece with really no hard facts to go on. These are the little details that kept happening throughout the movie that made it very unsatisfying. Oh yeah, and what really nailed it for me was the ending: Cotton struggles w/his niece on a train, between the carts, and she shoves him to his death off the train (done w/atrocious special effects by the way). A 6ft 2in 200lb man being outwrestled by his 5ft 5 100lb niece? I would not mind this lack of believability if it was a minor part in a movie that served to advance some minor plot point, but this was THE most important part of the movie, the climax where it all ends and comes to a point. It was a huge letdown. If you enjoy a good story, find a book version of this movie, because Hitchcock's linear approach makes it all but impossible to be surprised at what happens for the next hour and a half of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misogynist who prayed on women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shadow of a Doubt is a film with the hallmark signature which defines it as one directed by Hitchcock. This is exemplified by unique camera angles,delivery of character dialogue, set pieces, and of course the suspense. As is the way of Hitchcock, he has a knack of making the actors fit neatly into their character roles. This is particularly the case of Joseph Cotton, who plays a sinister character in Uncle Charlie, who is only made to appear clean living by being placed into the context of residing with the all American, Church going family. Therefore it is by making Uncle Charlie at odds with his clean living family, which creates the intensity, and suspense for the audience who know different, in that it realises all along that he is not all that he appears to be.Uncle Charlie relies heavily on his relationship with his niece and name sake Charlie to make him appear like butter wouldn't melt. However, as soon as Niece Charlie puts two and two together and comes to realise the truth about her Uncle the close relationship between them deteriorates at a rapid pace. But, it is less the fact that niece Charlie realises what her uncle really is, but it is because she is growing into a woman that Charlie doesn't like. In becoming a woman niece Charlie now represents all that her uncle can't abide. And it is this misogynistic streak in Uncle Charlie that compels him to attempt to murder his niece, as opposed to what she knows of him.In all, this film has an excellent cast who give their all for Sir Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mere Shadow of a Previous Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen about thirty (30) of Hitchcock's films, this is the first time I've had any complaints. This film was not bad, but certainly not one of Hitch's best. It was oddly choppy and hard to follow, far too slow, and not mysterious enough. Worst of all, there was NO "shadow" of a doubt. We are lead to believe with 'certainty' that the suspect is the killer! In short, the movie was frustrating for two reasons:1) The characters seemed oblivious to the plot. There was no chance for any of them to catch a killer. This certainly added to the tension, but not to the realism. There are ways of making suspects talk, but the characters never employed any of them. For me, what should have been suspense, just ended up as frustration. Maybe I'm missing something, but characters have to be intelligent, not just suspicious.2) Secondly, this movie was way too similar to THE LODGER (1926). Having seen THE LODGER first, it was hard to sit through this one. Both stories involve a suspected merciless killer living in an ordinary family home. The stories are so similar in fact, that they could probably share the same title. Unfortunately, this movie takes something away from THE LODGER, a remarkable first effort and one of Hitch's most intense films. Anyone who views SHADOW prior to LODGER is making a grave mistake. There are just too many similarities for both movies to grab your attention and pull you in.Alas, I found SHADOW OF A DOUBT to be just average, based on its redundancy. The ending was entertaining, but overall it was hard to watch. Slow at first, with ignorant characters and poor editing, I have to give this one an average score: 6 out of 10. Had this movie been entitled "The Lodger", I would probably bump it up to an 8, taking an average of the two. If you are looking for Hitchcock recommendations, please see REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, REBECCA, THE ROPE, and THE LODGER. These are my top five. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's first masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shadow of a Doubt is perhaps Hitchcock's first real masterpiece - a more mature film than The 39 Steps or Rebecca. It is also incidentally his favorite of his own films. The sleepy town of Santa Rosa is far removed from the very real events of WW-2, events that figured at least a mention if not a central influence on most films of that period. Hitchcock's Rear Window and Vertigo were also far removed from the realities of the Cold War and the Communist Witch-Hunts of the 50's.Shadow is taut with sexual tension - the incestuous overtones of the mental affinity of niece and uncle Charlie, the lusty infatuations of Charlie's teenage friend Catherine, and Herb, who just happens to be around the corner where ever we see Charlie. Charlie, the niece, is played by Teresa Wright in one of Hitchcock's best female performances. She is very warm, innocent and genuinely good-natured - completely unlike Hitch's usual icy blonds. I have always found Joseph Cotten to be quite inexpressive. He is slightly better than his usual self and is believable in charming and winning over the small town-folk.This is probably Hitchcock's only film with a strong human core, coupled with his well-known skills as a master technician. What other director of the era could have revealed the murderer at the start of the film and still maintained tension and a lingering unease throughout. Shadow of a Doubt is a precursor to the menace of Blue Velvet and the sexual tensions of American Beauty - and stays with you much longer than either of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Old Uncle Charlie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't believe Shadow of a Doubt will rank as one of Alfred Hitchcock's best film. But second rank Hitchcock is better than most people's best efforts. Joseph Cotten has come for a visit to Santa Rosa, California to see his sister Patricia Collinge and her family. They welcome him as the prodigal brother. But his very perceptive niece named after him played by Teresa Wright suspects something is wrong with this picture.Uncle Charlie is suspected of being a serial killer with the monniker of The Merry Widow Killer. He strangles rich old widows and robs them. I guess it's a living, albeit one with risks.Those risks are getting to him and on some levels you see Cotten almost wants to be caught. In fact Teresa starts to suspect him over a trivial incident involving her dad's paper. Cotten goes to great lengths to hide a feature story about The Merry Widow Murders. When she goes to the library to see what was in the paper that he didn't want the family to see, this is when she starts figuring it out.Really all Cotten had to do is nothing. But he really did want it to end. I'm not sure any player ever had such an auspicious beginning in such top rated films as Teresa Wright. In the space of three years she appeared in The Little Foxes, Mrs. Miniver, Pride of the Yankees and now Shadow of a Doubt. She's a Nancy Drew if Nancy had ever discovered there was a criminal who was a close relative.Patricia Collinge essentially repeats her role from The Little Foxes. If she's not quite as daft as Miss Birdie, she's still kind of operating within her own world. Henry Travers does fine as her husband as does Hume Cronyn as his partner in their own make believe world of crime.Of course giving a big assist to Ms. Wright's suspicions is the presence of detectives MacDonald Carey and Wallace Ford. They are a team chasing Cotten as one of two men they think is the Merry Widow Killer.One thing with this film is that unlike Suspicion, Hitchcock stood firm and did not bow to pressure to exonerate Cotten like he did with Cary Grant in the previous film. Of course Cotten was fairly new to the cinema so he could be cast as a villain. And Hitchcock does what he does best, toy with the audiences emotions. Like Suspicion when a whole lot of things happen to Teresa Wright they can be explained away and there is that red herring of that other suspect across the continent.Of course the other part of Shadow of a Doubt is how the thing is resolved in regard to Cotten's family. The ending might be a bit too pat, but still it does tie up the loose ends in the best way for all concerned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brilliant, subtle film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't care much for this film when I first saw it in college. I liked the romantic, humorous Hitchcock of Lady Vanishes and North by Northwest. But I've seen it twice since over the last 30 years, and each time liked it more than the time before.This time I was struck by the amazing subtleties and details. I love the heroine's pretentious angst in the beginning (good to know angsty teens are just a modern invention). I loved the slow build of the plot, and how well you are forced to consider what would you do in such an extraordinary case.But what I mainly love is Joseph Cotton's brilliant, dead-on performance as a psychopath. Genial and charming, he will flash a dangerous fury for just a moment then veer back to charming and easygoing without in blink of an eye. You see him smile and then, when no one is looking, you see the smile turn to calculation. He is chilling because you can both see how dangerous he is as well as why no one else can see it.I also love the many subtle ways they create the connection between the girl and her uncle, a relationship that at times looks dangerously close to a flirtation.While this is one of Hitchcock's least flashy films, if you go into it knowing that, you will be well rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thornton Wilder visits the dark side when evil comes to our town.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Hitchcock movie that still works very well today. Joseph Cotten is remarkably passive in the opening, something that stays with him till he sees his niece, Charlotte "Charlie" Newton, played by Teresa Wright. The movie belongs to those two. Macdonald Carey was so young I didn't recognize him playing Charlotte's love interest, and this is Hume Cronyn's first screen appearance. Patricia Collinge is great as Charlotte's mother (Emma Oakley Newton), the sister of the sinister Charles Oakley (Cotten). Charlotte is named after her mother's brother, and there are jokes throughout that the two are twins, telepathically connected.We know that something's wrong with Charles Oakley from the beginning, but we haven't a clue what it is. When he arrives at sunny Santa Rosa, California, on the steam train, we get to my favorite scene. I have no idea how Hitchcock pulled it off. The train steams into the station trailing a black cloud of exhaust which covers the sky and casts a dark shadow over the whole scene - Charles is here. It's like "MacBeth" when the witches say, "Something wicked this way comes."Cotten is great as Uncle Charlie. Smooth, affable, courteous when it pays for him. I got more out of watching him with his back to the camera than most actors give me when they face the camera. Cotten knew how to sell Charlie to me just by how he stood and walked. You know Charlie is a very dangerous sociopath without ever knowing why you know it or what the danger really is. Collinge's Emma is beautiful as the loving, gracious sister with no clue what her little brother has become.Teresa Wright plays the main character, the hero. This is not a typical Hitchcock movie where the hero is a good guy trapped in a bad man's clothes from which he must extricate himself and convince the cops he didn't do it. Charlotte is a good girl leaving no doubt about her goodness. The issue is coming to grips with the evil Charlie brings into their home. Wright is great as we see her spiral from joy to despair as Charlie's nature begins to expose itself. The conflict is how to protect Emma from knowing the real Charlie.Thornton Wilder contributed to the screenplay, and the beginning when we see Charlotte and her family is pure Wilder - families are supposed to be happy, they talk, they are all adults (even the 9-year-old). But as Charlie works his way on the Newtons, things get dark. "Our Town" goes sour as death becomes all too real. Charlie takes Charlotte where she's never been before. It's a place where no small-town girl before World War II needs to go, a place she shouldn't even know exists. Sally Benson was co-screenwriter for this movie. She may be best known for her short stories of growing up in St. Louis, which were made into "Meet Me in St. Louis," directed by Vincent Minnelli and starring Judy Garland (although Benson did the screenplay for "Viva Las Vegas," too.) How you get from happy, frothy musicals to foreboding Santa Ana is a mystery.Alma Reville also gets screenwriter credit. She was Hitchcock's wife, so I'm guessing where the darkness came from. Mystery solved. Nothing like being married to Alfred Hitchcock to bring out the darkness in one's soul.And Hitchcock knew his way around a set with a camera. He used the sets here with his usual greatness, giving us shots of Charlie and Charlotte that emphasized their dynamic relationship. Good and evil was black and white in those days, and although we're offered an excuse for Charlie's sociopathy it doesn't really hold water. Hitchcock doesn't really care how Charlie got that way; the issue here is Charlie and Charlotte. The tension is from Charlotte's journey of discovery, not Charlie's. And the sexual tension between them is palpable though never explicit.It's a movie that still grips the viewer. Teresa Wright was good as Charlotte, and Joseph Cotten was superb as Uncle Charlie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Master's graduate course in Misanthropy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film which many tell us was hitch's favorite is truly an astonishing display of the master's brilliance. Like Rear Window, it deals with hitch's favorite topic: the dark underbelly of human nature. David Lynch tried and failed miserably to imitate this film in his nihilistic Blue Velvet. The first thing to see is the characterizations are lifelike; the damaged fragile mother living within her childhood memories of uncle charlie. Theresa Wright's Charlie is indeed the head of the house and shares, at first, her mother's idealizations of good old uncle charlie. What hitch does spatially in Rear Window with the different apartments containing different ways of being or dasein, hitch uses interiors here instead. The characters are all cloistered within the house but where in Window external events hint at deviations from the ideal view of wonderful loving people, here we get personality deviations. Spoilers Ahead: Uncle Charlie's misogyny starts as odd eccentric remarks about fat useless widows. Joe the father and Herbie have a very bizarre interest in discussing how to murder people. One really misses what hitch is doing if u do not see that the joe \ herbbie interactions are just as central as the growing disillusionment charlie has with her malevolent uncle. The climax when he is unmasked in the bar telling charlie that the world is a foul pigsty and people are all swine is one of hitch's best verbal scenes on celluloid. The film has been criticized as simply not that suspenseful but please it is about disillusionment; the terror of discovery many of us share of finding out that maybe this or that person may be quite different beneath the mask. Charlie's concern is to shield her fragile mother from the monster her brother has become; she almost dies for this noble effort. Hitch always wants us to see that all is not flowers and light often right under our very noses. This is why the film resonates through the ages and will outlive all of us. Growing older and disillusionment are sadly often synonyms. How in each of us is charlie; full of dreams, hope and love idealizing the world and the people within it. It still, by the way, works very well as an above average thriller with great character development and a career defining moment for Joesph Cotten. He shines in a most unflattering role like Anthony Perkins did in Psycho. Pure darkness in human form without needing to shoot, stab, curse or explode his enemies; if only our current filmmakers could learn from Alfred. The core is the darkness in each of us; Charlie defeats uncle charlie by a chance of fate. She is changed forever; she will never again be that happy peaceful child she was at the beginning.

		<shortDescription>That's what suspense is all about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first of many of Hitchcock's well-known masterpieces. While most of his earlier works were stupendous and truly suspenseful, Shadow of a Doubt brought thriller genre to whole another level. It's a story so dramatic and nightmarish in its subject matter, and so rich and captivating in its performances. The narrative doesn't stop to build-up the suspense, and while the viewer knows for most of the time what's really going on, the true quality of the movie comes from the fact that the players don't know, and we're anxious all the time, being unable to help them in any way. That's true realism of this tale. And it's also disturbing. A story about a girl, who becomes convinced that her mysterious uncle is a deadly killer on-the-loose, but isn't able to convince other family members, as there are too little clues and evidence. Great juxtaposition of two marvelous actors, Joseph Cotten as an uncle-from-hell and Theresa Wright as the overly suspicious, yet astute girl with a bold attitude. A genuine psychological thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the saddest films I've ever seen, because what could be sadder than disillusionment and thwarted love? The two Charlies are kindred spirits meant but never destined to discover their true selves in and through each other. Joseph Cotten (Uncle Charlie) is weary, impulsive, duplicitous, caustic, menacing, and homicidal. Teresa Wright is perfectly cast as his naive but resourceful niece, infatuated with her cunning, forsaken uncle. A story of innocence and experience, an ironic tale of the dark forms self-loathing can take (in Uncle Charlie, it vies with ambition -- itself vying with misanthropic ((or merely misogynist?)) rage. This is nearly Fantasy -- Cotten might be a demon conjured by Wright to help her shed her dream world and translate her sparkling self into the realm of the sluggishly, obtusely, living. But Uncle Charlie is real enough to the widows he's strangled, and little Charlie is his last victim. She lives to learn at the expense of innocence and some of her capacity for love, and bears the burdensome bequeathment of her uncle's true nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every family has their ups and downs....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie and Charles are an extremely close niece and uncle who can read each other's minds, even seemingly across the country. Their ESP between each other is dangerous. Charlie (Teresa Wright) was named after her mother's much younger brother (Joseph Cotten), and even though they haven't seen each other in years, they adore each other. But even though they can read each other like a clock, Charlie can't quite figure out at first what secret her newly arrived uncle is hiding from the family. Charles is obviously on the run, because he has escaped from his New Jersey boarding house to his sister's house in the small city of Santa Rosa, California. Once there, Charles mixes right in with the family even though Charlie and her precocious younger sister Anne sense something is up. Anne is hysterically brainy, as evidenced in her first scene, answering the telephone from the telegraph company. "I'm saving my mind for more important things", she tells the operator. Charlie's father Henry Travers and neighbor Hume Cronyn spend hours plotting to outdo each other with causes, motives and clues concerning murder, an ironic hobby considering Traver's brother-in-law Cotten. But Charles can't keep his secret for long, and Wright begins to figure out why she has strange premonitions, the plot thickens. A trek to the library (with fabulous character actress Eily Maylon as the librarian) reveals all, and from there, Cotten is ripe to be picked.There is no real mystery, just the exciting revelation of what Cotten's crime is. Like Hitchcock later did in "Strangers on a Train", he turns popular music sinister; in this case, it's the "Merry Widow Waltz", and it ends up a theme for a total sociopath. "Shadow of a Doubt" and "Strangers on a Train" (using "The Strawberry Blonde") were effective enough to lead Hitchcock create the spooky glass-shattering music played over Janet Leigh's stabbing in "Psycho". It is also very ironic that every time Cotten appears that the photography gets darker or in outdoor sequences, dark clouds appear, much like an omen. Like the character of Hannibal Lecter later in "Silence of the Lambs" and its follow-up movies, Cotten plays a charming, educated sophisticate who is deadly dangerous. Everybody in the film shines; Wright, at the top of her game after "Pride of the Yankees" and "Mrs. Miniver", seemed destined for stardom. Her co-star from "The Little Foxes" (Patricia Collinge) is wonderfully lovable as the naive mother, while Edna May Wonacott as Anne steals every moment she is in.</fullReview>

He is dark, misanthropic, misogynistic, and keeps you guessing. That is the beauty of this film: you will debate with yourself Charlie's true identity (maybe he really is who he says he is).The film has a good deal of suspense, and solid performances from everyone involved. I do not think this is one of Hitchcock's most well-known films, and I am sorry about that. For me, it ranks above "Rebecca" in his catalog. Really a fine film and worth seeing again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SHADOW OF A DOUBT (1943) (UNIVERSAL) This film is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock picture. From most accounts it's Hitch's favorite, as well. It is very tough to pick a favorite from his fantastic body of work, but this one has always affected me personally. Growing up in a small town, whether it be Santa Rosa, CA., where this film is set or any other small town in North America is an experience that stays with you no matter how far you go away from home, how successful you may become or long you have been away from home. It is a very nostalgic film &amp; a very frightening film, at the same time. Only Hitchcock could have pulled this film off. In lesser hands this would have been just another studio potboiler of the era.This is the story of a serial killer &amp; prodigal son who comes home to sleepy Santa Rosa, to lie low. Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) is adored by his family, especially his niece Charlotte "Charlie" (Teresa Wright). The close bond between these two leads to a delicious cat &amp; mouse game, that eventually pits niece against uncle, good against evil.Hitch's shows that even in small town America, this evil can reside. When Cotten is dressing down his niece, as he realizes that she is on to him, he delivers a cynical monologue ending with "Do you know if you rip off the fronts of house you'd find swine? The world's a hell. What does it matter what happens in it?" To this very day that scene makes my skin crawl.The cast is top rate. Joseph Cotten is as good here as he was in "Citzen Kane" or "The 3rd Man". Beautiful Teresa Wright gives her finest performance, in only her 4th film. She is a very underrated &amp; under-appreciated actress. Hume Cronyn, in his film debut (Herbie Hawkins) &amp; Henry Travers (Charlie's father) give the film the right touch of "black" comedy relief, as mystery novel buffs who are constantly trying to come up with the perfect way to kill someone. Macdonald Carey (Detective Jack Graham) &amp; Patricia Collinge (Charlie's mother) are also well cast. Also look for Hitch's cameo, which has him playing cards, on the train to Santa Rosa.Hitchcock's direction keeps the film moving at the right pace &amp; brings you into story, as if you were living in Santa Rosa &amp; watching all of this unravel from your front porch. Thorton Wilder, Sally Benson &amp; Hitch's wife Alma Reville paint the picture with marvelous dialog, adapted from Gordon McDonell's original story. Joseph Valentine's photography on this film is stunning. The contrasting scenes of Uncle Charlie in bed at his flop house hotel &amp; Charlie in bed in her home, drives home the point of good vs. evil, without a word of dialog. This film also began the long partnership of Hitch &amp; legendary composer Dimitri Tiomkin.Rating 10 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joseph Cotton made this happen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Getting inside of the twisted, deranged, multifarious Joseph Cotton was fun. I don't mean that his villain was spontaneous also, because it was, but I rather watch Joseph Cotton slip into any actor he chooses. He does this with perfection, you know; I seriously doubt Hitch had to direct him on how to portray his character, because Joseph knew what he was doing(and if you don't believe me just check out the movie Niagra and see for yourself). He made this film and for a thousand reasons and I'll explain.One: Joseph Cotton knows how to make his character talk in this movie, his voice is the doom of whats to become, you get a first glimpse of this in the first opening two minutes of this movie. You know that even the poor little maid or whoever that was , she was tense, alert, and very frightened of his presence and I always wondered if she wasn't also suspicious about him herself...which makes two shadow of doubts, if that is the case. But his voice always made me afraid, especially the tones and the changes...he was meticulous with this!!! 2. Oh you know it, the walk, the posture, the custom in which he has to address his character. I seen people try to imitate this walk in movies for a long time, George Clooney could almost do it(Oceans Eleven, Out Of Sight), but you cant compare with Cotton, he has his own creative upbringing with this and only him belongs in this category. But in the scene where he grabs the newspaper from Young Charlies hand and tells her that is none of your business....I have to say this movie was made in 1943, but I was chilled and glued to my seat...it took me a glass of vodka and a pretzel to make me start moving again.3. His eyes, you don't see many movie stars with Joseph Cotton eyes. His stare, his knowledge...he knows, he knew and he wants to learn more, thats what it all says. I knew that he knew what Young Charlie was up to before it all started unraveling. The newspapers, the detectives disguising as photographers. In Joseph Cottons eyes you see the answers and his knowledge of all this already in his subconscious, a lot of actors cannot present this to you....well , OK maybe Anthony Hopkins in Nixon, even Stone said he was very deceiving on how he used his eyes. Creepy!!! 4. Joseph Cotton is the mastermind of being a little Jezebel...if he was a woman he be right up there with Joan and Betty themselves, probably outdo them and keep going forward , not looking back. At the scene of the dinner table was another point of how genuine Cotton can be. His dark, monotone voice sings to me with how cynical he views women, and oh I could see Joseph Cotton right there through those brilliant eyes murdering all his victims, and his lips moving and telling his opinion how dirty they are, how trashy, how thoughtful Joseph, maybe you should come over to my house and meet my mother....she would absolutely despise you!!! As for Alfred Hitchcock, well , how can you go wrong. The first scene, leading towards the last scene, with the dancers jumping in between sequences to remind us, where this guy has been and what he had done. Teresa Wright wasn't too bad, there were scenes I thought she maybe bit her tongue on and wish she could do over, but how can you with Hitchcock? If he thought it was alright, it was alright! I thought the ending was rushed, I wanted more appeal and suspense before it ended, but thats OK too , because I knew he wasn't going to board the train and leave out of sight again. Joseph Cotton personally probably would've wanted Hitchcock to let him go, be free and always being that lingering poisonous uncle Charlie in the back of Young Charlies fragile, naive, little mind, contaminating and absorbing her thoughts and playing with her mentally without being there in his lively presence.For my favorite scene , it definitely has to be the one where Joseph Cotton(I'm sorry, this is one of my favorite actors, I cant refer him to Charlie unless I get off track) is walking up the stairs after , well you'll find out, but he turns around and see's his Shadow Of Doubt right there in front of the door...at that moment , he knew, love , relative, whatever, he had to get rid of her and fast, but the scene was done so meticulously by Hitchcock that without any suspense to it at all, it literally gave me a ball of fear rolling around inside me.You guessed it......10/10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mixed Bag of Good and Bad: Dated, But Still Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been repeatedly pointed out here that SOAD is one of Hitchcock's films most overlooked by contemporary audiences, but it must be remembered this film was highly regarded for 30 years following its original release. Of course, more time has passed since then, so the film can't help but be dated at present, although such a status is intriguing as it shines light on the values and mores of an earlier time in America, and as such, is instructive.The strong points of the film are obvious: very well shot and attractive looking flick, outstanding job by the very great Joseph Cotten, and Theresa Wright, usually a pretty limp and wan actress, puts forth the best performance of her career. Both principals are well supported by the rest of the cast (particularly the Mother, the younger Sister, and Hume Cronyn as the next-door-neighbor). The film offers a charming glimpse of small town life in an America now long dead, and despite assertions by a poster that the wartime feel of the picture is absent, there are subtle but telling references to this off-screen catastrophic event (i.e., the presence of servicemen in at least two scenes, the notice in Oakley's brother-in-law's bank to Buy War Bonds and Stamps, Oakley's statements (in two scenes) that the world outside is evil, a "sty," and the Mother's insistence that the family "help the government" i.e., cooperate during wartime, when the two "surveyors" come to call). The various types of sexual tension in the film are palpable, and quite advanced for a picture of its time. And the little touches are great: Hitchcock's cameo, the brief bit with the waitress in the "Till Two" club, the assertions made by the clergyman at the family's after-speech party, the comic relief offered by the child actors.The weak points are glaring: doddering pacing and rather ill-focused editing, a pat and too-convenient explanation for Oakley's violent acts (i.e., head injury), a clumsy handling of the presumed budding romance between young Charlie and the detective, the needlessly dramatized episode of young Charlie in the library which supplies gratuitous suspense and tension that's hardly needed at that point in the picture, and a most contrived and implausible climax, albeit pretty harrowing if one exercises a suspension of disbelief.There are some plot holes that have been mentioned, and some others that have not. Of course, there's the over-generous openness of the family to the two "surveyors," the quick rise of Uncle Charlie as small town hero, the depositing of $40K at the bank without concern or suspicion on the part of others, the lack of curiosity about and ready acceptance of Uncle Charlie's mysterious past and the eventual disregard of Uncle Charlie's photograph as evidence in regard to several serial murders: these have all been mentioned here. What I found to be an odd episode in the film was young Charlie's near-fatal incident in the garage: despite the fact that she was almost killed, the rest of the family hurries off to Uncle Charlie's speaking engagement, leaving her home alone as if nothing more serious happened to her than a stubbed toe.All in all, viewing this film in a theater last night (the first time I had seen it in about 15 years), I was slightly disappointed in how it played and felt that it has not held up particularly well since my last viewing. Maybe because this film played as a double feature with "Out of the Past" my perceptions were such. In comparison, the Robert Mitchum-Jane Greer-Kirk Douglas noir classic made SOAD seem dowdy, small and unaccomplished: in the final analysis, I recognized "Out of the Past" to be the superior film.SOAD is still worth viewing, but with the above caveats in mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most overrated film I've ever seen...and I love Hitchcock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Hitchcock's movies, but this one's WAY overrated! You have a criminal on the lamb who makes no behavioral attempt to blend into straight society and seem like a regular person. He ALWAYS acts suspicious and vicious like a criminal, and nobody is smart enough to pick up on this.The niece reacts to seeing her long lost uncle whom she's supposedly never seen before as if she misses having sex with him, which would be incestuous, and she's so seemingly smitten with him, she gets defensive when it's suggested he might be a murderer.A cop spends probably about three hours with the girl in a non-intimate manner, and suddenly he's ready to marry her. Like that marriage is going to work.(SPOILER) And the movie ends with this villain who we're supposed to be scared of slipping and falling to his death, purely by accident. WHAT KIND OF MEANINGFUL ENDING IS THAT? A good ending involving a villain failing is supposed to happen because of the villain's Achilles's heel. Not a Deus ex Machina! I'm shocked that this is Hitchcock's favorite film. Frenzy, The Lady Vanishes, Dial M for Murder, Rope, and The 39 Steps are all rated lower on IMDb, but are actually much better, and more credible stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie in discussion is Alfred Hitchcock's "Without a shadow of doubt." I was confused saw was when Charlie finally puts together the reasoning of why her uncle Charlie rips up the newspaper to show her siblings how to make a house out of it. The underlying message was that his face was in the paper for being wanted. A second scene of confusion was when Charlie is suspecting her uncle and matches the initials on the ring he gave her to the initials of the murder victim she saw in the paper. She made the connection between the initials, why the paper was being ripped up, and proof for her standing suspicions. The first scene comes shortly after the film starts, when Ann takes a phone call for her mother. She all but blatantly ignores the woman marking her message to her mother as unimportant, and the message she is trying to get to in her novel as more important. Another scene that is when Charlie passes out in the garage and after Herb saves her everyone is cutting him off and ignoring him. Everyone is ignoring or filtering out the message he is trying to get across and filtering in the "What if" messages by the rest of the group. I also noticed that just about every time Ann made a comment it was contradictory and had a sense of evaluation hidden in it. One scene where this is prevalent is where Charlie says her family is falling apart and saying that all other families are happy, she is grouping them all together. A second scene that displays this is when Uncle Charlie confesses to Charlie about the murder and says they will give him the electric chair. They will physically kill him and figuratively kill her mother, grouping them together based on consequence. One scene where this takes place is where Charlie's father says that her mother was too busy making dinner to attend the big get together they have at the house. He is pretty much stereotyping women and what they do in the household. A second scene where this takes place is where Charlie says that she is becoming a nagging old maid, passing a stereotype on a certain social oupinggroup. A scene where this takes place is where Charlie's father says that Uncle Charlie is a New York man, generalizing what he is and spreading it to all New York natives. A second scene where this is shown is where Charlie is complaining about her family saying they are boring compared to other families. She is generalizing that all other families outside of her own are much more exciting. One scene where this is shown is where Charlie talks about her relationship between her and her uncle, constructing it to be much more serious than it is saying things have changed(for the better) since he came into town. The elements of their relationship are somewhat far spaced so to speak but now that Charlie and her uncle are closer in proximity she feels closer to him emotionally when in all reality she is not and it is more of a heat of the moment kind of thing. A way this is shown is when Uncle Charlie arrives bearing gifts and wanting to open a bank account with a huge amount of money. The message behind this is one of superiority to the rest of the family. Another scene where this is shown is when Charlie's father and Herb are talking about killing each other and Charlie snaps on them. The hidden message is that something is bothering her and something they were talking about related to her problem. Also I thought it was interesting when Uncle Charlie dies in the end and the trip scene resembles the Widow Waltz from the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark Thread</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it was the sixth film which Alfred Hitchcock made after his move to Hollywood, "Shadow of a Doubt" is his first major American thriller. "Rebecca" and "Suspicion" were both set in Britain and starred British actors in the leading roles. "Foreign Correspondent" has an American star but deals with the war in Europe; it is essentially a wake-up call to Americans, urging them to abandon isolationism and join Britain in the fight against Nazism. "Mr &amp; Mrs Smith" is an atypical romantic comedy, and "Saboteur", a patriotic warning against Fifth Columnists, is very minor-league stuff."Shadow of a Doubt" is set in Santa Rosa, California, here portrayed as the archetypal American small town where nothing ever happens. (One of the scriptwriters was Thornton Wilder of "Our Town" fame). It was something of a Hollywood convention to portray outwardly tranquil small towns as inwardly seething with hidden hatreds and passions, as in "Kings Row" made the previous year. Here, however, evil is something that comes into the town from outside. Charlie Oakley, a thirty-something bachelor, arrives in the town to stay with his married sister Emma Newton and her family. Unknown to them, however, Charlie is under suspicion of being the serial killer known as the "Merry Widow Murderer" who has killed several wealthy widows in the East, and two detectives have trailed him to California to keep him under surveillance.This is one of the minority of Hitchcock films which have a female protagonist and where the main male character is a villain. In this respect it has something in common with Hitchcock's later British film "Stage Fright". In both films, also, a romance develops between the heroine and the detective investigating the villain's crimes. In "Shadow of a Doubt" the heroine is Charlie's teenage niece, Charlotte. (She was named after her uncle and is sometimes referred to by the family as " Charlie ", but to avoid confusion I will refer to her by her full name). One of detectives informs Charlotte privately that her uncle is a suspect in the "Merry Widow" case; at first she cannot believe consider that her beloved uncle could be a murderer, but his increasingly odd behaviour begins to arouse her suspicion.Hitchcock counted this as one of his best films, but for me it never quite reaches the highest level. It is considerably better than the likes of "Saboteur" or "Stage Fright", but would not rate it as highly as some of Hitchcock's British films such as "The 39 Steps" or "The Lady Vanishes" or American ones such as "Rebecca" or "Strangers on a Train". The main reason is that there always seems to be a major plot hole at its centre. It is never satisfactorily explained why, after Uncle Charlie admits to Charlotte that he is indeed the killer, she agrees to help him by keeping his secret. The explanation that she gives is that she does not want to distress her mother, who idolises her brother, but it must surely have occurred to an intelligent young woman like Charlotte that if she keeps quiet and gives him time to escape there will always be a risk that he will kill again. (How distressed would Emma be if she were to discover not only that her brother is a murderer but also that her daughter could have prevented one of his crimes but failed to do so?) It is also not explained why the truth about Charlie does not come out after his death- he dies trying to push Charlotte from a moving train- or who the mysterious "second suspect" is whom the police are chasing in Maine. The romantic subplot between Charlotte and Detective Jack Graham always seems rather unnecessary. Yet there are compensations, especially a very fine performance from Joseph Cotten as Charlie, by turns either jovial or sinister. Yet even when he is at his most affable there is always a hidden undercurrent of menace; when Charlie reveals himself as the killer we have, in a sense, been prepared for this revelation. Charlie's crimes are motivated by a dark, pessimistic philosophy; he believes the world to be a cruel and brutal place and that this justifies his behaving in a cruel and brutal manner. The women he killed were, in his view, "fat animals deserving of slaughter". (There are no direct references to the war in the film, but Charlie's contempt for human life recalls that of the Nazis, who often referred to Jews as "animals" or "vermin").Indeed, there is a dark thread running throughout the film, which is why some have seen it as one of Hitchcock's films noirs, even though the "Pleasantville"-type small town is different to the normal urban noir setting. Like many Hitchcock thrillers it contains elements of humour, although often of a dark, unsettling kind. Charlotte's father Joe and his friend Herbert are keen crime buffs, eagerly discussing detective novels, unsolved murder cases or the best way to commit the perfect murder, all the time comically unaware of the real murder mystery unfolding under their noses.Strangest of all is the relationship between Charlotte and Charlie, who before Charlie reveals his secret are unusually close for uncle and niece, perhaps too close for comfort. Some have even seen hints of incest in this relationship. Hitchcock may have been suggesting hidden, deeper reasons for Charlotte's reluctance to inform the police about her uncle. "Shadow of a Doubt" is not Hitchcock's greatest film, but it is certainly one of his most disturbing. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To which Ma Newton replies - "It's your father's way of relaxing".Director Alfred Hitchcock liked to use humor to diffuse the building tension in his films and to shift emphasis, and this movie offers a number of excellent examples. They're peppered throughout the story and offer needed breaks as it becomes more and more apparent that Joseph Cotten's character, Uncle Charlie, just might be the 'Merry Widow Murderer' that a country wide manhunt is after.There's no doubting that Hitchcock is one of the great directors of American cinema, but once again, I find myself on the fence regarding this picture's reputation and my own reaction to it. Maybe I'm being a tad too critical, but just like with "Strangers On A Train", I found the resolution to the story to be just a little too pat for my liking. Here was Uncle Charlie (Cotten), an athletic looking man revealed to be the killer of three widows for their inheritance, successfully challenged by his niece almost half his size. Would a murderer of his talent and skill allow himself to be angled into a position as to fall off a train into the path of another because he just slipped? It's just too convenient a scenario to serve as the finale.What might have better served the picture would be to have the story actually support the title. Hitchcock did a nice job with the initial attempt on Young Charlie's (Teresa Wright) life using the doctored step on the stairway; not really sure if it was tampered with or not. The garage scene with the running car and Young Charlie 'trapped' could have been presented with an outcome that didn't make it obvious that the Uncle was behind it. Of course, the train scene makes it certain that Cotten's character is the widow maker, as he pulls out all the stops to take out his niece for what she suspects, but doesn't necessarily know for certain (although the ring inscribed with 'T.S. from B.M." was a pretty good clue). I guess what I'm saying is that the film would have worked a whole lot better for me if Uncle Charlie's murder history was maintained as a "Shadow of a Doubt" instead of a certainty. What I'm thinking is along the lines of 1938's "Angels With Dirty Faces" - it's up to the viewer to decide if Jimmy Cagney died a hero or a yellow rat. It makes for a much livelier debate.Aside from that, the film did hold my interest all the way through, with well presented performances by the principals, along with Henry Travers, Patricia Collinge, MacDonald Carey and Hume Cronyn in good support roles. Ma Newton (Colllinge) did a nice job of putting two and two together in a very low key scene, and it was rewarding to know that she 'got it' regarding her brother's presence back home.Say, there was one scene that took me way back to when I first learned to drive a car. Do you recall Jack Graham (Carey) using a stick shift on the column when driving his car - when's the last time you saw that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Uncle Charlie has a secret, and his niece, Young Charlie, wants to find it out. But what she just thinks is a playful little thing is actually a very dark and criminal thing; Uncle Charlie's on the run from the law, and her knowledge of his actions can turn to disastrous effects... like him willing to kill even her to keep his secret safe.DUH DUH DUH! No, but seriously, it was a very good look into the whole "tearing the veil off of Suburbia", a la Blue Velvet (I know, it came later) and Hitchcock's own repeated motif of "looking behind the curtain." Within an average, normal (and very stressed as such) household, complete and diabolical evil exists.It's some good stuff. I can never really fault Hitchcock his skill or his technique because he was great at it. I just regret to say I get kind of tired of having him basically show variants of the same story over and over again. But considering that this was, apparently, his favorite film of his, and being that it's a lot more personal and psychological than the common "mistaken-identity-man-on-the-run" with the "blond-woman-exploring-her-place-in-society-and-coming-of-age" that he tends to do much more often, it is quite definitely one of his better works.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly Hitch's "greatest"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING* SPOILERS * WARNING* MANY SPOILERS* Just finished watching "Shadow of a Doubt" for the third time, and once again I come away feeling that I just watched a silly film. First, let's just say right away that Joseph Cotten does a MAGNIFICENT job, although I think Robert Mitchum is much superior in "Night of the Hunter." Underplayed by Cotten? Certainly I feel that Mr. Cotten's shift of demeanors is the highlight of the entire experience. But here are some of my observations on plot holes and general silliness:1) The bank president barely gets ruffled at Uncle Charlie's $40,000 deposit, which is equivalent to maybe $200,000 in today's dollars. I realize that in those days there weren't drug czars, but organized crime was big business then, and Uncle Charlie's comments that he's just "in business" doesn't seem to make a dent in anybody's sensibilities, whereas the mention of the word "embezzlement" makes everyone turn and look at Joe. The deposit is made and seemingly a signature on a scrap of paper is enough "detail" for both Charlie and the bankers. Nobody else seems to care much about Uncle Charlie's riches either, except for another "merry widow." The detectives on Charlie's trail don't seem to know that Charlie just visited the bank, and if they do, the $40,000 in cash doesn't seem to arouse their suspicions. 2) On the train, at the end, the two little kids are told to "run along and play." Immediately after that, the train starts moving. Don't the mother and father have any concern that all three of their children are on this departing train? Wouldn't Roger and Anne come back to tell Charlie that the train was moving? The entire scene seems rather contrived.3) Charlie's girlfriends (teenagers, right?) all seem inordinately drawn to much older men (the detectives). Notice Kathy always coyly eying up Saunders? And isn't Graham a little OLD for "little Charlie?"4) How is it that Uncle Charlie comes into Santa Rosa, virtually unnoticed, appears at the bank with loads of cash and no explanation, and the next thing you know he's giving a speech and is a town HERO? I know he's charming and a conniver, but how he comes to this is just not satisfactorily explained, and I think is a key element in the film, i.e., how Uncle Charlie is able to survive and get by in a world that he obviously hates.5) The fact that the OTHER suspect(in Maine)gets chopped up by propellors while fleeing does not necessarily clear Uncle Charlie. In fact, the photo was already, according to Saunders, on its way to be viewed in Massachussetts when the news in Maine broke. Wouldn't the police in Mass. want to show the photo ANYWAY, just as a matter of course, or of detail? Wouldn't there be ONE person in command who would INSIST that the final detail be worked out? I mean, OK, the other suspect is chopped up...that doesn't LOGICALLY clear Charlie? After all, there were no remains to identify the other suspect; why not just "make sure?" Or is the plot element of "not a very good detective" more far-reaching than just Graham? Does Hitch think ALL cops are boobs?6) What was the point of the "hanging sub-plot" where Charlie's mother was starting to get suspicious of foul play? Why did that end abruptly? OK, I've made my points. I DID like the movie, though. I give it 3 stars out of 4 for a number of reasons: it IS suspenseful, well-acted, well-photographed, nicely-paced, and has great humorous moments.It's hard to pick a favorite Hitchcock movie, but right now, mine are North by Northwest, Saboteur, Topaz, The Birds, Psycho, Vertigo, and Frenzy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shadow of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD***Frankly, most of the critical raves blandished upon "Shadow of a Doubt" can be summed up in one word: drivel.It is not a great film, it is certainly NOT a "classic," except only in the most negative sense; it barely qualifies as even a "good" film. In fact, the most accurate judgment might be one purportedly leveled by author Dashiell Hammett at a Lillian Hellman effort: "worse than bad, it's ALMOST good." Hitchcock's missteps in this film are legion, from an unnecessary opening sequence in a Philadelphia boarding-house to a silly, equally unnecessary romantic entanglement toward the movie's end. He lets the film's pace get away from him -- an achievement in itself, given its tendency to plod at awkward moments -- and seems to lose any sense of thematic continuity from scene to scene, sacrificing the occasional strong, telling moment to a mishmash of indifferent editing.Contemporary critics, in extolling "Shadow," seem intent on projecting much of Hitchcock's later greatness onto this film, often seeing things that aren't there. It's become quite fashionable, for example, to speak of the voluminous dark smoke issuing from the locomotive as it powers the train bringing Uncle Charlie west, seeing this as a "harbinger" of evil descending. One critic has even termed the train as "phallic" in its invasion of bucolic Santa Rosa.Nonsense.Sometimes, as Freud once supposedly remarked, a cigar is simply a cigar. In this instance, the train is simply a train. Trains of that era happen to have belched dark smoke. Voluminously. And Hitchcock happened to like trains. Used them in a lot of his films. (And yes, the final train scene in "North By Northwest" IS phallic; this one, however, isn't.)"Shadow of a Doubt" is, very simply, a film that got away from Hitchcock, one that very likely wouldn't have had he filmed it later in his career. The themes he attempts to explore are worth exploring; unfortunately, he doesn't come close to pulling it off here. It's really maddening to think just what he might have done, say, a dozen or so years later with this story.But any "classic" encomiums attached to this film, sadly, are just so much wishful thinking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder what sort of film Shadow of a Doubt might be if Hitchock had cut that opening sequence with Cotten dodging the two agents and whisking away to a safer place. Sure, it does establish his boldness and knack for disappearing right in front of our very eyes (it helps that they do not know what he looks like so he can walk right by them) but it also establishes for a fact that Uncle Charlie is hiding something, and somewhat undermines the slow process of discovery that Charlotte has to go through. Surely the absence of it would make the best scene of the film even better. We overhear Joseph and Herbie musing as they always do, and they mention that the Merry Widow Murderer is dead. Then Cotten climbs the stairs, the slowly and deliberately turns back to give a pointed, menacing look back at Charlie in the sliver of sunlight in the doorstep. The soundtrack climaxes, and in that moment both characters know exactly where the real murderer, and so does the audience. It's a stunning moment of silent tension, mainly because neither can directly admit what they know, and everything else afterwards is merely a formality. The final 'fight' is a little silly now, and the forced romance with Detective Graham seems as though they plucked the nearest available male to give a little comfort for the young Charlie.The two Charlies are certainly a shining light here. Wright does not nearly resemble the teenager she plays (she was in her mid 20s) but by all means is radiant; she has the kind of vivacity and youthful idealism from the get go that Hitchcock ladies aren't often armed with and is the shining light from the start. She rises from the cosy domesticity of the small town as if she were totally aware that there is no other way to kickstart the movie than to get Uncle Charlie into the frame, and then beams constantly at how what a mysterious and imposing character he is. She has the all the imperative here. Opposing her is the sharp- eyed Cotten, who juggles the appearance of a family man rather well, only cracking once to give a frightful monologue. The clash between the leading pair makes the movie a worthwhile study in tension; we can see Hitchcock winking from every scene as Charlie goes closer and closer to discovering the truth, even as she chalks it all up the the excitement of her uncle's enigmatic lifestyle. When she first receives a murdered victim's watch, they key light flashes a little glint in her eye, but it's not yet the moment of discovery - she is merely overjoyed at such a cool present from such a cool uncle. A shake up indeed. What the intro does allow is for all these Hitchock nods at the source of the criminal contrasted with Charlie's initial obliviousness; the way she wonders how they just happen to be the 'average' family chosen for a nation-wide survey, the way Emma shrieks at the visitors to not take pictures of the ugly scenery, and the running dialogue of Joseph and Herbie as crime enthusiasts who endlessly speculate on the perfect murder. First it is a harmless hobby. Later it inserts a grim subtext until Charlie cannot bear it any longer. It's the classical build-up of dramatic irony, and Hitchock subverts his own tendencies; Wright closes the door and leans against it suggestively, and then Cotten grasps her hands roughly as he snatches the newspaper fragment, and for a moment, the pose is like two lovers about to embrace and kiss. But by foregoing that convention dynamic we have something a lot more interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shadow of a Doubt was seemingly Alfred Hitchcock's favourite of all his films. While it is good, I can't really agree with Hitch that it's quite at that level. Still, it's a very solid bit of work and is certainly an effective psychological thriller. It stars Joseph Cotten in a sinister role as an uncle from hell who suddenly turns up at the home of his sister's family after being away for a very long time. His niece, in particular, dotes on him but the trouble is that he is a seriously bad egg. The film doesn't really operate as a mystery as the audience always knows what is going on; the tension comes from watching characters that do not. Cotton is really great as Uncle Charlie and shows what a fine and versatile actor he was. The rest of the cast are mostly good, with a notably funny turn from Hume Cronyn as a nerdish neighbour who is obsessed with murder-mysteries. The film has a good mix of family dramatics and suspense, with the small town setting captured very well to add a fine backdrop to proceedings. Not top drawer Hitchcock exactly but a fine example of his early work for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just an average Hitchcock thriller , not a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock considered this film as his personal favorite among his own works . Its a story of a guy named Charlie who comes to visit his sister and her family. His niece Charlie named after him is very fond of him. But things become strange when she starts suspecting her uncle as a murderer .The movie has typical Hitchcock elements such as a pace, gallows humor and thrilling music and one typical thing seen in most Hitchcock movies light discussions over heavy topics such as murder . This may have been a masterpiece back then or may even have been the genre leader. But sadly it has lost its charm over the period of time .The camera work is beautifully done with the director going for difficult and unseen shots .Its not a time resistant classic like psycho or rope but does manage to keep your attention for its 100 minutes duration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sinister Joseph Cotten (as Charles "Uncle Charlie" Oakley) eludes some men in Philadelphia, then heads for Santa Rosa, California, where he plans an extended visit with adoring young niece Teresa Wright (as Charlotte "Charlie" Newton) and her family. Ms. Wright feels a "special" connection with Mr. Cotten, and the two share the nickname "Charlie". While Cotton tries to lay low, people want to know, "Where is The Merry Widow Murderer?" Could it be the Wright's beloved "Uncle Charlie"? Great starring performances by Cotton and Wright, and superb direction from Alfred Hitchcock, are this film's main attractions. The supporting characters are all, at least, entertaining; they include, notably, Hume Cronyn (as Herbie Hawkins) in his first feature. Mr. Cronyn, with his U.S. flag-pinned lapel, is an obvious supplier of red herrings. Macdonald Carey (as Jack Graham) provides Wright with some non-incestuous romantic possibilities.The story's promising psychological depth is somewhat marred by a plot which leaves too many important questions unanswered. The best piece of business that goes nowhere is matriarch Patricia Collinge (as Emma Newton)'s brief reconsideration of her brother's character, after her daughter suffers two near-death "accidents". Ms. Collinge is the only one who really loves Cotten; and, if you think about it, she should know better. "Shadow of a Doubt" may not be perfect, but it's still excellent Hitchcock.******** Shadow of a Doubt (1/12/43) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Teresa Wright, Joseph Cotten, Patricia Collinge, Macdonald Carey</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new Universal DVD kept freezing so instead I watched the video I taped off UK Channel 4 on June 6th 1987 yet again. Umpteen times later Shadow Of A Doubt is still an enjoyable experience, albeit masterful storytelling mixed with hokey non-sequiteurs. Both suspects got abruptly minced, but shame about the other one who was apparently innocent, I wonder what his story would have been! He would have had every right to be cut up about it all.On the run suspected murderer Uncle Charlie rather shortsightedly judges all others as he judges himself, as grasping sleazebags, the gradual realisation of which causes Young Charlie the worst growing-up pangs imaginable. And the counter-realisation in Old Charlie introduces attempted murder into the idyllic suburban familial household he's chosen to try to hide in - there's nothing like a young person's violent death to avert suspicion. One of the investigating cops (BlanderMan) falls for Young Charlie, which would surely have muddied the waters if the Case had come to trial. Small town America in Santa Rosa seemed to be a very busy, vibrant place to live too.However, these are (to me) all minor points in what is a classic American film told in Hitch's inimitable style and already well applauded in many other comments. Not perfect but a marvellously intelligent, bright, and cohesive plot, acting and production will ensure its survival in the public domain way beyond the DVD and all of us, lovers or haters of it. Of that there is no probable possible doubt whatever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark Side of Beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The weakest part of this movie is the part that involves the detectives. Nothing really seems to make sense. They want a picture of Charlie Oakley so they can show it to witnesses to see if he is the Merry Widow serial killer. All they need to do is bring him in for questioning and take his picture. Failing that, they could have photographed him when he walked right toward them at the beginning of the movie. After he walks past them, they follow him. What for? Do they think that by following him, they will catch him in the act of killing another widow? I could go on, but what would be the point? Suffice it to say that everything involving these detectives is unrealistic. And it is a shame, because with a few changes in the script, they could have been left out entirely.It is the rest of the movie, the parts where the detectives play no significant role, that the movie really engages us. When the movie begins, it is clear that Charlie Oakley has just killed another widow, after first getting his hands on her money. But it is not the money he cares about. He hates these women and it gives him great satisfaction to kill them. But now, thoroughly sated from his recent murder, he is weary, listlessly lying in bed, with some of the money carelessly allowed to fall on the floor. He finally decides to visit his sister and sends her a telegram.Meanwhile, his niece, young Charlie, is first seen lying supine in bed in a way that matches her uncle when we first saw him, giving us just a hint of incest. Her fascination with her uncle is just a little unsettling in this regard. They both have the same name, and she is convinced that they are just alike. At first, she too is listless, just as her uncle was, but she suddenly decides to send him a telegram, inviting him to visit them, right after he has sent her mother a telegram saying that he is coming.When her uncle arrives, he gives her a ring, which has an engraving on the inside, "T.S. from B.M." Later, Charlie reads in the paper that the initials of the deceased husband of a recently murdered widow were "B.M." Both "T.S" and "B.M." are well known abbreviations for fecal matter, which is a way of suggesting something foul associated with the beautiful emerald ring. The evil hidden underneath beauty is the theme of this movie.In a similar way, the town where young Charlie lives is one of those warm, wholesome towns, representing the goodness of America, and good-looking Uncle Charlie is the evil hidden within that town. But that is not the most disturbing example of this theme. We find such evil in young Charlie herself. As the movie keeps emphasizing, and as she keeps insisting, she and her Uncle Charlie are very much alike. And that means that she has her dark side too. Because young Charlie is played by Teresa Wright, a wholesome looking young woman, rather than an actress whom we might see playing a femme fatale in a film noir, the contrast between her innocent appearance and the evil within her is stark.When she figures out that her uncle is the Merry Widow murderer, she does not turn the ring over to the police and tell them what she knows. Instead, she merely insists that he leave town, so that her mother will not be hurt by the knowledge of what her brother really is. And she does this even when she knows who his next victim will be, a widow he meets in town, and who will be leaving on the same train. This makes her an accomplice to his next and subsequent murders.In another scene, she tells him that she wants to kill him. And so she does. The scene in which she pushes her uncle into the path of the oncoming train can be understood as merely the accidental result of her effort to get away from him, and it would have been an act of self-defense in any event. But what happens matches what she says she wanted to do. Of course, there is no way her dark side is anything like that of her uncle, the main difference being that her uncle had a head injury when he was young, which allowed his dark side to flourish. But the evil in her is there nevertheless. And so, the movie seems to say, in all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear of Your Own Family Member?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Shadow of a Doubt' is one of those films that makes you question which family members you can trust and those you cannot. In this tale, Hitchcock tells the story of the Newton family and the tragic secret that is hidden from them. Charles Spencer (Joseph Cotten in a chilling, but grand performance) is a man who is suspected of being a strangler known as the Merry Widow Murderer. To hide from authorities, he decides to visit his sister and her family in Santa Rosa. His niece, Charlotte or 'Charlie' (Theresa Wright, Oscar winner from 'Mrs. Miniver') is delighted to see him, but soon grows suspicious of her beloved uncle. This film is a great tale of terror and suspenseful moments, bu the fact that we know who the murderer is ruins some of the plot. A typical Hitchcock film has the element well concealed that we are made to guess (unless the film is meant to be biographical like 'Rope'). However, that fact aside the film is still a brilliant story and has a great cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock and Americana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the classic SHADOW OF A DOUBT when I was younger, I did not realize it was an Alfred Hitchcock movie. The movie, made in 1943, was unlike any movie Hitchcock had done before or for that matter after. It was Hitchcock's only "purely American" movie, and the movie was years ahead of itself in suspense, intrigue, and dialogue. While many films of the day were musicals about how the boy gets the girl, SHADOW OF A DOUBT truly is a film that has not aged much. Some 67 years after its release the film is still quite watchable and the suspense is more riveting than any 3D or special effects movie.Starring Joseph Cotten, Teresa Wright, and MacDonald Carey, SHADOW OF A DOUBT was one of Joseph Cotten's finest roles. Alfred Hitchcock appears about 15 minutes into the film, on the train to Santa Rosa, playing bridge with a man and a woman (Dr and Mrs. Harry). Charlie Oakley is traveling on the train under the assumed name of Otis. Mrs. Harry is eager to help Otis, who is feigning illness in order to avoid meeting fellow passengers, but Dr. Harry is not interested and keeps playing bridge. Hitchcock on his part seems surprised to see that he has somehow been dealt a full suite of spades, a Grand Slam bridge hand.The plot centers around a bored teenager living in Santa Rosa, California, Charlotte "Charlie" Newton (Wright). She is frustrated because nothing seems to be happening in her life and that of her family. Then, she receives wonderful news: her uncle (for whom she was named), Charlie Oakley (Cotten), her mother's brother, is arriving for a visit.Two men show up pretending to be photographers and journalists working on a national survey of the average American family. One of them speaks to Charlie privately, identifying himself as Detective Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey) and telling her that her uncle is one of two men who are suspected of being a serial killer known as the "Merry Widow Murderer". This murderer has a modus operandi of seducing, murdering and robbing wealthy widows.Young Charlie at first refuses to even consider that her uncle could be a murderer, but she cannot help noticing him acting strangely on several occasions. She confirms her suspicions after seeing the initials on the engraving on the ring Uncle Charlie gave her match one of the recent victims of the killer. Particularly chilling is a family dinner conversation during which Uncle Charlie reveals his hatred of rich widows, comparing them to fat animals deserving of slaughter.Young Charlie's growing suspicion soon becomes apparent to her uncle. He confronts her and admits that he is indeed the man the police are after. He begs her for help; she reluctantly agrees not to say anything, as long as he leaves soon, to avoid a horrible scandal in the town that would destroy her family, especially her mother, who idolizes her younger brother.Then news breaks that the second suspect was killed fleeing from the police in Portland, Maine, and is assumed to have been the guilty one. The detective Graham leaves after telling Young Charlie that he loves her and would like to marry her someday. Uncle Charlie is delighted at first, until he remembers that Young Charlie fully knows his secret. Soon, the young woman has a couple of near fatal "accidents", falling down some very steep stairs at her home, and being trapped in a closed garage with a car spewing exhaust fumes.Uncle Charlie soon announces that he is leaving by train for San Francisco, following what is presumably his next victim. As he departs, he contrives for young Charlie to stay on board, planning to kill her by pushing her off as soon as the train gets up to speed. Instead, in the ensuing struggle between them, he falls into the path of an oncoming train. At his funeral Uncle Charlie is highly honored by the townspeople of Santa Rosa, who know nothing of his crimes. Jack has come back to comfort Charlie; she tells him she had withheld from him information about her uncle which would have confirmed him as the murderer, but Jack already knows and accepts that, realizing her difficult situation. They become a couple, and resolve to keep Uncle Charlie's crimes a secret.If you are looking for one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces, do yourself a favor and watch SHADOW OF A DOUBT. It was by far one of the best movies of 1943, and one of the best movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More to this than meets the eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is much complexity to this film.Notable is the treatment of the locales, to emphasize the stark difference between the naive innocence of the small-town girl (whose first scene shows her bored with her mundane existence -- what teenager hasn't felt there was great adventure and excitement in the outside world?) and the urbane ennui of the uncle.We start with NY, shown as an unpopulated wasteland; first the "No dumping" sign at the waterfront, then the chase through barren alleys, ending with the rooftop shot from the perspective of the escapee. Where are the throngs of people on the streets of this metropolis? Why, they're all in Santa Rosa! Note how every street scene there is filled with happy pedestrians. As packed with citizenry as this little town is, they know each other -- the traffic cop and librarian know the girl by name. It's Thornton Wilder at work here.Now why is this complex? Because there's a war on, yet no mention is made of it. Maybe the script was written before Dec, 1941. The only nods to that condition I saw were the Army soldiers happily on the streets, the Buy Bonds sticker over teller window, and the snippet of a TOJO headline on a library newspaper. But the war wasn't lost on Hitchcock, who'd had years of it in Britain and Europe.He was telling us, through the treatment of the towns, and the lead characters, that our small-town innocence was about to be ravished by what was REALLY going on in the world.Uncle Charlie is a metaphor for the evil that is out there, that we assume will never assault our protected, insulated lives. (One could even say he had the mesmerizing charm of Hitler, and was as dangerous.) By the time this movie ends, how his niece must long for the boring, yet happy days she's now lost forever. A coming-of-age story, not just from the eyes of a young girl -- but from the eyes of small-town America.Then there's the complexity of the relationships. I noted a discussion thread here that postulates that Hitchcock was suggesting an incestuous past, or longing, between the leads. Way off base. Some people will see Freudian implications in a train wreck. He didn't throw his hat on her bed to "claim his territory" with her, but to flaunt his disregard for the father's superstition. His is an arrogant superiority at work, not a desire for his niece. Hers is not sexual tension; it is genuine joy at knowing her idolized uncle is on the way to visit -- after all, she was named after him, and her mother (his sister) has always idolized him herself. But from the first pain inflicted on her wrist, she slowly grows more and more suspicious of his perceived perfection. She is not starry-eyed, but centered -- after all, she very maturely reacts to the detective's proposal. But to her, Uncle Charlie represented all the good in the world, and soon he equals the opposite. She does NOT protect him through a misguided feeling for HIM, but to protect her mother -- she wants him arrested -- just not in her town.It is an underrated masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over the top but interesting commentary on Our Town...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the problems with Hitchcock's films is that he's been imitated so many times by now (an brilliantly parodied by Mel Brooks) that when you see one of his stylistic devices - it seems clichéd, even though probably at the time it was original. Also, and he admits this, his plots are always full of holes but as long as there is enough pace or misdirection, there isn't time to dwell upon it.In this film unfortunately, both of these problems really make this hard to enjoy. For example, the close shot of Cotten talking about the nasty lives of widows seems comically over-dramatic and the use of music esp the Merry Widow Waltz is corny. The plot is as always, full of holes, made worse by the fact that modern audiences are much more sophisticated than our heroine. Of course, that's true for most older movies but I found them harder to overlook here since everything was being taken so seriously and telegraphed so clumsily by today's standards. I couldn't help but laugh at spots. However, it's still worth watching. Teresa Wright's naiveté enhances and indeed makes possible the ethical conflict underlying the tension in the film and Joseph Cotten is very good as the creepy uncle. However, the thing that made this film worthwhile for me was that when you think about it, all the town characters are portrayed as dupes completely fooled by Cotten with Teresa Wright being the smartest of them all and still only prevailing through good luck. Perhaps this is intentional and Cotten's sardonic remark that people like them wouldn't understand the real world was not that of a deranged sociopath but Hitchcock's low opinion of Wilder's Our Town. And he was able to do this directly and in full view of an applauding American audience, knowing full well that it went over their heads. I can see why this was his personal favourite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The world's a hell. What does it matter what happens in it?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My twenty-third Alfred Hitchcock film was one that I had been looking forward to for quite a long time, and the Master of Suspense delivered all the thrills and chills I had been expecting. 'Shadow of a Doubt' was the director's sixth film in Hollywood, and his second with Universal Studios. This shadowy, cynical thriller probes within the darkened heart of a typical small American town, revealing a horrifying secret that none of them could ever possibly comprehend. Throughout his career, Hitchcock delighted in creating suspense by recruiting our sympathies for a villain {certain scenes in 'Strangers on a Train (1951),' 'Psycho (1960)' and 'Frenzy (1972)' spring straight to mind}, but here he constructs much of the film around a character we initially believe to be one of the director's "wrong men." Perhaps I was just being influenced by my previous experience with Hitchcock's films, but it wasn't until a long way into the picture that I even contemplated the possibility of Uncle Charlie being a murderous psycho, and Joseph Cotten seems such an amiable fellow that I wouldn't have believed it anyway.'Shadow of a Doubt' explores the duality of good and evil, as personified by the mysterious, almost-telepathic bond between the young and innocent "Charlie" Newton (Teresa Wright) and her disturbed uncle Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotton). After Uncle Charlie {whom we'll call Charles henceforth to avoid confusion} arrives in the Newton family's quaint hometown of Santa Rosa, California, Charlie is absolutely overwhelmed with joy, having shared a special bond with her uncle from a very early age, despite only seeing him on rare occasions. Charles in beloved by all who remember him; his sister Emma (Patricia Collinge) forever cherishes the idealistic childhood memories of her younger brother, and it doesn't take long for the peace-loving townsfolk of Santa Rosa to welcome him as a son. However, there's something sinister about Charles Oakley that nobody could have imagined, as young Charlie, to her dismay, is about to uncover.As well as some thoroughly-gripping suspense, 'Shadow of a Doubt' is also full of the black humour for which Hitchcock was well-known. I particularly enjoyed the playful bantering of Joseph Newton (Henry Travers) and neighbour Herbie Hawkins (Hume Cronyn), as they came together each night to discuss the most efficient means of murdering each other. There's a brilliant irony to be found in the fact that, despite their self-confessed fascination with murder, the two men are simply incapable of recognising a real-life murderer in their midst, dining at their own dinner table no less. The film's climax, though I would have liked for it to be longer, is extremely thrilling, even though we were never expecting our young heroine to be the Merry Widow Murderer's final victim. Another moment I loved, and which I didn't notice the first time I watched the scene, was the director's cameo appearance as a passenger playing bridge on the train. Appropriately in this story, it is Hitch who is holding all the cards, and the characters - as well as the audience! - are merely at his mercy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful Family Drama Of Big City Sin In Small Town America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Newtons are an average suburban American family living in the quiet Californian town of Santa Rosa. Elder daughter Charlie is over the moon when they are paid a surprise visit by her namesake, Uncle Charlie, who brings gifts and excitement, but also a shady and uncomfortable past ...I like this movie, but it's not my favourite Hitchcock film by a rather long chalk. It's extremely well made and the cast are great but whenever I see it, it feels a little flat to me and I'm never quite sure exactly what tone it's going for. The depiction of the small town (it was shot in the real Santa Rosa) and the corruption of young Charlie's innocence are terrific - she starts out bored by the humdrum predictability of her family but by the end she would give anything just to have that back. But as a thriller it has (perhaps intentionally) almost no suspense; we know that Uncle Charlie is a vicious, self-interested sociopath right from the start and we never have any sympathy for him. Wright - the Jodie Foster of her generation - is superb as the girl becoming a woman, forced into facing harsh truths, Collinge is memorable as the self-sacrificing mother who gives all to her family but underneath is dangerously fragile, and there are several excellent vignette performances, notably Cronyn as the meek neighbour. The most interesting thing about Shadow Of A Doubt is that Hitchcock cited it as his favourite of his own films, a comment that intrigues me when he made many other films that were more successful, more ambitious, more original, scarier, funnier, more exciting - take your pick. I think perhaps he meant that from first conception to final cut, this film turned out exactly the way he wanted it to, with nothing lost in the process, more than any other movie he made. It certainly doesn't have any flaws; for me, it's just a bit too much like Santa Rosa - ordinary and respectable. Scripted by Thornton Wilder (the author of Our Town), Sally Benson and Alma Reville (Hitch's wife); catch the director's cameo as the unlucky card-player on the train.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most interesting aspect of the film is the cameo of Hitchcock?only part of his face visible sitting quietly in a dining car on a train. Opposite him is a doctor, who looks at him, and remarks "Are you alright?" soon after the doctor's female companion has suggested that he should take a professional look at another co-passenger the reclusive Charlie, played by Joseph Cotton. Why was Hitchcock looking unwell? He was looking at the incredible full grand slam of spades in his hand.The film's strength is not merely the suspense but the constant counterpoints of humor. Early in the film, Charlie is able to outwit two cops who try to follow him?the humor of the sequence is captured visually.Then comes the niece Charlie's young sister who does not take down the telegram because she cannot find a pencil without making much of an effort to find one.Then you have Charlie's mother shouting into the telephone mouthpiece, which leads her precocious daughter to remind her that she need not shout to be heard on the other end.Then comes the comment from the telegraph operator who cannot distinguish telepathy from telegraph.Uncle Charlie alights from the train with the aid of a walking stick but walks briskly soon after. Hume Cronyn (the brilliant actor who went on to develop the script of "Rope") plays an armchair detective, who conjures up ways to kill people while others are eating their dinner. The list goes on.Thornton Wilder and Hitchcock must have seen the importance of counteracting grim comments like "If you rip off the fronts of houses, you will find swine," the colorful statement that evil is everywhere, within families, in a nice town, in big cities. Just as the humor offsets the grim facts, the cliché of white (innocence) vs. black (evil) is used in the two introductory shots of the two Charlies lying on their respective beds. The humor balances the misanthropy of uncle Charlie. If you discount the humor the film would be lifeless?this is the missing element of the Nineties TV film remake of the same story, with interesting additional elements that are not present in Hitchcock's version.More than anything, Hitchcock and Wilder must have been pleased with themselves sculpting the structure of the story, the constant dualism in the alter egos of the two Charlies and two contrasting siblings (elder Charlie and younger Charlie's mother), and the innuendo of incest without showing direct evidence of it. The film would satisfy the creators more than the viewer. It might well be Hitchcock's favorite work but interesting as it is, it probably will never be the viewer's favorite Hitchcock film.</fullReview>

Bored, headstrong and resentful of her conformist parents, Charlotte hungers for excitement. She gets just this when her uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) visits. He's a serial killer. Nobody but Charlotte notices.A reversal of his "Saboteur", which moved from California to New York, "Doubt" moves from the shadowy, decrepit world of New York City, to a small-town Californian "paradise". A kind of precursor to the films of Nicholas Ray, Douglas Sirk and even David Lynch's "Blue Velvet", "Shadow" then begins to peel back facades and take a look at America's "actual" social and moral landscape. Subverting Norman Rockwell idylls, with their white picket fences and picture-perfect All American Families, Hitchcock offers a world in which Bank of America towers loom ominously over small towns, and where almost all characters are dull materialists afflicted with a terrible loneliness.Into this world steps Charlotte, a teenager on the cusp of womanhood, budding breasts and all. She finds herself in her own little rights-of-passage, awakening to her newfound sexuality and also the existential hollowness of those around her. "Nothing happens," she mourns. "We eat and sleep and that's about it!" Charlotte's father counters that they have money, but she cuts him off: "How can you talk about money when I'm talking about souls?" In Hitchcock's films, the villain oft embodies temptations to which, on an unconscious level, the heroes have yielded or wish to yield. Think the tennis pro in "Strangers on a Train" who secretly wishes to rid himself of an inconvenient wife, an act which is actually acted upon by someone else. A similar situation takes place in "Rear Window". In this way, a number of Hitch's films function as parables of sin and expiation.And so Charlotte and her namesake Charlie have a creepy relationship. They have a telepathic bond, he puts a wedding ring on her finger and sexual sparks fly whenever they're together. But Charlie then begins to reveal himself to be akin to the killers in Hitchcock's "Rope". He views himself as being "superior" and above common, bourgeois men. Deeply nostalgic, he also has fantasies about returning to the "gay ole 1890s", "when things were better". Charlotte sympathises with these views, detests those around her, until Charlie reveals himself to be a monster. Charlotte recoils from this point onwards, as if catching a glimpse of herself in a mirror. We see here the seductively dangerous nature of nostalgia, specifically the reactionary kinship between conservatism (an idealised past) and sentimental liberalism, where, as author Dennis Grunes notes, "the latter replaces the historical past with childhood as the object of adoration, converting it, too, into a pathological fetish." Charlie and Charlotte themselves function as shadows who have doubts. He views himself as the ideal male (potent adventurer, rugged individualist, American Hero), she as the ideal female (erotic woman, feisty), both contrasted with their shadows (the dull husband, the devoted mother etc), both contemptuous of bourgeois complacency and the unhappiness that arises from gender roles. The duo are linked from Hitchcock's very first shot, both actors' names side by side whilst couples circle in an intimate male/female waltz. The film will eventually end with Charlotte transforming from an independent woman to a domesticated "wife". In this way "family" is seen as threatening, a trap, no worse than outside.In the way Hitchcock muddies "inside" and "outside" the family, the film differs from many films of its era, which typically tried to shake viewers out of complacency by presenting idyllic families being infiltrated by evil, corrupting spectres (commies, fascists, creeps etc). Hitchcock, though, resists identification with the law, the authority, blurs the forces of good and evil, and paints "normalcy" itself as being something monstrous.Still, Charlotte's family members are a likable bunch. You have her adorable brother and sister, a passive father and a forlorn mother who constantly dotes on others. They counterpoint the headstrong, intelligent Charlotte, who symbolically dances Franz Lehar's Merry Widow waltz with Charlie, himself called the "Merry Widow Murderer". But Charlie's aberrations ? stemming from a childhood tragedy in which he almost died - don't differ much from the "mainstream" aberrations of Hitchcock's uber-conservative, American family. Indeed, Charlie believes himself to be but a more "pure" and "honest" manifestation of the greedy, soulless "civilization" he sees around him. "Money's become more important than souls," he mourns, the man a sick distortion of a sound moral attitude.And so Hitchcock literally positions a church opposite a mega-bank and positions sociopathy as the extreme reactive consequence of a societal preoccupation with wealth and profit. Charlotte's father, a banker, himself relaxes by playing games of death, human beings comically reduced to objectifiable "things" or "playthings", a game of death which Charlie later really "plays" with Charlotte. Elsewhere the film looks at the ruthlessness behind American benefaction: Charlie's murder money is used for philanthropic funds, church's sing ironic praises about Charlie and civic good and bloodshed are continually intertwined. Later it becomes clear that Charlie is obsessed with "dirty truths" due to shattered idealisations, and that Charlotte lives in a false idyll which is slowly shattered but which she nevertheless wishes to preserve. Indeed, she willingly turns a serial killer into a phony martyr, all for a community's fragile self-image. Though personally free from fantasy, she maintains a sense of civilised hypocrisy for the sake of town and mother."Doubt's" an incredibly modern picture, Hitchcock's camera work, compositions, editing rhythms, strong-but-young female lead, sophisticated script, subversive themes and powerful uses of silence incredibly novel for a film released in 1943. At the time, films simply didn't look, feel and move like this. Almost, but not quite.10/10 ? Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like Hitchcock, you'll love "Shadow of a Doubt!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching late-night movies the other day, I came across the movie that Alfred Hitchcock declared as one of his favorites. After viewing this dark drama, I can readily understand his reasoning. The film is brilliant, starring actress Teresa Wright and actor Joseph Cotton in a tense, well-acted display of one man's hidden evil, in juxtaposition to a town's innate goodness. Throughout the film, I kept hoping Young Charlie's uncle would be revealed to be innocent, possibly because his character displayed redeeming qualities. Most of all, the film explored Young Charlie's journey from innocence to reality in such a way that all of us lost a small portion of our childlike innocence. My favorite scene was when Young Charlie came down the stairs, wearing that emerald ring, causing the smile that was on her uncle's hopeful face to change to the sudden realization that he had to silence his favorite niece in order to keep his murderous past a secret. I highly recommend this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Shadow of a Doubt" is one of Hitchcock's best films, often overshadowed by famous but actually inferior pictures like "Notorious". It's not quite a masterpiece: the pacing is too slow and there is a minor (but important) plot hole - why does Uncle Charlie try to hide that piece of the newspaper since it had no references directly to him anyway and his family didn't suspect him at all? But it's still an involving, absorbing film, where Hitchcock uses few fancy tricks and focuses on his characters and his actors. Cotten is menacing, but Wright steals the film with her extremely winning performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best of all Hitchcock films, which is saying a hell of a lot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In addition to being the "master of suspense", Shadow of a Doubt should give Alfred Hitchcock a claim at being one of the first and best of the film noir generation. That might seem odd, given the many surface differences between this movie and the rest of the genre. The story is set in a bright and cheerful small town, not the dark and menacing inner city. Most of its characters are much more normal, upright and socially functional. There's relatively little violence here and a great deal of humor. But under the surface and beyond Hitchcock's artistry, the black and cynical blood of noir courses through this film's veins.Shadow of a Doubt spins around the axis of young Charlotte "Charlie" Newton (Teresa Wright) and her namesake Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten). Charlie is a far too earnest girl who chafes at the ordinary life of her ordinary family in her ordinary home town of Santa Rosa, California. She especially laments the life of family service that defines her mother, Emma (Patricia Collinge). When flamboyant and irrepressible Uncle Charlie comes to town for a visit, young Charlie is ecstatic. Not only because Emma is overjoyed to be reunited with her baby brother, who brings to life all her most cherished memories, but because the two Charlies aren't just uncle and niece. They're kindred spirits that recognize they are different than other people.However, Uncle Charlie isn't just visiting his dear relatives. He's on the run from the East Coast, pursued by two detectives, and from his very first moments on screen, the audience is shown a bleak darkness that simmers under Uncle Charlie's audacious charm. He is a man with a secret, one that's eating away at him and will forever change the life of his beloved niece.Like just about all his other movies, Shadow of a Doubt is filled with striking and powerful imagery. There are some young fools who don't appreciate Hitchcock's greatness and it is easy to understand why. By the time they get around to watching his work, they've seen his style and techniques aped by innumerable lesser filmmakers. Even with today's technology, many directors are still following in Hitchcock's footsteps. They're just going a step or two past the physical, material limitations he faced. It's only when you ponder how a movie made nearly 70 years ago can look and flow better than most modern films that you can appreciate the genius at work.The chief argument against putting this movie in the film noir genre is that it does not embrace and wallow in the blackness of life. It doesn't cast evil as the truth and good as merely pretense, but Hitchcock and his writers infuse almost every inch of this ordinary family and their ordinary lives with pain and anger and unease. It's not only Uncle Charlie's hidden malevolence or young Charlie's awakening rage. It's Emma's profound sadness at the childhood she desperately wishes she had back. It's Charlie's father Joseph (Henry Tavers) feeling uncomfortable at Uncle Charlie superseding him in the family dynamic. There's also Joseph's unusual hobby of talking with fellow detective magazine fan Herbie Hawkins (Hume Cronyn) about the best way the two of them could murder each other. The burned out waitress in the dance hall where the two Charlies have their first confrontation is a girl Charlie's age but with all the life beaten out of her. The difference between the two couldn't be more stark. Shadow of a Doubt is all about the mean underside of human existence and how it seeps up into the sunny surface.There are also some excellent performances on display here, something for which Hitchcock films are not always known. Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten are spectacular. Henry Travers and Patricia Collinge are amazing. These are probably some of the most real and genuine characters to ever be in a Hitchcock movie.Capped off with a truly wicked ending, Sadow of a Doubt is a great motion picture. It's not surprising Hitchcock called it his favorite film. Watch it and it might be yours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Problem Of Alfred Hitchcock: A Heretical View</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SHADOW OF A DOUBT is not my favorite Hitchcock film. I suspect that STRANGERS ON A TRAIN or THE LADY VANISHES or REAR WINDOW are better films. They seem to be better to me. But SHADOW OF A DOUBT, good film that it is, always disappoints me because of what I term is the problem of Hitchcock. His problem is his inability to resolve issues properly (or even present them properly).In many of his films, Hitchcock starts off certain points regarding the characters that are never fully developed properly. For example, in NORTH BY NORTHWEST there is an undercurrent of homosexual jealousy by Martin Landau towards the relationship of his boss James Mason with Eva Marie Saint. It culminates in the scene when, to prove a point about Saint's betraying Mason, Landau fires her gun point blank at a shocked Mason. Mason suddenly realizes it is loaded with blanks (that Saint fired it at Cary Grant, pretending to critically wound him, to impress Mason). He reacts swiftly, punching Landau in the face (he did not like being surprised like that), but fully believing what Landau showed him. This sequence seems to be setting up some future point in the film.It's a weak point possibly, but I always felt that the moment of resolution was that Mason should have been the man who stood over Grant and Saint when they were holding onto the cliff at Mount Rushmore, not Landau. Because, if you remember, in a desperate plea, Grant says, "Please help us." I have always felt that Hitchcock missed the boat in putting the totally malevolent Landau over Grant and Saint at that moment - it should have been Mason. Because Mason, despite his own anger, did at one point like Saint (he showed a better side to his nature). If Saint had been the one hanging on for dear life, and pleading, and Mason after an initial moment of anger overcame it and started rescuing her just as Landau turned up, the ending would have been more interesting. Landau would then have felt betrayed by Mason, and might have pulled out a gun and shot him (this time fatally). It would have carried the relationship question to a more logical point.The same thing happens here in SHADOW OF A DOUBT. Young Charlie's problems with Uncle Charlie are compounded by the general liking felt by most people in the town for the latter. But if you notice, at various points in the film, members of Young Charlie's family do have "shadows of a doubt" about Uncle Charlie. Her father (Henry Travers) is humiliated in his bank job by Uncle Charlie hinting he is an embezzler, and that the books are cooked. Take a look at Travers when Joseph Cotton leaves laughing. It is one of curiosity and wonder compared to his general acceptance before. Young Charlie's two younger siblings notice Uncle Charlie's odd behavior destroying a newspaper to show them a trick, and then forgetting the trick (the paper had an article about the "Merry Widow" murder mystery. But finally there is Young Charlie's mother. She is mothering sister - we learn that she can't help it, after her parents died she only had her little brother Charlie (reading between the line she probably helped turn him into the selfish monster he is by spoiling him). But after the last of a series of accidents befall Young Charlie, as they all drive away to a social event, the mother says to herself that it is strange that so many bad things happened to her daughter, as though they were planned. This is never followed through (a point brought out on this thread in another comment). It should have been.Given her incredible fondness for her worthless brother, it would have been more interesting if Hitchcock had ended the film with a slightly different conclusion on that train. Suppose, while Uncle Charlie purposely delays his niece from departing the train, his sister (wondering what is delaying Theresa Wright) re-boards the train at a different door to catch Cotton trying to push Wright off. At that point a moment of truth might have occurred to the mother - and of shock. It would have been more interesting if in rescuing Wright, the mother pushes Cotton off the train into the path of the oncoming locomotive. Why Hitchcock or Thornton Wilder did not see such a simple conclusion to the problem (tying in with the idea of a "shadow of a doubt" theme) is just beyond my comprehension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Receives more credit than it deserves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No spoilers.This film tries to build suspense through simpler methods, everything that happens in the film seems like it could happen in your own life. I feel that viewers seem to have focused more on this different approach towards building suspense than they spend actually feeling the suspense, leading it to become overrated by most viewers. As a result it receives some praise for being a different type of film more than actually being an entertaining film. Hitchcock also said it was his personal favorite, which also has helped push people towards viewing it as a classic.I wouldn't call it a bad movie, however in my opinion it falls short of Hitchcock's later efforts. If I have to say something nice I'll give credit to the acting being a little above par for that time period. Other than that even for being made in 1943 I would have to consider it average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the most obviously good of Hitchcock's films but still an enjoyable piece despite difficulties in plotting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Newton's live a peaceful life in Santa Rosa - and young Charlie decides to liven things up by inviting her uncle Charlie to visit. She goes to the telegram office to find that he is already on his way. Uncle Charlie brings excitement and makes a difference to the daily routine for the Newton's but Charlie's affection for him is threatened when two men turn up investigating her uncle's possible connection with the murders of several rich widows. With the clues pointing to Uncle Charlie being the Merry Widow Murderer, the relationship between the two breaks down in tension.I was attracted to Shadow of a Doubt by the presence of Joseph Cotten, an actor who's films I tend to enjoy on the whole - I was not aware that this was featured so highly on the imdb 250 chart and am quite surprised that it is. The film takes little Charlie's desire for interest and excitement and makes it much more than she expected she would have expected. The guts of the film is little Charlie's loss of innocence as she begins to suspect her uncle of being more than just the interesting man she thinks she knows; this aspect works pretty well as it gathers a good pace around this discovery - surprising considering we are never in doubt that Charlie is the killer. The plot is not perfect however, there are not so much holes as, well, gaps in the film that are perhaps difficult to accept. These are mainly little things that don't make sense and seem to have been overlooked in favour of the central relationship dynamic. As I say, this worked well but there were issues with the plot that didn't always ring true to me.The film has a palatable tension throughout, as I say, a feat made more impressive by the fact that I never had any doubt that Charlie was the killer. This is the mark of a good director and Hitchcock does prove himself here (as if he had anything to prove!). He not only fills the foreground with this tension but he also puts plenty of nice touches all around the film - be it the `how to murder' dialogue or the support characters themselves. The main roles of course are the two Charlie's and both are interesting even if not totally clear. Wright is great as the niece Charlie and is convincing in the emotions that she goes through. Cotten has a showier role but occasionally hams it up as a result, but mostly his dark ramblings are pretty much spot on. Support is interesting from Hume Cronyn, Wonacott, Carey and the rest of the Newton family and they add detail around the story by being colourful while still allowing the lead pair to have a definite lead.Overall this is a good film although I must confess not to be as taken by it as I would have hoped. The film is a little too slow and has a few too many gaps in it that served to annoy me a little bit and detract from the story. However Hitchcock uses the central two characters to build his tension and thus stops the plot gaps being too much of a problem. Both Cotten and Wright lead the film well and a great director adds colour and uses their performances to generate tension and drive the film forward. Not perfect and far from Hitchcock's best but still a very enjoyable film that is typically Hitchcockian in some if not all regards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So so, still pretty good Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just about a half-step down from his usual films, not in his specific directing but choice of a story and just film as a whole. As always, there's a great deal of mystery insidiously woven throughout the first act that immediately catches the viewer's utmost interest, and the development makes for a smooth watch. The casting is very good, with notably the at times breathtakingly beautiful and natural Teresa Wright as the very strong and bold female lead, and Cotten who plays his role of the perpetually suspect and obscure uncle just right. There's enough to go around to fill up the film convincingly, but the ending feels something of a rush. As very often with Hitchcock films, the ending is the least subtle part of the picture, something of a more ordinary finishing point than brought to expect - which definitely dents a good, sometimes great effort's worth. Almost like the film's had enough of itself and just wants to move on to the next.Pretty good film, definitely a smooth viewing and a few things to look forward to, just perhaps that last part. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SHADOW OF A DOUBT is a psychological thriller full of distrust and mystery. I've always wondered how Hitch enjoys uncertainty and tension in their films. In the idyllic environment and "unspoiled" town one (admired) character brings his dark secret. The director has made an almost perfect contrast.Hitch shows us in the very beginning of the film as one of the main characters is something wrong. This is perhaps the main drawback. We stayed poor for normal and superior change in the atmosphere. The entire film runs in a similar vein. The changes are visible, but not exaggerated. The highlight of surprises and tension is again excellent. After that, the atmosphere is a bit tense and depressed. In the second part of the film expressions of morality and solidarity are a bit strange. The world is a terrible place to live, and every now and then someone goes crazy. Given the theme of the movie, my statement can be cynical and justified at the same time.Scenography and acting are as usual at a high level. Teresa Wright as Charlotte "Charlie" Newton is the first part of the film victim of her own instincts and emotions, while in the second part of the film victim of the dangerous truth and "loved" person. Change in acting is visible and quite good. Joseph Cotten as Charles "Charlie" Oakley is a charming uncle, a killer and a scoundrel. It is difficult to simply consider a complex character. Prominent these psycho-physical mysterious moments when the beloved uncle feels threatened. Shadow of a doubt are expressed in both character. In the same moment. It's fascinating.The story is not convincing. However, the coincidence is no place in Hitchcock's style.Without some exaggerated doubt this is a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the cheers of Idealization meets the shock of Deception, you get the thrills of the "Shadow of a Doubt'...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shadow of a Doubt" was pivotal in Hitchcock's career as the first movie set in directors' Promised Land: America. And if I'm not sure that he held the film in higher regards than some later classics, I'm pretty sure though that the film was a sentimental favorite. And the word 'sentimental' is crucial as the underlying theme of "Shadow of a Doubt", is "when idealization meets deception" and we idealize a big deal in the name of sentimentality.So sentimentality was a prevalent element of Hitch' premiere in America, he wanted the most American-looking location, one you couldn't tell in which state it was. The privilege went to Santa Rosa, a postcard little town of old fashion charm, with an obligatory library, train station, bank, all in one copy. Townspeople know each other by first name, from the priest to the brave overweight traffic cop. The town also neighbored some famous Californian vineyards, which made the shooting all the more interesting for Hitch and all.If the sleepy little town could appeal to any outsider in quest of peace, some insiders would have a much different opinion. Charlotte, played by the sweet and talented Teresa Wright, nicknamed Charlie after her mother's brother but will be called Charlotte in this review for clarity's sake, doesn't feel exactly like a fish in water. When we first see her, she's lying on her bed, wondering how she can get off this unbearable heaviness of boredom. And she can't find any supports from her parents played by former co-stars, from "Mrs. Miniver", Henry Travers, a banker, and from "The Little Foxes", Patricia Collinge as the devoted housewife.All these faces fit together and the actors are so natural we really believe this is a family, but there are many hints suggesting that each member tries to escape from a suffocating routine The mother is mentally rooted in the past and mourns her brother, Charlie whose absence had a profound effect on her well-being. The father shares a strange hobby with his friend Herb (Hume Cronyn in his debut) imagining the perfect crime as if they were about to write a crime novel. The precocious little sister Ann, is a bookworm, as indicated by her glasses, and doesn't indulge to child's activities, and the youngest child Roger enjoys counting steps between places. Unrealistic? I used to do the same thing as a child.As usual, Hitch manages to create eccentric yet realistic characters, and Charlotte, the one person who had her feet on the ground decides to invite her Uncle. She learns that Uncle Charlie is coming to pay a visit after many years of absence. And it's not much the news that delights Charlotte, but the fact that she and her uncle had the same idea, she calls it telepathy, we call it idealization. We all feel a deep connection with the people we love and will find signs everywhere. And sneaky Hitch provides us the same signs, so we can also feel that bond. Narrative-wise, it's excellent because in a film where the bad guy is the main protagonist, Hitch knows we have to root for him a little, he manages to create the empathy by giving similar feelings to the good characters.So Hitchcock (who's all about signs) give us the ultimate sign of a deep bond between Charlie and Charlotte. When we first see Uncle Charlie, played by the great Joseph Cotton, he's also lying in a bed in some lousy place in New Jersey, just like his niece. But obviously, he has darker motives as suggested by the cops who try to arrest him. Uncle Charlie is a fugitive, a criminal whose record will be revealed progressively, but we're already ahead of Charlotte and her family. And the first visual sings of the titular shadow seem to be conveyed by the heavy cloud of gray smokes coming from the train, when Uncle Charlie arrives. Hitchcock, loved contrasts and the idea of sleazy evil coming to disturb the quiet peaceful town, something so impossible that no one would accept it, not even Charlotte, maybe not even us.It's a strange feeling because as soon as he comes, Uncle Charlie is like the touchstone of the family, such a natural charismatic character that we somewhat want the happiness to be maintained to this status quo. However, Uncle Charlie constantly throws hints to the face of Charlotte, and her resistance to face the truth takes its source from her admiration toward uncle. Before being a psychological battle, it's an internal one, and the whole first act is your typical Hitchcockian quest of a mysterious identity. The film gets actually more interesting once Charlotte knows, and has to digest the contrast between her idealization of her Uncle and what he really is, and it's such a startling contrast that she knows her mother mustn't know the secret, because it would kill her, it becomes a life-and-death situation.It also allows to cops not to arrest him in the house and so begins a psychological battle between the man-who-wants-to-stay and the girl-who-wants-him-to-leave and it naturally culminates with murder impulses from both sides. And while the story leads us to its thrilling resolution, we discover deeper and darker aspects of the protagonists' personalities, confronting two visions of life: cheerful and optimistic and twisted and misanthropist, and Teresa Wright is as convincing in the positive as in the negative emotions. And while the good triumphs over the evil, she's slightly contaminated by her Uncle's spirit, and might have her own shadow of a doubt regarding the goodness of human nature.While a masterpiece in its own terms, the film has a few little flaws but Hitch, and even us, viewers, keep on idealizing "Shadow of a Doubt", just like the family idealized Uncle Charlie, ignoring his darkest side. It's part of human nature. The question is, do we idealize the film better for its good or for its dark side?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fans of Alfred Hitchcock will love this earlier work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shadow of a Doubt was, according to the Director himself, Hitchcock's favorite of his films, most likely because it opened a door for his later work. He had moved past the point of merely trying to thrill an audience, instead towards shocking them. Coming from an outsider's perspective, Hitchcock saw America for what it was at the time: a culture obsessed with war and violence that wanted to bury the past. America had been involved in World War II for several years at this point, those left behind were mainly older people who had little to do outside of work. He knew people wanted to see a good murder-mystery, and he finally poked at people's interest in the subject, by putting them in the story.Beginning in the average home life of the time, Hitchcock unsettles everything by introducing Uncle Charlie. The viewer is immediately introduced to Charlie's world, where we understand right away that he is a murderer evading the police. But to his family, Uncle Charlie is a charming, charismatic, handsome man, who is also obviously disturbed in some way. The way the characters choose to ignore this fact is telling. Uncle Uncle Charlie obviously has some sort of past abuse of some form or another in order to be a violent criminal, and his character lets his resentment known a number of times. The fact that no one had even attempted at this point to examine what made someone this way is revolutionary, and is not merely a coincidence. Uncle Charlie seems intent on burying the past the same way everyday people at time also attempted. Regardless, he is desperate to bring the family together, even though it can't be ignored that he is a criminal trying to hide himself in a normal setting. The fact that Hitchcock had chosen to bring a killer into a family setting is the source of the film's suspense. He was trying to get under the skin of everyday people at the time. All he had to do to in order to achieve this, was put Uncle Charlie at a dinner table with everyday people. The dinner scene carries the entire significance of the film. All focus is put on Uncle Charlie during the scene. We see, in close up, Uncle Charlie summarize his harsh feelings towards his targets, in a way that the audience is unable to ignore. It defines the entire work, and it is masterfully executed. Make sure to watch intently as it happens.The entire film hints at something unseen. Alfred Hitchcock knew that suspense came from a more mysterious place, and this is him executing that at a masterful level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Hitchcock's Movie I have seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my 72 years of age, which happens to be the same time since this picture was released(1943), I thought I had seen all of this Master of suspense movies, but I was delighted to discover this one. What I love about this film, is how he plays with all different kind of emotions. The beginning of the film is kind of creepy. The following scenes, hint of what type of Person Uncle Charlie is. How he travels in the train to Santa Rosa, and gets off the train, it is a basic indication of this. The movie has moments to laugh, to be serious and meditate about what the actors say, and shows true emotions of the different members and friends of the family. Even when many of us would suspect the outcome of this plot, the real suspense is to know how this would happen. One of the last scenes where Little Charlie and her brother and sister go out to say good bye to their Uncle, is very obvious that something unexpected will happen, but again, the mystery is: What will happen? Great Movie. I agree with Hitchcock that this is his best one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By now, this is the fourth Hitchcock film that I've seen and it certainly is a better representation of what I understood his work to be than SABOTEUR was. SHADOW OF A DOUBT, which Hitchcock said was his favorite, is a rather simple tale that explores one of his favorite themes: mistaken identity. Joseph Cotten (THE THIRD MAN) plays "Uncle Charlie" who visits his family for a visit in Santa Rosa, California. However, he's not quite what his young niece Charlie remembers. One thing I've noticed about Hitchcock's films is the various ways he's able to create tension and suspense in a way that keeps the viewer hooked. Some of the elements he uses includes light and shadow, camera angles, the score, etc. All of them came together in a rather cohesive way that kept me interested in seeing where the story would go. This film also captures an America in transition. The world created here isn't the paranoia-filled one of SABOTEUR, but still one where suspicion is very palpable and there's a sense that trust is becoming less of an innate quality in Everytown, USA. Like in SABOTEUR, there are two characters who serve as thematic counterpoint to each other. Here, they are the two Charlies. Joseph Cotten's character is somewhat of an idealized figure for his young niece (Teresa Wright), but the reality of how cynical and pessimistic he really is gets revealed over the course of the film. I thought it was a brilliant way of showing how expectations measure up when faced with reality. There's also the "is he/isn't he?" sense of if he's really even the person he purports to be, which plays into the themes of suspicion and trust. One thing I wasn't entirely expecting was the awkward sexual tension (in a few scenes) between the two Charlies, which added an incest layer that helped to flesh out the tense relationship between them. If there's anything weak about the film, the ending was a bit abrupt and a romance that develops between young Charlie and a detective seemed to be shoehorned in (and provided for an unnecessary coda. Still, I liked this film very much and it bodes well for the successive Hitchcock films I'll be viewing later this month.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Shadow of a Doubt" is a thriller movie in which we watch a man who travels to his sister's house in order to spend some days there with her and her family. The oldest daughter of her loves her uncle very much and her uncle loves her the same. Although after some time she starts to observe some strange things and also the strange behavior of her uncle. And everything gets even more complicated when two strangers appear asking questions about him.I liked this movie because of the plot which was very mysterious and unpredictable. Also the direction which made by the master Alfred Hitchcock was simply the best for one more time. About the interpretations I have to say that I liked the interpretation of Joseph Cotten who played as Uncle Charlie and he was very good at it and also the interpretation of Teresa Wright who played as Young Charlie and she was equally good.Lastly I believe that "Shadow of a Doubt" is a good movie to watch with much of suspense but if I had to compare it with some of the other masterpieces of Alfred Hitchcock then I would say that this movie would be a little lower than the others. If you want a thriller and mysterious movie then just watch this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great creepy Hitchcock movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotten) is being followed by two men. He decides to hide out with his sister's family in Santa Rosa, California. Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright) is a bored teenager who wants to contact her worldly uncle Charlie. To her surprise, he sent them a telegram right at the same time. He gives her an expensive ring inscribed with "TS from BM". Herbie Hawkins (Hume Cronyn) is the father Mr. Newton (Henry Travers)'s brother-in-law and both like to imagine the perfect murder stories. Uncle Charlie is hiding the newspapers and niece Charlie notices. He never has his picture taken. The last picture is a childhood photo just before his accident. Two men are coming over to interview a typical American family and want to take their pictures. When they take his picture, he takes the whole roll back. Niece Charlie figures out that the two men are detectives searching for a murderer and she agrees to keep quiet for the sake of her mother. She goes to the library and finds the newspaper with the story of the "Merry Widow" who had murdered three women with the last being Mrs Bruce Matthewson.There is a real creepy vibe between the uncle and niece Charlies at the beginning. That starts the movie off on the correct and uncomfortably awkward tone. As uncle Charlie's weird actions pile up, the suspense builds. Joseph Cotten taps into his inner villain. I think he is quite good playing this character. Teresa Wright is a little old when she's twenty something playing a teenager. She actually looks twenty something. That is maybe why the chemistry seems to be so creepy. This is a great creepy Hitchcock movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good mystery story that has a lot to offer if you look closely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can view this as a good mystery story (which I did first time), but on a thematic level this is highly interesting. Hitchcocks juxtaposes the American dream with danger. He works extremely hard to fill the movie with many allusions, metaphors. Note how the survey of the typical American family is not a mere plot element, but also a way of rubbing the ordinary into our faces. Similarly, traditional or common-use things like a waltz theme or the mother baking her perfect cake are used to enhance this image. And meanwhile, there is of course danger threatening to rip this apart. At one point, one of the characters even says it bluntly: "You live in a dream. You're a sleepwalker, blind." And young Charlie's idolisation of her Uncle Charlie is for sure intentionally a little brooding, embodying the tension between the two things at work here. As much as this is an entertaining mystery, it is also Hitchcock's way of forcing us to view the danger amidst the ordinary.What Hitchcock does here is very reminiscent of what Lynch does in many of his works, particularly Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks. There are differences: Lynch goes further and deconstructs the American suburb dream, whereas Hitchcock's main concern is not showing the ugliness within the dream itself, rather showing how there is some ugliness threatening the dream. And perhaps Lynch is a little more perverse (of course he had no Hays censor code to work with).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense on Main Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Shadow of a Doubt", Alfred Hitchcock takes the action to Main Street USA. To understand this movie as it was meant to affect the average viewer, just read an old 1940s newspaper on microfilm. The advertisements speak with almost surreal frequency of the typical American family, this nonexistent ideal that so many people felt as if they should be striving to be.This typical family ideal was very powerful, and to question it had a power that it simply doesn't today. This movie is essentially a challenge to that ideal, albeit a charmingly clumsy challenge that was all Hollywood could muster at the time. This movie doesn't say that race relations or an evolving economy or lifestyle-altering technology is a threat to the typical American family, but simply that evil, uncaring people are the threat.We are presented with a family that, despite its protestations, is told by a national survey team that they are the typical American family. Indeed the family is off-kilter, but nevertheless Hitchcock intends them as a typical family, if geared toward being audience-pleasing with all their quirks.Their peaceful "typical" life is interrupted when "Uncle Charlie" comes for a visit. The abrasive city-dweller with many secrets and detectives in tow makes very explicit the threat he represents, telling his namesake niece "You go through your ordinary little day, and at night you sleep your untroubled ordinary little sleep, filled with peaceful stupid dreams. And I brought you nightmares." The suspense in this movie isn't Uncle Charlie's dark past and what he'll do to avoid capture, but, in the context of 1943 America, it must have meant to be shocking that a nihilistic self-loathing man capable of murder without any qualms could be coming to a pleasant, picture-perfect small town USA. The scare here for the original audiences was an attack on "ordinary America"."Shadow of a Doubt" shows us a pleasant world of (white) people cheerfully walking on sidewalks, being helped along by the kindly policeman and hurrying home to dinner with their idealized families, and asks us to imagine that being under attack. While the threat to "Ordinary America" didn't end up being evil uncles, it's still a powerful movie about the fear of change.Stylistically, it is full of wonderful angles and exciting, by-the-books suspense building. I personally don't feel it's the top-tier classic many do, there's far too much formula and cliché and not a great deal of truly original concepts, but it's still a worthwhile movie to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock Favourite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story of a young woman (Teresa Wright) living in a small town with her family and looking forward to a visit from her favorite uncle (Joseph Cotten). The trouble is that she begins to suspect her uncle might be a serial killer known as the Merry Widow murderer.The picture shows Hitchcock's great skill at developing suspense. While he would make many great thrillers over his career, this film stands out for me because it achieves this result without the fantastic locales or the spectacular set pieces of some of his later films.Teresa Wright who would be nominated for three Oscars and win one in the two years leading up to this film is very effective in her role. Equally as effective is Joseph Cotten at is most sinister.The strong supporting cast includes MacDonald Carey, Henry Travers (Clarence from it s a Wonderful Life) and Hume Cronyn.The script that so effectively works at building the suspense in the small town locale was co-written by Thorton Wilder (Our Town).As has often been cited this was reportedly Hitchcock's personal favorites amongst his own films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing duality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie I was struck by the aggressive, brutality of what was acceptable on film in 1943. That is just the beginning of the amazing duality that exists in Shadow of a Doubt. What can I say but, "watch it twice" It first appears to us that both "Charlie's" live in parallel worlds one bright and clean the other dark and dirty, as we see in the beginning scenes. As the movie continues we see that Charles lives life in the past and one in the present being disgusted by the current and fond of the old where as young Charlie is happy with the current but not with the reality of the world. It's brutality and barbarism disgusts her and she is very outspoken about it as Charles is. She is all pleasant and beautiful and Charles is dark, brooding. The duality spirals on and on like a bad case of Vertigo. I am always amazed by this movie and I see more each time I watch it. I consider this more than a gem by Hitchcock, it's a true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Uncle Charlie comes to visit the Newtons in their quiet town of Santa Rosa, young Charlie (his niece, named after him) is thrilled. Thrilled that is, until she realizes that he is being pursued by two detectives who suspect that he is the "Merry Widow" murderer. Various things make young Charlie suspicious of her uncle and this leads to an exciting climax.Shadow of a Doubt is a wonderful film which shows clearly Hitchcock's skill at building and maintaining suspense throughout a film's run. But it is not just the suspense that makes this movie work. The whole presentation of Santa Rosa-the feel of a sleepy, pleasant little town-is charming, the dialog is witty and entertaining and the characters are well developed, interesting and well acted. No one does a bad job in this film and they all fit together perfectly within the framework of the story.Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>as Ace Ventura would say. Isn't there enough comments about this film already? of course, you should read the ones under The Dark Knight.. it's an encyclopedia by now.Every scene is so carefully crafted, every movement, dialogue, lighting choices. Case in point : the dinner scene. The overall tone is very strange, Cotten comes across in the entrance scene as scheming, dark, and brooding with untethered thoughts. Yet with this is the contrast of a small town family reunion. The lauded closeness between the niece and uncle is kind of chilling with its undertone.The tension and sharp change in mode in restaurant scene near the end just grabs you by the throat and strangles the air out of it. Only part I didn't like was the melodramatic train ending. Give it maybe another 10 minutes - milk it with more suspense and maybe less dialogue, more glances. But there was not way as Cotton's characters seems to need a reason for remorse but can't find one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Always enjoyed the great acting of Joseph Cotten, (Uncle Charlie) who starts off this movie laying in bed and smoking a cigar and and just staring into space, with money thrown all over the floor of his boarding house room. His landlady tells him that two men were looking for him, but she told them he was not feeling very well and she did not want to disturb him. It is from this point in the film when Charlie decides to take off to visit his sister's family in a small town and hide out from who ever is trying meet up with him. Charlie is well liked by his sister's daughter, Charlie Newton, (Teresa Wright) who thinks the world of her uncle Charlie. Charlie Newton is a very smart young gal and starts to get suspicious of the way her uncle is acting and the story begins to get very interesting which will keep you glued to the silver screen. Great Hitchcock film with great actors and a great ending which will definitely surprise you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love It,Then Fear It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gripping and expertly shot thriller which also unites comedy, social consciousness and film-noir. What makes this film utterly interesting, is the ambiguity of the relationship of the two main protagonists, young Charlie (Teresa Wright) and her uncle Charles (Joseph Cotten). The swinger seems to epitomize the dark side of the charming girl, a motif of romantic (and Victorian?) tradition Hitchcock refers to again and again. Between both there is also a latently incestuous conjunction: Charlie is as excited as a lover before and while the uncle arrives; later, he gives her a (stolen) ring, as if she was his fiancé.As Truffaut and other critics already commented, the dichotomy of the Charlie/Charles-character is specified in the dual structure of the whole film: There are two policemen in the East and two in the West, two sought criminals and two private detectives, two doctors and two siblings, two scenes at the train station and two in the garage, two scenes in front of the church and two at dinner etc</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth About Charlie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shadow of a Doubt" (1943), the story of a serial murderer as a loving uncle is the movie which Hitchcock himself had declared as his favorite. This movie is quite a departure from Hitchcock's previous Hollywood productions. For the first half, it is an intimate family dramedy that describes a typical American family in a typical small town, USA which in this film is called Santa Rosa, CA. Hitch said about the movie, "I am extremely anxious to avoid the conventional small-town American scene and the stock figures that have been seen in so many films." Much of the film was shot on location in a real California small town far away from the studio. The director worked closely with the famous writer Thornton Wilder on the screen (Oscar nomination) about a charming attractive young man (Joseph Cotten) who after many years comes to Santa Rosa to visit with the family of his older sister whom he truly loved. He brings into the lives of his relatives, especially his older niece and namesake Charlie (Teresa Wright) excitement and joy. Soon things begin look puzzling and even grim when two undercover detectives from a big city on the East Coast show up in Santa Rosa and reveal to Charlie who by the words of her father, "has brains" and the power of observation that her beloved uncle Charlie may be an infamous "Merry Widows murderer" on the run. The girl does not want to believe the detectives but she can't help noticing her uncle's strange behavior, his sudden and scary mood changes. The inscription on a gorgeous emerald ring he gave her as a gift makes her think of a previous owner of the pricey jewelry. She grows increasingly suspicious of the uncle who loves his niece but he loves his freedom much, much more...Unbearable tension builds up, leading to the series of accidents and to hair-raising climax in the best traditions of Hitchcock's movies.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, I don't necessarily like being told something is a "classic" until I finally see it for myself and judge it on its merits. I don't want to base my opinion on what some swarthy critic condescendingly tells me what makes the film so great, worthwhile ... classic. So, while I was watching "Shadow Of A Doubt," I really tried to retain that in the back of my mind. First of all ... I think "Shadow Of A Doubt" IS a classic. Alfred Hitchcock's name-sake alone makes this film worthwhile. Maybe I am channeling more than just a few critics, here, but even Hitchcock's lesser films have flourishes of masterful cinematic technique. "Shadow Of A Doubt" is certainly NOT one of those films, however. There's more than enough, here, to place it on the same shelf as "Rear Window," and "The 39 Steps." Here, in his first American film, Hitchcock whittles out an excellent story of deceit, suspicion, and outright terror. One that plunges us, the viewer, deep into its guts. Joseph Cotton plays Charlie, a man whose mysterious criminal past prompts him to flee for California, where his sister, nieces and nephews reside. As he arrives, his niece Charlie (Teresa Wright) greets him with love and more than just a little hero-worship. And yet, after a firm warning from a police investigator, she begins to suspect that her uncle may, in fact, be a vicious killer who has sought asylum in her mother's home. As the tension slowly rises, Charlie's mistrust gives way to bone-chilling terror. And we, as the audience, question everything that we/she sees until the surprising finale. You know ... my only real complaint about "Shadow Of A Doubt" is its dawdling pace. Hitchcock takes WAY too much time establishing each character. He's a master filmmaker, but the suspense really didn't add up until well after the mid-way point of the movie. And while I enjoyed the development and the fine writing, some of it becomes moot at the very end. But ... lingering for the climax was well worth the admission price. Besides, Joesph Cotton is pure gold, here. When, at the dinner table, he begins a sort of silent but deadly tirade about widowed women, frivolously squandering their husbands' money, Hitchcock's camera reluctantly pushing in to Cotton's face. "Are they human or are they fat, wheezing animals, hmm," asks Cotton. "And what happens to animals when they get too fat and too old?" I don't know where this seething hatred originates ... but it's enough to evoke a nightmare or two. Cotton does it quite well. He knows how to dominate the screen without appearing to even try. He's strikingly handsome, but not pretty enough to be your average dispassionate Hollywood heart-throb. He had the look of an everyman, who only happened to know are really great tailor. I think that "Shadow Of A Doubt" indeed is a classic. It's slow to start ... but it finishes very well, under Hitchcock's knowing eye. Also ... check out Joseph Cotton in one of my favorites, "The Third Man."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No "Doubt" about this film's quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been reported that Shadow of a Doubt was Alfred Hitchcock's favorite film from his oeuvre. While it's not my personal favorite of Hitchcock's films that I have seen (Psycho still rules supreme), I was rather struck by the power this film still holds more than fifty years after it's initial release.The centerpiece of this film is the character of "Uncle Charlie", portrayed by Joseph Cotton (famously just off of a role in Citizen Kane). He is on the lamb from some detectives tracking him, suspicious that he is the "Merry Widow Strangler", a man who charms wealthy widows and then kills them, taking their vast riches with him. Needing a place to hide out, Charlie decides to visit his older sister, Emma Newton (Patricia Collinge) in sunny Santa Rosa, California. There, he is greeted warmly by his sister's family, especially his niece, named Charlie (Teresa Wright), after him. However, it doesn't take long before Uncle Charlie begins to exhibit some strange behavior, ripping out stories in the newspaper, questioning the sudden appearance of some national surveyors who have seemingly coincidentally selected the Newton family for a subject of their survey, and becoming quite irate when individuals look into any of his belongings. When one of the surveyors, Jack Graham (MacDonald Carey), informs young Charlie that he is a detective who is on the trail of her Uncle, she at first doesn't believe him. But when Uncle Charlie becomes suspicious that she knows the truth, he beings to openly threaten her and suddenly the benevolent visitor becomes a palpable source of evil living in their otherwise average home.Hitchcock weaves a tale of menace living beneath a façade of kindness and good-looks. Uncle Charlie is a romantic notion of what many of us would like in a family member: well-traveled, upbeat, well-off financially, adventurous. Charlie is quickly the talk of both the family and their immediate social circle after he arrives, invited to give speaking engagements in the small town and his sister is excited to have him there, reawakening memories of their happy childhood. Young Charlie is taken with him most, exuberant at his presence, believe he is the key to breaking her out of a malaise she has been feeling about "average" life. But Hitchcock quickly shows us the other side of Charlie. He snaps at younger Charlie and the rest of the family when he is concerned that he is being found out, going so far to grab Charlie's wrist when she finds a newspaper article in his jacket pocket. The film contains many scenes of idyllic small-town life before Charlie arrives to show what an ideal world exists there, a world that begins to show some cracks after his arrival.While he receives only second billing officially, this is Joseph Cotton's film all the way. It is reported that this is the only time in his career that he portrayed a heavy, and you wonder why he never gave it another try, because he is outstanding as Uncle Charlie. Cotton's normally cheerful and warm features disappear behind a visage of hate and menace often in the film, creating a chilling persona. Twice in the film, Hitchcock and screenwriters Thornton Wilder, Sally Benson and Alma Reville give Charlie speeches that reveal the hollow, misogynist core of this otherwise normal looking man. During one of the speeches at the family dinner table, the camera slowly zooms in until only Uncle Charlie's face fills the screen, as he mesmerizes the audience with his distaste for the world around him. He is a character who hates women, hates normal, average life, hates people in general and is only interested in his own well-being. When young Charlie defiantly stands against him, he begins plotting to do away with her, shattering whatever image we had up to that point of his good intentions.As with many of his other films, Hitchcock uses unique camera work to tell his story on occasion. This includes an early scene filmed from a high-angle, only to use this as a transition to a character observing others from the same angle, even after viewing the same character from the same perspective just a few moments before. But even more important, Hitchcock keeps the tension high as we watch events unspool, uncertain of where things are going next. In this respect, Shadow of a Doubt is no less accomplished than any modern thriller.Some aspects of this film have certainly dated (the rather prim and proper attitude to family life, for one), but it's still an amazing accomplishment to have stood the test of time. If you have any interest in a good thriller, Shadow of a Doubt is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the things about Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt is that it keeps us in suspense throughout and of which is the objective to this film. It tells the story about a young girl named Charlie (played by Teresa Wright)begins to suspect that her Uncle Charlie (played by Joseph Cotten)may be the so called "Merry Widow Murderer", then a deadly game of cat and mouse starts as soon as Uncle Charlie plots her death. Director Alfred Hitchcock can rely on making every suspense thriller that he makes into a masterpiece. This movie compares to some of his own movies such as Spellbound, Vertigo, Rear Window, and Dial M for Murder. Also the film compares to other suspense thrillers such as The Conversation, The French Connection, Spy Game and many more. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat when I first started watching it and this movie will stay with you for life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . or maybe it is Alfred Hitchcock himself who is tone deaf here, as connecting the obscure Merry Widow Waltz with the national media's decision to tab Charlie's uncle Charles as "the Merry Widow Killer" is a stretch so lame it boggles the mind. The humming of this tune at the extended family dinner table constitutes the proverbial plot hole large enough for a semi-truck's entrance. Someone such as poet Alan Ginsberg (or was it the poison-witted Dorothy Parker?) once recommended that story tellers "kill their darlings" or pet ideas that clutter what might otherwise be a workable tale. This movie is one of the best examples from the body of human culture that illustrates what can happen when an artist stubbornly refuses to kill his darling (in this case, the "merry widow" motif). It's no surprise to the knowledgeable that Hitch always named SHADOW OF A DOUBT as his favorite film among his own 50-plus offerings, as it is one of his most misogynistic, trimmed with sprigs of incest overtones. After SHADOW OF A DOUBT, the viewer can see how there was no place left for him to go other than the psychotic extremes of VERTIGO, PSYCHO, and MARNIE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Effortlessly managing to endure the test of time, Shadow of a Doubt is a deftly crafted psychological thriller from Alfred Hitchcock that tells the story of a young girl &amp; her relationship with her charming "Uncle Charlie" who might not be the man he actually seems to be.Brilliantly directed by Hitchcock who cleverly allows the doubts &amp; uncertainties to creep into the viewers' minds from its opening moments and keeps us on our toes throughout its runtime, thanks to expert placements of twists &amp; turns, Shadow of a Doubt presents the revered director in prime form &amp; is his first indisputable masterpiece.The screenplay itself exhibits a tightly structured story, its scripted characters are homely, finely shaded &amp; very believable, the moral complexity present in the film not only tests its characters but us viewers as well and the entire film is skilfully edited to deliver a cinematic experience that's incredibly tense &amp; spine-chilling.Also benefiting the film are the stellar performances from its cast, its splendid score &amp; its unusual take on the themes of love n evil. On an overall scale, Shadow of a Doubt remains one of the finest achievements in cinema that's as effective today as it was 70 years ago &amp; isn't Hitchcock's personal favourite from his glorious filmography for nothing.A defining classic in every sense of the word, an influential example of its genre &amp; a must for every cinema lover out there, Shadow of a Doubt comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hitchcock masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, I am updating my review to reflect the fairly recent Blu Ray edition of this film. Is it better? Worth the upgrade? It is a very nice transfer, marginally better than the regular DVD.There are a handful of Hitchcock films that would be my "favorites", and this is one of them...perhaps my very favorite...which made me all the more want to watch it again when I learned that it was Hitchcock's favorite film, as well. And then I watched the documentary on the film on the DVD, and although I knew the story well, it put some aspects of it into better perspective.What I will call the prelude is in two parts. In the first part of the prelude we learn that Joseph Cotton is in some rather poor neighborhood in an eastern city, and is being watched, probably by the police...and he says to himself that they haven't got anything on him. He heads to a telegraph office. In the second part of the prologue, we are invited into small-town America...where the pace is slow...and we meet the "innocents" -- Cotton's sister (wonderfully realized by Patricia Collinge; while she wasn't a prolific movie actress, I've always enjoyed seeing her in a film), her husband (warmly -- as always -- played by Henry Travers), a young girl and a young boy, and the main focus of the film -- Teresa Wright, as an older daughter nicknamed Charlie after her uncle (Cotton). She's looking for something to break the monotony of a small town, and decides to invite her uncle for a visit. Both Charlies seem to be on the same wavelength! In the next segment, evil (Cotton) arrives in small town America, and for no good reason (other than effect) a shadow envelopes the train station as the train arrives. And then evil is invited into the home. And it first personifies itself with the humming of a tune -- "The Merry Widow Waltz", which Cotton attempts to change the topic, because he is the infamous "Merry Widow Murderer". (In fact, if you don't "get" the "Merry Widow Waltz" connection, you miss a big part of the picture's subtleties.The third segment is when Teresa Wright begins to realize something is not quite right. The newspaper article, the rough hand, an undercover police officer dating her to ask for her help. This is when the suspense begins building. And then the clincher -- a ring with an inscription.The final segment is how can Teresa Wright get rid of Uncle Charley, whom she knows is the murderer...even though the police wrongly think the real murderer was killed in a freak accident? I can't say that the (his) end is totally surprising, but how they get there is.Teresa Wright is fantastic as the young lady of the family who begins to suspect her uncle. Joseph Cotton is also wonderful. Both of these actors are somewhat forgotten today, but are just terrific actors.There are a couple of other supporting actors here worth mentioning. Macdonald Carey plays a detective, as does Wallace Ford. Both do nicely. Hume Cronyn plays an oddball neighbor who, along with Charlie's father, loves hashing over crime fiction. He's a hoot! This is absolutely top-notch Hitchcock at his best! Highly recommended, and it's on my DVD-Blu Ray shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sociopath Joseph Cotten cannot restrain himself among his family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie. It's not a perfect movie, but it still is outstanding. The story is well known to movie and Hitchcock fans, so there is no need to repeat it in detail.In brief, Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) is a killer of widows for their jewels. Police have no photos of him but they are closing in on him and another suspect. Evading them, he travels cross country to Santa Rosa and embeds himself with his sister and her family. His niece, Teresa Wright, is also called Charlie. Macdonald Carey and Wallace Ford, posing as men doing a survey, but really detectives arrive in Santa Rosa. Teresa Wright begins to suspect Cotten, especially after Carey levels with her about the police suspicions. Meanwhile Cotten is maneuvering through their queries, but will do anything to keep out of the law's hands, including killing Wright.What has always impressed me the most about this film are the writing of Cotten's character and his fantastic portrayal of that character. He has some terrific lines that bring out his sociopathy, plus he has some superb movements and body language that convey his thoughts. Hitchcock did a marvellous job throughout, and certainly in directing Cotten. But Cotten should get immense credit for the acting. He really should have been nominated for an Academy Award, but a war was on. Hollywood turned to more soupy patriotic stuff like Mrs. Miniver and Yankee Doodle Dandy. Hollywood was loath to recognize a picture with such a dark view of America as "Shadow of a Doubt" much less give an Academy Award to a portrayal of a serial murderer. Nevertheless, you are not going to see better acting than Cotten's performance in this movie.Cotten often has played amiable men convincingly as well as rogues and scoundrels. Here he feigns amiability but really hates people. In some scenes, his eyes and expression are absolutely convincing in conveying his hostility and hatred, sometimes mixed with a bit of fear. Not many actors can do this.At the same time, the screenplay writing of Thornton Wilder (and co-writers) is superb, especially Cotten's part. Among other things, he is shown as exercising control over himself so as not to reveal his real feelings and thoughts. And yet every so often he is unable to restrain himself. At those moments, his bitterly cynical phrases and sentences pour out of him like a confession.The resulting combination of writing, directing and acting is a totally realistic character who is charming one moment, dripping acid remarks in another and violent in a third. The story itself moves along well enough, with some creakiness here and there, but it is overshadowed by Cotten's character and performance. This is why I rate the movie as a 10.This is not to take anything away from Teresa Wright. She does a terrific job too in a difficult part, and her acting may well have helped inspire Cotten with his. She looks the part of innocent blooming beauty combined with intelligence. I cannot imagine what world-weary Hollywood starlet of the 90s or 00s could play this part. Indeed, although to me it is Cotten's movie, it comes across as a "cast" effort, right down to the children, but including Wallace Ford, Macdonald Carey, Henry Travers, Hume Cronyn and a very effective Patricia Collinge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Personal Favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock considered this thriller to be his personal favorite among his own films, and although it's not as popular as some of Hitchcock's later work, it's certainly worthy of the master's admiration. Shadow Of A Doubt stars Teresa Wright,Joseph Cotten,Macdonald Carey,Patricia Collinge and Henry Travers. Scripted by playwright Thornton Wilder and inspired by the actual case of a 1920's serial killer known as "The Merry Widow Murderer," the movie sets a tone of menace and fear by introducing a psychotic killer into the small-town comforts of Santa Rosa, California.Charlie is a small-town high-schooler who enjoys a symbiotic relationship with her favorite uncle, also named Charlie. When young Charlie "wills" that old Charlie pay a visit to her family, her wish comes true. Uncle Charlie is his usual charming self, but he seems a bit secretive and reserved at times. Too, his manner of speaking is curiously unsettling, especially when he brings up the subject of rich widows, whom he characterizes as "swine." When a pair of detectives, posing as magazine writers, arrive in town and begin asking questions about Uncle Charlie, young Charlie's curiosity is aroused. Why, for example, has Uncle Charlie torn an article out of the evening newspaper? Rushing to the library, Young Charlie locates the missing item: the headline screams WHO IS THE MERRY WIDOW MURDERER? As the horrified Charlie reads on, the conclusion is inescapable: her beloved Uncle Charlie is a mass murderer, preying upon wealthy old women.Alfred Hitchcock's earliest classic deals its flesh-crawling thrills as deftly as its finely shaded characters.It is about awakening and the simultaneous darkening and enlarging of the world. You've got to hand it to Hitchcock: when he sows the fearful seeds of mistrust in one of his motion pictures he can raise more goose pimples to the square inch of a customer's flesh than any other director of thrillers in Hollywood.No doubt,it is one of his grimmest and most impressive movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Hitchcock suspense flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 1940s, Hitchcock made a LOT of films about mysterious characters with possibly sinister intentions (usually starring the likes of Gregory Peck or Cary Grant). SHADOW OF A DOUBT is my favourite of these so far, a gripping and intelligent mystery in which a bright young girl's kindly Uncle Charlie may in fact be much more than he at first seems.The script is pitch perfect and the pacing exact. Some have noted the thematic parallels to the story of Dracula, but these are too subtle to make much of. As with SUSPICION and SPELLBOUND, much fun comes from the "is he or isn't he?" premise, but to SHADOW OF A DOUBT's credit, it continues to thrill even after the mystery has been resolved. It's a subtle film that emphasises realism for the most part, so there are no murder or chase scenes, just quietly building tension that closes with a still-thrilling climax.Teresa Wright is an unfamiliar actress to me, but she's given more screen time than most Hitchcock actresses and she shines as the fresh-faced innocent. Joseph Cotton, who I'd previously only known in the latter stages of his career, is also excellent as the friendly Uncle Charlie, who never once fails to be charismatic or polite during the entire running time. There's further solid support from the likes of Macdonald Carey and a particular highlight is the comic ghoulish interplay between Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn, two men obsessed with pulp crime and who remain totally oblivious to the real story unfolding in their midst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You think you know something, don't you? You think you're the clever little girl who knows something. There's so much you don't know. So much."Charlie (Teresa Wright) is thrilled when her adored uncle (Joseph Cotten) comes to visit her family and shake her out of the malaise and monotony that she's been feeling. But when suspicion is cast on the man that she was named after, can she accept that he might be a killer? If he finds out what she suspects, could that put even the life of his beloved niece in jeopardy?&nbsp;I don't really know how to review Shadow of a Doubt. I found myself liking it, even though I can't give any particular reasons why. In fact, I found it to be meandering and a little unfocused, at times. Yet it still left me with a positive impression. It had a different feel from any of the other Hitchcock movies that I've seen. There's little mystery to it, and the thrills and suspense are of a different kind than those that were offered in North by Northwest or Notorious. I'd struggle to compare this to any of his other movies. Yet, the director felt that it was his favorite. I can't deny that I found the relationship between Charlie and her uncle to be interesting, in all its phases. And since so much of the plot hinges on that, then perhaps that explains some of Shadow of a Doubt's likability. &nbsp;&nbsp;I'd say that if you're a fan of Hitchcock, give this film about family menace in Santa Rosa a try. It's a bit of an odd duck, yet it was entertaining, nonetheless. I put it firmly in the middle of the pack of Hitchcock's movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's favorite... and one of his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little Charlie (Theresa Wright) is excited when she hears the news that her great uncle (and namesake) Uncle Charles (Joseph Cotten) is visiting in their town of Santa Rosa. Little does Charlie know who her uncle really is, and his purpose for visiting. Soon, their seemingly perfect relationship is shattered by a shadow of a doubt: Good ol' Uncle CHalrie may be the wanted Merry Widow Murderer.Regarded by the Master himself as his personal favorite among his works, SHADOW OF A DOUBT is one of Hitchcock's best works. With his emphasis on suspense rather than surprise, the story is not really about Charlie finding out who her uncle really is. In fact, if it won't take you halfway throughout the movie without knowing who Charles really is. But Hitch doesn't aim for surprise; to shock us with a twist ending that might come of as implausible if not obvious. Instead, he focuses on his characters and the tension brimming between them. If Charlie knew of her uncle's identity, what would she feel? And how far will Charles go to keep his identity hidden? Will he risk killing his favorite niece (not to mention the daughter of his only sister)? There's so much tension going on that in fact, it's the ending (not the climax) that comes of as the weakest point (Once again, Hitch leaves a number of things open for debate and curiosity that comes off a little frustrating).But despite just that little quibble (after all, it's a pretty common Hitch trait that I've learned to live with), SHADOW OF A DOUBT is an expertly-crafted and intriguing thriller, held together by strong performances and Hitch's touches of suspense and dark humor. Not his best ever, but up there in his Top 10.Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film starts with Joseph Cotton (Uncle Charlie) being pursued by 2 detectives - MacDonald Carey (Jack) and Wallace Ford (Fred). He gives them the slip and goes to stay with his sister Patricia Collinge (Emma) and her family. This includes her husband Henry Travers (Joe), and children Edna May Wonacott (Anne), Charles Bates (Roger) and eldest daughter and Cotton's favourite Teresa Wright (Charlie). What is Cotton running away from if indeed anything? The relationship between the two Charlies is put to the test as we reach a suspenseful climax.The film suffers from a slow beginning once Cotton arrives at his sister's house. The two children are very annoying and so the film drags whenever they show up in a scene. The film doesn't need them. Also, I found Collinge's smiling facial expressions quite sickly. In fact, she is dreadful throughout and her voice just grates as the sweet mother figure. Yuk! Kill her, someone??please! The women are not very good in this film. Even Teresa Wright in the lead is pretty annoying although she gets better as things progress. And stop saying "Uncle Charlie" all the bleeding time. It's stupid.The film got going from about halfway through and I enjoyed it despite the occasional crass dialogue (eg, the ending). Apart from those already mentioned, the cast are good and I felt that Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten provided a good match as they battled against each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty nice thriller for its time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't exactly label this movie as a film-noir but it's a pretty good '40's thriller, that has a nice concept, which of course gets handled magnificently by the master of suspense; Alfred Hitchcock. It's not his best and also certainly not his most memorable movie but this says something more about the quality of the other movies he has done than about this movie really.Like basically every '40's movie it begins rather slow and it takes its time to set up its story and characters. However about halve way through, when things really start to take off, it becomes a great movie to watch. For '40's standards it's quite an unique little thriller. It knows to build up its tension with a minimum amount of resources.It has a nice story about average people. This is one of the reasons why the thriller elements work out so effectively. The movie isn't set at any strange places, with stereotypical characters. The places, situations and characters are all easy to identify with. The main concept itself is pretty simple but somethings this is all you need for a movie to become a good one. Its screenplay got even nominated for an Oscar.It's a nice shot movie, with some wonderful looking and constructed sequences, once you start paying attention to it. This is were Alfred Hitchcock was great in; creating some solid, unique, great looking sequences, with its original camera-work, in which he could capture a lot of things and emotions and setting the right mood with for the movie.It also features some nice acting. What I like is that the characters are changing throughout the movie. It gives the movie some nice tension since it provides the movie with a certain feeling of insecurity and uncertainty. Especially Joseph Cotten did a great job with this but Teresa Wright is also a nice leading lady.Nice little minimalistic thriller, made great by its concept and of course wonderful and effective directing from Alfred Hitchcock.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understanding Uncle Charlie In "Shadow of A Doubt"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the comments about this intriguing film, only one that I read mentioned the accident Charles Oakley had as a boy: he was struck by a streetcar, and nearly killed. When he emerged from his coma days later, he was changed somehow, and never again the same person he had been, according to an elder female relative.This is the type of detail that another writer than Thornton Wilder, or another director than Alfred Hitchcock, might have glossed over. But both of them had an uncanny sense of how things work in reality, and I believe it is this which lends an air of verisimilitude even to their most outlandish story premise. History tells of people who were injured in the frontal area of the brain, and how their character changed afterward: they felt no more empathy, love or remorse; only greed, fear, suspicion and anger, with joy only visiting their lives when they "won" some contest or struggle against another person. Modern science finds that the Conscience seems to reside in that part of the brain, and to "leak out" when the area is injured, leaving the recovering patient a functional sociopath.Unlike some of those who have commented, I found Charles Oakley a very believable character. Unfortunately, I knew a sociopath personally (not a serial killer, as far as I know! just manipulative and extremely selfish), and he was charming and likable - until he was crossed. His family knew all about him, yet even so could be lulled by his wheedling and flattery into believing his lies "just this once." Normal people WANT to believe there's good in everyone, and the sociopath takes advantage of that to manipulate them. Once the sociopath knows you're on to him (or her), however, and won't be fooled by him anymore, the mask drops and he shows his true nature. That's when things start to get nasty.That is what we see happening in "Shadow of A Doubt." Charles is quickly able to convince the whole town of what a great guy he is, and even with his little slips and gaffes - like his outrageously cynical banter with his brother-in-law at the bank - people overlook such "aberrations" and make excuses for him, because they want to believe in him. The children in the story, however, are less set in their ways. Like children in reality, they take people as they find them, and are quick to wise up about "Good Old Uncle Charlie," even though the younger two never seem to be aware of the full extent of his evil. It's very clear to them that there is something wrong with him, but everyone else is in nearly complete denial, and in a kind of role reversal, the children want to protect the adults' peace of mind. Young Charlie and her younger siblings want to protect their mother from finding out what a monster her beloved younger brother has become (or perhaps they are only stoic about the unlikelihood of her believing anything they might say against him). Unfortunately, his death is the only thing that allows her to maintain her cherished illusions about her brother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nihilism comes to small-town America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shadow of a Doubt" is often listed as Alfred Hitchcock's favorite of his own films, and while it's not his greatest masterpiece, his liking for it is perfectly understandable. Not only is it an engaging and well-crafted thriller, but it also illustrates a typical Hitchcock theme: the seedy underbelly and the dangerous psychological impulses that lie beneath civilized society. The screenplay by Thornton Wilder has the folksy humor about small-town family life that you'd expect from the author of "Our Town." But it also finds room for some hilariously dark jokes ?two respectable citizens relax by reading cheap mystery novels and discussing the best way to kill somebody.Meanwhile, these characters have no idea that there may be an actual criminal in their midst. On the run from the law, Charlie (Joseph Cotten) has come to stay with his sister and her family in sleepy little Santa Rosa, CA. His adoring teenaged niece, also called Charlie (Teresa Wright) is thrilled at her uncle's visit, until she finds more and more reason to suspect that he might be the "Merry Widow Murderer."As played by Cotten, Charlie is an outwardly charming man who conceals a vicious nihilism: he believes that nothing matters, that many people don't deserve to live, and that he can do whatever he likes. This philosophy is powerfully disturbing even today, and must have been even more so at the height of World War II, when "Shadow of a Doubt" came out. At that time, America was fighting an enemy that also thought certain people just didn't deserve to live, so I can see how the theme of "heartland values" versus nihilism might really have resonated.Those of you who find Hitchcock too misogynistic will be pleased that "Shadow of a Doubt" features a smart, likable heroine who's stronger than she looks?even if she does have a weird relationship with her uncle. However, weird as the relationship may be, it gives the movie a scary ambiguity. If even a sweet teenage girl is nearly "seduced" by this man's nihilistic philosophy?if the two Charlies claim to feel a special quasi-psychic connection, and then, when Uncle Charlie's true nature is revealed, seriously threaten to kill one another, like volatile lovers?maybe there isn't as much difference between hero and villain as we'd like to think.</fullReview>

The story is very routine and straightforward, however, with very little suspense. Given the surly character that Uncle Charlie is, it is hard to believe that he was ever a favorite relative of the children's. The best part of the movie is the running gag between Travers and Cronyn as they discuss the best ways to commit murder. The ending is plain stupid. This was supposedly Hitchcock's favorite among his films. Well, Beethoven's favorite among his symphonies was No. 8, proving that artists are not good judges of their own works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncle Charlie as a "Hitler" figure?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was wondering if I was the only one who saw Uncle Charlie as a Hitler figure? To me, his "mission" is like Nazi anti-semitism, both UC and Hitler had no real friends, both were stirring orators, both were sentimental and modernists at the same time, and both had crappy excuses for becoming what they were. UC displaces Joe as the father figure (i.e. Hitler becomes the fuhrer), no one around these people sees them as dangerous until its too late, both Hitler and UC are merely "in business the way men are", their only job is murder/politics. Those are just a few examples, I'd really like to know if their are scholarly essays out there on this, or to know if I'm just crazy.It also seems that this is a "what if", kind of movie-- suggesting what it may have been like if a figure like Hitler had been eliminated early and minimized his deadly effects on the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Artful Hitchcock N/W Thriller; Influential, Powerful But Flawed Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film begins in Philadelphia with a hunted man--Charles Oakley. In Santa Rosa, we meet his namesake who complains that her family, the Newtons, need something to shake them out of lethargy. Her mother acts as if she were born to slave and wear old clothes; her father talks only of his bank job and money; etc. Into this dysfunctional group comes cultured Uncle Charles. Dimitri Tiomkin's eerie music adds to the proceedings; a psychic connection between Charlie and her Uncle, who is sexually drawn to her, is stressed.. A story by Gordon Macdonnell, Hitchcock, and Alma Reville, his wife was made into a screenplay with contributions from Sally Benson and Thornton Wilder. Hitchcock contrasted the British Empire--within which individuals are actually freer to be eccentric-- with the outwardly freer US, in which they are not. After a reunion recalling older days, Charles doles out presents. After, though Charlie says she wants nothing, he gives her an emerald ring; she talks about knowing that like her, a secretive person, there must be something wonderful inside of him. Charles returns to table and talks about transferring thousands to the local bank. Various sorts of craziness are commented upon. When Charles is given the paper while the father discusses murder with his neighbor, Oakley rip 2 pages out--an article about him; Charlie later spots them folded in his pocket and intuitively tells him they must have been about him. She grabs them and he grasps her wrists, then apologizes as he says they were about something unpleasant. The next day Charlie is running around because the family is going to be interviewed as the 'typical American family". Charles says count me out and derides the process. He goes with Charlie to the bank and jokes about banks hiding secrets; upbraided by the others, he says, "all the world's a joke to me." On the streetcar, they meet the surveyers; Charles refuses to be included, and Charlie agrees. Her mother bosses the photographer while Charlie and the interviewer get acquainted. Later when a shot is accidentally snapped of Uncle Charles he demands the film. The interviewer, Graham, takes Charlie to a movie. He questions her about her Uncle. He admits he is a police detective; he is seeking a man-- maybe her uncle, maybe not. He appeals to her, because he likes her. if the Uncle is the one, he vows to escort him out of town first. At home, restless, Charlie searches for the missing articles and then rushes to the Library. Dodging traffic and convincing the Librarian to stay open, she tracks down the story--the ring was stolen from the latest victim; her Uncle is the murderer. Avoiding him at table the next night, when she does talk to him, she says she dreamed he was leaving on a train. Later, her Mother reminds him he's to address her club. Charles extemporizes on fat, rich ladies, whom he dislikes. "They're human beings," Charlie reminds him. "Are they?" he returns. When Charlie cannot stand the neighbor and her Father talking of poisons, she runs out. Uncle Charles follows and takes her into a wartime club, smoke-filled. He tries to get her to reveal what she has been told; he appeals to her as his "twin". She takes off the ring and hands it to him. Protecting himself, he palms the ring and repeats his comments about the women He calls her a sleepwalker, tells her to wake up. Outside he appeals to her; he had been contemplating suicide, and he came here for a refuge from the world. She tells him to go, then at his pleading grants him "a few days". Next morning, after church, Graham takes Charlie aside and says his partner got a picture of her uncle after all. She says she's going to get him to leave, before the picture can be checked. Then, with the parents, she's told the Merry Widow killer was killed, in another state--it's on the news. Graham tells Charlie he loves her. The garage door locks them in for a moment before they can get out. Uncle Charles comes out to say goodbye. Later, she nearly falls on the back stair, and wonders if her uncle had prepared it in some way. She confronts him. He is not going away; he's going to settle down. He says the truth would break her Mother's heart; and she no longer has the ring as evidence. He adds, "I can do a lot for all of you". She denies it-- a reversal of the beginning attitude she had exhibited. She tells him to go away or she'll kill him herself. That night, the night his lecture to the women's club, he tries to murder Charlie; and from there to the satisfying conclusion on a train, there's no let up in danget, or artistic tying up of loose ends. Cinematography by Joseph Valentine, John Goodman's art direction, set decorations by Russell A. Gausman and the gowns by Adrian and costumes by Vera West are all first-rate. Joseph Cotten is unusually strong; Teresa Wright plays the young woman convincingly. Parents Henry Travers and Patricia Collinge were well-chosen to seem older, ineffectual and vulnerable. Pairing Travers with Hume Cronyn, theneighbor who talks with him about murder, and playing powerful Madcdonald Carey as Chapman assisted by Wallace Ford, another strong choice, were successful castings by my judgment. Among others Grandon Rhodes, Edwin Stanley, Ruth Lee and Minerva Urecal stand out. This is not a great film; it could perhaps have been a great one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie (Wright) is feeling in a rut; when she suspects that her family, particularly her mother, feels the same way, she decides to give their lives a shot in the arm by sending a telegram to her beloved Uncle Charlie (Cotten), her mother's youngest brother and her namesake. It turns out that Uncle Charlie has beaten her to the punch because while at the post office, she finds that he has already sent one to them, announcing his upcoming arrival. Unfortunately, what Charlie and her family don't know is that he is coming because he is on the run from the police, as he is under suspicion for being "The Merry Widow Killer", a man who romances wealthy older women and then bilks them of their money before disposing of them. While Uncle Charlie charms the family, Charlie begins to suspect that her uncle may not be what he claims to be, suspicions that could threaten her life.One thing I have always admired about Alfred Hitchcock is his amazing ability to take something or someone that we assume is safe and turn them into a source of terror. He did it with a shower in "Psycho", childhood friends in "Rope" and even was able to turn some harmless window gazing into a life-and-death situation with "Rear Window". In "Shadow of a Doubt", he not only turns a beloved family member into a murderous threat, but set the film in one of the most idyllic towns in the country, where no one would think to lock their doors, much less do it to keep out a serial killer living in their midst. It's like Thornton Wilder mixed with Edgar Allen Poe, featuring Jack the Ripper as the "hero". Actually, with irony befitting Hitchcock, he enlisted Wilder (best known for writing "Our Town") to write the screenplay for this film. While the characters don't know the true nature of Uncle Charlie, the audience is tuned in from the start, another Hitchcockian staple that never loses its effectiveness. It is far more frightening to watch someone venture blindly into a situation when the audience knows what lies waiting for them.Joseph Cotten, one of my favorite classic male actors, plays Uncle Charlie with panache and charm, but laced with a sinister fringe which creates a scary persona. Teresa Wright, an actress I have seen in several films, is perfect as young Charlie; her innocence is undercut with a fierce spirit that manifests into survivalism. While the main conflict is between the two Charlies, "Shadow of a Doubt" features a great supporting cast, most notably Edna May Wonacott, who plays Charlie's little sister, a bookworm who not only is wise beyond her 10 or so years, but is given some of the funniest lines in the film, as well as Hume Cronyn who plays a neighbor who engages in murder fantasies with Charlie's dad as part of their "mystery club"."Shadow of a Doubt" is not one of Hitchcock's better-known films like those of his 1950's ? mid-1960's period, but it is one of my personal favorites. Its' sinister theme and truly suspenseful moments combined with great performances make this film a true early Hitchcock classic. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uhh... Great camera work!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The star of this movie is the camera - the scenes are shot with such intelligence and deftness that its a shame all that skill was wasted on this movie. There are some terrific experiments with angles and tracking shots, no doubt Orson Welles and Hitchcock kept track of each other's works.Theresa Wright is admirable in her attempts at torment and Joseph Cotten is good, but it's the camera that tells most of the story. Most of the reason Cotten is good is that he lets the camera do its job.The pacing and the editing is where this movie really lost me. It's either a wacky experiment in storytelling or it was left until the last minute. The first twenty minutes are very slow, until we get to the first shock, and it isn't even all that shocking. Then it slows down again and doesn't really get going until the final sequences. Normally, this wouldn't bother me, but it's really obvious and distracting. Crucial plot elements are zipped along, and then the camera experiments take their time to show us the inner lives of the characters, needlessly.Also, someone should remove about 80% of the orchestra from the soundtrack. It was way too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My least favourite Hitchcock movie so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pursued by the police, shifty Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) skips town to stay with his sister's family in tranquil Santa Rosa, but it's not long before his beautiful niece, Young Charlie (Teresa Wright), begins to suspect that the new house-guest is a right wrong'un.Shadow of a Doubt was apparently Hitchcock's favourite of all his own films, which I fail to understand: while many of the director's movies grab hold and don't let go till the end credits, this one took me several evenings to get through, which is indicative of just how mundane I found it. Certain potentially interesting themes?the sexual tension between Charlie and her uncle and the notion of evil lurking unsuspected in American suburbia?amount to very little and the manner in which the film unfolds is surprisingly dull, the whole affair lacking Hitch's usual excellent pacing, masterful storytelling and visual flair.Wright is a delight to behold and Cotten makes for a genuinely creepy villain but overall I found the film to be far from Hitchcock's best work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great suspense thriller from the master of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film opens with a woman coming into a room to tell her lodger that two men have been asking to see him; he is clearly somewhat perturbed and soon after telegrams his sister in California to say that he will be coming to stay. It is a simple opening but somehow it had me hooked... was he running because he was in danger or was he running because he was a dangerous man wanted by the authorities? Coincidentally his niece Charlie is planning to write to him, her Uncle Charlie, to invite him to visit when the telegram arrives. When he gets there everybody is happy but there is something not quite right; he states that he refuses to be photographed, tears an article out of the news paper and when he realises the ring he has given his niece is already engraved with another set of initials he wants to get the old inscription removed... each thing in itself is fairly trivial but they add up to raise suspicions. Soon two men turn up asking to interview the family for a survey about an 'average American family'; later one of them confides in young Charlie telling her they are investigating her uncle. He is suspected of committing a series of heinous crimes but there is a second suspect in Maine so it is possible that he is innocent... young Charlie wants to believe he is but similarly it is hard to ignore the clues.After the interesting opening the film continued to keep be gripped and I was constantly changing my mind about whether Uncle Charlie was really a killer or whether he was innocent. Joseph Cotton puts in a fine performance; charming one moment potentially threatening the next; Teresa Wright is equally good as his adoring niece who wants to believe in him but finds it more and more difficult as the evidence stacks up. The rest of the cast are good too; I particularly liked Henry Travers, who played young Charlie's father, and Hume Cronyn, who played his friend Herbie in the scenes where they discussed crime fiction; in particular when they talked about how one might get away with murder... while this doesn't effect the plot it makes one wonder whether certain accidents are that or whether they are attempts at murder... their conversations are also very funny! Being a Hitchcock film I shouldn't have been surprised how well the tension was managed; he is of course the expert in the field; more surprising is that this isn't one of his better known works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Considered as the Master of Suspense's personal favourite of the films he did, Shadow of a Doubt is a suspenseful, tense and well made classic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shadow of a Doubt mayn't be my personal favourite of Hitchcock's movies, but it is in my opinion one of his most suspenseful and tense films evident from right at the beginning with the cloud of ominous black smoke. In short, it is a brilliant classic thriller. Even after first seeing the movie 7 years ago when I was 11, the film never loses its tension. Some people might say it lacks the show-off set pieces that was Hitch's trademark, but I have to say I don't find that the case. I for one found the climax especially nail-biting. On top of that, the film is very well made, the cinematography once again is faultless and the production values are sumptuous. The music also adds to the suspense and the tension, it is beautiful at times with the mix of Lehar's Merry Widow Overture, which is significant to the story, yet in the more tense scenes, it is powerful, haunting and chilling. The script is also of high-calibre quality, as is Hitch's direction. As are the performances. Teresa Wright is pretty much the epitome of pumpkin-pie innocence, while Joseph Cotton is charming and suave yet somewhat chilling as well as the killer who is wanted in the east for relieving widows of their wealth and their lives. The story is swiftly-told, isn't that complicated and moves along at a reasonable pace if rather slow on occasions. Overall, suspenseful, tense and well made, a must see for fans of the Master of Suspense. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Merry Widow Murderer, Hitchcock style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shadow Of A Doubt was believed to have been Hitchcock's own favourite movie, it's the one he was most proud of, and the one where he felt his critics hadn't got any justifiable ammunition to shoot him down with. The film stands out because it doesn't have the tongue in cheek dark humour traits that light up most of the maestro's classics. It's cheeky bonus is having the central premise of its main protagonist being a hero of the people, his family adore him, he is on the surface a man that all men want to be, and it's here that Hitchcock molds a chilling filmic arc, in fact, it's a masterstroke.The plot involves Uncle Charlie returning to his adoring family in Santa Rosa after just avoiding capture for the murder of a widow. His niece Charlie treats Uncle as a hero, she worships the ground he walks on, but as the detectives close in, niece Charlie starts to piece together things and suspects herself that Uncle may just be The Merry Widow Murderer. We are then involved in the cat &amp; mouse story and privy to Uncle Charlie's switch from debonair handsome hero, into the devil incarnate. A reoccurring theme of The Merry Widow Waltz adds to the uneasy feel, and the relationship between Uncle &amp; Niece is one that I'm sure Hitchcock was revelling in. Because make no bones about it, it's in itself bordering on being unhealthy, and it's something that helps make this a more edgier thriller than other genre pieces.Joseph Cotten is special as Uncle Charlie, his duality acting hits the spot on both fronts, whilst Teresa Wright is beguiling as the niece because she really makes the character infectious. Thus it's with these two great performances that the films final reel brings special results. Screenplay written by the wonderfully talented Thornton Wilder, and directed by the master, it's a triumphant classic from the ever impressive cannon of Alfred Hitchcock. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a marvellous film, superbly acted and directed. Knowledge has, since the Garden of Eden, been associated with the discovery of evil, and the transition from innocence and youth to adulthood and corruption. The scene where Young Charlie rushes to the Public Library in pursuit of the newspaper cutting and, on discovering the truth, right out of her childhood is quite extraordinary.Patricia Collinge is, as always, splendid and, as is true so often of her characters, never quite understands what's going on around her.Saying more might spoil the film.

		<shortDescription>Wow ... Twisted my stomach in knots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see why this was Hitch's personal favorite. Everything about it is really wonderful- wonderfully twisted! Most everyone has commented on the plot twists, etc, but what I really noticed about this movie was the strange ... dare I say it? ... sexual tension between Charlie and Charlie! Her description of her relationship with her uncle is more like that of a soulmate than a "twin." She reacts to his homecoming more as a girlfriend than as a niece. Just the physical interactions between the two of them are strangely ... romantic? Uncle Charlie grabs his niece and, instead of giving her a ring, he slips it on her finger, like an engagement ring. Young Charlie enjoys being seen with her uncle (notice the jealous looks on her friends' faces-they don't know he's her uncle!). Even as her suspicions grow and *spoilers* he becomes more violent with her, he always grabs her so that her face is very near his. He's upset about her relationship with Jack, not just because he's a detective, but because Jack is taking away HIS Charlie. Uncle HAS to dominate. He dominates his sister by manipulating her emotions through memory, but his domination of Charlie seems more sexual. Just another twist in Uncle Charlies malformed character. Deliciously juicy noir!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self-consciously bemused and droll Alfred Hitchcock...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock and writer Thornton Wilder attempt to expose the underside of Americana (a favorite Hitchcock theme), but "Shadow of a Doubt" is self-consciously dry and droll. Joseph Cotten is very good as malevolent relative to middle-class California family who pays them a surprise visit and brings mystery into their household. Before his first night is over, he's already acting strange, tearing up Dad's newspaper and then snatching it away from too-smart Teresa Wright (playing teenage detective, but not looking very happy about it). The film's atmosphere and scenario are well-captured, but the plot starts to bog down (if not unravel) when two interviewers want to quiz the family about their lives; this would be suspicious in any era, and yet it leads to nothing. "Shadow" is a puzzling drama-lite with danger lurking just outside the center; but when the reality of the situation comes apart, the circumstances are no longer so absorbing. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be Hitchcock's favorite film but it's hardly his greatest. OK, so it's a look at the underside of small-town Americana. Or is it? The bad guy here is a visitor. There's nothing wrong with the townspeople here. The evil doesn't emanate from the town itself. It's a reasonable but slow-moving and rather dull character study, with the only action being the poorly staged finale. Joseph Cotton is excellent, Teresa Wright fine and the rest of the cast is fine. But this is very minor Hitchcock. Of course, I didn't like Blue Velvet much either. Pleasantville is better than either one by a country mile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently you have to love Hitchcock to love "Shadow of a Doubt," judging from the comments in this forum. I'm no Hitchcock aficionado, but I did come to the picture with enough knowledge of his work to expect interesting filmmaking, great performances, smart dialogue and masterful suspense. I was disappointed on every count. The directing itself has some nice touches, but overall it's a bit ham-handed, as are the performances--especially from the youngest daughter, whose work here is laughably bad (though that's understandable as she was no professional--but couldn't the DIRECTOR have coaxed a better performance out of her?). My favorite parts were the performances of the young Hume Cronyn, and of Travers. Cronyn is excellent here, outacting Cotten turn for turn. Worst of all is the dialogue--unrealistic and exaggerated. This is a picture very much of its day. It's worth seeing, to be sure, but it's no masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read somewhere that "Shadow of a Doubt" was Alfred Hitchcock's favorite of all his films, but I can't imagine why. It has little suspense, and despite the elaborately credited contribution of Thornton Wilder, little flavor for the slow-paced, small town life it depicts and celebrates. Joseph Cotton is good as the world hating Uncle Harry, but Teresa Wright is a little too perky as his admiring niece. Macdonald Carey is his usual bland self as the detective who woos her while setting a trap for his prey. Frankly, with a smug bore like Carey on the side of law and order, I found myself rooting for the killer. And even I could compose a more distinctive music score than the one provided by Dimitri Tiomkan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was definitely hyped for this movie when I first saw it, if only because it was a young Joseph Cotten in a Hitchcock movie. This was a very enjoyable movie, but I have to agree that this is definitely NOT Hitchcock's best; with Psycho, Vertigo, and Spellbound easily beating it out.Of course, I can't blame either Hitchcock or Cotten for this disappointment. In 1943 when this movie was made, Hitchcock had just moved to Hollywood from England and had to deal with big time movie producers, the most notable being David Selznick. Selznick thought he knew how to make a movie, and pressured Hitchcock to make cookie-cutter movies that would make big bucks at the box office. Hitchcock and Selznick continually fought about what should be a good movie. The two were like oil and water--they didn't mix, and neither does this Hitchcock production. Although Jack Skirball does get credit with the production, it's either in the opening or endings credits where you can see the words "a David O. Selznick production," a good indicator that Selznick was involved somehow. It's only after Hitchcock is released from Selznick's grasp that you see some of his truly great movies like Psycho, Rear Window, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder, and Vertigo.So there's the history lesson why Shadow of a Doubt is not as good as other Hitchcocks. But that's not to detract from some of the ingenious parts of the movie. Thorton Wilder's writing is accurate of how a large family converses: by continually overlapping and interrupting each other. (or maybe it was Hitchcock's idea, either way it was great!) And, of course, the greatest part of it all, Henry Travers, the angel from It's a Wonderful Life, and a very young Hume Cronyn discussing how to kill each other! What a great idea! I doubt very much if Selznick could have thought of that. All in all a very enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I guess we'll just have to wait for a miracle or something.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder what sort of film Shadow of a Doubt might be if Hitchock had cut that opening sequence with Cotten dodging the two agents and whisking away to a safer place. Sure, it does establish his boldness and knack for disappearing right in front of our very eyes (it helps that they do not know what he looks like so he can walk right by them) but it also establishes for a fact that Uncle Charlie is hiding something, and somewhat undermines the slow process of discovery that Charlotte has to go through. Surely the absence of it would make the best scene of the film even better. We overhear Joseph and Herbie musing as they always do, and they mention that the Merry Widow Murderer is dead. Then Cotten climbs the stairs, the slowly and deliberately turns back to give a pointed, menacing look back at Charlie in the sliver of sunlight in the doorstep. The soundtrack climaxes, and in that moment both characters know exactly where the real murderer, and so does the audience. It's a stunning moment of silent tension, mainly because neither can directly admit what they know, and everything else afterwards is merely a formality. The final 'fight' is a little silly now, and the forced romance with Detective Graham seems as though they plucked the nearest available male to give a little comfort for the young Charlie.The two Charlies are certainly a shining light here. Wright does not nearly resemble the teenager she plays (she was in her mid 20s) but by all means is radiant; she has the kind of vivacity and youthful idealism from the get go that Hitchcock ladies aren't often armed with and is the shining light from the start. She rises from the cosy domesticity of the small town as if she were totally aware that there is no other way to kickstart the movie than to get Uncle Charlie into the frame, and then beams constantly at how what a mysterious and imposing character he is. She has the all the imperative here. Opposing her is the sharp- eyed Cotten, who juggles the appearance of a family man rather well, only cracking once to give a frightful monologue. The clash between the leading pair makes the movie a worthwhile study in tension; we can see Hitchcock winking from every scene as Charlie goes closer and closer to discovering the truth, even as she chalks it all up the the excitement of her uncle's enigmatic lifestyle. When she first receives a murdered victim's watch, they key light flashes a little glint in her eye, but it's not yet the moment of discovery - she is merely overjoyed at such a cool present from such a cool uncle. A shake up indeed. What the intro does allow is for all these Hitchock nods at the source of the criminal contrasted with Charlie's initial obliviousness; the way she wonders how they just happen to be the 'average' family chosen for a nation-wide survey, the way Emma shrieks at the visitors to not take pictures of the ugly scenery, and the running dialogue of Joseph and Herbie as crime enthusiasts who endlessly speculate on the perfect murder. First it is a harmless hobby. Later it inserts a grim subtext until Charlie cannot bear it any longer. It's the classical build-up of dramatic irony, and Hitchock subverts his own tendencies; Wright closes the door and leans against it suggestively, and then Cotten grasps her hands roughly as he snatches the newspaper fragment, and for a moment, the pose is like two lovers about to embrace and kiss. But by foregoing that convention dynamic we have something a lot more interesting.</fullReview>

From Joseph Cotton's utterly believable inhabitation of the central character to Teresa Wright's dawning realisation of the facts, this is a very absorbing piece of cinema. As usual, there are some beautiful set pieces and the director really engages your attention, which is really all that one can ask as a viewer.I find it quite sad that Cotton never landed an Oscar for this, or for any of his other roles for that matter, as he really had what it took. As a side note, for any 'It's A Wonderful Life' fans, you will immediately spot the presence of a certain Henry Travers - aka Clarence the angel.In summary, for me this is the definitive Hitchcock film, and should be in any discerning film buff's library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the Creepiest Filmmed Relationship, The Charlies Garner Acclaim As the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot line: Young Charlie, as played by Theresa Wright, is a bored, directionless, recent high school graduate who gets a welcome surprise when her doting uncle and namesake ? she calls him a twin ? the mysterious Charles Oakley, comes to her small hometown of Santa Rosa, California for an extended visit. Unfortunately, trouble seems to follow him.Or...Plot line: Bored, directionless Charles Oakley (Joseph Cotton) ? a jobless, thirty-something, single man, with a lot of money ? is being stalked by men who look like gumshoes. After expertly giving them the slip, Oakley decides it's best to hide out with his sister's family in the sleepy, wonderous town of Santa Rosa, CA ? where he is known as "Uncle Charlie". Unfortunately, his favorite niece and namesake, the fawning Young Charlie Newton, is becoming too inquisitive...In this collaboration between Alfred Hitchcock and Thornton Wilder plot lines don't do this film justice. There is a richness of detail in the characterizations and the dialogue that still holds more than seventy years after the making of the film. In truth, Hitchcock would never be able to achieve the communal feel that he masterfully captured in this film, and Wilder would never be able to weave the tension or menace that kept this film going all the way to the end in any of his works.This was the second Hitchcock film I had seen as a child ? the first being 1934's The Man Who Knew Too Much. I remembered thinking that this filmmaker must concentrate on family films ? dark, family films, though.It is not an average Hitchcock film. There are no monuments to climb such as Big Ben. Nor are there any ships to wreck. If you're a Hitchcock fan, you'll also miss the gunplay and extended chase sequences. Young Charlie is not a cool, icy blonde. She is a raven head, young adult who speaks her feelings plainly. And Uncle Charlie? He is Hitchcock's first (Norman Bates being the second) anti-hero. He also speaks his feelings plainly. But boy can these Charlies keep secrets! The Charlies are the set pieces in this Hitchcock film. Joseph Valentine photographed them in bookend poses, in order to emphasis the closeness...UNNATURAL closeness...between the two. Instead of guns, there is a lot of power play between these self made "twins", flipping who is in control and who's not.IMO Young Charlie is arguably Hitchcock's best Heroine. She has many emotional hurdles to overcome, and she does it without fueling anyone's suspicions that something is amiss. Her aim to protect her family is one many of the viewing audience can understand.Of the suspense master's heroines, Lisa Fremont was the most head strong. Melanie Daniels was the most sympathetic. Jill Lawrence and Frances Stevens were the most able, either through wealth or skill or both. The Second Mrs. de Winter (the only heroine without a first name) had to grow the most on screen ? literally from a nobody to a formidable mistress. And Iris Henderson was the smartest ? by far. But none of them had to survive the trails that Young Charlie had to. And Young Charlie had to change greatly also, in the end becoming an Ice-Cold Heroine.I believe that the only three heroines who give Young Charlie any competition were the two spies, Eve Kindell and Alicia Huberman; and Carol Fisher. Carol Fisher was the most knowledgeable of the heroines; Eve was more steely, and Alicia faced far more dangers. But Young Charlie wasn't cajoled into taking action, like the spies were. Her moral compass was instantly set to "Family" once she figured out what was going down. (Note how she is not taken for a fool once she is put under interrogation. She sets the terms.) And more importantly, Carol, Eve and Alicia were provided for by established institutions and very capable Hitchcock heroes. (Cary Grant played the knight in shining armor in both spy cases; Joel McCrea's John Jones provided the metal for Carol.) Young Charlie didn't have that luxury. In a great performance by Wright, Charlie's wits were all she had to keep her alive.She needed it. For all though there is much debate as to who is the best Hitchcock heroine, there is very little over who is the best antagonist. That honor goes to Joseph Cotton's creepy Uncle Charlie. Prequels are needed for this character. This layered, hard to pin down, portrayal of the bad guy (?) was what Hitchcock had wanted for Johnnie, Cary Grant's role in Suspicion. But the studio balked at their matinée idol playing a cold-blooded killing villain; so, Johnnie's ending was re-shot to show that he was Mr. Okay.No such road blocks stood in Joseph Cotton's way. As it was, he was able to craft one of the most memorable characters in film history. Why the studios favored Grant over Cotton, idk. Maybe they had high hopes for the end film. (It got an Oscar nomination for Best Story.) (Strangely enough, the only heroine who garnered attention from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences was the weakest, Johnnie's wife, Lina - the only heroine without a last name - as played by Joan Fontaine.)P.S.Young Charlie gets involved with the silliest love story Alfred Hitchcock ever directed. In a documentary on the film, Theresa Wright said that his wife, co-screenwriter Alma Reville, Patricia Collinge, who played Emma Newton, and Wright, herself, backed Hitchcock off of exploring the relationship any further, due to Young Charlie's age and the tribulations that the character was suffering. As it is filmed, it becomes another trial for Young Charlie: having to deal with a love sick fool. Collinge rewrote the scene to distance the love interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, subtly subversive masterpiece, one of Hitch's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt" might be the most stately, elegant serial killer movie ever made. It stands with "Silence of the Lambs", "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" and another of Hitchcock's masterpieces, "Psycho", as a film that elevates the thriller genre into art. It's one of Hitchcock's best movies, and one of the best movies in the murder thriller genre.Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright) is a small-town teenager who dreams of a big, exciting life in the big, exciting city. When her Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten), for whom she was named and for whom she feels a mystical connection that only a teenage girl can feel, comes to visit, she follows him around like a lovesick puppy - and finds out that he is a serial killer of elderly widows. Suddenly, the adventure has become a bit too grown-up, especially when Uncle Charlie decides that his favorite niece may have to be his next victim.This is one of Hitchcock's darkest movies, especially considering the time in which he made it. "Shadow of a Doubt" was released in 1943, a time when American movies felt they had a duty to be plucky, sweet and optimistic - there was a war on, after all, and the folks back home needed cheering up. With this movie, Hitchcock turns that optimism on its head: Human evil at its worst takes root in Anytown, USA, and flourishes. "The world's a hell, Charlie," Uncle Charlie says. "What does it matter what happens in it?" Try finding a line like that in a Ronald Reagan movie.Cotten is perfect as Uncle Charlie, playing him as a monster disguised as a person. Beneath his charm, he is missing a basic element of a human being - a conscience, a soul - and it is getting harder and harder for him to cover it up. There's a desperate hollowness in his eyes as he smiles and makes nice, as if the strain of keeping his homicidal urges under control is eating away at him. There's a wonderful scene where he lets the mask slip during a family dinner: His eyes go dead and his voice flattens as he delivers a chilling monologue comparing old women to animals ready for slaughter. For a brief moment, we see him for what he really is, and it's terrifying.Wright seems callow as Young Charlie, which is right for the part - she is just learning that the world isn't always such a peachy keen place. Hume Cronyn is funny as the Newtons' weird neighbor, who likes to muse about the perfect murder, unaware that he is sitting right next to an expert in the field. Patricia Collinge as Young Charlie's mother is charmingly clueless about her brother, as well as the world around her. MacDonald Carey plays the detective following Uncle Charlie, who develops an interest in Young Charlie that is almost as creepy as what her uncle is accused of doing.Hitchcock was the Master of Suspense for a reason - he could make you feel afraid without knowing why. "Shadow of a Doubt" oozes creepy atmosphere, playing to the kind of fear you can't quite put your finger on, as if something horrible is lurking just out of view. It's a great thriller, and a masterpiece of anxiety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfred Hitchcock's favorite film of his own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright) is a young girl in Santa Rosa, California, USA with her father Joe (Henry Travers), her mother Emma (Patricia Collinge), her sister Ann (Edna May Wonacott), and her brother Roger (Charles Bates). She is constantly bored with her idyllic life. Her uncle Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotten) is having his own problems. He is a suspected murderer who begins to distrust everyone. Oakley makes a visit to the Newton house. Oakley seems like a nice guy. But After talking with detective Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey) Charlie begins to suspect that Oakley may just be a serial killer. Charlie can not believe him to be a murderer but she starts observing him to act strangely and out of place. Like getting angry when someone takes his photo, being outspoken about rich widows (who also happen to be the victims in these murder cases) and taking a newspaper from Charlie when he sees that it has an article about the murders. I won't give away anything else I'll just let you see it for yourself. This is one of the first definite Alfred Hitchcock classics. Hitchcock made several other films before which were excellent, but this is the first one he made that would join the ranks of Rear Window (1954) and North by Northwest (1959). And it happened to be Hitchcock's favorite of his own films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found it interesting that Margaret &amp; David from The Movie Show reviewed this movie as their classic only a week or so after I watched it. They of course gave it high praise.This was a Hitchcock movie that I had found in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and I had not heard about it before then, but boy did I really enjoy it. The way the story unravels into the mystery that it is, the tension between Charlie (the girl) and Uncle Charlie is built up from a loving niece and uncle relationship to the final 30 minutes when Charlies true intentions are shown.I did find Charlotte to be a bit pretentious and annoying, but it is just a minor annoyance for me, putting that aside, the film was excellent and was for me a "hidden Hitchcock classic",</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's own personal favorite undoubtedly has a gripping story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever had a family member that you dearly love who has been keeping a dark secret about themselves from you for your whole life? If so, then you'll be the first to relate to the main character of Alfred Hitchcock's 1943 mystery "Shadow of a Doubt". Our main protagonist is Charlotte "Charlie" Newton (Teresa Wright), a bored teenager in a small California town who's just learned that her uncle (Joseph Cotten), with the same name, is coming to town to visit her and her family. During his visit, she notices that her uncle is acting very odd at times, mainly when he refuses to have his picture be taken by strangers. Things change further when she discovers the last thing that her uncle would want her to discover, that he may indeed be a murderer on the run. Director Alfred Hitchcock considered "Shadow of a Doubt" his favorite film out of all the films he made. Coming from the same talented filmmaker who made "Rear Window" (1954), "Vertigo" (1958), "North by Northwest" (1959), and "Psycho" (1960), that's a high honor indeed. Looking at it again, I can certainly understand why that might be. It's a story about a young woman who goes through the most backstabbing situation she could find herself in. That, of course, being that she has a family member whom she can no longer trust because of a crime they committed. What's worse is that she wanted to know what secret this person was keeping from her in the first place. It's devastating because she sees another side to this person that she never thought she'd see and also didn't want them to become. "Shadow of a Doubt" tells a powerful story that reminds us that there are going to be family members that aren't always going to be as trustworthy as we think they will be. No matter how hard we try to keep in touch with everyone in our families, there's always going to be difficulty in keeping tabs on each other and trying to know everything about a certain family member. In the case of the relationship between Uncle Charlie and Charlotte's mother Emma (Patricia Collinge), we have a brother-sister relationship in which the brother is trying to keep a secret that would separate him from his sister further. If there are times in this movie in which you have to close your eyes because the worst thing imaginable is about to happen to these characters, then that means this film is doing its job. The reason being is that through all this dread with Charlotte emotionally separating further from her uncle, there is underlying suspense that indicates that it only gets worse. The screenplay by Thornton Wilder, Sally Benson, and Alma Reville creates tension all throughout the film and makes these characters feel real. It's fascinating that Charlotte's father (Henry Travers) invites his neighbor (Hume Cronyn) over for dinner every night just to talk about committing the perfect crime. All I can say is it's no wonder Charlotte doesn't react kindly to these conversations at dinner on top of her dilemma with her uncle. I sincerely believe that films and shows along the lines of "Breaking Bad" owe their existence to this masterful thriller. Joseph Cotten is chillingly good as the fishy uncle and Teresa Wright is full of life as his most cherished niece. The plot is powerful and very well paced by Hitchcock and his screenwriters. To talk any more about "Shadow of a Doubt" would only spoil the suspense along with your enjoyment of seeing it firsthand. So by all means, check out this Hitchcock classic and see why it's Hitchcock's own personal favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's very best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The simple, yet very suspenseful story of a man suspected of being a serial killer coming to visit his sister and his family in a small, quintessential American town is one that despite the enormous freedom allowed today, many directors would probably pass on. Perhaps this is due to the fact that no one could make it as intense or thrilling as the Master of Suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock.After a string of successes in Hollywood, including the Oscar-winning Rebecca, Suspicion, and Saboteur, Hitchcock really began to branch out and make projects that I believe foreshadow the imminent success he would have in the 1950s. While this may not have been one of his most successful or memorable films, it is in my mind the first one dealing with a rather grim subject, more so than his previous films, and it also shows his immense talent in setting up the audience for a devastating climax. Here, Hitchcock had a tremendous cast to work with as well as being able to shoot on-site in a small suburban California town.Teresa Wright gives a quirky and solid performance as the oldest daughter and the most idealistic, named Charlie after her uncle Charlie, the suspected murderer played so brilliantly by one of the most underrated actors of all time, Joseph Cotten. Cotten, best known for working with Orson Welles, completely changes his on-screen persona and creates a very disturbing and memorable character. There are some deftly touches from Hitchcock that show the special bond these two have and has Charlie's suspicions rise about her uncle, we can see that connection manifest itself even more. My one tiny complaint is that of the detective character who seemingly falls in love with the young Charlie, which to me didn't fit the tone or realism of the story.In short, this is one of Hitchcock's very best, on par with his run of masterpieces in the late 1950s. He uses the great cast and writing and traps us in the story with the characters in this innocent little town that has to deal with a very big presence that is overshadowing them all. And all the young Charlie needs to suspect her uncle is a shadow of a doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The master is hatching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock is hatching in the US while the war is dragging along. He is building a tight little plot around a small criminal who gets into some serial killing of rich widows in New York or somewhere back East just because he likes money, because he does not like working at all, and because he hates these women who are wasting the money they inherited instead of giving it to someone like him who would make a better use of it since that would prevent him from working ever and forever and might even enable him to open some small business to cover up the bag of green backs. He is on the run. He escapes from the East and moves to California where his sister lives with her family. But the cops are on his tracks and they get quite close. One manages to capture the attention and care of the oldest girl of the family who is over eighteen in order to arrange with her the leaving of the uncle so that he is arrested out of the city. The uncle, the murderer as you have guessed, understands his niece has gotten through the cloud of mystery and has put two and two together and that it does make four in her head. So he has to get rid of her but he fails probably more out of lack of luck than anything else. But the luck of one is the lack of luck of the ether and vice versa. And during that time our uncle is courting the city and becoming some kind of glorious visitor on the music of some Merry Widow. The end is not going to be what he wanted it to be since he will not be able to leave the town but he will not remain at the surface of it either because he will nicely take residence is some kind of wooden underground chamber six feet under. You really feel the growing pains of Hitchcock under this little film that is probably already definitely too small for the big man who is inhabiting it. But he still has a few years to go before getting in the big shoes he deserves.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

Teresa Wright has never been better, and I'm stunned that she wasn't nominated for the Academy Award for Leading Actress, as she certainly deserved it. Although I've never enjoyed Joseph Cotten before this film or afterward, here he is perfectly cast and delivers a fine performance. To try and describe all of the reasons I enjoyed and appreciated Hitchcock's work here would take all day long. The cinematography certainly compliments the story and nearly becomes a character all by itself. Mezmerizing. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cream of the Hitchcock Crop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The distinction of dramatic tension in Shadow of a Doubt, which is among the highest class of Alfred Hitchcock's direct hits, rests in his powerful instincts for the abstractions of being totally preoccupied with oneself, the way he understands distress and darkness as less intruding outside energy than as the subdued underneath of matters. A bored teenager, portrayed in a tender, unabashedly feminine performance by the uniquely sweet and wise Teresa Wright, is bothered because nothing appears to be going on in her life. Then, she gets the most exciting news that her uncle, whom she dearly loves, in Joseph Cotton's inarguably greatest performance is coming to town. The contrasting extremities are each safe and sound in its spot, but are both obliged jointly. In spite of Thornton Wilder's hand in the script, this is not at all like Our Town. The film's warmth for romanticized American culture is genuine, but there is an aching curiosity. Is one to simply accept this picturesque environment as is? This is the idealized small town with its family values? This penetrative hankering filtering throughout the sun-spotted squares and courtyards and social gatherings that visibly conjecture Wright's growing consciousness as the film's budding realization. The insular contentment of this quaint community is distrusted by Cotten's arrival, which highlights not how much of an outsider he is but how much a part of it he continues to be since he last left. His portrayal as Wright's beloved uncle appears as nearly a caricature of the clean-shaven, mild-mannered likeness appreciated by conventional public. In the course of one of the swift moments that suggest an unpleasant reality behind his pleasant facade, Hitchcock dollies in tight on him, delicately veering Cotten's mildly agreeable facial appearance into a faint callousness.Exactly as dark, unsavory truths and images are shown to have a face, so does the benevolent surface of morality comes apart to let ominous gravity slip, as intimated by one of the hands-down most brilliant devices in Hitchcock's work, the subconscious hints at the Merry Widow Waltz, which are like Freudian slips for the characters, in a film which is otherwise scored by Dmitri Tiomkin, whose score is the mortar for the film's bricks and tiles. Wright's mother is crazy about her baby brother to a curiously overwhelming degree, the father plays morose games with the neighbor, Hume Cronyn, always a delightful surprise, who is obsessed with murder mysteries, and the air of security is merely a threadbare film taut over the world. The underpinnings of darkness may have just a footstep to go, and at the heart of it all is Teresa Wright, finding her way through troubled waters of her own into adulthood. Her angelic purity is stained in the course of her tribulation, but Hitchcock realizes the course as obligatory, her idyllic life cruelly forced open, and her responsibility to face life's capability of wickedness and malevolence, in addition to her inevitable link with it. (Speaking of which, however, if I'm locked in a garage with a car's engine running, I might reasonably employ the car in reverse to break out, but why nitpick an otherwise enormously effective scene?)That the movie is filmed in black and white is seminal. Its transition from the seedy, mystifying introduction of Uncle Charlie and the simple down-home introduction of young Charlie must not be too obvious. They have the same black and white complexion to disguise the vast distinctions between their initial environments.Wright seems to be pouring her fullest heart into her performance in profuse strains of unpremeditated reactions and feelings as this dark, probing, intensely feeling girl who happens to have been surrounded her entire life by a pleasant facade. So she is prone to a cynical view of day-to-day life until her uncle shows and her perspective is rejuvenated, which makes her suspicion much more tense, resistant and tortuous, as well as when we see how much she hates being betrayed. A great touch I always find cynically funny is the character of her little sister as some idealistic intellectual of the generation to continue, hardly through elementary school and rattling off aphorisms while independently reading Ivanhoe. Cotten, likewise, is able to plunge into the depths he would normally seem too sociable and pleasantly persuasive to be typically asked of him, portraying a dark, shadowy man whose experience is on the subterranean side of the life that he lives apart from his family, that brooding disposition leaking into the sensibilities that once called this small town home.Shadow of a Doubt is about the insulated opening their eyes to the macrocosm of existence, the concurrent shadowing and broadening of the perception of the world. And conversely, Wright's protagonist has to silence her revelation as to not unsettle the harmony of her family and her environment. This masterpiece of suspense is one of Hitchcock's most ruthless portrayals of an outrageous certainty divulged no more than to be renounced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is my all time favorite director, and that is a very cliché thing to say but it's cliché for good reason, he simply is the best. Shadow of a Doubt is in my top three favorite films of his. It is nearly perfectly crafted, written, executed and directed. This is truly the closest that a film can get to pure perfection. Every movie fan should see it immediately.The characters in this film are so well thought out. There is Anne, the book smart little girl, Roger, the young math wiz, Emma, the loving mother, and Joe, the quirky father who has a healthy fascination with murder. Then, there are the two most important characters, Young Charlie and Uncle Charlie They start off as best friends but Young Charlie becomes suspicious of her uncle not being who he says he is. All of the acting is magnificent. There truly could not have been a better cast for this film.The writing is seemingly flawless. I tend to get chills whenever I watch Hitchcock's films because the writing is so amazing. This story is intense and very dramatic. It is groundbreaking to this day.This is a movie that no one should go without seeing. I think people who even aren't huge on Hitchcock will enjoy this film. Just watch out for the marry widow killer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shadow of a Doubt is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and stars Joseph Cotton, Teresa Wright and Henry Travers.This film about a deadly game of cat and mouse was Hitchcock's favourite of his own films.It tells the story of young Charlie(Teresa Wright)who is the niece and namesake of her adored uncle Charlie(Joseph Cotton giving one of his best performances).Unknown to his family Uncle Charlie is a killer.He travels from Philadelphia to California not aware that detectives are on his trail,staying with his family he discovers he has not only been discovered by the police but by his niece too. So begins a chilling cat and mouse game as he tries to kill her so she can not tell anyone.Filled with lots of suspense this film makes you think that you may not know those you love as well as you think. This film does a superb job of showing us that life in small towns like this is not always as perfect as it's made out to be. Everyone has secrets and behind closed doors who knows what goes on? Uncle Charlie may well be evil, but he is right when he says the world is a terrible place and there is much truth in his famous line "if you rip the front off houses, you'd find swine".Joseph Cotton gives one of his best performances as the charming man who hides a dark secret and an even darker personality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Families Have Their Deep Dark Secrets; Be They Dysfunctional Types or Be They The So-Called "Normal Types."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IT is indeed a point of interest that this Film Noir, psychological thriller would be offered as a diversion to the very real horrors of World War II; which were only too much of a reality to the folks on the home front in 1943. The engagement of American and other Allied Nations in Europe, the Far East, the Pacific and North Africa was enough of a living horror. Interestingly, or perhaps intentionally, any mention of the War is missing from this Contemporary storyline.WE find it further to be an example of totally unfettered irony that the Film is a co-production of the distributor, Universal Pictures; who also released the production. It was Universal, of course, who made its great fame and fortune by producing such classic works of Horror as Lon Chaney's starring vehicles THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (1923) and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (19??). Moving into the Sound Era, it was Carl Lemmaele's home studio that gave us Bela Lugosi in Dracula (1931), Boris Karloff as the Monster in FRANKENSTEIN (also '31) and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935); as well as his portrayal of Im-Ho-Tep in THE MUMMY (1932). Further examples of fine works of Gothic Horror are: THE WEREWOLF OF London (1935), THE WOLFMAN (1941); as well as a whole sh*t house full of sequels, spin-offs and All-Star Monster fest crossovers.OBVIOUSLY, Alfred Hitchcock's SHADOW OF A DOUBT (Skirbill Productions/Universal Pictures, 1943) made for a very different sort of Horror Picture; albeit one that should be all the more frightening, for it could happen.HITCH takes a very fine cast and puts them through their paces in the sort of manner to which we have become accustomed. The interplay among the main characters is near perfection; with the cast featuring: Young Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright), Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten ), Detective Jack Graham (MacDonald Carey in his first featured role), Joseph Newton (Henry Travers), Emma Newton (Patricia Collinge), Detective Fred Saunders (Wallace Ford) and a supporting cast of what, hundreds? Some outstanding work is in evidence by some great Character Actors (Face Players). Among them is a very pivotal performance by veteran Clarence Muse as a Pullman Porter and a young Hume Cronyn, in his film debut as the Newton's neighbor and detective novel fanatic, Herbie Hawkins.WE have read that Sir Alfred designed the whole to be a view of the darker side of Life; which even exists on Main Street USA, in our Small Towns. Allegedly this was spurned on by the adaptation of Thornton Wilder's Broadway Drama, OUR TOWN (Sol Lesser's Principal Pictures/United Artists Corporation, 1940)* to the Silver Screen. Indeed, we can fully understand how an offbeat sort of approach, which may well not have translated into big (bleepin') deal Box Office $ucce$$; but surely inspired a degree of Cult Status and Following.THIS inclusion of a huge talent such as Thornton Wilder is certainly a true feather in the cap of the whole Hitchcock Production Team; as the name alone certainly would elevate any Production, even a Three Stooges 2 reeler comedy, to the level above any cinematic endeavour. For this we heartily congratulate Messers Wilder and Hitchcock; but we fail to give an automatic status as a True Work of "Art"; for as much as we do truly like this film and have enjoyed multiple viewings of it and would do it again in a New York Minute. We just believe there are just a few minor details that should be discussed and disgusted. That would be the screenplay itself.WHILE the story is inherently gripping, suspenseful and truly horrifying it, like any work of fiction, must take certain artistic license in maintaining continuity, eliminating any unnecessary or repetitive dialogue and in relating its message (whatever that may be). With or without Mr. Thornton Wilder's considerable ability, under the wrong hands of a lesser film maker, the story could be in danger of getting, well, sort of hokey. Our guess that a writer like the above mentioned Pulitzer Prize Winner wrote this in his spare time and could most likely have just "phoned it in"; all for a very hand$ome amount of Cold Ca$h Fee$. (Uh, no problem there, Thornton! After all, we all gotta eat!) WELL, thank God that it was a guy like Hitch who did it; when you add the great photographic work done in the real life Santa Rosa, California and New Jersey (which as a by product provided the world with an archival record of Small Town America, circa 1940. Hey, that's what we were sort of started out to do, no? (And we got it, warts and all!) NOTE * Oh, what a surprise to us it was to us to see Producer Sol Lesser's name in our research for the OUR TOWN movie version. Before now, Sol was only known for his productions, such as THE RETURN OF CHANDU (Principal Pictures, 1934) with Bela Lugosi , the TARZAN THE FEARLESS Serial (Principal Pictures, 1933) with Buster Crabbe in his solo outing with the loin cloth of Tarzan. He also was responsible for all of the post-MGM Tarzan Pictures with Johnny Weissmuller done at RKO Radio Pictures.POODLE SCHNITZ!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Hitchcock's finest, but still a very good thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shadow of a Doubt" is the kind of film that suffers from comparison. It lacks the depth or character development of many of Hitchcock's finest films. Outside of the rather basic "corruption beneath small town" theme, its free of subtexts. Still, if viewed on its own, its a very suspenseful and entertaining thriller. One needs to accept going in that its not going to be nearly as good as either "Vertigo" or "Strangers on a Train", and you'll enjoy the film a lot more. This is because even second-tier Hitchcock is still leagues above the simplistic crap that gets passed for thrillers nowadays. It also proves that one doesn't need loads of sex and violence to craft an involving thriller, just a good sense of pacing and an involving story.Hitchock's direction is as usual exquisite. His sense of pacing is perfect and the film holds up well on repeat viewings. Plus, the screenplay (credited to three different writers), is full of great dialog. The acting here is phenomenal as well. Joseph Cotton, one of the finest performers from the Golden Age of Hollywood, turns in one of his best roles as Uncle Charlie. He manages to make a nihilistic serial killer into an oddly sympathetic story. Teresa Wright gives great support as his questioning niece. The supporting cast is full of delightfully quirky smaller roles. Even the young children are extremely funny, and few movies containing wisecracking kids actually work. "Shadow of a Doubt" is a very good thriller that shows why Hitchcock is considered the master of suspense. (8/10)</fullReview>

The pace usually drags, the conclusion is usually bland, especially compared to newer, more edgy films, and the dialog is strange. Remnants of years gone by are all over this film, but it fails to bore you for a second. It is engaging and suspenseful up until the last minute.When he comes to visit, a young girl starts to think that her uncle may be a serial killer of wealthy women. She finds clues and she is torn between her love for him and her morals.I really enjoyed this movie, maybe my favorite Hitchcock so far besides "Rear Window." The only thing I didn't like was the strange relationship between the girl and the detective...I thought that was awkward. She seems way too young for him.9 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shadow of a Doubt (1943) *** (out of 4) The second film in the series is yet again one that I've only seen once and that was probably fifteen years ago. The plot is pretty simple as a young woman (Teresa Wright) begins to think that her loving uncle (Joseph Cotten) might be a killer. Here's another one that I remembered liking more back in the day but this still remains a rather nice and satisfying thriller, although I didn't care too much for how it ended as it seemed to be walking a tight rope just like Suspicion did with its controversial ending. Outside of that Hitchcock does a nice job building suspense from start to finish, although I'm not really sure if we, the viewer, was every suppose to really suspect that the uncle might not be a killer. From my point of view, the viewer is suppose to know Cotton is the killer while the young girl is suppose to find out along the way. With that in mind, that takes some of the suspense away because I feel it would have worked better had we not known just like the girl. However, perhaps we're not suppose to know and I just didn't see it that way. As with any Hitchcock film you get some very strong performances from the entire cast but the highlight here is without question Cotten who is the perfect snake of a man. At times he comes off very charming but at the same time he pulls off that devilish smile so well. Henry Travers is always fun to watch as is Wallace Ford in his small role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."Are they?"... a mendacious Joseph Cotten (as Uncle Charlie) stares into the camera, with a grimace reflecting his contempt for merry widows. "The Merry Widow Killer" is loose in small town America, and Hitchcock again proves that no one can know what evil lives inside the spirits of some men.Patricia Collinge is very good as the conventional, self-satisfied housewife, ..."ah the house owns us"..., she says to a photographer from Good Housekeeping proudly. All is well and happy. Or so it seems.Teresa Wright, as Uncle Charlie's favorite niece, senses something is awry. The very fine emerald her impoverished waitress friend admires is ill gotten gains. Apparently from a dead widow. Hume Cronyn also has an excellent cameo as a neighbor who trades murder hypotheses with Wright's father, Henry Travers. A few ironic and amusing macabre stories.The middle class morality Hitchcock pokes fun with, always subtle. In this case his anti-hero protagonist Joe Cotten casually depositing $40,000.00 in the bank and quipping we all know what banks are they take your money, God forbid you want some of it back. Brilliant and frightening character study. Do not miss. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...This is Hitchcock at his muscle-flexing best, bringing almost every aspect of his cinematic expertise to conjure a film noir classic which he himself often termed one of his favourite works. The direction is sure and pacey, you feel that Hitch is behind the camera on every shot (no first or second unit lapses are apparent here), deriving maximum effect from his actors and backgrounds. Thus we get camera shots from below, above, off centre (betraying perhaps a Welles-ian influence), forward tracking, backward tracking, long shots, extreme close-ups, together with a panoply of different lighting effects in the best noir tradition. One or two of the narrative devices seem unusual to modern sensibilities, in particular the fact that the Newtons allow the masquerading cops the run of their house for a government survey but there are compensations in snappy dialogue from all concerned, even from the young children and particularly in the director's typical black humour as Newton and his chum, played by Hume Cronyn, forever ghoulishly discuss the perfect murder. Best of all though is the lead acting, with Joseph Cotten as the "wonder-uncle" with a (serial) murderous secret and in particular Teresa Wright in a terrific turn as the hero-worshipping adolescent who grows up fast to finally see through Uncle Charlie's charade and attempts, at great personal risk, to effectively exile the serpent from the smalltown Garden of Eden that Cotten has invaded. There are too many excellent what I term directorial flourishes from Hitchcock to recount, just sit back and watch the Master at work. Perhaps the best of his 1940's "black and white" work, which considering that list includes "Notorious", "Rebecca" and "Foreign Correspondent" is saying a lot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock Film "Shadow of a Doubt"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Alfred Hitchcock's film "Shadow of a Doubt" a very intriguing movie. One of the things that stood out for me was the way Hitchcock put together the film with so much thought, and time. This was my very first Hitchcock film actually, and after seeing this I have picked up on other of Hitchcock's films. Uncle Charlie is viewed upon with mysterious music?shadowing lights?and a look of suspicion. Though he may have a light side to his part of being Uncle Charlie, there is also a dark side that is trying to flee from what is occupying his mind. So he goes to visit his older sister, and family in a small suburban town. He comes in with innocence, knowing he can try to hide his secret. He's zoomed in on with the camera with a look that makes you think. It makes me think of something is going on that he's not telling us. As he smokes cigars, the smoke rises up in front of his face; the smoke hides Uncle Charlie's face for a moment. Uncle Charlie defiantly has something going on. He has a relationship with his niece, Young Charlie that is so pure and sweet. Young Charlie is always excited to be around with her uncle, and she doesn't expect anything from him but kindness. As the film roles on, Young Charlie gets suspicious. With detectives coming to her home, wanting to talk with her Uncle Charlie specifically, Uncle Charlie tries to hide away. Young Charlie catches on to this and gets into some research about what's been in the news paper lately. She has caught on to her Uncle Charlie, wanting to help the detectives out. The way Hitchcock put this film together is amazing. Not once did I draw my eyes away from the scene. He left me at the edge of my seat wanting to know what was going on, and what would happen next. And the way Hitchcock set up the scenes to relate with the characters was wonderful. For example, one that stood out was the train's smoke. As Uncle Charlie is arriving to the station, there is a huge cloud of black smoke that rises up out of the train. It surrounds the station, making the sun disappear. Everything is dark, and as the smoke starts to evaporate into the sky the music gets happier, and Uncle Charlie steps out seeing his family waiting for him. The smoke is gone?for now. Later in the movie, we see Uncle Charlie lying on his bed smoking a cigar. He puffs rings of smoke out of his mouth, and as that happens you hear faintly in the background the train's horn, and the scene of Uncle Charlie is gone. Now that I have seen "Shadow of a Doubt" thanks to my Film Studies teacher, I have fully enjoyed the Hitchcock films, and this one in particular was very well done. If what you're looking for is mystery, drama, and a classic I should say, this is your kind of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite Hitchcock movies and probably one of the first I've ever seen.Its starts off slow paced but gradually becomes more and more tense until the film reaches its climax.Uncle Charlie is a murderer of wealthy middle aged women,the police are on to him so he skips town and goes to stay with his elder sister. The family are pleased to see him especially his niece,who is also named Charlie,everything seems perfect.Until young Charlie{Teresa Wright}discovers her uncle is a serial killer,and the police are on to him. Because she doesn't want her family dragged into his arrest she urges her uncle to leave,but he has other plans and sets out to silence her.Towards the end of the film he lets his niece think that she has won the argument and decides to leave but insists young Charlie says her goodbyes to him on the train. His plan is to wait until the train starts moving fast and then push her off.But his plan backfires and it is he who falls from the train to his death.Shadow of a Doubt is very good for a 1942 film,the script is good and the acting is realistic.There is also some funny moments between young Charlies father Joe and his friend Herbert,who in their spare time like to discuss the perfect way to commit murder and get away with it. Also others may disagree but Teresa Wrights character is probably my favourite of the Hitchcock women,as shes different to the usual Hitchcock cool blonde's,in that shes playing a typical average young woman who's intelligent but naive,but at the same time very plucky and has the courage to stand up to her uncle,and eventually put an end to him.More than sixty years on this is still a very watchable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's first American masterpiece... Don't miss it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shadow of a Doubt is Hitchcock's first American masterpiece, a timeless morality tale of good and evil.Joseph Cotten is Uncle Charlie who leaves Philadelphia under mysterious circumstances to visit his sister and cousin Charlie in the small town of Santa Rosa. Cousin Charlie adores her uncle until she begins to have doubts about who he really is. This is one of the four Hitchcock films that deals with duality. The others are Strangers on a Train, Psycho, and Frenzy. Hitchock exposes the dual nature of people through the use of doubling. Try to count all the instances of "doubles" in the film. The two Charlies; two detectives in Philadelphia, two detectives in Santa Rosa; two scenes on the train; Cotten orders a double shot in a bar; two scenes in the garage. The list goes on and on. This film rewards with repeated viewings.The acting in the film is top notch. Teresa Wright is perfect as the innocent girl who is exposed to the horrific world of her uncle. Joseph Cotten is terrific, understated but very creepy. Thorton Wilder's script is one of the best in all of Hitchcock's films. Dimitri Tiompkin's score is perfectly atmospheric and really adds to the tension.Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Age of Innocence Shadowed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film of subtleties, Shadow of a Doubt is a slow moving character study of young "Charlie" (Teresa Wright), the namesake of sinister uncle, Charles Oakley (Joseph Cotton), formerly of Philadelphia, a man of dubious talents. Contrasting with the light and seemingly perfect Americana of 40s, middle class, small town Northern California, Uncle Charles is the shadow who comes into the lives of his sister's family. As young Charlie, Wright is an average but purposeless girl whose world has become boring largely by her failure to give it any meaning. She wants her uncle Charles to "shake them up." However, she is part of a family where everyone talks over one another without heed, they present an assortment of conversations lost. The kids prattle, the mother/wife babbles, and the family's men persist in mindless discussions of how to plot murder effectively. Somehow, this connotes as the average family dynamic in Hitchcock's translation. This is a film of many dialogues but only one voice is heard without interruption, that of Uncle Charles. His monologue is the most menacing at the dinner table as he describes the "silly wives," useless, fat, women whom he sees as less than human, faded, fat, greedy animals deserving to die. Young Charlie adores her uncle until the "shadow of a doubt" is placed in her mind by detective MacDonald Cary, one of two detectives on a national hunt for the "Merry Widow" serial murderer. Once the seeds of doubt are sown, however, young Charlie's dream of the perfect uncle and her perfect world are forever shattered. Uncle Charles rips away at ordinary Charlie, her sleepwalking innocence forcing her to see the warped world he has experienced. The real world is not a nice place and Charlie attempts to shield her simplistic family from the evil under their roof becomes her responsibility for she has ultimately summoned the devil to their door. Will she keep the family ignorant of Uncle Charles murderous past but at a cost to her own happiness?Hitchcock acknowledged the film was his personal favorite and it defines the idea of suspense, noir, and thriller without blood or visual carnage. A literate script by Thorton Wilder (Our Town) alludes to all the violence that is only suggested but never seen, and through the physical presence of the brilliant character actor, Joseph Cotton, the menace and diabolic threat to the virginal Theresa Wright is alluded to in eye, body language, and hands. Sophisticated and cerebral, Hitch was playing with the audience by creating a masterpiece of normality and averageness through the evil veneer of a sophisticated character versus the idealized characters of small town America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several things about this movie are bothersome. For example, the police suspicion that Joseph Cotten may be the Merry Widow Killer results in two of them visiting the family with whom he's staying so that they can pose as survey takers. This seems contrived and somewhat implausible. True, it may provide the basis for a sub-plot romance between Teresa Wright and Macdonald Carey but this sub-plot is unnecessary and besides, there's never any real ardor in this romance. Then there's the matter of the Uncle Charlie character. He's supposed to be one of those charmers whose appearance on the doorstep provokes delight on the part of his hosts. Yet he often comes across as a bad house-guest -- surly and even rude. That scene in the bank, for instance, when he loudly jokes about embezzlement and thus causes real embarrassment for his brother-in-law. What a boor! And if he's so smart, why does he give his niece a stolen ring which bears the engraved initials of its owner, one of his victims? Wouldn't he have checked over this ring first? And why try to hide the news item about the Merry Widow Killer by tearing it out of the newspaper? This only drew attention to the item whereas, if he left it alone, it would probably have passed without any special notice. On the other hand, I've always liked this movie's basic set-up, (though I could do with a bit less of the bookwormish kid sister), and it has a number of fine moments in it, such as when the camera pans down the Merry Widow newspaper article, line by line, as the Merry Widow Waltz plays ominously on the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>analysis of the theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>************************Careful SPOILERS ahead************************Theme is the underlying subject of the entire film one is watching. The theme of Shadow of a Doubt is subtle at times but nonetheless important. The theme of the film seems to be the duality of the human condition. Stated another way, the theme is that human beings are capable of doing good and evil. As Spoto says, Little Charlie (Teresa Wright) and Uncle Charlie (Uncle Charlie) are two sides of a coin. Uncle Charlie is an `evil' murderer of helpless widows. Little Charlie is a kind, loving niece who would never do such things. What Hitchcock does is to almost make Uncle Charlie and Little Charlie the same character. It is as if they are two dueling sides of one persons mind. One tells the person to do good while the other tells the person to do evil. This is similar to the relationship between Bruno and Guy in Strangers on a Train. Bruno and Guy meet `accidentally' on a train and immediately it is evident that they are polar opposites. However, they are both related in some way. There is a strange homosexual attraction between Bruno and Guy. This is similar to the incestuous relationship between Uncle Charlie and Little Charlie. She says that they are more than uncle and niece. She knows him. I do not, however, believe that Hitchcock wants to make them lovers. Instead, I think the strange relationship is supposed to strengthen the connection between the two and make it clear that they are the same person. This theme of duality is expressed in many of the scenes in Shadow of a Doubt. One scene Spoto gets at when he talks about the presentation of the characters. The scene takes place at the very beginning of the film. We see the camera zoom in on the streets of Philadelphia, cutting in closer to an apartment building. The camera finds itself zooming in on Uncle Charlie, lying on a bed. This whole part is done to show the darkness of Uncle Charlie's surroundings, thus showing the darkness of his character. This is juxtaposed with a shot of Little Charlie's house. It is in the very beautiful Santa Rosa. It zooms in and cuts to Little Charlie's room. Like her uncle, she is lying on the bed thinking. This whole scene shows the beauty and peacefulness of Little Charlie's surroundings, thus showing her beautiful character. Both characters lie in the same position and are presented very similarly. What Hitchcock shows is the two sides of the coin. He shows the good Little Charlie and the evil Uncle Charlie. Another scene, which reflects the theme, is one in which Little Charlie walks up the stairs to find her uncle waiting for her. He stands in the dark while she is has more light on her. The young Charlie has found out that her uncle is a serial killer. She tells him to leave and he says he will in time. This scene reflects the theme in that it shows the two sides of the psyche conflicting, one in light and one in shadow. Charlie is the good side trying to get the bad side to leave. The theme of the film can also be seen in the techniques that Hitchcock uses. One technique is his running motif of the `Merry Widow March.' This tune that jumps from Uncle Charlie's head to his niece's helps to strengthen the link between the two. It makes them more the same character. This tune is in fact the MaGuffin of the film. It is the clue that we never notice while watching the film. One scene in which the motif is used is one that takes place at the dinner table. Little Charlie comes to the table with a tune stuck in her head. She says she cannot think of what it is. Uncle Charlie attempts to call it the Blue Danube Waltz, but his niece soon figures it out. Before she can say the name of it, he spills wine. This is a sign that the uncle wants to separate himself from his niece, or perhaps his other half. This tune brings the two closer together, thus making them conflict more. Another technique that contributes to the theme is Hitchcock's use of angles. For Uncle Charlie in many scenes, he uses low angle shots to make him seem more imposing and powerful. In many scenes, high angle shots are used for Little Charlie. This makes her seem much more confused by her surroundings. She does not hold power like her uncle. She looks like a pawn being played in a disturbing chess game. One shot that exemplifies this shows Uncle Charlie in his room. He looks out to see his niece talking with her friend/boyfriend Detective Jack Graham (MacDonald Carey). A low angle shot shows him dropping his cigar and position his hands as if to strangle someone. This shows the evil power of the uncle. A high angle P.O.V. shot is used to see Little Charlie conversing with her friend. These angles in the scene make Uncle Charlie look like the evil power, while his niece is good and almost without power. All of these scenes and techniques point to the theme of conflicting psyches. The scenes show that Little Charlie is the good side conflicting with her uncle, the evil side. They are meant to be parts of the same person. The incestuous relationship makes them look closer than just uncle and niece. They are psychologically linked and will fight for what they believe is right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe this movie is fairly overrated. Not saying it is bad but it isn't a classic."Shadow of a Doubt" is a good movie, one I'll probably watch a few more times but it isn't a great film. Acting wise Patricia Collinge and Teresa Wright steal the show. They are both great. Not to mention Wright is amazingly beautiful.I felt Joseph Cotten, although decent overall was the acting weakness. I just didn't feel any suspense from his performance. Then again I felt very little at all.Hitchcock is a great director and knows how to tell a story. But here he seemed to get lazy. He didn't seem to add in any Hitch-ness to the movie. The movie even plays out like a drama since we already know about Uncle Charlie's secret at the start of the movie.So, basically any tension is eliminated. I also thought the climatic scene of the movie was poorly edited or whatever. Just came across scrambled and forced.Now, this is still a really good movie. As a drama and psychological showcase it is a really good drama. But it doesn't deserved to be mentioned as Hitchcock's best or in the top 250 of all time. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Gothic: A Tale of Two Charlies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NO SPOILERS!!One of Hitchcock's more gleefully mean-spirited and satisfying thrillers, Shadow of A Doubt, was also his personal favorite. This is the tale of two Charlies, one good the other, bad. There's Charlie Newton(Theresa Wright) the young woman, barely twenty who lives with her family in quaint, all-American Santa Rosa California and then there's her Uncle and namesake - Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotton). Charlie Oakley is the impossibly tall man who lives on the wrong side of the tracks back east. Young Charlie Newton pines away in her idyllic home, waiting for adventure and romance while Uncle Charlie Oakley seems to have some trouble with detectives asking questions about him. In the first of many telepathic coincidences, Young Charlie sets to send a telegram to her Uncle Charlie inviting him to visit while Uncle Charlie himself sends word that he will in fact be coming to Santa Rosa for a vacation.At last, the two Charlies are reunited. Young Charlie and her entire family seem thrilled and charmed by Uncle Charlie. Most happy to see him is Emma Newton, Young Charlie's mother who dotes on her handsome 'baby brother'. Even lonely next-door neighbor and aspiring murder mystery writer (Hume Cronyn) enjoys the bits of fun and wisdom the 'city slicker' brings to the table. Just when Young Charlie is poised to 'show off' her favorite Uncle in town, she accidently stumbles upon some information and slowly realizes that Uncle Charlie might not be as nice as he seems. This being a Hitchcock film naturally Uncle Charlie isn't just 'not nice' , he's what we would now a days call - a serial killer. A tense game of cat and mouse begins as each Charlie realizes that the other is 'on to him'. Unfortunately for Young Charlie, Uncle Charlie is much better at these games.There's a full, lushness to the Americana at work here that perhaps only script and story collaborator Thornton Wilder could create. The mixture of the penultimate writer of small town Americana - Our Town and the perverse sensibilities of Alfred Hitchcock is sublime. The subtle camerawork and design reveals the shadows in the impeccable Victorian-style house and the garrulous, sit-com style sensibility of the Newton family is perfectly realized. They seem instantly real and vulnerable to the unexpected violence brewing under their roof. Slick, and almost comically fiendish, Shadow of A Doubt remains immensely potent, suprisingly sadistic and extremely entertaining. Hitchcock is in top form as is fresh faced Theresa Wright as breezy Young Charlie and menacing, jaw clenching Joseph Cotton in one of his finest star turns here as her deadly Uncle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual Hitchcock outing scores winning performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joseph Cotten made one of the great screen villains ever with his Uncle Charlie, who gathers complexity not because of the possibility of his innocence (from the opening scenes it's clear Hitchcock is not playing that game) but because of the identification he elicits from both the viewer and from his niece. He's a tortured soul as well as a torturing one. Teresa Wright matches Cotten every step of the way, as a good girl who never falls into the stilted ingenue trap of the period. That confrontation at the back steps near the conclusion is a classic cinematic confrontation, and the menace is all hers ("Go away or I'll kill you myself...that's how I feel...")The supporting players are uniformly fine, especially Patricia Collinge as snookered sister Emma and Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn as the comic-relief pair (the latter two do a lot to liven up some duller patches in the second half.) I may be the only one who feels this way, but I love Janet Shaw as that poor waitress Louise, the kind of person Charlie might have become if her uncle had his way. ("I've been in half the restaurants in town...Yes sir, for a ring like that I'd just about die.")The most interesting thing about "Shadow of a Doubt" is the marriage of two great artistic visions, Hitchcock's belief in the core evil of humankind and Thornton Wilder's sunnier but no less complex focus on how society, informed with some sense of spiritual responsibility, can shape man for the better. There's a duality here that is presented to us in varying ways throughout the film, most successfully with the two lead characters, "twins" who live on opposite ends of a wide moral chasm.I just wish this film moved a bit faster and that the characters weren't so marble-mouthed at times. I don't think this is MTV-era carping, it just feels slow for a Hitchcock film. Then again, compared to "Our Town," this is a Will Smith video, so maybe that Hitchcock-Wilder duality has its downside. I give it an 8, not tops but I really enjoy it and think you will, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a definite sexual tension in this movie between Charlie the uncle and Charlie the niece. He, being the sociopath that he is, is well aware of it and uses it to keep her loyal to him. She, of course, is an innocent who has no idea. She isn't ready to have her suspicions awakened until her attraction is transferred from her uncle to the cop. It's been a while since I've seen the film, but my recollection is that the cop understands this and that his courtship of her starts out with very mixed motives. The Production Code kept all this well below the surface.If Shadow of a Doubt were to be remade, this triangle would probably be more explicit. If it had been remade, say, 15 years ago it would have been very explicit. These days, though, the niece couldn't be played as plausibly naive about her feelings for her uncle if older than 15 or 16, which would complicate her relationship to the detective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright) is a bored young woman in a small California town who wishes something exciting would happen. She gets more than she bargained for with a visit from Charlie (Joseph Cotten), her favorite uncle after whom she was named. Her uncle is followed by two detectives who believe him to be the Merry Widow Murderer. Charlie refuses to believe this of her beloved uncle but soon the clues start piling up and she has no choice but to face the truth about him.One of Alfred Hitchcock's best suspense films is a brilliant twist on the kind of wholesome Americana films that were very popular at the time. That Thornton "Our Town" Wilder co-wrote the screenplay surely helped. The cast is so good. Teresa Wright has her best and most-remembered role here. Joseph Cotten, a phenomenal actor who could make anything better just by being in it, plays the sinister and disturbed Uncle Charlie perfectly. He has a couple of truly chilling speeches. A lot of scenes for his highlight reel here. Henry Travers and Patricia Collinge are both excellent in subtle ways as the parents. Edna May Wonacott is a lot of fun as the precocious little sister who always seems to have her nose buried in a book. Hume Cronyn makes his film debut as the comic relief neighbor and murder mystery enthusiast. His scenes with Travers are wonderful.I first saw this when I was a teenager and came away disappointed. But, as with many films, I've grown to appreciate it much more as I've gotten older. The main sticking point for me back then was the same as many of the reviewers here -- I felt Uncle Charlie being a murderer was obvious too early and should have been left unclear until the end. I still wonder how much the film would improve, if any, with more ambiguity. This isn't to say the film lacks suspense. It's certainly got that in spades, just not built around the question of Uncle Charlie's guilt. Try to go into it not expecting some big twist and just savor the performances and direction. Hitchcock does an amazing job building the tension, particularly in the final act. It's classic Hitch with some truly memorable lines and scenes. A film that should be on everybody's must-see list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is acclaimed as one of the greatest directors of all time, but he doesn't shows up all his masterpiece touch here in Shadows of a doubt. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, but is just nothing more than this. Nothing special. The story just took way too long to define it's direction, where it was going. And i didn't felt the thriller moments. Due to the fact that we took way too long to discover where the story was going, i didn't care for the niece and uncle Charlies at all. The only plus that i find in the story was the cartoon-like supporting characters and the histrionic acting, which brought more 'life' to the movie. It's also very well-written, regardless of it's content. A 7.50 is a fair rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Concise, taut, not a scene wasted. Prime for remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the type of movie you rarely see anymore. It lives in a world of its own like a high-priced hooker. There is no fat, no excess, no bloat. If you are not sitting on the edge of your seat through this, you are not alive. Rarely have I seen a more disciplined production. The director acts as a living being, unseen, unheard but there, always there, stalking your imagination and fears brilliantly. Blake Edwards is known for his comedy films. A pity. He was made for drama and suspense. I don't usually propose remakes of classics. Modern directors know nothing of restraint and precise story telling without gimmickry. Edwards weaves this tale with all faculties present and accounted for. Acting? Check. Music? Check. Cinematography? Check. Script? Check. Lighting? Check. Acting? Check. That's why I wish Clint Eastwood would remake this. Like his direction or not, he is economical in his art and fluid in his storytelling. Experiment in Terror is a forgotten classic that deserves to live another day. I don't think anyone could it justice these days other than Eastwood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of typical Hitchcock irony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shadow of a Doubt" is full of the kind of irony that Hitckcock liked to inject into his films. We see what appears to be a normal family living in small town America, but everything is far from normal. The young daughter laments the monotony and trite of her every day life. She has no idea that things can get worse and that is exactly what is going to happen. Then there is the psychotic one in the family who in one moment is sweeping one of the widows in town off her feet, and in another, wringing and twisting his newspaper is if he were strangling someone. Best of all is the father and his friend debating about the best way to commit murder and get away with it. Little do they suspect the real murderer in their midst. They never do find out. It is a secret that only one in the family comes to know, the same one who at the beginning wanted a more meaningful existence. Great stuff and one of Hitchcock's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Hitchcock, terrific entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shadow of a Doubt" is not one of Hitchcock's better known films. People are more apt to think of "Psycho", "Vertigo", "Rear Window", "The Birds" or any one of several others before they think of this film as one of their favorites. But although the film is badly dated, I think that it is one of the more entertaining and amusing of the Hitchcock films.Terrific acting, great camera work and an amusing sub-plot(with Hume Cronyn and Henry Travers)will keep you entertained, and help you appreciate one of Hitchcock's less shown classics.Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten are terrific as Charlotte (Young Charlie)and Uncle Charlie, respectively. She is the small town girl and he is the long, lost mysterious uncle with a secret past.The very end of the movie, like a good number of other Hitchcock endings is a little contrived. And as I said earlier, the movie is pretty dated. But it's still an entertaining film by a man who was a master of this genre.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid mainstream Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can tell Theresa Wright's wardrobe was done by Adrian, who had a penchant for mannish contours. She wears one suit that seems to have a curtain rod thrust through the shoulders. Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't have such shoulders. In order to be built like that without props you'd have to be Bronco Nagurski. I liked some of her shoes, though, a pair of white heels with brown tips, somehow so pure looking. Maybe they are spectator pumps. (What ARE spectator pumps?)Hitchcock always claimed this was one of his favorites. Maybe it was. It was shot on a very small budget under wartime restrictions yet it's gripping. Thornton Wilder was just the writer to capture the nuances and quotidian details of small-town life, as he'd shown in "Our Town." Hitchcock himself was born into a family of modest means but he quickly put his background and his family behind him. He shot in varied locations but the point of view he presented was almost always a middle-class tourist's.Some of the details were undoubtedly the contribution of the director and his wife, Alma. It's amazing, really, how much effort Hitchcock put into small bits of business considering that the word "art" had hardly any meaning in the context of American popular movies at the time. More than once he changes a scene from a shot of Uncle Charlie to one of Little Charlie, both in the same positions, perhaps flat on their backs in bed, connecting the two characters by simple visual means. And when Cotton, as the uncle, races after Wright, as Little Charlie, he grabs her by the arm and hustles her off the bustling, innocent early evening street and through the doors of a shabby noisy bar called "Till Two," while she protests, "I've never been in a place like this before." Indeed she hasn't, not physically and not morally. But it's Uncle Charlie's kind of place allright. At their table Uncle Charlie begins to insult her, ridiculing her for her ignorance, telling her that "the world is a foul sty," all his charm gone. The exchange, which is critical, could have been turned by another director into something dull and strictly functional. But Hitchcock had a gift for lifting such scenes out of the ordinary. While Uncle Charlie is explaining how rotten the world is, and why those rich greedy women deserved to die, he takes a paper napkin, folds it, and begins to strangle it distractedly with his strong hands, while Charlie stares in horror. And I doubt that anyone other than Hitchcock was responsible for the scene at the railway station when Uncle Charlie's train arrives at small tranquil abnormally normal Santa Rose -- with a huge billowing plume of black smoke hovering over the locomotive as it rolls to a halt. What an image!Joseph Cotton is always elegantly dressed, even flamboyantly dressed. He cracks sadistic and ill-timed jokes. But he's handsome too, and generous and friendly, and he seems genuinely to love the only remaining members of his family. His rich baritone is confident, and we can believe he knows what he's talking about. At the beginning of the movie, however, as he is about to be nabbed by two detectives, he seems so tired that we feel kind of sorry for him, although to be sure we don't know exactly what he's done yet. Theresa Wright's voice has a stagey trained quality that makes it hard to believe her, but she's such a petite and appealing actress that it's easy to suspend our disbelief. Her theatrical quality is matched by her mother. Little Charlie has two younger siblings, one of them one of Hitchcock's homely little girls with glasses. MacDonald Carey is from Sioux Falls, Iowa, or someplace. Hume Cronyn as the neighbor is creepy.The score is by the ever-popular Dmitri Tiomkin. If he accomplishes nothing else, he does a fine job of establishing an atmosphere of unease by transposing a graceful Strauss waltz into a minor key. The photography is fine too. And Hitchcock's cameo appearance is one of his most humorous, even if we don't see his face. We only see his bridge hand, a grand slam in spades, and one of the other players remarks to him, "You don't look so good yourself." There's another point, the explanation of Uncle Charlie's murderous propensities. The dialogue must have been Wilder's. As a child, it seems, Charlie's bike skidded on some ice and he was thrown into a streetcar, his skull fractured, and when he emerged from the coma he was never the same. I feel the explanation MUST have come from Wilder's script because if Hitchcock had had anything to do with it he would have stuck it to Uncle Charlie's mother! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's most fascinating movies. Hugely underrated!.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw 'Shadow Of A Doubt' on TV back in the 1980s and it always stuck with me, but if someone asked me what my favourite Hitchcock movies were it wouldn't be one that I would immediately think of. However, I rewatched it for the first time in years the other day on DVD, and I must say that I was hugely impressed by it. It could well tie with 'Lifeboat' as Hitchcock's most underrated movie. It's such an interesting film, and difficult to categorize. While there are moments of suspense I wouldn't really describe it as a thriller. Film-noir is a bit off, and just plain drama doesn't give you much idea of what you're in for. However you want to label it it's a brilliant piece of work, with a strong script from Thornton Wilder, and an excellent cast. I know nothing about Teresa Wright, but she is very good as Young Charlie, and the scenes between Henry Travers ('It's A Wonderful Life'), who plays her father, and his crime buff buddy Hume Cronyn (in his film debut) are priceless, but of course, Joseph Cotton as the charming but deadly Uncle Charlie steals the movie with a superb performance. Cotton worked with everyone from Orson Welles to Mario Bava in his long career, but I would say this is my favourite role of his, even beating his Holly Martins in the dazzling 'The Third Man'. 'Shadow Of A Doubt' gets better and better with every viewing. I think it's close to being a masterpiece. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Class paper... Spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the major themes of this film is the reoccurrence of the issue of identity. Uncle Charlie has multiple identities that he only shows to certain people. In the home of his sister, Charlie attempts to have the identity of the perfect brother and visitor. To his niece, young Charlie, he must show the second side of his personality: the murderer. Young Charlie also has to show two different identities: the calm side of being a loving and devoted daughter and the troubled side where she knows Uncle Charlie's secret. She struggles with the issue of turning her uncle in for murder or saving her mother's heart by not telling. Identity of the suburban town versus the gritty city also shows the contrast between good and evil. Identity is definitely a reoccurring theme in this film. Identity also occurs often in 'North by Northwest" and "The Lady Vanishes."This theme is shown in two major scenes as well as many others. The first is when Uncle Charlie gives young Charlie the emerald ring. The ring was stolen from one of his merry widow victims. The giving of the ring mimics a wedding proposal, indicating trust and devotion. The ring itself represents murder and the dark side of Uncle Charlie. Another scene is when Uncle Charlie is in bed and the mother and young Charlie are talking about being photographed for the paper. Photos usually represent certain times and image. Charlie looks at photos differently because he is a murderer. He does not want his identity to be shown for fear that he could be recognized and caught.There are two film techniques that are also very apparent in "Shadow of a Doubt." The first and major one is the reoccurrence of music. The song that is played the most is the 'Merry Widow Waltz.' The title of the waltz in relation to the film is obvious; Charlie is called the 'Merry Widow Murderer.' The song for some reason keeps on popping into young Charlie's head during the first dinner scene. When she tries to remember the name and mentions the name 'merry' Uncle Charlie suddenly spills a glass of wine, showing that he does not want her to make the connection between the waltz and the title. Dialogue is the other film technique that keeps on showing up. The way that Uncle Charlie and young Charlie talk together is very unique. They constantly say each other's names, making all of the actions very personal. Young Charlie also mentions to her Uncle in the kitchen scene during the first night that they have some sort of telepathy. This would be dialogue in their heads, versus out loud. She feels that they are connected, yet she also knows that there is a secret that her uncle is hiding. The connection between the two characters is apparent through dialogue, spoken or unspoken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And their wives...their greedy little wives...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly my favorite Hitchcock (mmm?'Strangers on a Train' comes pretty close too). It has so many great things going for it that I'm not even sure where to begin. For a film made such a long time ago, the way it holds up today speaks volumes about its power. I showed this film to my grandmother who, having never seen it, fell in love with the depiction of 40s small town life (the on-location shoot in Santa Rosa really made a difference here. It is in fact a character unto itself.). By the 40s, my grandmother was a schoolteacher/housewife living in Queens and by no means the teenager Charlie is in the movie. But I think for those looking to capture a fairly accurate glimpse of how people spent their time back then, this film will be of great interest. Here we see as world where teens are certainly not the entity they are now and are more or less treated as adults. Where people took to the streets at night for enjoyment with their friends and neighbors instead of sitting in front of TV or a computer. Where people lived a fairly contained, contented life in a place where the local cop might cut you a break just because he knows you.But this ain't all Frank Capra, baby, it's Hitchcock, and he is definitely making a certain kind of statement about the small town America he found himself fascinated with when he arrived from his native London (this, I think, is his first real American made film). He manipulates us with this great, comfortable, familiar ? and accurate! ? American atmosphere and shows us something extremely sinister lying-in-wait through the arrival of Uncle Charlie (check out the dark shadow cast by the train carrying Charlie as it pulls in to Santa Rosa). In our modern terminology, I guess one could say that Hitch is showing a world that, while a very nice place, is blanketed in denial. The mother, played by Patricia Collinge, perhaps best personifies this notion to the point where she practically flat-out refuses to believe anything amiss could possibly be happening within her glorious household. She is hysterically happy in an almost forceful, even disturbing, way! For younger audiences, I think they will begin the movie with a preconceived Frank Capra-type expectation (which really seems old fashioned today), but slowly develop appreciation as these two worlds begin to collide. John Carpenter approached `Halloween' in much the same way: evil is a natural force in human nature that cannot be avoided or reasoned with no matter how hard one tries to act superior to it. Anyone who believes they can is merely deluding themselves. We often cannot control where or when it will enter and throw our lives asunder. As for the players, they are entirely outstanding. Teresa Wright practically grows up before our eyes. Hume Cronyn provides intelligently fun comedic relief. Joseph Cotton is absolutely amazing as the heavy. His smirk reflects a cynicism and arrogance that attests to the hardships of the many dark corners of his world ? the world Santa Rosa consciously shuts out. His negative energy would make him the perfect villain, but he's not an easy guy to hate. Just as his niece, Charlie, observes, we too find him dashing, charming, experienced, interesting and even friendly. By returning to Santa Rosa, we know that he's looking for something that has long been corrupted from his soul. We slowly realize that he can't ever truly return to his home, or what it represents for him, ever again. In that sense, Uncle Charlie is quite tragic. On the other hand, Hitch doesn't spare us of the evil lurking within, and Cotton's soliloquy at the dinner table is nothing short in awesome in giving us a peek inside the violent hatred fueling this serial killer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Discrete Charm of the Bourgeoisie Killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock cited this film as his personal favorite; he apparently savored the idea of a serial killer entering the calm, middle-class world of Santa Rosa, CA. And it is perversely delightful (especially for a film of this age) to see the murderer's nihilistic philosophy not given much reproach; though he's obviously gone too far in his murderous actions, he's a lot more appealing, and sensical, than most of the other characters in the story. However, this is one of Hitchcock's least cinematically interesting films of his American period; it seems he was so tickled by the material that he felt he didn't need to invest his inventive stylistic flourishes into the story. Granted, there are some choice touches: the extradiagetic transitional ballroom dance is haunting, and the easy supernaturality of Uncle Charlie's ability to evade capture is masterfully, subtly conveyed. Perhaps it's shallow of me to yearn for a big set-piece or two, but Hitchcock's set-pieces always did more than merely entertainingly punctuate his narratives; they enriched the meanings of his works on a surrealistically psychological level. This is one of the few Hitchcock films that leaves me feeling unfulfilled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slight Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it hard to believe that Shadow of a Doubt is even considered as Alfred Hitchcock's best film. Although he was a brilliant director, the suspense of this film is minimal while the plot can leave you uninterested. Joseph Cotton plays the beloved `Uncle Charlie', who pays a visit to his older sister and her family. Meanwhile his adoring niece is tipped off by a detective that her uncle is a serial killer. Some undeveloped references to telepathy and an unintended, yet apparent sexual chemistry between Uncle and Niece just added to the things I did not like about this film. Shadow of a Doubt may be a masterpiece to film majors, but for an average moviegoer like myself, this film is no greater than any other - and definitely nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but lacks subtlety and suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago, I watched this film and liked it a lot more than when I just watched it again. I think this is because on second viewing, I noticed some plot problems that hindered me from scoring it higher. I should point out that IMDb users have placed the film in the top 250, so it's quite possible I am nitpicking, but I just thought the film could have been better--especially from a suspense point of view.Joseph Cotten plays a man who you think is a multiple murderer. Oddly, whether he is or not COULD have been held until the end of the film, but the truth of it was revealed about halfway into the film--and kind of took the wind out of the sails. While the only one who knew that he was a murderer was his niece, Teresa Wright, she kept this to herself--even when it seemed he was trying to kill her!! Now I know that Ms. Wright supposedly didn't want to upset her mother by announcing that he was a murderer, but after two attempts on her life and nothing said by Wright, you just have to assume she's an idiot! In addition, she did a lousy job of hiding it from Cotten--making her an obvious liability. I hate "suspense" movies that rely on the basic stupidity of a character in order to keep the film going! However, apart from these serious problems, the film STILL is pretty exciting--and the ending is very, very memorable. However I still think the film is a bit overrated.FYI--For those who love to spot Hitchcock, you see the back of his head and a bit of his side profile towards the beginning of the film on the train. He has in his hands one of the most stupendous Bridge hands imaginable--provided he can get control of the table.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less showy, more sinister</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The split opinion on "Shadow of a Doubt" is not surprising. Many video and DVD viewers watch this after being enveloped by the Hitchcock canon "Psycho," "Rear Window," and "Vertigo." Toss in "The Birds" even the underrated remake of "The Man Who Knew too Much," and you have five films with spectacular sequences (the shower murder, the assassination attempt in Royal Albert Hall, Jimmy Stewart's flashbulb defense) that pushed cinema in breathtaking directions. Of his best-loved films, "Shadow of Doubt" is his least showy: a character study of an all-American family facing (and denying) the presence of evil in their home. As so many have already noted, the performances are uniformly superb, allowing the central relationship between young Charlie and her mysterious Uncle Charlie to take on disconcerting edge rarely found in the cinema of 1943. Hitch asks the question: What would you do if you suspected a relative of serial murder? Like real life, his answers are frustrating and gray. To the many who find the film slack, I suggest they watch it again now that their expectations are lower. Like Hitch's best films, it improves with each viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a change from modern films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1943 Hitchcock film is really like nothing I've ever seen. It is devoid of twists or needlessly flashy film-making?it just tells a story from beginning to the end, and all the while keeps you very entertained with great acting, dialog and various indescribable nuances.The story revolves around a family in a small California town (interesting note: the movie was made in 1943 yet there's no mention of the war. I think this helps preserve the feeling of small town isolation). The oldest daughter named Charlie is bored with her family's ho-hum life. Then, UNCLE Charlie comes to town (played magnificently by Joseph Cotton) because he wants "to settle down", but to the viewer it seems like he's running away from something. He has a lot of cash and wants to open a bank account. Two men have been carefully following him since the beginning of the film. I'm not going to give away any more because it's pretty cool.What was so stunning about this movie is that we as modern movie enthusiasts expect a good movie to have something hidden, something up its sleeve. Well, this one doesn't, which is a fresh change for us modern types. A remake would be impossible--modern audiences would consider it "tame". However, the story excels within the confines of its time. Any remake would be a joke.The family is very interesting to observe. The little girl Anne almost steals the show. She's literate and unintentionally snobby?like a nine-year-old Ayn Rand. The father is kind of aloof and simple?he and his neighbor friend are constantly talking about the "science" of committing murders, which serves as a great backdrop to the suspense going on right under their noses.Thornton Wilder wrote it. This may have something to do with the story and dialog being so engaging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Hitch Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** Another fine movie done by the master. Joseph Cotten is superb as "Uncle Charlie" Oakley and Teresa Wright is excellent as well as "Little Charlie", his adoring niece. The thing that makes this movie so good is that Hitch makes it pretty obvious from the beginning that Cotten is a disturbed individual; however, he milks these feelings as long as he can by getting the audience to constantly believe that maybe Cotten is just a man who is a victim of extenuating circumstances. The turning point though is when Teresa Wright loses faith in her Uncle. One negative is Macdonald Carey. I didn't think that he performed as well as the rest of the cast. Although Wright had won an oscar for supporting actress, it didn't seem to me that she ever became really famous. I told some friends of mine of this movie and they all had heard of Cotten, but they hadn't heard of Wright. A couple of interesting things about this movie: 1) Hume Cronyn who was a comical character in the movie would continue to have an association with Hitch in all phases--he would help write the screenplay to Rope and he would appear in a couple of episodes in Hitch's TV series, 2) Cotten may have been in the most memorable Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode ever entitled "Breakdown". He would appear in several more episodes. This is another Hitch classic that is in my Hitch Top 10. Watch this movie, the ending is unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised to learn that Hitchcock valued this film above his other works. While not a bad film, "Shadow of a Doubt" is so devoid of the director's trademark suspense that I would strongly protest against its labelling as a "thriller".The plot trundles along nicely as Uncle Charlie, on the run, decides to lay low at his sister's house. However a succession of clues and an intervention by two mysterious police officers soon lead Charlie's niece (also Charlie) to begin to unravel the sinister truth behind his charming exterior.Joseph Cotten is fine as Uncle Charlie, convincing in his role as caring yet reclusive relative. However his portrayal of the murderous side of the character is hindered by a script which fails to impress upon the viewer any real sense of danger from the man. This affected my entire experience of the film, as I began not to care whether he was found out or not.Teresa Wright is also capable as Young Charlie, depicting strength and vulnerability.The rest of the cast is able, those in the family convincingly depicting an average American household (though the little girl annoyed me somewhat). I enjoyed the discussions about the perfect murder (foreshadowing the far superior "Rope") between Travers and Cronyn, however irrelevant they seemed. The theme of danger in an average life also appealed to me.Yet the film is let down by a poor script. The plot was convoluted, often veering erratically down pointless dead ends (the romance subplot between Young Charlie and the inspector seems particularly irrelevant). Believability was stretched as the film approached a disappointing anti-climax."Shadow of a Doubt" is in many ways well executed; yet it lacked the essential substance and tension to properly capture my attention.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS was Hitchcock's favorite film???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotten) is the "Merry Widow murderer". He romances widows and kills them for their money and jewelry. The police have no idea who he is but are hot on his trial. He visits his family in Santa Rosa CA to hide out till the heat is down. He has a cousin--young Charlotte "Charlie" Nrwton who was named after him. She loves her uncle completely...but slowly begins to discover that he's a killer and might kill her if he discovers she knows.I've seen this film multiple times over the years and its immense popularity totally escapes me. It is well-done, well-directed (of course)and captures the small town atmosphere convincingly...but it's just simply boring! The film moves VERY slowly and the dialogue is incredibly dull. It doesn't help that Cotten is pretty bad in one of the key roles (even Cotten admitted he was never a good actor). I saw it in a revival theatre years ago and the audience was laughing out loud when Cotten gave his little speech about hating widows so much! He's supposed to come across as evil there but the blank look on his face doesn't convey anything! The rest of the cast is good and Wright is exceptional but they can't do much with the dull dialogue and slow pace. Also there's a silly storyline about a psychic link between Cotten and Wright that is brought up...and nothing is done with it! Dull and pointless. This gets a three only for Wright and Alfred Hitchcock's great direction. See "Blue Velvet" if you want to see a good film about evil in a small town.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst Hitchcock - sucks in every respect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily the worst Hitchcock. One of the worst movies ever.Makes absolutely no sense eg. Uncle Charlie escapes to his sister's house where he's unknown. He sees an article about his crimes in the local paper and rips it out. There would be nothing to connect him otherwise. Charlie (the niece) then figures him out based on this story and a couple of other slips that he makes. (Years ago a friend ('L') began an extra-marital affair. To hide it, L crossed out the woman's name in 3-4 copies of his phone book. Incredibly, L's wife figured it out. For years L talked with some amazement about this detective work. The plot of this movie about as sharp.)Let's briefly consider the main plot: the "detectives" are after a serial killer; there are 2 suspects; one runs into an airplane propeller and dies. Do they say "Shame we couldn't question him." or "We need to focus on Charlie now."? Nope, they say "Case closed".These "detectives" allow at one point that there are people who can ID the killer via a photo. Do they just arrest the two suspects and photograph them? Or fly them back to the scene for ID? Or fly one of the witnesses out to see Uncle Charlie? They do not. Instead they come up with an elaborate ruse to photograph the house and this get a picture of Charlie.The dialogue is as stilted and tedious as any Thornton Wilder novel. It's much like a bad high school play, without the unintentional humor. Everyone overacts, Cotton more than most (and more than usual, if that's possible).It baffling that Hitchcock allowed this to be released; more amazing, he apparently considered it his favorite movie. We can only imagine that Wilder had some final say over the story or that AH himself was brain-dead throughout.It's painful to watch and an embarrassment to an otherwise fine director. There isn't a single good scene, subplot or piece of story. It's probably a 3/10 but because it's AH, it deserves 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Than A Shadow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock directed this well-remembered suspense tale that stars Teresa Wright as young Charlotte 'Charlie' Newton, who is a bored young woman living with her parents and sister, looking for excitement and finds it with the unexpected return of her beloved Uncle Charlie(played by Joseph Cotton). She begins to have doubts about him when he starts acting oddly, like being quite sharp with her for no reason, or cutting out news stories about a strangler of old women... It turns out her doubts may not be unfounded after all... Well acted film also has an amusing performance from Hume Cronyn as a murder mystery fan. Good story and suspense, though has lost some of its edge since the plot has become quite familiar, with little "doubt" as to its ultimate solution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All in all, It is a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hooked from the beginning when I read the plot, and the movie was built up well. Boy, I'm never good at pointing out the good things in the review. I just feel disappointed with the main character, Charlie. She is supposed to be the smartest girl from her school, but she makes countless stupid decisions. She is the definition of really book smart with absolutely no street smarts whatsoever. How many attempted murders does it take before you learn? He tries killing her by rigging the stairs to break and she realizes this, but she still runs right into the garage when the car is running even though she is perfectly aware that A) someone is trying to kill her and B) The door to the garage closes and locks on its own. But guess what! She decides to take a nice little stroll around the city at night with Charles following her around. But the worst of everything is stepping foot on that train. He's tried to kill you multiple times already. Use your brain! My other problem is the way she figured out that he was bad. Early in the movie, you could see how smart she was because she was putting some odd pieces together and realizing that something was not quite right. I wish the detectives had not come around so she could continue to piece this odd mystery together without their useless help. It would have made it a much better movie, in my honest opinion.After all these bad things, you must think I'm rating this a 1, but it is a good movie, but it could have been GREAT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joseph Cotten Is Terrific In Hitchcock's Slow Burner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Newton family receives a telegram that their uncle Charlie is coming to town to spend some time with them. His niece, whom is named after him suspects that he is not all he claims to be, when two detectives start questioning them.Rope, Saboteur and now Shadow of A Doubt. These are the only three films from the legendary Hitchcock that I have seen. Each one couldn't be more different. One is confined to one room, while another takes one character across America. Shadow of a Doubt tells the tale of family secrets and takes us to a small town. The film creates the tension needed to make one just uneasy enough to sit through the film. Shadow of a Doubt is considered one of Hitchcock's classic films and according to his daughter, his personal favourite. I found it to be rather brilliant at times, but testing at others. Joseph Cotten plays the character of uncle Charlie, who is downright frightening at times and made my enjoyment of the film more fulfilling. I won't go into detail about the plot of the film, I went in knowing nothing about it and appreciate it more because of that. The film doesn't depend on star power or any glamour, just the story and characters. The uncle Charlie character is one creepy guy who is portrayed brilliantly by Joseph Cotten. In one brilliant scene he has a monologue that is pretty harsh, even by today's standards and one simple turn of the head makes the scene all the more intense and creepy.The film doesn't reach the suspense levels of other films in his catalogue, I've seen bits and pieces of Rear Window, which was more suspenseful, but it does have the slow burner feel that builds up to something. You know some kind of confrontation is about to happen at the climax and your itching for it to happen the whole time. A few things did bother me though, even if they were intentional.The sexual tension between uncle and niece is just a bit much. It seemed that in every scene they were itching to go at each other. The constant talking about how much they have in common and how they are so alike is fine, until they start to hold each other and get close. It's uncomfortable. Second, the detective declaring his love for Charlie, totally out of place. To me there was not enough room for the two to grow as a romantic couple. Does she feel the same way? No, which is what made me a little bit happier, had she had the same feelings as him, I would have been upset with this film.Shadow of a Doubt is a well crafted thriller that doesn't mind taking it's time getting to where it wants to go. Subtle hints here and there adds to the mystery of what's going and is intriguing. It pulls the viewer into the web that is this story. It's not my favourite Hitchcock film, but rather one that I appreciate and respect the most, at least so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No doubt about it - One of Hitchcock's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only after many viewings am I able to fully appreciate this film. It improves each time. Part of the difficulty is its age - It looks like an old movie. It was made too early in Hitchcock's career. Had it come a decade later during his peak years, it would have been an easy fit with the rest of his 1950s masterpieces. What makes "Shadow of a Doubt" so special is the psychological dilemma, the differing viewpoints of each character, and the formal structure that adds balance and credibility. Hitchcock was so adept at drawing that fine line between good and evil. There are great subtle performances from the stars right down through the children. Though I'm not crazy about Joseph Cotten as a leading man, he does a fine job here. Fifteen years later, the role would have been a perfect fit for James Mason, Hitchcock's most suave villain (See "North by Northwest"). Filled with all the Hitchcock trademarks, like humor and suspense, "Shadow of a Doubt" is one of his finest films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shadows of "Hitchcock"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shadow of a doubt is the favorite movie of its famous director. As you may know, Hitch always puts a lot of himself and his life in his movies. SOAD is the most revealing example. During the time of the shooting, his own mother felt pretty sick and died during the war in England. It has been pretty though on him and this situation creates a dark emotion throughout the movie and reveals the DUALIITY of personality that Hitchcock always had. The kind of duality that makes him a real catholic gentleman in public, and on the other side, he loved to play tricks on his actors and crew that has a taste of sadism. That duality is omnipresent in the movie.For example the little girl Charlie and the uncle Charlie. Two dinners, two detectives, two scenes outside of a church, two double cognac bring at "Till two", two murder attempts on the child before the final sequence, etc. This duality is deeply rooted in the Hitchcock childhood. Anyway we must understand the duality of Hitchcock persona to deeply understand the duality of SOAD versus Hitchcock life!!!!!!! Great piece of work. He really puts is life on the screen!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shadow of a Doubt is an incredible film once again directed by Alfred Hitchcock, not to mention that he claims this is his favorite movie by himself. Shadow of a Doubt is well acted and again well put together. It's about a girl, Charlie, her Uncle Charlie (she was named after him) comes to visit her and her family. They love him to death, he's very generous, kind, and always giving them lavish gifts. But when Charlie starts to wonder why he is tearing up news papers and won't answer or take pictures by reporters, well, you know the saying "curiousity killed the cat"? That's the perfect sentence to sum up this film.It's original and exciting to watch. I would always again recommend this movie for any movie appreciator or Alfred Hitchcock fan. This is a true classic and an exciting thriller.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Murderer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Teresa Wright, innocent young woman, lives with her Betty Crocker, mom, Patricia Collinge and her bank clerk dad. He's a detective murder enthusiast, Henry Travers. Then there's Dad's creepy pal, Hume Cronvn, with various recipes for poison. A young bespectacled sister and goofy little brother complete the family circle. Indeed, Wright is just off the set from her Mrs. Miniver performance. The virginal attitudes, the very real naiveté of 1940's small town, middle class girlhood never to be seen again, contrasts with the, ah, insertion of evil.Uncle Charlie shows up, the beloved, world traveling, younger brother of weepy mom. Actually, he's on the lamb because his apparent wealth is accumulated after affairs with wealthy widows. Since these women had ended up in the morgue, the young detective, Macdonald Carey is on Joseph Cotton's trail. To get information, Carey woes Wright to get the goods on the Uncle. Hence, a confusing romance ensues, but can she give the detective information on her mother's favorite. It gets easier as Wright starts to get the picture.This is Hitch's first American production and he certainly seems to enjoy the more expensive production values. The town of Santa Rosa literally pulls all the stops for the fat man. In those days, folks lived a block from the town business center. This is the same area where today there are crumbling buildings and high crime rates. In the forties, the middle class lived there, wandering the streets, walking to the library, strolling to the bank, or the local bar without a look over their shoulders. But watch out! Joseph Cotton, an excellent strangler, may be behind you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Suspense Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently had the opportunity to see Alfred Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt" (1943) on a large screen at the Gene Siskel Film Center at 164 State Street in Chicago, IL. After seeing it previously only on a small TV screen, the viewing was fantastic.As most film and Hitchcock fans know, "Shadow of a Doubt" is the story of a small town girl who idolizes her uncle, (who she is named after) only to become disillusioned when he visits her and she soon realizes that he is not the wonderful uncle she thinks he is, but is in fact a cold-hearted murderer.The niece (Charlie or Charlotte) is well played by the lovely and talented Teresa Wright (she should have been nominated for an Academy Award for this role). She displays true innocence early in the film, only to turn against her uncle in the end.I did not like Joseph Cotton in the lead role as Uncle Charlie the first time I saw the film. However, recently seeing him on the big screen, I saw a true professional actor, doing a very good job playing a despicable character.Wright mother is played by the wonderful Patricia Collinge (who also played Wright's aunt in "The Little Foxes" (1941), and played her mother again in the forgotten classic, "Casanova Brown" (1944). She is truly in love with her brother Charlie and has no clue to his hidden awful secret.Henry Travers ("It's A Wonderful Life") plays Wright's father and Collinge's husband. Travers was 69 (born 1874) when the film was released. A little too old to play the father of Wright and two other small children, but he still is fun in the role.Hume Cronyn plays Travers quirky friend, Herbie. Together they relax after work, by describing ways they could "kill" each other and get away with it. Cronyn (a wonderful and underrated actor) nearly steals the film with his whimsical banter with Travers.MacDonald Carey plays a detective "hot' on Cotton's trail. He plays the "romantic" interest for Wright. Their romance is forced and not believable. He is the worst part of the film.The script by Thorton Wilder and Hitcock's wife Alma Reville has some minor problems.Who are these detectives (two on the East coast and two in Califonia) who are looking for Uncle Charlie? Are they local cops, the FBI? They are never identified.How could a forty-year old man (Uncle Charlie) who recently dated three women who later turned up dead, not have a single photograph of him for the detectives to see. No photos were ever taken by his socialite and wealthy girlfriends? How could Uncle Charlie give to his niece one of his victim's rings and not see that it is engraved with his victim's name on it? And then later get the ring back and instead of throwing it into the river, leaves it in his room for his niece to get it back? Why when the second suspect in the widow killings is accidentally killed at an airport in Maine, why do the detectives(Carey and partner) not continue to investigate Uncle Charlie? Does running from the police at an airport automatically mean you are a murderer? The film does hold up very well after over sixty-years. Wright and Hitchcock both called it their favorite film. However, Hitchcock never used Wright again in another of his feature films. He seemed to only cast blondes in his films during the 1950's when he made some of the best suspense films in history. (Wright did appear twice in 1964 on the television show "The Alfred Hitchcock Hour". She played a murderer in both episodes)***The film does made one small reference to World War II. When Wright (Charlie) is looking through old newspapers at the town's library, one headline mentions TOJO (a possible reference to the Japanese military dictator at the time) and the rest of the headline can not be made out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legendary Hitchcock's favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shadow of a Doubt" is a movie surrounded by a particularly special mystique a bit different from Alfred Hitchcock's other better known works. The source of such aura is the rumor that this film was the personal favorite of the Master of Suspense himself. Wheter this is true or not, it is not hard to believe that this flawless mixture of film noir and thriller could be really the favorite of the legendary British filmmaker, as it contains the theme and elements Hitchcock loved in the stories he put on film.Loosely based on a story by Gordon McDonell, the plot focuses on Charlotte "Charlie" Newton (Teresa Wright), a young high school girl tired of the monotony of her suburban life in Santa Rosa. One day, she receives a telegram announcing the visit of her favorite uncle, who is also nicknamed Charlie (Joseph Cotten). They have always had a special relationship but this time, a sinister shadow will cover their lives as the young Charlie will discover that her favorite uncle is probably a psychotic serial killer.The film contains many of the aspects of the suspense that Hitchcock mastered through the years. It is no mystery that Uncle Charlie is the murderer, as it is stated almost from the beginning that he is really the "Merry Widow Killer"; the suspense lays in the fact that the rest of the characters have no idea of what kind of man Charlie is. And even when the young Charlie begins to suspect, the love for her uncle clouds her vision.The Master of Suspense handles the tension between the two Charlies with excellent technique. Presented as equal but different at the same time; the two Charlies represent two extreme sides of human nature that coexist in modern society. The excellent performances of Cotten and Wright are of high importance for the success of this film, as the two opposite forces in the conflict.Joseph Cotten creates a haunting Uncle Charlie; as charming as deadly, his character may not be as well remembered as Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates, but he contains the same power as the memorable Motel owner. Teresa Wright also shines in her role, with a very emotional performance as the young girl who must face the reality of the world, a world that is scarier than she thought, with horrors a lot closer to home than she ever imagined."Shadow of a Doubt" plays with the idea of the "All-American Family" with subtle yet sharp irony, and moves into the dark side of the suburban society and its dubious morale. How can this apparently perfect and happy environment create a serial killer? Uncle Charlie is the absolute representation of evil, and Hitchcock made him not a stranger nor a foreigner, he made him a charming member of the typical American family.Hitchcock made the bold move of portraying the dark side of the U.S. society in a time when most American filmmakers where trying to offer happier tales as a escape from the grim reality of of World War II. However, the film has it's small dose of the witty dark humor always present in the master's works; one has to wonder if the characters of Charlie's father Joseph and his friend Herb Hawkins, as well as their morbid fascination with bizarre murders are not based on Hitchcock himself."Shadow of a Doubt" is one more of the perfect works of art the Master of Suspense's legacy. A movie filled with haunting images and witty social cometary, it truly deserves to be seen and be known for what it is, and not only, as the Master's favorite. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You should see it and then reflect on it the next day....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shadow of a Doubt (1943)What I was struck by was that it was made in 1943. You can see the soldiers here and there, but you really wouldn't know that a war and mass murder is going on in the world at large. World War II is not mentioned. Santa Rosa and America herself look so pristine, clean, and, if the scenes from the film are looked at from a qualitative point of view, a higher standard of living exists than at present. Who cares if the trains are pulled by steam engines. At least, there is a bloody train running from Santa Rosa to Frisco. Yes, the air is clean and the people look happier and treat each other decently....except of course, Uncle Charlie.Crazy Charlie (Joseph Cotten), the serial killer and part-time uncle, looks dapper as, I suspect, many serial killers do. And Teresa (Young Charlie) Wright...is she really a 25 year old playing a seventeen year old who has nothing but innocent bones in her body...well, until she discovers the truth about Uncle Charlie. When, half way through the movie, she moves from worshiping belief, to "a shadow of a doubt" and then to CONVICTION about Uncle Charlie, she too threatens murder. You can see it in her eyes! She tells her misogynist Uncle Charlie, to his face that she will kill him, if he doesn't leave town.Is this what happens to the innocence of America herself, confronted by Hitlerian madness, egged on by the arrogance of Japanese Imperial aggression? To be condemned and contaminated by mass murder? Alfred Hitchcock knew. He went to his grave with the answer, unless of course, you can figure it out from his work.By the way, a nice bed of naiveté Charlie's family makes for the detectives, who lie their way into the household to get their man. They lie about being government men, on a socially scientific expedition to find and interview and eventually, to publicly display a "typical American family" for America herself to see and revel in. After all, these are hard (WWII) times?only hinted at. Come on. It's 1943 when people see this film! Of course, the nice "g-men" get the co-operation they came for and of course they violate innocent trust WHILE missing their man. Innocent trust, you say? Think citizens, think : about your attitude to the current "Patriot Act".Advantages will be taken of the naive. This is Cotten-Charlie's message...and he's psychotic! Uncle Charlie takes advantage of naive, rich widows. He kills them and takes their money. Is he wrong? Depends. Are you a psychotic misogynist? What will happen to the innocence of America? Look at Young Charlie. What does she say? What does she do? And the minor subplot of the Young Charlie Newton's father (Henry Travers) and his friend (Hume Cronyn), reading mystery stories, while fantasizing perfect murders of their own, perfection to a tee. After all, what can a poor pop do? There's no television in 1943 Santa Rosa. One can only spend one's free-time talking to one's friends. Hell, the kids have no cell phones! And the mother, what does she do? Cook? How un-hip. She actually spends her labour time making meals from scratch and keeping the rather enormous house which accrues from the wages of her bank-clerk husband, tidy and pleasantly adorned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is too a good film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised so many commenters are picking on this film. I find it to be just as suspenseful as Hitchcock's other films. Teresa Wright is wonderful in this. I'm sorry that she died earlier this year, but now I will be checking out her other films. Hume Cronyn is also in this -- it was neat to see him as a young man. I also think Joseph Cotten (a favorite of mine from Gaslight, Portrait of Jennie, and I think Laura) is excellent. I'm used to seeing him as more of a hero, but here he plays a kind of villain (which isn't giving anything away as you know that from the beginning of the film.) The family is hilarious -- especially the bookish younger sister Anna. I love the way humor, drama, and a sense of horror are blended in this film. It's interesting to note that this was Hitchcock's personal favorite. I think those who find this film lacking should consider that -- what about this film as compared to his others, made this Hitchcock's favorite? It must have something they don't. I find the whole concept of the film intriguing. Not at all conventional, as some have commented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's favorite film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock said that Shadow of a Doubt was his favorite movie. There is one funny story about it, which is that after making great efforts to find the perfect house in Santa Rosa, California to use as the exterior of the family home, the people who owned it were so excited that they had the place painted - which wasn't what he wanted. Nevertheless, the house still stands in Santa Rosa today.This is a tense, successful film concerning Charles, a man who kills rich widows. To escape the police, Charles, known as the Merry Widow Killer, visits his sister and her family in a small town. This is one of Hitchcock's signatures, bringing danger to an unexpected place. His niece, Charlie (Charlotte) feels a special bond with him, which turns out to be dangerous for her as she soon realizes that her uncle isn't the smooth and charming man he pretends to be. Hitchcock believed that villains had to be attractive, not slimy - otherwise, how could they con anyone? So he chose handsome Joseph Cotten, who is excellent in his role. Theresa Wright is wonderful as the young niece, who is about to lose her innocence and learn a hard life lesson. There are several things I love about the film: One - the bizarre murder plots concocted by Henry Travers, who plays Wright's father, and his friend, played by Hume Cronyn. As they discuss abstract killings, there is a murderer in their midst. Another thing, much more subtle, demonstrates Hitchcock's tremendous knowledge of human beings. None of the little children want to sit next to Uncle Charlie. Pure spirits, children always know when someone isn't quite right.MacDonald Carey is one of the investigating detectives who has a lovely scene with Wright at the end of the film. Excellent character-driven film that focuses on the relationship between the two Charlies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's favorite film... and for good reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard plenty of good things about this film before I got it, and when I found out it was noir, one of my favorite genres, I naturally had to see it. It was a pleasant surprise. The film is interesting from the get-go, and is never really boring. The idea is very good, and the execution is great. The plot is excellent. The acting is great, particularly Joseph Cotten as Uncle Frank. The writing is excellent, very real and natural, particularly the two young children. I believed the characters, they felt real. As most of Hitchcock's films, I found this to be completely psychologically accurate. Like all of Hitchcock's films, it contains a good bit of suspense. One scene near the end nearly had me in hysterics with how intense it was. Hitchcock builds the mystery and lets it unfold in a manner similar to several of his other films. Though the ending felt somewhat abrupt and unsatisfying, this is still one of Hitchcock's best, in my opinion. A thoroughly great Hitchcock, worth watching for anyone who enjoys his films. I recommend this to fans of Hitchcock, thrillers in general and film noir. 8/10</fullReview>

And what was it to have her character named after her uncle?? Too confusing, little Charlie, big Charlie, Uncle Charlie, Young Charlie--why did they not give her a girls name for crying out loud?? But I did get a kick out of the performance of Edna May Wonacott, now she was hilarious for a kid actor!! But all in all, I did like this film, especially some of the cinematography--like the night shots of the town library. Those were some weird looking shots.</fullReview>

Her torment is not so much fear as conflicted emotions, and you feel them with her. Cotton is both charming and frightening. Aside: what game was Hitchcock playing, anyway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Favourite Falls Flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story of a man on the run is said to be Alfred Hitchcock's favourite of his own movies. Joseph Cotten is the man on the run. He plays a debonair and well-tailored ladies' man but behind the act, there is a different man. For Joseph Cotten, it is a change from his usual good guy roles. Theresa Wright is his devoted niece who finds her loyalty to her Uncle Charlie, her hero, gradually slipping away. The cast is rounded out by Henry Travers and Patricia Collonge as Theresa Wright's small town parents; Macdonald Carey as the police detective; Hume Cronyn as the father's buddy, who shares his passion for crime as a hobby; and Edna May Wannacott, a wonderful child actor, is the younger sister Anne, who is a delight each time she appears.Thornton Wilder's was Hitchcock's personal choice as writer of the script because Hitchcock enjoyed his book Our Town. However, Shadow of a Doubt lacked the wit or repartee of other movies. Both the script and the film-making itself seemed to lack Hitchcock's usual style. Hitchcock's movies have humour, entertaining sidebars, amusing supporting actors, and vignettes but this movie just seems to lack any resemblance to his usual standard of entertainment. Uncle Charlie's character is charming but totally heartless. The character attracts the loathing of the audience. The long takes that go up and downstairs at various points during the movie are the only recognizable Hitchcock touch. A disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of sinister suspense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a masterpiece of sinister suspense set in everyday life, a first rate example of what makes Hitchcock films work so well even when they abjure the usual dark shadows of Gothic thrillers. The wonderful script by Thornton Wilder is pure Americana, the perfect dialogue equivalent to Hitchcock's Norman Rockwell style tableaux of a happy American family in a small town untroubled by the violence that at that moment (WWII) threatened to destroy the world. Evil inevitably enters this paradise in the form of the genial misogynist Uncle Charlie, whose smile conceals a cesspool of malice and murderous intent towards rich widows, which then threatens to destroy his innocent and intuitive niece. I haven't seen this in so long I'll just have to rent it again, if only to see the extraordinary performance of Joseph Cotten, so chilling in its depiction of everyday evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More melodramatic than suspenseful but this is in my opinion one of Hitchcock's most absorbing films. Also one of his movies with stylized camera movements. Such as one the shot tightens up when Uncle Charlie tells something about the widows in the dinner table scene. And like typical Hitchcock, there's always some beautiful mobile framing every now and again in the movie. Was fascinating to see the transition to how jolly young Teresa Wright suddenly becomes stricken and perturbed when she finds out about Uncle Charles.The most frightening scene is the one in the end inside the train and its the final payoff of HOW Uncle Charles murders his victims and the kind of man he has really always been.I hear this is one of Hitchcock's underrated films and I wonder why one called NOTORIOUS inferior to this one. By the way it was the Merry Widow waltz and at the time of this movie, it needed no explanation.Yeah, I only send telegrams the normal way.Grade A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shadow of a Doubt, I think, is one of those film that can make you wondering if any one of us are alright. Joseph Cotten deliver one of the memorable performance of his career as Uncle Charlie, whose is very sinister person. Also, another memorable role is Theresa Wright, whose play young Charlie. Some may complain about the pacing of this film but I don't have any problem with that because the suspense is building very slowly, which is missing from Hollywood's manufacturing products. However, if one show me few frames from this film, I'm afraid that I won't recognize Hitchcock's style, which should make me ashamed of myself. I'm kind of disappointed that Cotten didn't get nominated for best actor because he did really great job. The atmosphere in this film is just flawless.Some people may not like the plot in this film, i.e. Cotten make some deposit at the bank but I doesn't find this distracting from my experience because it's truly great viewing. It is very seldom to see this film come and one should check it out when one does get the chance. I really like this film a lot. ****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen about 80% of all Hitchcock's films. This is indeed one of my favorites as it is also Hitchcock's favorite according to an interview with his daughter, Pat. It is the story of a small town American happy family(in Santa Rosa, CA)----nearly destroyed by the evilness of one member. It is a slick story with a lot of tension and suspense. The characters are most likable with an extraordinary cast. Joseph Cotten is at his best as the seemingly devoted Uncle Charlie that hides an evil secret. Teresa Wright is most effective as the intelligent but unaware niece in this "average" American Family. She soon becomes a threat to Cotten's character and thus is in jeopardy herself. The "murder" games between the characters played by Hume Cronyn and Joseph Newton add hilarity and a bit of irony to the plot. The entire family's characters are portrayed with ease without over acting. As Alfred Hitchcock put it when remarking about this movie "...brought murder and violence back into the home,where it rightfully belongs."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Theresa Wright's character universe is cosy,harmless and safe.Her family is prepossessing.In a nutshell,her little town is some kind of paradise on earth where evil can't reach.Enter Uncle Charlie.See how Hitchcock introduces him:when the train enters the station,a black smoke signals an impending threat.(the director will use this technique again in "the birds":when Jessica Tandy comes back from the farm,after discovering a dead body,a black smoke is coming out of the exhaust pipe) So,as Alice,the hero?ne will discover the darker side of the mirror.Once proud of her beloved uncle,she becomes suspicious.In the most famous scene of the movie,she discovers her hero's misanthropy,who thinks the world is a big pigpen,where greedy women are staking their preys.A lot of people said (among them François Truffaut)that Hitchcock spoke through Charlie's voice.Some kind of self-portrait!What puzzles and bewilders us is the way the great Master manipulates us,making us almost side with Charlie.Then horror grows ever greater when the wicked uncle tries to do away with his niece who has discovered he's a serial killer.The family's attitude is amazing:they do not seem to notice,they act as if they do not care,because Charlie is so handsome and charismatic.At the end of the movie,the dialogue almost disappear between the two leads,but the looks tell it all.I will not spoil the ending,I will content myself with saying it's ambiguous,and certainly not a happy one in the Hitchcock vein.Later,David Lynch will try to update "shadow" with his "blue velvet":the innocence versus the wrong side of town.But Hitchcock had already achieved all that.Because,like the very few true creators of the seven art,he was not born to follow but,but to pioneer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite Hitchcock movie. Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright were both excellent, and unlike other reviewers, I never had a problem with the movie's pace. But I think what makes this movie so creepy, and in a Hitchcockian way, so subversive, is the juxtaposition of the image of sunny, happy small-town America and insensate, predatory violence. I'm no film historian, so I can't comment on war-time mentality or place this all in context. I also don't think Hitchcock was slamming us with any specific social criticism. It's just a shadow of a doubt about human nature, and what we believe about others. And that subtlety is why it's such an effective film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>JOSEPH COTTEN STILL SCARES ME...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... I was never a Joseph Cotten fan until I saw him as Uncle Charlie in "Shadow of a Doubt", a fine movie that stands the test of time. (As for his co-star, I was ALWAYS in love with Teresa Wright.) Cotten is true-ly terrifying. His low-key, controlled portrayal of a psychotic murderer, hiding out with "mostly" unsuspecting relatives, oozes dread and death. Hitchcock accomplishes this without gore, imaginations are much more detailed. Murder is a necessity for Uncle Charlie, one for which he feels nothing. Living in the "sane" world, he values no life, and I mean NO LIFE, but his own.This portrayal led me to other performances by Joseph Cotten. Nontheless, it took an adjustment to forget his "murderous" past. To show his range, I recommend "LOVE LETTERS" with Jennifer Jones. From murderer to lover, totally believable in both. Cotten adds greatly to this Cyrano/mystery story too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I find interesting about the film is the young woman's existential situation: she's alone in her knowledge of who her Uncle really is and what he's doing. Even the detectives leave town at some point, leaving her alone with someone who wants to kill her, and she's the only one who knows it. She feels she has to protect her family, especially her mother, from knowledge of who her Uncle really is. I find this interesting in light of the year: 1943. The middle of the war, and the reports of the horrible atrocities of both the Nazis and the Japanese POW camps, but particularly of the new nature of war itself that had come to be for the world. It's like it's all impacting on her generation, and her parents are too nice, too peaceable and part of a far more protected and homespun world unaware of the evil "out there" and under the surface lurking even in people they love. (And even the science of the Unconscious was coming to the fore as the world witnessed the evil human beings were capable of on a colossal scale, not as a sideshow or outcome of war, but rather as the result of central planning. Meantime, at the finish of that war would be the introduction of nuclear weapons -- a whole new scale of planned destruction and deliberate evil aimed at masses of humanity.)I find in Shadow of a Doubt all of this dawning on this generation that fought that war and had to take knowledge of a world quite different from their parents', and that is the central role I see of the character of Charlie, alone with her knowledge, and with the knowledge of her own danger, who must fight her own battles and rely only on her own insights, wits, and intelligence to do so, and not the experience of her parents -- they're not prepared to cope with the knowledge of that kind of evil.I once heard a comment about Humphrey Bogart as a movie hero by Alistair Cooke. He explained that the great film hero of the 30s was Leslie Howard. But when the war and the Nazis came about, Leslie Howard and his image did not seem someone who could cope with Nazis. They needed tougher heroes, people who seemingly could cope with such evil, maybe having had a taste of the darker side of the law themselves. And so, Humphrey Bogart became the new face of the hero (especially with Casablanca, 1942), the type of hero necessary for the new time, the new menace, the new enemy.Makes you wonder about films and heroes of today a little, doesn't it? What does, for example, The Matrix say about what menaces us now?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Lies Beneath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shadow Of a Doubt is Hitchcock's favorite of his more than fifty films. Many find this puzzling, since it's rather cool, light and detached, and has few really suspenseful set-pieces till near the end. The setting is prosaic,--a small California town in wartime--and though Hitch didn't generally go for thunderstorms and castles, he tended to set his films in glamorous, cosmopolitan locales, while this one is extremely bland. One half-expects Andy Hardy to turn up in his jalopy. It takes several viewings of this subtle, complex film to understand why Hitchcock chose to make it the way he did, and where he did. In the end, I'm inclined to agree with the director in so far as while this may not be my favorite Hitchcock, I can think of none better.The story revolves around an outwardly normal middle class American family whose eldest daughter, Charlie, is the most intelligent and imaginative member. She can hardly wait till her handsome, mysterious uncle, also named Charlie, will arrive for a visit. Uncle Charlie proves to be a charming, sophisticated fellow, and if not quite the knight in shining armor his niece imagined him to be, he manages to make a pretty big noise with his relatives and various of their friends. As things turn out, some lawmen are on the lookout for a fugitive psychopath known as "the merry widow murderer", who seduces and then kills wealthy women for their money and jewels. Since uncle Charlie happens to match certain of their criteria for this criminal, niece Charlie grows understandably suspicious. At first, niece Charlie regards the notion of her uncle as a murderer as ludicrous. Then uncle Charlie begins to drop hints that he may be not be quite so nice a fellow as he seems. There's no one for niece Charlie to turn to. Her father is distracted by fantasies of, oddly enough, murder, as he and neighbor Herbie read murder mysteries constantly, and dream of ever more efficient ways of killing someone; while her mother, Charlie's sister, is nervous and not, well, not a hundred percent. Patricia Collinge plays the part brilliantly, using her voice in such a way as to suggest someone in whom years of affectation have become normal, and who yet still cannot comfortably be herself. Niece Charlie's suspicions about her beloved uncle increase. She comes to understand, as we all must, that things are not as they appear. In such circumstances there's really no one to turn to but oneself. Most people are too self-absorbed to care, or are not interested in the finer points of psychology and behavior. What makes this all the more disturbing is that the people one loves the most are often the least reliable in their insights because they're so loving; when it comes to getting at the truth, any truth, one often has to go it on one's own. In a strange way, Shadow Of a Doubt is a coming of age tale masquerading as a murder mystery. It's that, too, and grandly entertaining, but Hitch and author Thornton Wilder seem to be probing deeper, into what it's like to become and be an adult, and how difficult this is in a world that cares only for appearances and impressions. In this regard, the movie is also a satire of the middle classes, with their hidden morbid traits and nervous afflictions no one wants to talk about. That the film came out in wartime gives it an added resonance. America was shielded from the war by two oceans, and though there were homefront hardships, they were minor when compared to the suffering in Europe and Asia. Yet for all this, we were never so safe as we imagined. Crimes were still committed; the darkness and complexity of humanity didn't vanish just because there was a war on. There are murderers here, in our very midst, Hitchcock and Wilder are telling us. Some of them might even be mass murderers, in a manner of speaking. They might even be members of our family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Shadow of a Doubt" is the quietest, most disturbing, and most curious of all of Hitchcock's films. Hitchcock may have put other movies together more tautly and more efficiently, but "Shadow" has a weird knack for tugging at your bones. Cotten's performance has a lot to do with this. I'm not sure that he was ever used more effectively than as the charming, hollow, unnervingly empty Uncle Charlie, a man who has given up on the world, and on morality, conscience, and compassion as well. There's a real creepiness to the character, and to the way Hitchcock lets darkness creep into the lovely small town where the film is set. (This aspect of the film reminded me, oddly but inescapably, of Lynch's "Blue Velvet," a comparison that I thought of as irrational until I happened to see another review which brought that film up as well. Apparently I'm not alone in feeling the connection.)Shots I love: the train carrying Charlie arriving in town, with the camera aimed unusually high to show the sky filling the sky with black smoke; Charlie approaching his welcoming family in a walk that begins in a limp and suddenly rejuvenates, vampirically filled with new energy; Cotten's famous speech to the camera, in close-up; Teresa Wright instinctively clutching her wrist as she speaks in defense of her uncle; Cotten and Wright at the diner in the "bad" part of town; and the final fadeout scene.As in "Blue Velvet," (although considerably less flamboyantly) something quite nasty is welling up in the subconscious of this film. It gains with repeated viewings and is well worth seeking out for a quiet, dark frisson.</fullReview>

But the movie is worth seeing at least twice, and you can't say that about a lot of movies. Teresa Wright is perfectly cast as Charlie who is named after her much-beloved Uncle Charlie, who played by Joseph Cotten. I did not know MacDonald Carey was in this movie but he's very good. I only knew him from whatever soap he was on. The movie has a lot going for it but I appreciated the small things in it - such as little sister Ann always reading, the next-door neighbor played by Hume Cronyn, who is obsessed with murder mysteries and there is a barmaid who speaks like she's on too many sedatives. Cotten and the soundtrack go a little overboard at times but overall this is a classic from Hitchcock and should be respected as such.</fullReview>

Few actors could portray Uncle Charlie's combination of charm and all-consuming evil as well as Cotten, and his performance, inexplicably snubbed at the Oscars, is the single greatest aspect of this fine film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie held my interest, but by the end I saw so many plot holes and implausibilities that it diminished my enjoyment of it. I won't include any spoilers, although some of this won't make complete sense unless you've seen the movie. Joseph Cotten's character, "Uncle Charlie," goes to spend time with his sister's family, apparently to get away from a couple of guys who are trying to hunt him down (why, is not immediately apparent). The drama begins when Charlie tries to get rid of a newspaper page containing a story about him. Problem is, only he knew it was about him. Nobody else would have connected it with him, and he must have known that. Two central characters then concoct an elaborate scheme, involving posing as reporters, to get a photograph of his face, when they could have just set up across the street with a telephoto lens (which I'm pretty sure they had circa 1940). For that matter, they could've simply walked up to him as soon as he came out the front door. There was no reason for the magazine scheme, except as a plot device, that leads to one of the main characters implausibly falling head over heels in love, with further complications ensuing. Eventually we learn that the plot involves some murders. At the end, everybody seems happy to leave things as they are, because the murderer is dead, but it would not have been that simple. There would have been issues to resolve about what was stolen from the victims. No honest police officer would just walk away and leave things as they stood, knowing about those outstanding issues. Well directed, with some nice camera work, and generally well acted. The kids are a little stiff, unsurprisingly, though Henry Travers is excellent in his supporting role as Joseph Newton. But the plot lets this movie down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**This review was written before I have seen Vertigo (1958), which I consider as Hitchcock's best, receiving full marks from me.Shadow Of A Doubt confirms my speculation that Hitchcock films can never reach the score of 10/10. As legendary as the Master of Suspense was, his pictures has never really hit the perfect note with me, but strangely he's still in the list of my Top 5 film-makers of all-time. I love all his films (especially Rear Window, and Psycho), but most of them are not serious heavyweights, or in other words, films that you have to be in the right frame of mind before viewing it. Shadow Of A Doubt is a typical Hitchcock feature, a mystery plot set in a small town that starts out like a lighted-hearted family show, but slowly becomes suspenseful.In the tradition of Dial M For Murder, and Rope, the villains are developed in such a manner that viewers tend to like them even though they are evil. Maybe that's what makes Hitchcock films so fascinating. There are engaging performances by the cast, with special mention given to Patricia Collinge (who plays the mother of the family). The ending is masterfully executed by Hitchcock, relying on close-up shots to make the 'struggle' sequence more frightening. This is said to be his favorite film, but it's by no means his best.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Slice of (sinister) Americana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shadow of a Doubt" is one of my favorite Hitchcock films, but it wasn't always so. The first time I saw it I was very surprised by the number of "leaps in narrative": 1. We are never shown Charles Oakley strangling his victims. 2. The initial connection between the Niece &amp; the Uncle is not made all that clear, or why he is coming to Santa Rosa. (By the way, her formal name is apparently Charlotte, although this is never mentioned in the film; I read it somewhere else). 3. It's never explained how the Uncle managed to accumulate such a vast amount of money so easily.(That was a lot of money in the 1940's!) 4. It seems silly for the Uncle to give his Niece a stolen ring from one of his victims. 5. The two detectives posing as reporters, and just inviting themselves in without being asked for any credentials, seemed a "bit of a stretch". 6. The too convenient plot involving two suspects, so that the Uncle could have an alibi. 7. We don't see the Uncle make his famous speech, so we aren't shown that supposed side of his personality. 8. And finally...how in the world would the Niece explain the Uncle's death in a satisfactory manner, without admitting the truth? And even if she could, wouldn't the news kill her mother anyway...?In any case...after multiple viewings you forget all that, and just concentrate on the interesting historical view of small town America of the 1940's, and the sharply etched characters. The whole cast is excellent and a wonder to watch. Intended to be a subtle reminder to the public that evil exists in the world, and has to be confronted and dealt with. Exactly the message that was needed in the middle of WWII!Trivia: Only the (Newton) house on McDonald Avenue, the railroad station, and the clock tower seen in downtown views still exist. Santa Rosa has changed completely in 60+ years...!Oh...one more thing: it could have used a better music score. Dimitri Tiomkin would later do a lot of good scores for Hitchcock, but unfortunately this was not one of them. Overly dramatic and somewhat tedious in places. Apparently, Hitchcock was actually trying to get Bernard Herrmann, but just could not for some reason. Now that would have been very, very interesting...!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow but strange Hitchcock film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of Hitchcock and having seen all his films this was a slow but wonderfully different style of his and one he used again later in his career. Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten were just terrific, along with Macdonald Carey and all the supporting cast. The suspense was certain not the blood and hacking type of say Psycho, it was more of a slow build-up type as in The Trouble with Harry and tell the story of terror even in a small town in America in your own home. The master of Suspense at his best I thought and although I have viewed it many, many times it still brings a thrill to me and this is what a good film should do no matter how many times you see it.

		<fullReview>This one isn't really my favorite by Hitch, but it is really good none the less. Had some pretty decent performances, yet the real star of this one is the story. I have never seen any other movie keep you interested while still being in the dark as to what has happened for so long. And I'm talking about what Uncle Charlie did. Hitchcock as always uses masterful direction cinematography, music, and sound to create a world of suspense. Should be on everybody's to see list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's quieter and more understated movies, but a charming and intriguing one. The suspense throughout is nicely measured, slowly and surely keeping you on the edge of your seat. Joseph Cotton is marvellously villanious as Uncle Charlie and Teresa Wright is great as younger niece Charlie. The supporting cast is fantastic too, especially the actress who plays percocious little Anne the bookworm and the actor who plays the father: the expressions on his face at various points in the movie are hilarious. All in all, not the most famous Hitchcock - but nevertheless one of the best, and can certainly hold its own against the master's more well-known works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another masterpiece from Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shadow of a Doubt" is a one of a kind film by Hitchcock. It separates itself from his standard formula, in one notable way. Rather than the usually theme of an ordinary man trapped in an extraordinary situation, Hitchcock presents the main character as a villain, something he did in only one other film, one of his most well known ones at that.A man living in the city (Joseph Cotten) comes to a small town to live with his sister and her family. His niece (Teresa Wright) feels she has an abnormally strong connection with him - in fact, there almost seems to be a sort of love interest between them, whether it be intentional or not. She slowly grows to realize that he is a serial killer, and the story builds from that."Shadow of a Doubt" shares the same technical and visual style that has made Hitchcock arguably the most important man ever to direct a movie. As usual, he is able to bring excellent performances from his actors, most notably Cotten, who is perfect as the evil yet likeable uncle, and Wright, the naive young girl who slowly catches on.The performance of Cotten is important because Hitchcock's films usually feature a character that the viewer can relate to. Cotten presents a character who, despite the fact that he is a serial killer, still makes the audience like him and sympathize with him. This is similar to "Psycho" and Anthony Perkins. "Shadow of a Doubt" succeeds in doing this because of three things - the excellent screenplay, Hitchcock's direction, and Cotten's performance.Despite the fact that this movie contains fewer great suspenseful action scenes than most Hitchcock movies, the storyline and the acting are as good as they have ever been. It succeeds in all of its fundamentals, and most Hitchcock buffs will rate it as one of his best.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely incredible!!!! I love Joseph Cotten in it. I think this role, Uncle Charlie, is his best role. It's not hard to believe that the Newtons love Uncle Charlie so much. He's so charming and loving...he couldn't even hurt a fly! But his niece, young Charlie, starts to suspect that's he's the "Merry Widow Murderer". At first, she doesn't want to believe it. But all the clues seem to add up. Is he, or isn't he a killer?"Shadow of a Doubt" is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies. It has a great cast featuring not only Joseph Cotten, but Teresa Wright, Henry Travers, and Patricia Collinge. If you've never seen this movie...you really should. It's one of those movies you cannot miss. This thriller gets a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This can be known as a Hitchcock masterpiece. Oscar-winner Teresa Wright is great in the part of Young Charlie. She's innocent and at times, naive. Should-be-an-Oscar-winner Joseph Cotten was incredible as Uncle Charlie. At times, you can love him because he is so sweet. At others, you could hate and fear and loathe him for things he does (or tries to do). Hitchcock is once again the master. He lets you see a lot, but not too much. There are always areas that you are left in the dark about. This should be one of those movies to stand the test of time. (It does very well.) I will always love this one. Watch for the Hitch on the train with a full house of cards in his hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** This contains SPOILERS ***I guess before people knew anything about sociopaths, it made sense to keep things quiet. So, perhaps this film is a time capsule of American culture in the 1940's. It is not an America that I've known all my life. My not being able to know if this is a bad script or an accurate reflection of our society back 70 years ago, makes me question how anyone can tell a movie's reality from the real reality.The other theme is the onset of war, as shown by headlines showing ToJo and seeing soldiers in the café's and bars. So, perhaps this is an allegory of our provincialism (everyone knows everyone's names) and niceness (people dropping by for dinner unannounced) being unknowing of the evil (Hitler/ToJo and Uncle Charlie) that lurks at our door. I was disappointed since it got 4 out of 4 stars on cable TV. Maybe it was a good movie "for its time" (that phrase is my knowing reference to the Bible which said Noah was a good man for his time ? implying that after the discovery of religion, there were better men: "Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time" ).It is strange to see the Freudian hand gestures of Uncle Charlie move in a strangling motion when he sees his too knowledgeable niece. And Uncle Charlie's speech about fat, rich women was pretty bad ? but (do I have to keep making explanations?) I guess it's similar to Jackie Gleason saying "One day, Alice, to the moon" being ignored for it anti-woman domestic violence.I'd say this is a period piece, and may be worthwhile in a way to understand the time and the director, but I would NOT recommend watching this in my era of 2014.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock himself said this was his favorite of all the movies he made. I certainly think it is right up there. There are so many things to recommend about this movie. First Joseph Cotten is perfect as the killer whom the audience can sympathize with. His dinner table speech about 'the money' is one of the most riveting monologues I've ever seen. The development of his relationship with the younger Charlie is also very compelling. It's genuinely sad to see her turn from adoration to confrontation with her namesake. The supporting cast is also more than up to par. Highly recommended, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has some great quotes about Uncle Charlie's outlook on life that are applicable to today's society:Uncle Charlie (while looking at an old picture with his niece Charlie): "Everybody was sweet and pretty then, Charlie. The whole world. A wonderful world. Not like the world today. Not like the world now. It was great to be young then."Uncle Charlie (while joking about embezzlement &amp; the bank president): "$40,000 is no joke. Not to him, I bet. It's a joke to me. The whole world's a joke to me."Uncle Charlie: "Women keep busy in towns like this. In the cities it's different. The cities are full of women. Middle aged widows. Husbands dead. Husbands who've spent their lives making fortunes. Working and working. Then they die and leave their money to their wives. Their silly wives. What do these wives do, these useless women? You see them in the hotels. The best hotels every day by the thousands. Drinking the money. Eating the money. Losing their money at bridge. Playing all day and all night. Smelling of money. Proud of their jewelry but of nothing else. Horrible, faded, fat, greedy women." Charlie: "But they're alive. They're human beings." Uncle Charlie: "Are they? Are they, Charlie? Are they human or are they fat, wheezing animals? Huh? What happens to animals when they get fat and too old?"Uncle Charlie: "How do you know what the world is like? Do you know the world's a fat sty? Do you know if you rip the fronts off houses you'd find swine? The world's a hell. What does it matter what happens in it?"Charlie: "He thought the world was a horrible place. Couldn't have been very happy ever. He didn't trust people. He seemed to hate them. Hated the whole world."In other words: Everybody's out to screw you, so you'd better screw them first. Isn't that what many people think today?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Hitchcock was a late bloomer, and even then he sometimes did some dreadful stuff. I just cannot fathom anyone who sees any consistency in his work, even the way he handles the camera."Rear Window" and "Vertigo" were masterpieces, novel cinematic narrative integrated into highly self-referential stories. I think in some way, they were the result of some happy accident and the peak of collaboration with his wife, who seems to have been the brains behind the narrative devices. Hitch seemed to have good visual intuition, novel ideas about who the camera was, and good production skills. But she was the genius.She's not much in evidence here. Instead we have the lazy Hitchcock, the one who relies on tension. But this time, it isn't something we know that the characters don't: its something both we and the main character know. Sure, there's a small town and a small town home with evil visiting. But its hardly enough to sustain a long form film. There's one cinematic stroke only, with the rest is an effect that simply doesn't work: the tune of a waltz. We actually see the dancers at the beginning and end, and we hear the tune repeatedly. But the dancing itself means nothing; its the WORDS to the song that are supposed to matter. But if you listen to them, they don't, even remotely. This reference through three filters ? dancers, to waltz music, to the words to the music, to a point in the plot ? isn't worthy of anyone.I'm going to recommend that you not watch this, because seeing any of Hitch's better films again would be better than seeing this one once.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have, you know what an agonizingly slow process it is. Well, that's exactly how I felt during the first 45 minutes of this film. Now, it eventually turns into a barely tolerable suspense thriller during the last hour but it could have been a shorter and tighter film if Hitchcock hadn't seen fit to try and put his audience to sleep during the first hour. This film is extremely talky and flatly photographed. In addition there are two rather annoying brat kids, one male and one female, who play no real part in the basic plot. Personally, IMHO, this film does nothing to deserve the praise that many reviewers on this forum have heaped upon it. I guess we watched this movie from vastly different perspectives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could have watched this in my college library, but I'd have to put up with sign language, so I'm glad it was on TV in the middle of the day. Basically Young Charlie (Teresa Wright) and her family, including Joseph Newton (It's a Wonderful Life's Henry Travers), Emma Newton (Patricia Collinge), Ann Newton (Edna May Wonacott) and Roger Newton (Charles Bates) are expecting their unseen-for-ages family member, Charles 'Uncle Charlie' Newton (Joseph Cotten). Everyone else is up in arms about Charles staying with the family, possibly for good, apart from Young Charlie who suspects Uncle Charlie (the two names being the same is intriguing) of being a "Widow Murderer", and she's right, it's obvious when he yells about looking at the newspaper, to read a story about him. Also starring Macdonald Carey as Det. Jack Graham, Hume Cronyn as Herbie Hawkins, Wallace Ford as Det. Fred Saunders and Hitchcock's cameo is the man on the train to Santa Rosa, playing cards. The highlight for me is when the two Charlies are on the train, and Charles tries to force Young Charlie off the train, but ends up falling off alone, with an oncoming train. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Story. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>there's no doubt that this was a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know that a movie is really good when you feel that you can't tell very much about it without giving anything away. "Shadow of a Doubt" is one such movie. Charlie (Joseph Cotten) is a man who goes to visit his relatives in Santa Rosa, California. He is so well respected by his relatives that they named their oldest daughter (Teresa Wright) Charlie. When Uncle Charlie first arrives, everything seems to be going very nicely and everyone is having a lot of fun. But then, Young Charlie begins to get suspicious.That's as much as I'm going to tell you about the plot, because I worry that any more information will give everything away. However, I will discuss some interesting aspects in the movie. For starters, duality. There are two Charlies, two bespectacled females, two trips to the train station, two trips to the restaurant, and even when Alfred Hitchcock makes his cameo, he is carrying a piece of luggage almost as big as he is. This all may have something to do with the idea that there are two sides to everything (which turns out to be an important aspect in this movie). Also, Santa Rosa looks like a town in a Norman Rockwell painting, but then, everything changes.In one scene, Young Charlie is trying to call people on the phone, but can't reach them. Each time they show her again, the scene is shot from a higher angle, as though she is sinking deeper into desperation.I guess that overall, the movie is about how Young Charlie is forced to grow out of her youthful impression of the "good old days", as represented by "The Merry Widow Waltz", played during a repeated scene of a grand ball. The words "merry widow" also play a role in the plot.That is all that I can tell you. Any more would definitely give away the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've read some of my other reviews for Alfred Hitchcock movies, you know I've been to trying to come up with a list of his top ten best. Let it be known that it has changed with my screening of "Shadow of a Doubt," a Hitchcock masterpiece of humor and suspense.Teresa Wright plays Young Charlie Newton, a pretty, vulnerable girl who thinks her family can be "reawakened," if you will, if her dear Uncle Charlie (played excellently by stage theater veteran Joseph Cotten) comes for a visit. He does, but there may be more to "dear old Uncle Charlie" than meets the eye, much more.If you're interested, I've finally completed my top ten Hitchcock films list. It reads: #10. "Rope"; #9. "Frenzy"; #8. "The Birds"; #7. (tie) both version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much"; 5. "Psycho"; 4. "Shadow of a Doubt"; 3. "Strangers on a Train"; 2. "Vertigo"; 1. "Rear Window."And once again, "Shadow of a Doubt" is definitely a film, along with those other Hitchcock masterpieces, to add to the favorites. Rated PG. 120 minutes. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film as usual started with a plot that will definitely look to be mysterious and you will never be able to judge what the film is going to tell you in the end. The Hitchcock thrilling element was definitely missing in the film and it was not able to generate that much of speculation at any point. This may be because the point when the film started to become thrilling in the end a little time was given to it to elaborate the thrills. In all it lacked the things which were present in vertigo or rear window. Every film cannot be good from a director and this one is an example. You ought to be a big Hitchcock fan in order to see this film. For a casual thrill and mystery lovers this is not for you."A onetime watch for Hitchcock fans only."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take Hitchcock. Get his list of movies in which he directed. You will notice that most of his movies have very similar premises, and characters dangle in similar situations in his movies. To plan the perfect murder, to get away with it, a man escaping from his past, the sentimental and ideological obstacles in the planning of a crime.Now, if you strip "Shadow of a Doubt" from the Hitchcockian themes, the story will be that of a TV novella with a hint of suspense. The admiration of young Theresa Wright to his uncle is anti-climatic and burns too slow. It lacks dynamics, red herrings, climaxes. It denies the power of possible shockers, endings, dialogs. To cope with one emotionally charming Hitch, with good character development, try "Rope".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have recently begun a Hitch-kick and was excited to watch what is commonly referred to as his favourite film - IMDb users also seem to hold it in similar esteem. But, for the life of me, I can't understand why. Firstly, I found the script and dialogue excruciating. Hitch was undoubtedly a master of the form and no one knew better than he about setting up small chunks of info that would come into play later, rewarding the discerning viewer; however, I sat through each tedious detail wondering when/how they'd become significant. Secondly, the pacing had none of Hitch's rhythm. Suspense would build and then and just hang there, unresolved. I felt tense the whole time, but not in suspense, just in discomfort. Finally, I didn't care about any of the characters. The only performances I felt drawn to were Joseph Cotten as the psychotic Uncle Charlie and Hume Cronyn as the eccentric Herbie Hawkins. I found myself either cheering for Charlie (not to be confused for the disconcerting sympathy Hitch creates for Norman Bates) or wishing Herb and Roger would continue discussing their paperback murder scenarios. And, honestly, did anyone else not find Patricia Collinge painful to watch? I enjoyed how the relationship between Uncle Charlie and Young Charlie deteriorated and, of course, the film itself was beautifully shot, but, beyond that, I feel this was quite the dud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many superlatives have been heaped on "Shadow Of A Doubt" that I feel kind of strange writing this ... However, I must say I was a trifle disappointed. There's, of course, no gainsaying the virtuosity of the performances, either of Joseph Cotten or of Teresa Wright, but somehow, at the end of it all, one was left with the feeling - "Was that all?" I don't want to say more, so as not to spoil the experience of those who are yet to see the film, but, personally speaking, I felt the film, on the whole, lacked the "punch" which classic film noir should possess. That, however, is a complaint I have with much of Hitchcock's work, be it "North By Northwest", or "The Paradine Case", or even "Rear Window". Notable exceptions, however, are, for example, "Spellbound", "Notorious" and the unforgettable "Psycho", and, in my view, "Shadow Of A Doubt", irrespective of how treasured it may have been to Hitchcock himself, does not fall in that class.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shadow maybe, substance? Forget it. This is what Englishman Alfred Hitchcock was doing in the war, Daddy, whilst other Englishmen were fielding bombs and bullets at home and on the battlefield and it may be more than coincidence that Hitchcock made several films with Cary Grant, another Englishman who preferred to do his fighting under the Kliegs rather than under fire. There are curious writing credits as well if anyone asks you. Mrs Hitchcock, natch, gets equal credit under her maiden name, Alma Reville - possibly where Bryan Forbes learned about nepotism - but it is the pairing of intellectual Thornton Wilder and New Yorker regular Sally Benson that intrigues, though whilst we COULD have had an amalgam of The Bridge of St Louis Rey and Meet Me In St Louis we have to settle for something far more pedestrian, our old friend the 'mysterious' stranger who may or may not be hiding a guilty secret. Joseph Cotton is a fine actor, exceptional when working with a real 'master' like Orson Welles rather than a faux imitation clad in the King's new clothes, and together with Teresa Wright he invests the film with what appeal it has. Luckily I just caught this on television so all I lost was a couple of hours of my time rather than hard cash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a movie made in 1943 SHADOW OF A DOUBT seems to lack period detail . The second world war was at its height with American troops landing in North Africa and leading the fight against the Japanese in the Pacific . Strangely these events are ignored in the narrative and unless I'm greatly mistaken I don't even think the war is referred to in any depth . Mind you Hitchcock had previously made a movie set around Nazi traitors in America ( As had several studios at the time )so I guess many movie makers just wanted to move onto conventional thrillers devoid of patriotic subtextWatching this movie today I'm in two minds about it . I found the " Uncle Charlie is a good guy " slightly overplayed as he gives presents to his family and they greatly receiving them without any questions as to where the money came from or where he got them from but I did remind myself that very few people ever look a gift horse in the mouth and human beings are often overwhelmed by successful people in the hope that this rubs off on them so I shouldn't criticise any characters in the movie as being too gullible . I also guess people in those days were a lot more trusting than in the cynical late 20th and 21st centuries At the end of the day SHADOW OF A DOUBT has the persuasive idea that people aren't who they always say they are and you shouldn't take people on trust , but is this actually groundbreaking enough to make it a classic thriller in the way NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is ? Despite this criticism at least Hitchcock cast character actor Joseph Cotton as Uncle Charlie . If it was remade today we'd have Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise all teeth and smiles and a very poor script</fullReview>
