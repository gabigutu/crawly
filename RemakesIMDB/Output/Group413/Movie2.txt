		<shortDescription>Yet another lesser TV version of film noir plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I noticed no one has commented on this somewhat slight TV version of Hitchcock's (one of his favorites)film noir SHADOW OF A DOUBT. This version is set in a southwestern town, rather than a small town near Los Angeles (though I think we supposed to believe it's supposed to be the Midwest.) The camera work is rather routine (it IS for TV), but tension does build in the plot. Robert Culp is a good choice for the Joseph Cotten role (tho his demeanor and facial appearance give him away faster than Mr. Cotton.) In the TV version the closest relative is his brother who is the sheriff. The Teresa Wright role is played by Tara Talboy (an actress who never had many credits-- perhaps she dropped out of the business.) Her younger brother is played by Leif Garrett in what must be one of his first roles. I saw this film when it was first shown and on a local TV station, many years later, when they ran TV movies on weekday afternoons, but I don't believe it's ever been on videocassette (&amp; certainly not on DVD.) I would probably record it (on VHS or DVD)if I saw it on a program schedule again, if only to compare it to SHADOW OF A DOUBT (which I have.)</fullReview>
