		<shortDescription>A disgrace to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason this movie sucked royally was not because it didn't have the potential to be a good movie it was mainly casting. I don't understand why mainstream Hollywood horror movies cast ridiculous people in roles that don't fit them. The casting of Rhodes was absolutely dumb considering Ving was in the Dawn of the dead remake so it confused everyone into thinking that he survived or something of that nature. Also, if you want a sure shot at ruining your movie just cast Nick Cannon in any part and he will say ridiculous lines like "by the power or gray skull" or some random curse word when he kills his hundredth zombie because apparently he is a super zombie killer as soon as the outbreak occurs. He was quite possibly the worst actor i have ever seen and i just don't understand why he was even cast. The same thing happened with Busta Rhymes in Halloween Resurrection when he said "Trick or Treat Motha F*@#*$." When these dumb lines were barked out by these no talented actors the entire movie lost all credibility in my eyes. Granted both of these movies are not that good but at least would have been watchable if these no talented ridiculous actors were cast. It is just a recipe for disaster with respect to a horror movie.Now for the movie itself, i literally feel like the only redeeming factor in the whole film was Mina Servari (excuse spelling if its wrong) because she was the only actor that i believed deserved credit. I think Ving was just looking for a quick pay check and the rest of the cast i don't think have any experience and thats all this was for them. I don't blame them for taking the roles because they probably didn't know this crap fest was going to be as bad as it was considering the success of the Zack Synder remake of Dawn of the Dead. The zombie's in this film must have been bitten by radioactive zombie spiders because they develop powers very similar to spider-man when they turn. My brother and I laughed out loud as the chaos happened because it was a mockery of any zombie film ever made.I also want to point out that i very rarely will comment on films because it is almost pointless, but this film was one of the biggest let downs in all of the movies I have ever seen. I am an avid Romero fan and this did nothing but make a disgrace of his life's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only it hadn't carried the name Day of the Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Miner, as a director, isn't bad. He directed my favorite entries in the Friday the 13th series, Halloween: H20, and Lake Placid. None of these movies are Oscar worthy, but they are all good, fun horror films. What he was thinking when he directed the Day of the Dead redux is beyond me.A small Colorado town is overrun with the living dead, following a flu like virus that has swept across the land. As soon as the virus kills someone, their skin immediately decays and they become superhuman beasts. These zombies don't just run (a modern zombie element which has caused a lot of controversy in recent years) they jump, shoot weapons, and somehow manage to crawl on walls and ceilings. At the forefront of this super-zombie apocalypse is Mena Suvari (who phoned in her part) and Nick Cannon (who should have) as well as a few other meaningless characters. People die, things explode, and an hour and a half of your life is wasted as you watch this deplorable film.Honestly, if this film had carried any moniker other than the classic Day of the Dead, I would have given it a bit higher of a rating. I'm thinking 3 or 4, mostly because some of the make-up fx are pretty nifty. Instead, the filmmakers decided to take everything Romero created and turn it on its head. Experimentation is a good thing, but not in this case. This should not be called a remake...or even a reimagining for that matter. It has nothing to do with the original film, aside that there are zombies involved and the military has a presence. I say, pull it from the shelves now, and send it out retitled. George Romero really shouldn't have to put up with this nonsense anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing Excuse For A Romero Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many of you, I got really excited when I heard about this film. After the incredibly good effort that was the Dawn of the Dead 2004 remake, this film is an extremely cheap attempt to cash in on the name. It's extremely important to keep in mind that this film it's not a remake as much as it's a by-the-numbers zombie/infected flick with a fancy name on it.The film stars Mena Suvari and has a short cameo by Ving Rhames. While I'll watch anything with Mena Suvari in it - even "Loser" - this is a stretch. While Suvari does a decent job with a flat, lifeless (no pun intended) script, the other actors are incredibly stiff, awkward and unconvincing. Rhames plays basically the same character he played in the Dawn of the Dead remake, although he only appears for the first 15 minutes or so.The film itself is extremely boring and the action and special effects are haphazard. I can honestly say that I've never felt so bored during an action sequence before. The "climax", if you can call it that, runs on for about 5 minutes more than it should. Even worse, the film doesn't even attempt to redeem itself by being a tad funny.. it tries, but fails with flying colors. The script is absolutely ridiculous, not even making relative sense in the world of the film.If you've ever wondered what "vegetarian" zombies eat, feel free to watch this movie. If you want to see a new spin on Romero, wait for Diary of the Dead to come out in wide release by the man himself. I'm giving this one a three for Mena Suvari alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director surely mustn't of been a big fan of this genre when he signed up for it. I just don't understand how somebody who has achieved the status of becoming a film director could end up spoiling a movie that could of been so good! OK, so i guess he wanted to take a different approach to the Zombie movie. Maybe add to Zach Schnyder's good effort with DAWN. But to make Zombies able to leap 20ft and walk on walls and ceilings. I mean really!!! What were you thinking?!?! You've well and truly messed up big time and done nothing for you career. I apologise for sounding a bit harsh but millions of fans of this DEAD franchise expected a lot better to say the least. I was gutted from the first twenty minutes. The casting was way bad too. Who in their right mind would have Mena Suvari as an Army Corporal?? Ving Rhames does his best. Make up and special effects were extremely mediocre as well. My advice, wait for Diary of the Dead. And see how a zombie flick is supposed to be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day of the Dead is set in a small Colorado town which has been quarantined by the US Military due to a flu like disease sweeping the town, assigned to her hometown army soldier Sarah (Mena Suvari) takes her mother to a medical facility set up to treat the townspeople a lot of whom seem to be suffering from the flu like symptoms. It's not long before the situation takes a turn for the worse though as those infected start to die &amp; come back as flesh eating zombies, Sarah leads a small group of survivors as they fight for their lives against hordes of flesh eating zombies &amp; try to escape to safety...Directed by Steve Miner I would imagine many horror fans will be horrified by Day of the Dead. Lets start at the beginning shall we? A filmmaker called George A. Romero made the ground breaking Night of the Living Dead (1968) which changed the face of horror films literally overnight, he then made one of the greatest films ever in it's sequel Dawn of the Dead (1978), then he made a brilliant third film in the trilogy called Day of the Dead (1985) before an OK fourth Land of the Dead (2005) &amp; more recently a fifth film in the series Diary of the Dead (2007). Right, Night of the Living Dead (1990) was remade to great effect, Dawn of the Dead (2004) was next to be remade to fun if unspectacular results &amp; Day of the Dead was initially given a sequel called Day of the Dead 2: Contagium (2005) which wasn't a sequel at all &amp; was terrible &amp; that brings us bang up to date with this Day of the Dead which is touted as a remake but in reality isn't anything of the sort. The script by Jeffrey Reddick is more akin to something that I would have expected to find on the sci-fi channel rather than a reworking or re-imagining of one of the greatest zombie films of all time, in fact George A. Romero isn't even mentioned during the opening credits which gives you some indication that this Day of the Dead is a million miles from his. Gone are the brilliant character's replaced with a almost entirely teenage cast with even the army soldiers are fresh faced teenage recruits, gone is the oppressive atmosphere, biting social commentary &amp; sense of gloom replaced with lots of 28 Days Later... (2002) shaky camera hyperactive shrieking zombies attacking from all angles as well as Resident Evil (2002) style genetically created virus's that infect a small town turning everyone into zombies &amp; gone is Tom Savini's ultra realistic gore &amp; zombie effects to be replaced with CGI blood splatters. Having said that if you take Day of the Dead on it's own terms then I don't think it's a bad way to pass 90 odd minutes at all, the character's are mostly likable &amp; good looking enough, although the gore doesn't compare to the original there's still a fair amount of blood, there's more action in this at the expense of story though &amp; above all I thought it was quite fun &amp; for what it is pretty entertaining. So shoot me.Director Miner did actually have a Hollywood career at one point with films such as Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981), Friday the 13th Part III (1982), Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998) &amp; Lake Placid (1999) to his credit, he does alright here &amp; despite some shaky camera moments Day of the Dead looks pretty good &amp; is competent if nothing else. While the gore isn't as good or as extensive as Romero's film there's a fair amount of blood, decapitated heads, rotting zombies, gory bites, a few severed limbs &amp; mutilated bodies on show. The special effects vary from good prosthetic make-up effects to poor CGI computer ones. Day of the Dead goes for action set-pieces rather than scares, tension &amp; atmosphere which won't please lovers of the original but there you go.With a supposed budget of about $18,000,000 Day of the Dead is well made but does have that slightly cheap made-for-video look about it, it looks OK but won't last long in your memory. Shot in Bulgaria to keep the cost down even more. The acting isn't great, it's alright &amp; the largely teenage cast are attractive enough. Having been in the Dawn of the Dead remake Ving Rhames also appears in this as a much toned down Captain Rhodes one of the few direct references to Romero's original, Nick Cannon is the obligatory rapper involved.Day of the Dead if under any other mundane title such as Virus of the Dead or Dead Rising or something that has nothing to do with Romero's original would stand a good chance of being a well liked fast paced zombie horror, unfortunately by saddling itself with the Day of the Dead name it made a rod for it's own back as it could never come anywhere near Romero's original. Taken for what it is I liked it, as a remake of one of the greatest zombie films ever it's a travesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait...Have we stooped so low?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid zombie film buff I feel sick to my stomach after watching an hour and a half of worthless film. Everyone associated with this production should truly feel uncomfortable with the direction of their careers. I knew it was going to be bad after a zombie scaled a hospital ceiling for no apparent reason other than being some type of crazy generation x zombie...not to mention zombies later on poking air conditioner ducts with crutches and floor sweepers (apparently not blessed with the gravity defying before mentioned wall crawling) in order to get at non zombie flesh crawling to safety.You have to wonder about the makeup of a person who sits down to write a script like this. Better yet those who read this nonsense and throw millions of dollars around in order to make sure it happens. Was it that they truly could not tell a difference between this script and dawn of the dead remake script. One being decent while the other, well, read my first paragraph...Simply put, this is pathetic. If anyone who took part in the production of this reads this, please look in the mirror and ask yourself was this the reason you got into film. Though you will always have the Day of the dead remake on your resume maybe its not too late to do something worthwhile and memorable...good luck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the case of this movie, re-making Day of the Dead means stealing the title and some character names.Its truly awful. There plot is non existent, the acting poor and the characters inconsistent. The zombies look quite good, but are more like rabid humans. This is one of those zombie movies that changes the characteristics of the zombies to suite the scenes. Mostly its just rabid, insane 28 days later type movements. Oh but they can sometimes walk on walls and ceilings (how? why?). Oh and listen to radios and understand what is being said. The Bub character is ridiculously used in the plot. One of the soldiers is infected, turns into a zombie, but they decide to keep him around and drive around with him in the car, because he might be useful. Thats right, they pile into the back seats and he is sat in the middle of them. Zombies throwing themselves at the car, everyone screaming, but the one I am sat next to? No problem! The final scenes are just ridiculous and I felt that at this point they had run out of ideas so they made it up as they went along. One line summed the whole movie up for me. They discovered that one of the scientists who worked on the project that started the virus has now become a zombie and is in the complex they are in. A colleague of his says 'If what you said about them retaining some of what they were is true, then we are so f*cked'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the only big mistake of that movie was to pretend to be the remake of a classic, when it was not. That must have disappointed and angered a lot of people.Actually "Day of the Dead" is a highly entertaining Zombie-Flick that delivers everything one expects: good trash, gore, humor and well-known main-actors who act, well, lets say "okay"...The story is not really important, as we saw it dozens of times (Virus, Transformation, Out of Control, group trying to escape,....and so on) and there were elements of "Resident Evil" and "28 Days/Weeks later" as the "life to death transformed" corpses behave the same hysterical way as the sickos from London, only that Americans must be way much hungrier as these zombies are feeding on flesh. And how....Anyway: "Day of the Dead" was fun, a little thrilling, entertaining and better than a lot of other genre-movies BUT somebody in the marketing-department blew it up by having the idea to sell it as a "Romero Remake".Some Zombie should bite this person....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watch this movie as in any way being connected to the Romero series of movies or even the remake of Dawn Of The Dead and you are heading down a one-way alley towards a wall spray-painted with "disappointment". Watch this movie, however, for the sake of seeing a decent little zombie flick and you should enjoy yourself. Is it in the same league as any of those just mentioned? Of course not. Is it the worst horror movie of the year? Not by a bloody, and I do mean bloody, long shot.The plot? The dead start problematically walking about with bad hunger pangs and a few survivors back up and back up until they find out the cause of the problem and also the fact that they must destroy as many zombies as possible before the film ends. Oh, and there's a zombie known as "Bud" (maybe not quite Bub but close enough) and an army member known as "Captain Rhodes" in at least two nods to the original movie (a film much maligned over the years but one that's also growing in the hearts of zombie fans worldwide, from what I've seen).The main points against this movie are the facts that we've seen much of it before, Mena Suvari is the least convincing soldier since my mother gave me a Barbie in a khaki skirt for Christmas and told me it was an Action Man (that's G.I. Joe for my American friends) and, at only 80 minutes long, it feels like little more than a taster for something that could/should have been even better. Also, there's a bit too much CG-blood for my taste.On the plus side, and it's not a universal view, I loved the non-stop action once things went all pear-shaped, the zombies new super-skills added to the tension and gave a new spin to an old stalwart and the blood was flowing quicker than the Mississippi on a really, really rainy day.Horror fans won't necessarily be scared by this but they WILL be entertained. Which, from a zombie movie, is sometimes all you need.See this if you like: Mena Suvari, Resident Evil, Nightmare City.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Romp Through the Land of the Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Film by Steve Miner. Now let's begin there. I honestly like Steve Miner. He's directed Soul Man, Friday the 13th parts 2 and 3, as well as producing the original and The Last House on the Left. That's not a bad resume. That aside, he hasn't done anything worth noting in about 20 years+. Screenplay is by Jeffrey Reddick who wrote all the Final Destination screenplays, so that can't be too bad right?Let's talk casting. Mena Suvari (American Beauty, Spun) Nick Cannon (Drumline) Michael Welch (Joan of Arcadia) AnnaLynne McCord (Made quite a splash on Nip/Tuck last year) Ian McNeice (HBO's Rome) Ving Rhames (Mission Impossible)Altogether not a bad looking cast.So that in mind, we start the film...We begin our journey on a lighter note typical of the '80s slasher flicks, in an abandoned barn in Leadville, Colorado. Full of candles and horny teenagers, and there's nothing wrong with that. One couple decides to explore the rather creepy barn.The movie actually starts out alright. Decent directing, acting, dialog if it keeps up like this, it might not be such a bad movie after all... but lets keep watching... where angels fear to tread...First lets discuss spider monkey zombies. Now we have become so accustomed to Romero's slow moving zombies that the atmosphere has been set in stone for the standard, but I see nothing wrong with trying new things in horror, in fact I long for it. Now this isn't the first time fast moving zombies have been done, but it was probably the best explained of the type out of the ones I've seen.The first few kills are fantastic, and holy the zombies were pretty scary, and in all honesty I haven't been scared of a zombie in a long time.But the show must go on, even if it goes on like spider monkey zombies on crack.If you want this to be just like the original, go watch the original. I have yet to read one decent complaint about the movie. The faces decaying rapidly through the change was really unique, I don't think I've ever seen that used before so I thought that was pretty cool.I actually enjoyed the movie for what it was. It had good pacing, took liberties, and took zombies into a new direction which is pretty hard to do these days. I've seen a lot worse. A whole lot worse. I love how the people who can't let go of the idea of walking zombies thinks walking zombies is more realistic, like any kind of zombie can be realistic. If this movie had not been called Day of the Dead I guarantee it would have been better received, because die hard fans expected it to stay true to Romero's zombie mythology which it did not do.And though this was not adhering to Romero's preconceptions, it had a few things going for it. It brought it's own ideas to the table which worked. Such as the people going blank just before turning. As the last particle in the blood stream switched them on. I thought that was rather realistic, and a nice little piece of detail. The action was fairly non stop with good pacing. And in all honesty it was far more enjoyable than Diary of the Dead. A movie that turned out to be a huge disappointment, as was Argento's latest installment, "Mother of Tears". The two horror masters have taught a new generation well it seems.Now not to downplay Romero, the original Night of the Living Dead is a classic that will likely never be topped. And the mood of the original Dawn of the Dead is intensely scary, but for a direct to video movie it was pretty good.Now the idea of "When there's no room in hell, the dead will walk the earth", was never intended to be true. It is the religious reasoning to unreasonable things. But we also must conclude that there is a scientific explanation as well, and zombie movies these days attempt to take the genre in a direction of the more realistic explanation.And it isn't specific to the horror genre either. We see how it worked for Ang Lee's Hulk and Nolan's Batman, we must be able to appreciate it here as well.For all the differences between this and Romero, the one that stands out the most in my mind is the lack of political and philosophical importance which Romero is famous for including in his films. And while I respect that in a film, though this remake lacked that angle entirely, it was at least enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's with the running? And now with the jumping and wall crawling? Okay so everyone says it's bad, but it's not that bad. It's just a zombie movie. I laughed a couple of times, and rolled my eyes a couple of times. Wasn't really scared though. There's no real looming claustrophobic terror there. It's more like the shock violence of 28 days later and 28 weeks later, that mixed some Aliens knock off, and strangely enough Scary Movie. The zombie effects are OK, bit like an episode of Buffy, and then there's the film effects like the beginning of Dawn of the Dead. It's no way as good as the new Dawn of the Dead, and is a bit of a let down, but it's just a zombie movie. It's strait to DVD, but I'd wait for the sales.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Like Romero and Cartoonish, but Still Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other reviewers are absolutely correct when they say this flick has nothing to do with any of the George Romero movies, and it's not exactly honest to use the name of one of those films. The only things in common are the names of some of the characters (including the best-known zombie from Romero's original) and the military theme, albeit vaguely so.Acting? It's OK. Nothing special. Special effects? Variable; some are good, some are not so good. Plot? Fuggedaboutit; zombies eat people, people blow up zombies, and that's about the extent of it. Turn off your brain for this one.While Miner's "remake" has none of the style or finesse of the Romero films, it's still an enjoyable enough zombie action shoot-'em-up and watch the heads fly movie. If you're looking for a Romero-like movie, pass this by. If you've got an hour and a half to kill and enjoy a video nasty now and again, you might like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remake of George Romero's original "Day of the Dead (1985)"? no way! How could you. Well I'll admit, I didn't mind Steve Miner's superfluously clichéd straight-to-DVD b-grade take, but it's far from a traditional scene by scene/scenario remake with the film only sharing the same title (even though most of the zombie action centres around night time), featuring zombies (who bestow very impressive psychical abilities like sprinting, leaping and thinking) and having a character named Captain Rhodes (played by the commanding Ving Rhames in nothing more than a support role). Really that's it, but also shares some common similarities to Romero's 1973 'The Crazies' (which a remake is on the horizon), as it features the US army posting-guard in a virus-infected small town turning the locals into blood crazy zombies. I don't seem to share much of the hate towards it (maybe hearing a lot bad things before hand to work in my favour as I didn't have expectations for it), although I agree it does have some dumb plot devices (mainly centring that of certain zombie soldier, but is it any worse than the 'Bub' creation in the original film?), but despite that and its formulaic patterns. I remained easily engrossed.The talented Meni Suvari is agreeably sincere in the central role, but does feel a little miss-cast. Her turn is better than what the stereotypically thin material (and there's no social commentary here) and lazy script ("It's complicated") offers up. The performances are mediocre at best, but some do standout more than others like Nick Cannon as a macho gun-tooting soldier with a smart attitude, Stark Sands as the clumsy private and Ian McNeice as the town's radio DJ. As for Ving Rhames, he's wasted in what ends up as a nothing part for such an infamous character.Director Steve Miner's orthodox, if tight handling is broken up by kinetic editing; flash camera tilts that keep on the move and jerky action placement (where surprisingly random stages manage to hold a certain amount of chaotic tension). At least the story gets right into it and at only 80 minutes it doesn't seem to sag much? well towards the end its persistent style wears thin and the ending was feebly done. Now the blood-soaked gore? naming its self under day wasn't good. While having moments of bloody carnage and some decent make-up FX, it's rather watered-down with over-the-top CGI taking over the show. The CGI wasn't bad, but it's no substitute for latex.Sure it doesn't come close to the 'Dead' franchise (and as it stands it better off as a stand-alone), but for cheap, quick brainless entertainment it's adequately done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is just plain bad, remake or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I started watching this movie I was a tad worried, it being a remake of one of my favourite zombie movies of all time, however, I found myself kinda enjoying it. That is, until the zombies came out to play. Really, what were the cast and crew thinking when they were making this? Nothing was done well, even the presence of Mena Suvari could not save the movie from the dregs of shoddiness. Bad CGI, wooden acting, zombies with super-human abilities, a lazy script and clichéd characters all contribute to make this "remake" a mess. I mention remake that way because it bears very little similarity to George A. Romero's dark, violent, claustrophobic 1985 film. The nods to the original include character's names, one line spoken by the main character and the last 20 minutes being set in an underground bunker.Day of the Dead opens with four teenagers in the woods doing what any teen in a horror movie would be doing. Meanwhile, the army have got the city quarantined due to a flu outbreak (although we know it is so much more than that). Corporal Sarah Bowman (Mena Suvari) is put in charge of three younger soldiers (although one disappears after a minute introduction). She takes one of the them, Bub (Stark Sands) to pick up her sick mother and take her to the local medical centre. Along for the ride is her younger brother Trevor (Michael Welch) and his girl Nina (AnnaLynne McCord). When they arrive at the hospital, all hell breaks loose when the virus is unleashed and turns most of the town into zombies. From here on the movie is a standard action/horror flick with the survivors going from one place to another trying to find shelter.First things first, the zombies in this film are stupid creations. I do not know who thought that zombies should be able to not only run, but climb walls and ceilings, jump out of two-story windows without damage, drive cars and shoot machine guns. These were like super-zombies that for some reason decayed massively when they turned, but lost no strength. No explanation was given for these zombies except for the fact it was a biochemical weapon (surprise). Not only were the undead unbelievable, but they were CGI...and bad CGI at that. I have never seen so much digital blood and gore, it was poor and only added to the straight-to-DVD feel. The entire cast were bad, Mena Suvari looked like she just needed the money as her performance was dull and by-the-numbers. Nick Cannon should never be allowed to act, but he was not assisted by the dumb script with some appalling one-liners ("by the power of grey skull"?) and rather confusing scenes of civilians becoming master gunman in mere seconds.Basically, this is a bad movie whether you consider it a remake of Romero's film or a standalone zombie flick. It is not even "so bad it's funny," it is just bad. Sure, it is not the worst movie ever made and it is fast paced enough to never become boring, but there are so many other zombie movies out there that Steve Miner's Day of the Dead should be at the bottom of the need-to-see list.?/5</fullReview>

Instead of a small unit of military men and scientists trapped in an underground bunker occasionally testing on zombies we have a small town turning into zombies by some weird virus. However as bizarre as the dead coming back to life is it's nothing compared to the dead climbing on ceilings upside down and running about and leaping 20-30 feet in a single bound all done with the brilliance of a "my first cgi kit" seriously the cgi in this film is awful. If you can't do it well then don't do it! the gore is very poor indeed and the casting is incredibly poor with Danny Cannon stopping just short of saying fo'shizzle at the end of every sentence because he's a bad ass gangsta pimp army man. this is nothing short of an abortion of a film and should be ignored by all fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Really A Remake . Not Really Great Either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my review of the original DAY OF THE DEAD I suggested if there was a better screenplay and better actors it would have been a very good film . As it stood it was the least of George A Romero's zombie trilogy . I didn't know that there had been a remake until it appeared on tonight's schedule on one of the minor ITV channels so I checked it out on this page and was pleased to see its budget was quoted as being 18 million dollars , along with a cast featuring actors I'd seen in other movies . Certainly this made me optimistic that this version - if not surpassing the original in every field - would at least have improved production standards One warning sign appeared at the opening credits . " Produced by Boaz Davidson " a man responsible for bringing such disasters to cable TV stations and DVD stores as CROCODILE 2:DEATH SWAMP and SHARK ATTACK 3 . This didn't look too promising , especially when you don't see the name of George A Remero appear . Early in to the film something else became painfully clear and that is it doesn't sit anywhere in the continuity of the DEAD universe . The original film had the entire human race facing its ;last days as the zombies outnumbered them 400,000 to every human . Here the movie starts with the National Guard quarantining an area of Colorado . I had thought maybe we'd be watching something similar to THE CRAZIES but the more the story continues the more you realise that Romero's subversive and nihilistic hand hasn't touched the film and is a straight forward zombie horror Taken on its own terms then DAY OF THE DEAD isn't too bad but neither is it great . Danny Boyle was accused of ripping off the original DAY OF THE DEAD with 28 DAYS LATER and since then horror movie producers have returned the favour by making every zombie run faster than Usain Bolt on steroids . The ones seen here can also jump around like Carl Lewis which makes them extremely formidable foes for the humans to battle . The film works best when the people at the hospital become zombified and attack the humans . Watching this happen is similar to watching the alluded to scenes of 28 DAYS LATER when Jim lies in a coma . Unfortunately - and perhaps understandably - the film is unable to keep up this pace and just becomes a long sequence of " How are our heroes going to get out of this one ? " So in conclusion DAY OF HE DEAD isn't so terrible but isn't great either . Romero's lack of involvement is very much a mixed blessing . He's not a great director but it he is a very good ideas man and one had wished he could have contributed to the screenplay at least . As it stands this isn't a remake , or even a reworking of it , and anyone coming to it thinking it has something to do with the DEAD trilogy might feel a little bit disappointed not to mention cheated</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A zombie virus, which signs are flu-like symptoms leading to severe nose bleeds with those infected having worm-like organisms which attack the brain cells(..created by biological scientists for the military), is spreading like wildfire through a little town in Colorado, and a small band of immune survivors try to outlast the raging, leaping, balletic hordes in pursuit of fresh meat.Military soldier Sarah Bowman(Mena Suvari, who deserves better avenues for her talent)must find a way, along with fellow soldiers Salazar(Nick Cannon, the stereotypical black dude speaking gangsta and hip-hop, so that this horror film could somehow pull in the African American demographic)and amiable vegetarian Bud(Stark Sands), to escape the town hospital littered with zombies attacking their family members and medical personnel. While bodies pile up and the zombies feast feverishly, Sarah's brother Trevor(Michael Welch)and his hottie Nina(AnnaLynne McCord)find a radio station with the massive DJ(Ian McNeice), and a married couple, Mr and Mrs Leither(Robert Rais &amp; Christa Campbell)holed up inside. Attempting to contact anyone across the airwaves, Trevor and Nina find a bloody napkin meaning that someone inside the station with them is infected with the virus. Sarah, Salazar &amp; Bud, along with the sneaky, untrustworthy Dr. Logan(Matt Rippy)who might have knowledge on the cause of the zombie outbreak, will flee into the streets from the hospital in the hopes of finding a vehicle to drive..Logan informs the crew that he arrived in a taxi, lying because he actually has an SUV(..for which he drives off in leaving his mates to fight off a group of zombies coming straight at them). Behind the wheel of a jeep the three will appropriately hear Trevor's cries across the radio..if they are to make it through the night, they must find shelter, with one appropriately located in an abandoned Nike factory, which might just hold a secret facility for certain scientific personnel studying a biological weapon.Not a remake in the slightest to Romero's film, Miner's uninspired, cliché-ridden zombie film lacks any depth whatsoever. Much of the bloody carnage happens hidden from the viewer. If a victim is attacked, zombies form a collective group over his/her body where we can not see the flesh eating. This particular film is heavily dependent on CGI effects which often fail to convince, and certainly lack the quality of Savini and Nicotero's make-up grue. The sequences which were the most groan-inducing to me were when Molotov cocktails were used to set fire to them. Many of the scenes where bullet-fire destroy zombie skulls CGI fails to generate the same shock value the squibs have on exploding heads and torsos in Savini's gore effects. To be honest, Miner's film, like "Resident Evil:Extinction" will find a nice home on the Sci-fi channel where these kinds of films are made for cable all the time. I can see why this film never got a wider release..it simply fails to present anything worth noting. I think the only audience, a forgiving breed who love their sub-genre faithfully, this might find are the zombie fans. Ving Rhames is wasted as Captain Rhodes, although he gets some "zombie time". Stark Sands tries hard with Bud, somewhat modeled after Bub from the original Romero film, but this film fails to generate in that respect as well. Miner has some moments, particularly the hospital slaughter where the zombie go on a rampage, and Suvari tries, but this film is simply a failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate remakes. I hate the talk of remakes. I don't think anyone should do a remake unless they stick to the original story and double the original budget...and leave the computer effects out.Not that this is really a remake as it has nothing to do with the original, with the exception of zombies and the docile zombie Bud/Bub. This could have done very well on it's own, not really needing to associate itself with the superior original. I usually rant and rave against remakes, but i actually liked this one. I just mentally removed the fact that it was a remake of the kick-a** original, sat back and enjoyed it for what it was...a low budget zombie flick. And you have to remember, Land of the Dead was pretty craptacular, so even Romero seems to have lost his edge...probably some years ago.I have to address the key issue with the Humvee though. Anyone in the military would know that in a civilian setting, if you left your vehicle, you would padlock the steering wheel if you had to leave it. Seeing as you don't need a key to start it, anyone could take it. Also, if these guys are in the Army, the hats are wrong (berets) as are the t-shirts (brown not black,black is Air Force). I could go on because military inconsistencies really bother me, but I leave it with the prior two.While the hyper speed freak zombie creatures are so popular at the moment, I still don't like them. Why do they need to crawl walls and super jump? How does a virus change the human form so drastically that this is possible? Things like this really bother me. Logic people, logic! Negatives aside, I still like this movie. The acting wasn't all that bad for this caliber of film. I didn't think the script was too shoddy either, certainly there is far worse. I really enjoyed the F/X because of the use of REAL latex, not CGI garbage. There was some CGI, but it was far better than usually used in this caliber of film.Go into this with no connection to the original and you will enjoy it. Eventually someone will come to the rescue of the zombie genre and right things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i am one of the most forgiving viewers when it comes to horror, i actually like really bad films. however, when a film tries so hard to be serious, but winds up being one of the most ridiculously awful, messy pieces of garbage ever committed to film, i have to give it 1 star! why?, no WHY? was mena suvari and ring rhames in this? how did that even come about? it defies all belief, just like zombies running up walls and ceilings! the dialogue is a joke. for example (in one scene involving the "friendly zombie" bud.. (anyone who had even seen the original day of the dead (which so happen to be my all time favourite horror film btw!), will know his name was bub! not bud!) anyway...nick's character: "why is thriller over here not trying to eat us?" pointing at the "friendly zombie" sat next to him in the jeepmena's character "he's a vegetarian"!!!OK, that is not even a joke, it's a serious line not played for laughs, as earlier that character told mena he is in fact a vegetarian, and if that was meant as a joke, the direction was SO bad it certainly didn't come across that way. i can honestly say there is not a single redeeming feature with this film, not one. again, not usually my style or place to say, but in this case, i really hope steve minor is never allowed near a film set again. as for the producers. with such turd-shaped gems as creepshow 3, day of the dead 2 and now this piece of garbage under their belts. i hope they come to their senses and realise they should NEVER, EVER attempt to produce a film again. it was like some bad 80s US soap with zombies.. laughable! i'm not gonna waste any more time talking about it.

		<shortDescription>What's Romero got to do with anything?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombie movies are more popular than ever since the beginning of the new Millennium, and we particularly notice an undeniable revival of George A. Romero's legendary trilogy of the dead. The Man himself released two more genuine sequels to his own franchise ("Land of the Dead" and "Diary of the Dead", which can't live up to the older movies but are still very much worth checking out) and no less than two of the three original classics already received modern makeovers. Actually, they aren't prototypic remakes to be honest. Zack Snyder added a lot of personalized style and ideas to his interpretation of "Dawn of the Dead" in 2004 and, well, to link this straight-to-video reworking of "Day of the Dead" to Romero's legacy would be blasphemous and a complete disgrace. This isn't a remake of the brilliant 80's milestone, but a mundane and inconspicuous splatter B-movie that simply needed an eye-catching gimmick in order not to dive into oblivion straight away. So what they did here was steal the title and borrow a couple of story elements from Romero's film (like the obedient zombie and the underground laboratory), but otherwise this is just a lame and uninspired zombie movie like there are thirteen in a dozen nowadays. Nearly the entire population of a small Colorado town overnight becomes infected with a hideous virus that causes their bodies to rapidly decompose and inflicts an insatiable hunger for human flesh. The army is called in and young soldier Sarah Bowman, who's from around the area, discovers a link with scientific experiments that took place in an abandoned factory nearby. There's absolutely nothing original about "Day of the Dead", unless you consider a vegetarian zombie to be innovative. To me, that was simply the most ridiculous and embarrassing moment of the entire movie. The CGI-effects look horrible and this is yet another film that doesn't comprehend that zombies need to move slowly in order to look menacing! The rotting cadavers here run faster than African athletes and, for some reason, they can even walk upside down on the ceiling! I mean, were they actually trying to make the movie look stupid? Just trying to imagine Mena Suvari as a hard-boiled and stern army girl is already impossible and, even though his name parades on the DVD-cover in thick bold letters, Ving Rhames' role as Captain Rhodes is hardly more than a cameo. That was perhaps the biggest disappointment of all, since the Captain Rhodes character of the original movie is one of the notorious "bad guys" in the history of horror. This is by far the worst thing Steve Miner ever got associated with. Otherwise he's the respectable director of several modest competent horror movies, like "Friday the Thirteenth Parts 2 and 3", "Warlock", "House" and "Lake Placid".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombies have invaded a small Colorado town. The government has blocked it off, leaving the survivors to fend for themselves.This is yet another boring zombie flick that follows the same predictable patterns with nothing new, exciting, or fresh. Unless you bring into account the fact that Mr. Mariah Carey (Nick Cannon) is in it. The acting, as you would expect, is sub-par, and the only REAL thing going for the film is the makeup effects on the zombies...pretty darn impressive for such a low-budget picture.Still, it's something to watch I suppose if you're totally bored and want to kill some time. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid this abomination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, how the heck did this even manage to make it to DVD? For anyone reading this who hasn't seen the movie yet, don't waste your money. It's a worthless piece of crap that defiles the reputation of the movie it's supposedly a remake of and the incredible director of that movie. First off, I don't care what anyone says about the cast, they suck. Even Ving Rhames' acting sucked, and he was probably the only high-budget actor they had in the film. Nick Cannon butchered the movie with unnecessary profanity, dimwit humor, and a scene in which he grabs two pump-action shotguns with the purpose of dual-wielding them in combat. The zombies were doing things that is not even possible by humans(such as crawling along a ceiling). The so called special effects were on par with movies released by the sci-fi channel(and that is not saying much). And the ending looks like it was taken from some foreign car advertisement(the characters driving a vehicle in the background and a zombie jumps up out of nowhere, trying to shock the viewers.) The whole plot of the movie seems like it was ripped from the script of Resident Evil and combined with a "few" elements of 28 Days Later. In reality, I have just one question for the producers: What the hell were you thinking when you made this abomination? The only reason I gave this horrible excuse of a movie a 1 rating is because "0" wasn't an option. Pass this one up people, it will only give you a headache later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did I just watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words just cant really describe how bad this movie really is. So far I've seen zombies that use the ceiling to get in front of someone like an martial arts expert, zombies that walk on the wall like Spiderman. I've seen zombies that HIDE a body in the closet, and when the police arrives (after the body's have been found)lay in between them as to fool the police. I've seen purple blood. A zombie who's sad about being tied up in a car, and not going totally berserk, but just sad. The reason why? He's a vegetarian. Since when do zombies DODGE bullets? Or climb a ladder? Or leap like frog on amphetamine? Or flap their arms like a monkey on crack? I'm not saying that a zombie movie is very believable, but this was just over the top. The SFX in this film is not just bad, it's pathetic! Looks like the SFX from the Xena series or Hercules. At one point it looked like the blood was just painted on the frame. I was expecting so much more from this, seeing as the 2004 dawn of the dead was, imho, very good. Even if you think of it as a stand-alone, it's just sad beyond words. Still, you have to see this just to believe how a film with the magical title Day Of The Dead could suck so hard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its movies like this that make me miss Mystery Science Theatre 3000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like zombie movies, i do and most are bad but guilty pleasure all the same. This movie however is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is bad for a zombie it is bad for any movie, i'd rather watch godfather 3 than watch this, hell i'd rather watch Santa Claus Vs the Martians. You are undoubtedly think it can't be that bad but you'd be wrong. Where to begin, well this movie bears not relation to the plot of Day of the Dead and seems like a poor cash in by the copyright holder of that on the success of the Dawn of the Dead remake, (also starring Ving Rhames but more of that later). The plot actually feels like it was lifted from the Res Evil games meshing elements of 1 2 and 3 the military quarantine a town, virus runs amok, secret experiments etc. This might fill you with hope, if it does your'll be sorely disappointed. So whats wrong with the film, well the acting is bad even for a zombie movie, the script can only of been written by a child or a group of the higher primates (and if its the latter then i guess that would deserve some respect), and the camera-work and editing is so bad at points its hard to tell whats happening. The cardboard characters consists of three marines (how they became marines is beyond me) of Mena Suvari as Jill valentine, coming back to her hometown after leaving (apparently its complicated but never explains why), a Ghetto Stereotype, and newbie aka zombie bait aka bub (the only reference to the original), an evil government doctor who habitually lies for no apparent reason (like claim not to have a car) and is evil (to emphasis this a nurse begs for help by his car in the zombie infested parking lot, but he just pushes to some waiting zombies for some reason?) plus some towns folk like Mena's brother and his girlfriend or something. At this point you might be wondering why i haven't mention Ving Rhames character, Black Authority figure, thats because it really was only a cameo no doubt in a effort to link this to the Dawn of the Dead remake he appeared in, when the best character in a zombie movie dies 5 minutes in to the actually zombie attack you got start questioning the film. So after what is a pretty terrible build up, (apparently stoners can hang out at abandon missile silos housing secret military labs, who knew?)At the hospital you half expect Hugh Laurie to gait by on his cane as the film liberal steals, ahem homages from House with a scene apparently show the activation of the virus. Most of the special effects are sub par not bad enough to make you laugh just poor, and i expect this was because they wasted most of the SFX budget on the House cgi. So the zombies aren't zombies not really coming somewhere between the comedy zombies of night of the living dead and the those of 28 days later, but what they most remind you of is deadites and its at this point you realise this movie could of been awesome, if they had cast Bruce Campbell and rather than stealing the plot of Res Evil stole the plot of Fistful of Broomsticks but alas this is not to be. The Zombies have superpowers (like crawling on ceilings) are smart (they can hide bodies in cupboards, pretend to be a corpse, understand directions given over a radio) and in the case of one zombie dodge bullets like Neo (honestly though he is apparently the zombie messiah since scientists are know for the physical prowess) oh and they fall in love (zombie love story i wonder if the zombie virus can be sexually transmitted?). Thats right Bub the newbie moron soldier, get bitten and smitten, and apparently doesn't attack people because he was a vegetarian in life. However Bub does reckon the best part of this movie Mena Suvari arse, thats it the sole good point of this movie is her Arse, for the ladies there's nothing unless your into black stereotypes, women or rotting corpses (in which case you got a whole other set of problems). This movie is like a parody without the comedy, the only way this could be redeemed is by a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 commentary or if they re-cut it to star Bruce Campbell.In conclusion if you like Mena Suvari rent American Pie or Beauty, if you like Zombies rent the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only write reviews of movies with low rating, which actually are not that bad. Give them a chance!I must admit I expected more, the casting is cool, as well as the story taken from the original, but... something went wrong. Zombies are bad, really, really BAD. Now imagine MJ singing this in his Thriller zombie costume! That is probably the only thing I don't like. When you watch a remake, you already know what will happen, and you expect to see that old story again in some new form, like other 'modern' films... this one had a potential for that, but failed. Zombies shouldn't be so fast, and camera in those parts is bad, too. I blame producers for this, instead of giving money to Ving Rhames and Mena Suvari, they should have gave it to someone who knows how to create and shoot zombie-fight scenes. Then the movie would be cool even without known actors.I watched it only because I like movies about apocalypse, and if you imagine it like that - it is watchable! I was able to watch it to the end. All craziness caused by zombie outbreak is 'realisic', so I can't regret watching this.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice Zombie outbreak film. Nothing more, nothing less.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I've just finished watching Day of the Dead, and I must say I've rather enjoyed it. I've read some of the reviews and message board posts, and I can understand why people don't think it's the best film out there, not even the best Zombie flick. It's just a zombie film, and not such a bad one.The story is just about the same story like in any other film of the sort. A virus, infected, some people naturally immune, survivors trying to escape the outbreak. It's not an apocalypse film, as the virus is local, it's more like what happens before the apocalypse. The plot is nice enough. I did like the fact that unlike in other films of the sort, in this case the infected do retain some of their humanity and traits. Acting isn't all that great, though I don't think it's the cast's fault, as there's a limit to how well one could play the banal obvious rolls in such a film. I did like Nick Cannon as the comic relief, although it too was rather stereotypical (very Bad Boys). Nothing I can say about the direction and cinematography, and the soundtrack was OK I guess.All in all, it's typical Action Horror zombies. If you din't expect to be overwhelmed by quality, you can really enjoy this film for what it is. If you want a nice Zombie film - go ahead and watch Day of the Dead, but if you're looking to be scared or for a Zombie film that reinvents the wheel - keep looking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well i must say that the original day is one of my all time favourite movies of all time, i never thought this current "re-hash" was ever going to come close, just as i didn't expect the recent dawn re-make to be up to scratch, it was however infinitely better than this.I truly found myself coming very close to using the FF button during this movie as i found it that boring and poorly made. To summarize.1.The spider man like behavior of many of the zombies, plain retarded.2.The instant a person enters the "zombie state" they look like they they have been dead and decomposing for weeks, this happens in mere frames! 3.Overuse of very poor quality CGI.4.None of the gun sounds are close to realistic,i don't know if they are using uber low charge blanks or what, but all the weapons sound like cap guns.5.Un-millitary like behavior from supposed soldiers.6.Un realistic weapon physics,most notably full automatic firing of an ak-47 like gun (pilfered from gun store) with one hand fully out stretched arm, try that in real life... Of note do they even sell fully automatic rifles like this in gun stores int he USA? They also managed to get an UZI from same gun store, i don't live in the USA but I'm pretty sure they are not sold in gun stores.7.I have to mention the lack of ANY visible substance coming from the "missle engines" after they break the ends off, i think somebody forgot to add these effects in.Rapid release of any highly compressed gas will be visible.Nore is there any audible sound again WRONG.Even a very poorly made re-make of the original movie, or the original full script (which i hoped is what this movie would have been) would have been a whole lot better.I cant think of anything positive at all about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the heck?? This is a cheap cash in on the success of the million times better remake of Dawn of the dead. To be honest I liked the remake far better than the original while in the case of Day of the Dead its the other way round. First of all the movie doesn't have many resemblances with the original except for there is soldiers and zombies in it. None of the claustrophobic eerie feeling in the underground complex was captured in this movie. It reminded me like a total rip-off of dozen other horror movies... the whole quarantined town thing was there a million times, the running zombie thing is a new hype that is getting annoying and was taking too far in this one with jumping zombies crawling the ceiling.Honestly... you have seen each of every scene in this movie before... what totally killed it for me was the idiotic vegetarian zombie idea which doesn't even help the plot and that they ended the movie with some survivors escaping and suddenly a screaming zombie face appearing before the credits.... PLEASE NO ONE EVER DARE DO THIS AGAIN!! I hate it... its one of the cheapest and brainless horror clichés.Sure, the acting was okay and effects also were OK although some of the CGI blood squirts looked incredibly fake. But this movie is so empty of any new idea or feeling of the original movie that I can just call it a real cheap cash in on the hype that rapes the name of one of the best zombie classics (at least for me). Somebody should make a law that forbids movie remakes... its getting unbearable, especially when the remakes are totally different movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>According to Jeffrey Reddick's bio (the writer), when he was 14, his manuscript for a "Nightmare on Elmstreet" prequel was turned down because while he had a "fertile imagination, his stories lacked structure." Things apparently haven't changed."Day of the Dead" is a series of video game-esquire episodes capped by an incredibly illogical and predictable ending. It all begins with a bunch of kids making out in some kind of abandoned farmhouse or warehouse or other nondescript building and then jumps to a road block where the military is keeping people from going anywhere. Huh? What? Did I miss something? Like a set up or a first act? Anyone could have read the script and realized it was going to be a narrative mess. Except, it appears, the producers and director who went ahead with this mish mash of blood, gore, and tired lines.The effects are also pretty lame with lots of cheap CG stuff and bad makeup.All in all, don't bother. It's not good to appreciate or bad enough to laugh at - it's just plain mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent zombie flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who like zombie flicks will probably like this one or at least won't hate it.My only real complaints are: - no actual connection to the original "Day of the Dead". - occasional bad attempts at humor. - occasional use of catch-phrases. - some(but not that many) bad effects. - zombies are a bit too "active", jumping around like Spiderman at times, etc.Those aside I thought the plot was OK, the acting pretty solid(none of it was truly bad) and most of the effects were done well. As a fan of the genre I can honestly say that this is one of the better ones that I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite sharing its title with Romero's 1985 cult film "Day of the Dead" this movie has no connection with the old classic. As quite a fan of anything post-apocalyptic and favorably zombie-infested, I decided to give it a go anyway.In sum everything seems to have gone awry with this movie. The script is full of gaping plot-holes, and if this is not insulting in itself, add poor acting to an emotionally implausible script (e.g. after watching his zombie-mother be splattered by a Humvee one character remains in a rather jolly mood), and painfully cliché stereotypes (the token "gangster" black guy wielding a makeshift bone saw-taped-to-a-broom scythe with ninja-like precision) defying the laws of physics.My personal favorite is the wall-scaling spider zombies, which move about with superhuman speed... ofc except when attempting a go at our protagonists. Oh yeah, and then there is the gun firing zombies, and the empathic zombie, who happens to be so forcefully in love with the protagonist that he overcomes his zombie-hood, and collaborates with the band of survivors - lets not give too much thought to the point that they've met each other approximately half a day prior to zombie-transformation.In so many words: this movie is thoroughly retarded</fullReview>

This movie is the lousiest horror movie I have ever seen and does an injustice to the genre itself while insulting the audience in the process.For Zombie films this is Blasphemy! For it to be a remake of the Romero masterpiece is unforgivable.......in fact I pulled it out of the DVD and chucked it across the room 3/4 of the way through, rental or not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shut Your Brain Off and Enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you can fully separate this from the original Romero classic, there's a lot to love.A very basic turn-off-your brain zombie horror flick, the zombies have been pumped up to "Xtreme" levels even more than in the remake of Dawn of the Dead. They run, but they also jump, leap, stick to the ceiling (for short periods of time), remember things, and disembowel in moments. I've seen a lot of complaints about the believability and consistency of these zombies, but there really aren't any real problems. If you can accept the "universe" in the movie, then you can get past any of those problems.There is hardly any character development, which really was my only big problem with the flick. There have been grumblings about Mina Suvari being cast in the role she plays, but honestly, I find it to be perfect. She's a small-town girl in the army who is stuck in these circumstances. I have very close friends exactly like her (girls who look nothing like the part, yet are in the Army doing quite well for themselves), so I didn't have any issues. Also, while he was seriously grating, Nick Cannon wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I'm fairly certain that the audience is meant to dislike him. I mean, he seemed to be the answer to the jerks of the original movie.Finally, the whole remake issue - People seemed to love the Dawn of the Dead remake, but absolutely loathe this movie with a sort of seething hatred that hasn't been so unfounded since the seething hatred for the ORIGINAL Day of the Dead. If you were able to love Dawn '04, there's plenty to at least *like* here. In fact, this movie holds more in common with the original Day than Dawn '04 did with its original. The setting is entirely different, yes... Even the plot is quite different, but there are lines, characters, and some situations that are the same. The *only* thing the two Dawn movies had in common was the setting and like two character names.I watched this movie from start to finish, and while I do agree that it was disappointing if you wanted Romero's original script to be realized on screen, there was still a TON to enjoy, and I even loved it a little bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why a whole day when 10 minutes is too much?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst a generation of sandal-wearing anti-disciplinarians have instilled into our consciousness the notion that there are no stupid questions, I like most rational people am of the school of thought that dictates quite the opposite; and not only that, but a stupid question must warrant a frank and scornful reply if we are to avoid such occurrences in future. The same can be said about bad movies warranting reviews of a similarly disdainful nature to save people like myself the time it takes to sit through one of these filmic abortions. Of course such tirades wouldn't exist without fuel from Hollywood's worst (a true shame for the deeply cynical among us); but these idiots need to know that you simply can't partly digest a known classic, regurgitate it along with a lot of bland methodology, mould it into something close to its original form, slap a name on it that the viewing public will respect and recognise, and have a box-office smash on your hands as a result. And yet this frankly pale imitation of a movie, let alone George A. Romero's seminal 'Day of the Dead', is absolutely the type of profiteering amateurism that could well give a cinephile a stomach ulcer. It really is difficult for me to decide what I liked least about this "remake" of 'Day of the Dead'. The list of failings is after all rather lengthy. The most noticeable failing of course (and the purpose for the quotation marks) is that this bore almost no likeness to the original in any way, except of course for Stark Sands embarrassing monkey impersonation as 'Bud', the zombie with a heart of a gold. This incidentally comes nowhere close to the understated brilliance of Howard Sherman's delivery of 'Bub', the fully actualised representation of the link between the living and the undead in the original. I came very close to naming Nick Cannon's overconfident portrayal of the painfully clichéd Black bad-ass who knows all too well "what we be talking' 'bout" as the biggest blight on this picture; however I would then have to ignore the terrible sound that often detracted from the impact of the action; the shoddy direction and amateur camera-work which often left me feeling confused about what was happening on screen; the hints at back stories that led nowhere; and the incredibly lazy and pedestrian dialogue which did nothing to reflect the wit and tension of Romero's, instead seemingly replacing it as a means to do nothing more than move the story onwards towards its excruciatingly inevitable conclusion. Let us not forget however the rather unnecessary attempt to rewrite undead mythology which will jab at the purist within us all. At times I was left feeling like I could have been watching something as equally foreign to the genre as 'Predator' or 'Ghosts of Mars' as veritable super-zombies planned attacks on our hapless heroes with military precision, even working together to achieve a common goal, and snatching a certain member of the cast from above like 'Alien'. Of course whilst the drama school dropouts seem to be flailing both in-front of and behind camera, let us not overestimate a veteran of stage and screen such as Ian McNeice. His frankly awful accent, which seems to shift back and forth across the Atlantic, is only dwarfed by his incomparable size. Ironically his ability to pile on the pounds is the only quality he seems to possess which would convincingly allow him to play your average American. Even Ving Rhames however, who was needless to say a welcome sight very early in proceedings, was heavily underutilised and killed off far too soon, even despite the important role that Joe Pilato's 'Captain Rhodes' played in the original story. Frankly I hope that Mr. Rhames' early demise was most likely a card he himself played to keep his time in production to an absolute minimum for very obvious reasons. I'm afraid to say that whilst the failings were many and numerous, ultimately what won for me was how some talentless nobody who has directed a couple of crappy teen dramas, and some hack that has done nothing but write scripts of the same calibre, can be left to play around with the usage rights to a classic horror picture like 'Day of the Dead'. From start to finish this was a chronicle of screw ups on every level, and yet what infuriates me is that it still hit the shelves because the unwitting public won't know how much it sucked until after they've already bought the DVD. What has clearly worked against the suits here however is the invitation we were all given to tear this thing apart the minute they tried to cash-in by associating this picture with Romero. It seems that where Zack Synder's 'Dawn of the Dead' will be hailed as a true labour of love from a fan of the series, this will do nothing but remind us that 99 times out of 100 a remake will leave a bad taste in our mouths that even human flesh would go a long way to quell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say is, "Really?" People, please quit turning Romero's work into this crap. The Dawn of the Dead movie was done well, it was a decent budget, decent conversion of the script, decent acting, and was pretty entertaining. The main thing about it; besides budget, script, and actors, was that the most engrossing and thrilling part of Romero's work; the feeling of survival in isolated, outnumbered, globally terrifying situations. People enjoy watching a movie about survival in this element, you constantly wonder what you would do in the situation. Day of the Dead was not the same kind of movie at all, the original was a heck of a lot better and it was kind of lame. They used the same crummy cheap horror movie equations for this movie they use for all of the really bad, mass produced, bargain bin horror videos made for a quick buck. They are kind of an insult to anyone's intelligence, there's the cliché "young persons making out in a shack in the woods and hear something and get attacked while you only hear noises then see blood then cut scene" scenario, the "person who wanted to get away from her small town only to find out she missed it and wanted to save it" scenario, I could go on and on but it was not at all what Romero wrote about. Please, just make your cheap, crappy, cliché horror movies but leave Romero's zombies out of it, just keeping using the vengeful ghost or teenagers in a cabin for a weekend plots.</fullReview>

Boy have I been let down. Others have said it, and I want to confirm it. In this movie, Zombies not only move fast, but they crawl on ceilings, Jump large distances like striking spiders, and sometimes run on walls. A person infected will also go from looking like a normal person one second to a hideous deformed creature the next. To put my opinion in perspective for others, I love the original Night of the dead movies. I even liked the first two Night of the Living Dead movies and thought Resident Evil was a decent popcorn zombie movie. But I hated House of the Dead.</fullReview>

Romero's protagonist-zombie in his 1985 classic Day of the Dead is named Bub; in this pathetic 2008 remake they call him Bud. How can they screw that up? It's like remaking Star Wars and calling your lead character Daryl Skywalker. If you thought Day of the Dead 2: Contagium was the lousiest zombie movie ever made -- think again. Oh wait -- this remake is produced by the guy who directed Contagium. And he also directed the ultra-lousy Creepshow 3. I can't tell if James Glenn Dudelson is trying to single-handedly destroy the legacy of George A. Romero, or if he simply making Romero's movies better. Thanks to this 2008 remake, Romero's 1985 Day of the Dead is an American classic. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a horror website I frequent, many people posted derogatory comments about this film. The site's owner said that the worse people insulted the film, the more people are likely to part with their hard-earned to see it. Such is the strange world of horror websites. Well, with that in mind, I'd like to wholeheartedly recommend this absolute flippin' masterpiece.The narrative, framed in a style that some would consider 'poor', 'amateurish' or 'atrociously bad' I consider to be a learn-by-example of unparalleled genius. It challenges our conceptions of what makes for good cinema, or even 'entertainment', and offers, instead, a story-structure and pace that allows one so much interpretation. As a viewer you will look deep inside yourself, back and forward through time, out of the window, in your pockets... Pretty much anywhere but the screen while it's on. SUCH is the profundity of the Day Of The Dead 2008 experience.The performances are, in a word, acting. There are many other words that could be used, but I think the director should be applauded for making use of people from the 'special communities'. Their unique interpretations of emotional responses are brave, their struggle evident in every laboured motion and word. It almost brings a tear to the eye, especially when comparing this to the original D.O.T.D. which relied so heavily on such conventional approaches to acting. These are the kind of challenges we should confront ourselves as viewers of high class cinema.Scares? Well, in the original, we had the hands coming out of the wall, Dr Tongue, the amazing Rhodes death scene, the metaphorical, regan-era cold war tension between science and military, the oppressive gloom of the miles of underground tunnels filled with the groaning dead. This version does away with such things, instead employing a cast of utterly lovely photogenic models barely out of their teens. Surely this, more than anything Romero has ever done, reminds us to be cautious of our collective attitudes towards the increasingly disposable nature of society, how living for now, and only caring about image and asthetics will surely come back and bite us. The lack of gore just reinforces the fact that beauty is only skin deep and looks fade with age... or infection from a zombie bite. In this one, the zombies can also climb on walls and stuff. Which is also brilliant. And not at all rubbish.To summarise, this is the best film ever made in the history of all existence and should be experienced by everyone at least one thousand times. In NO WAY is it a cynical exploitation of focus group, corporate demographic mentality, created entirely for audiences of pubescent, text-speak, MySpace idiots who will whoop at any bright colours and loud noises like a bunch of hollering sub-cretins in dire need of having some real life punched into their vacant, teenage, mouth-breathing faces.Yes, please see it. You wont regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, if this movie claims to be a horror movie -- it is dead-fully wrong. It is a large combination of other movies all packed into one. Resident Evil, The Fog, AVPR, and more. I could not help but to laugh at the fully predictable "Zombie hiding locations" or the cheesy dialogue. They type casted Nick Cannon and gave him lines that 2Dimensional-ize black males within film and bring shame to their culture and use of slang. The pacing of this movie is also of in that it seems like it was shot by multiple directors and 2nd and 3rd units. The cinematography was well done, but the director's choice in using a shaky "Hills Have Eyes II" shooting style dropped the suspense factor down to zero. More importantly the zombies in this film have brought shame to all other before. They can climb up walls, on ceilings, jump 10+ feet in the air, but cannot catch our main characters when they are right next to them.A combination of bad dialogue, super-zombies, poor direction, predictability, and stolen scenes from other movies. This movie has been one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to the master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film I felt compelled to write a short review so that other zombie-film fans wouldn't have to sit through it. To connect it in any way to Romero's 1985 masterpiece is heresy and as far as I could see, the only connection was a zombie called Bud who retained some human-like behaviour. The effects were not that bad and there were some good set pieces but they couldn't distract from the overall mess of clichés that the film was. With most of the action happening at night there was very little of the original's feeling of apocalyptic disaster and the total lack of anyone to care about just added to the frustration of sitting through a film that isn't fit to bear even a nod to Romero's work, let alone claim to be a remake. The only thing worse than sitting through this film would be to be told that someone credited you in it as an influence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best excuse people can come up with for this trash, is that critics just don't like it because they can't stand someone trying to replace Romero's previous work. The remake of "Dawn of the Dead" was actually very well received overall by Romero fans. As a staunch Romero fan, I can say I liked the "Dawn" remake. Many of us did. But what Steve Miner did with the "Day" remake was just bad film making. Miner is so much better than this, he blew a sure thing with the remake recipe, and trashed "Day". Yes, I'm mad Miner remade a Romero film but the real issue is that it's simply bad film making. Do you punks get it?This movie is an insult to Romero and to intelligent horror fans. The highest overall rating this deserved was possibly two stars. There were no redeeming qualities what-so-over. I've lost what little respect I had for Rhames for his participation in this film. Cannon's performance fortifies societal stereotypes of African American men; what an insult his character was! Suvari's performance was disgusting. Every one of her lines was delivered in the same flat, oh I'm such a beautiful tough chick with brains, delivery. She's an idiot, I'm not impressed. And I don't think she's hot! She's a fool. I wonder what Romero thinks of this garbage? I know what I think. It was horrible from beginning to end. A brain numbing experience that had me continually checking my watch. How did they even get the green light for this project? I consider it a Cardinal Sin that Miner took the "Day of the Dead" production name and attached it to this monstrosity! Miner owes Romero an apology. He owes the world of film making an apology. He owes horror fans an apology. The real shame here is that much more talented production professionals and actors would have been happy to remake this film, at least good enough to have it shown in theaters, not straight to DVD. Probably the biggest disappointment of the year for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I finally got to see this. And I wish there weren't a self imposed rule against expletives, or I'd write a message filled with them and my anger at this piece of crap still wouldn't be sated. Not even close to being a remake of a much better film, it is a raping of much better films title. How they got two decent actors (Mena Suvari, who I guess has no career any longer and Ving Rhames, who sleep walks through his ten minute cameo) is beyond me. A stupid-fest from beginning to end, I can't think of one positive thing to say about this garbage simply because even it's short running time felt like five hours. I won't point out all the mistakes, someone did that in an earlier message, I will say that if I were George Romero, I'd want to hit someone for the credit: BASED ON DAY OF THE DEAD BY GEORGE ROMERO. I'd like to meet the idiot who read this terrible script and said, "Yeah! This sounds GREAT!" I will point out some of the stupider things that were slightly missed in earlier critiques. 1 - We never find out why the hell Mena's gun isn't loaded. "It's complicated." Oh, unlike the script which was just STUPID? 2 - The bit with the spear. Nick Cannon killed like ten creatures (I refuse to call them zombies) with a saw medic taped to a crutch! 3 - Why, why, why in all zombie movies (but a Romero one) is there one idiot who says, "No, they may not turn." We've seen an ENTIRE town turned in like 8 minutes and this guy won't turn? PUH-LEEZE pass the barf bag. 4 - Bud, BUD the vegetarian Zombie? Oh I think I'm gonna heave... 5 - Zombies running around shooting guns? Sorry, but zombies are either morons (like most) or can think (return of the living dead), which leads to: 6 - No consistency among the zombies. Either they are fast or they aren't. Either they think or they don't. Either they suck (like here) or they are great. 7 - The lead zombie... they tried to have a reason for them. But viruses don't just mutate over night. And Pat Kilbane... guess his career after Mad TV is really over.Sigh... that's enough I guess. Just a crapfest (and boring at that) from beginning to end. A bad, bad, bad movie. And on a final note, I will NEVER forgive the far superior 28 series for introducing the idea of fast zombies. To paraphrase Indiana Jones, "I hate fast zombies, Jock. HATE EM!" And to paraphrase Doctor Zachary Smith, after sitting though this trash, "Oh the pain... the pain!"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Not even recommended for the Zombie completist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... Are the people condemning this movie, no doubt. This obviously is a sequel to the remake of Dawn, (04). The characters are likable. The storyline, isn't the best or worst, I've seen. The effects are superb.Mena Suvari, does a very decent job of carrying this movie. Fast Paced, action oriented. I'm sure Lot's of hungry zombie fans will enjoy this newest re-make in the zombie genre.I was very pleasantly surprised, while viewing this one. Whilst not the best, certainly not the worst either.I'll watch it quite a few more times.I recommend giving it a whirl, before handing out heavy handed judgements against it. Don't be fooled folk's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In defense of...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've given this a 7/10 stars on a curved scale. First, the negatives...A) Never should've been considered a "remake" I can't recognize a signal element from Day in it, except zombies and a character named Bud.B) This movie isn't great, not by a long shot.Now, here's where I defend it. It isn't that hard. It does something the past two Romero films have not done. Try to be scary. Land and Diary, both of which I saw in the theaters, hold little promise of the filmmaker that made Night of the Living Dead and even less of the dark humor that was in Dawn and Day. Land and Day spent a great deal of time simply beating us over the head with principals and value judgments. Romero's most social commentary was Night, and that was, according to him and all other reports accidental as opposed to intentional.This film has no such compunction. What this film does is try to be suspenseful, entertaining and scary. And you know what? It succeeds. The production values are ten times higher than the last real Romero flick. it's got some moments in it that are so graphic you simply pause and go "eww" or jump. But yet, it does NOT take the audiences intelligence for granted. It knows its a schlocky horror flick and has the appropriate amount of fun with that, without trying to be a political statement. The lead, Mena, holds her own in a movie that if done with a T&amp;A style actress would've been ham-handed. Nick Cannon, while the trailer seemed awful, was a typical army grunt.As for plot. Hmm, how to say this delicately? It's a ZOMBIE movie. You already have legions of the undead, and you want completely realistic exposition? Certainly not as well done as 28 Days Later, but it was more sensible than the last two Romero films.All in all, I would say that as a sequel to the remake of Dawn of the Dead, it worked. As a remake, it didn't, and the original pales in comparison. However, as a stand alone, it's good to put on, have a few friends over and watch for 90 plus minutes of non-stop zombie gore.</fullReview>

If you prefer the more 'active' style of zombies then perhaps you will discover a gem in this film.Its not great by any standards but it does have a few surprises in store. Don't expect too much and I doubt you will be disappointed.I believe this film was made for TV (could be wrong) and in that respect its not a bad effort. Better than some I've paid to see for sure. In fact I have to say that I preferred it to Land Of The Dead.Don't pay to watch this film but by all means catch it when it airs on TV - assuming you don't have anything better to do! 5 out of 10 for effort</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the screening for Day of the Dead in LA in September... I wanted my money back, but i didn't even pay for the movie.Cardboard acting, completely ridiculous character traits that defy all sense of realism (Marines do NOT act like that, ever), and very odd casting that didn't work out (Mena Suvari and Nick Cannon? Come on). Also, there was definitely no style to this movie at all! Dawn of the Dead had style, Grindhouse (although not a Zombie flick, but of a similar genre-style) was greatly stylized, Sin City was exciting visually as well, but this movie could have been shot in daylight outside of LA over a weekend. It had no "Feel" to it. I love Zombie movies (James Gunn's Dawn of the Dead, awesome), but this one was true Hollywood schlock and a big disappointment.Who ever thought a ZOMBIE movie could be Boring?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two horror writers Jeffery Reddrick and Steven Miner take over the remake to day about a town under seize of the undead. The military moves in to contain it from spreading when they find out the dark secrets leading to its cause.The military created a virus, a.k.a resident evil, to fight terrorism and now its leaked to the unsuspecting populace.Following the trend of early 2000 horror tropes it consists of cheap scares, famous or good looking teens who can't act and dark lighting for atmosphere. Nick Cannon should stuck to singing.The zombies had great makeup, but the standard slouch is replaced by crawling up walks and moving fast across vents like super mutants. This effect alone made many potential creepy scenes like the hospital massacre cheesy and quite humorous.These characters make one stupid mistake after another like the boy who sees his zomified mother and runs out into a crowded street full of rotting bodies to get her or the army waiting so long to take action making them ineffective institution when a new recruit recognizes the danger right away.One ingredient missing from this travesty is the moral implications and philosophy you become accustomed to leaving it a hollow shell.I didn't bat an eye lash it even win razzes awards that year in all categories and was negativity received by fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather pitiful remake packed with CGI gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the success of 2004's DAWN OF THE DEAD remake I suppose it was inevitable that a remake of the third film in Romero's dead trilogy would follow ? after all, zombies are a perennial favourite and this was sure to ignite the box office to similar success. Sadly, it turned out to be a lacklustre, thoroughly disappointing straight-to-DVD effort that entranced nobody.The remake is loose indeed ? in fact this has more to do with a film like RESIDENT EVIL than the Romero classic. A couple of elements are present, including an underground missile silo at the climax, the presence of a tough army officer called Captain Rhodes and a 'friendly' zombie named Bud, but otherwise this is a completely generic zombie outing. The first third is the set up, with lots of ill people, then there's the zombie attack, and finally we see a dwindling group of survivors struggling to escape the mayhem.In order to be frightening, zombie films need to be realistic ? and that's where DAY OF THE DEAD falls down. This is a film full of obnoxious teens, 'edgy' black comedians and an entire cast who seem entirely at home using automatic weaponry. Watching a group of people running around shooting super-fast zombies is not fun ? watching a guy having to use a screwdriver on a zombie about to eat him in the original DAWN OF THE DEAD was. The script is stale and lifeless, with moronic humour throughout and a distinct lack of likable or indeed interesting characters.The zombies are copied over from 28 DAYS LATER but they're saddled with rubbish Halloween mask make-up worse than you'd see in a Bruno Mattei effort. There's quite a bit of gore, but it's all done with CGI and looks completely crappy. Most of the scenes are nonsensical and the group's decision to take the zombified 'Bud' around with them is simply ludicrous ? and then his presence is revealed as nothing more than a throwaway twist at the climax. Mena Suvari is bland and miscast as the heroine and Ving Rhames wasted as the army guy, and Ian McNeice also miscast as a shock DJ. In fact, I liked only two brief scenes: a gross-out interlude with Rhames, and a 'jump' scare done in complete silence eerier than anything else the movie has to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast-Paced Pandemonium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I thought this was a remake of George A. Romero's "Day of the Dead". But there are really few similarities despite the claim that it is "based" upon it. For starters, the zombies are much, much faster than anything Romero ever envisioned. Too fast in my opinion, as both the zombies and the overall non-stop action tended to be a bit too much sometimes. Another difference is the setting. While Romero's movie had people under siege in an underground military facility, this film had most of the action occurring in a small town before finally ending up in a nearby laboratory. So rather than being a remake of the original "Day of the Dead" I found it to be more like a clone of "Resident Evil" in which a virus escapes from a lab and fast-paced pandemonium ensues. That said, if a person likes an action-packed zombie movie instead of the usual graphic zombie formula then I think they probably liked it. Personally, I would have preferred the latter but this was still a fairly decent movie all the same. One major flaw I noticed regarded the wearing of the military uniforms for which any army officer or NCO could have easily corrected if they had been consulted. Why film-makers cannot seem to get simple errors like this fixed before they start shooting the film is beyond me. Even so, I enjoyed the movie despite these obvious flaws. While it might not qualify as a GREAT movie it is certainly better than some critics have suggested. Again, it's all about whether a person demands that a zombie movie conforms to certain "rules" or whether they're willing to suspend some of the rules in favor of more action. While I wish it had stayed more in line with the "Romero standard", I believe that the positives in this film counter-balanced the negatives and I'll give it an "average" rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Day of the Dead"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Day of the Dead" is a very strange little gem of a direct-to-video "B"-movie. On the one hand, the film is a remake of George A. Romero's highly underrated 1985 film of the same name. On the other, Steve Miner's 2008 film bears little resemblance at all to Romero's predecessor. In a way that's good, because it would have given the filmmakers a chance to put a new spin on old material. But it's also very bad, because while the movie does try a new approach, it fails at nearly every turn and is quite bone-headed in its presentation.To be totally fair, Romero's "Day of the Dead" was my LEAST favorite of the original film series, but I still really liked it and gave it a 9/10; the "best-of" honor belonged to "Dawn of the Dead" (1978), my personal favorite horror film of all time and of which I think is Romero's best film ever - a true masterpiece of zombie/horror movie film-making. The "Day of the Dead" remake film has a better-than-average production for a DTV flick and takes its cues from Zack Snyder's highly effective 2004 remake "Dawn of the Dead," which I'll explain in a few short sentences."Day of the Dead" is set in a small Colorado town that the U.S. military has quarantined off due to a viral infection of unknown origin. Soon, people begin dropping like flies and re-animating as flesh-hungry zombies. So it's up to a small group of survivors led by Cpl. Sarah Bowman (Mena Suvari) and Pvt. Salazar (Nick Cannon) to arm up and try to escape an out-of-control living dead situation, eventually making it to an abandoned underground missile silo located somewhere in the mountains. (It should be noted that while Romero's original "Day of the Dead" was set in an underground missile silo from the get-go, the remake has the missile silo angle not coming in until at least a good hour into the picture.)Miner gives the film a rather tense build-up, since it's about a half-hour in before the zombie action and mayhem even starts. And here is where the film begins to falter. The gimmick of zombies being able to run, rather than simply moan &amp; groan and lurch up and down escalators, is nothing new; "The Return of the Living Dead" (1985) is the earliest example that I've seen to use the concept of running zombies. Zack Snyder put that gimmick to chillingly effective use in his remake. But here, Miner one-ups both "Return" and Snyder's 2004 film by giving us zombies that can not only run and retain some evidence of their former lives, but also climb walls and leap 20 feet in the air like they were Spider-Man Undead!It is here that my jaw almost hit the floor in utter disbelief. While the idea might sound nice on paper, seeing it action is something else entirely. I wasn't convinced at all by this move and would have much rather preferred if they just ran after their victims instead of acting like human flies. And actually seeing zombies that seem superhuman was just a huge turn-off for me, not to mention that incredibly lousy special effects were used to implement them.Additionally, one of the great things about Romero's original film was the strong human element and strong-willed performances from a no-name cast. We empathized with the tight-knit group of civilian scientists who were at the mercy of gung-ho and semi-psychotic army men in an abandoned underground missile silo. Many of the characters here are pretty one-dimensional with little or no development or back-story at all (and did I mention how annoying Nick Cannon's character was?). Also in Romero's original, we sympathized with the "domesticated" zombie known only as "Bub." Here, a similar situation pops up that could have had great implications for the film overall, but sadly whatever it could have done to make the film better never develops."Day of the Dead" does also have some nifty zombie kills and gore (this side of the "R" rating, at least), and they're good for a DTV feature. Other than that, it's still pretty forgettable."Day of the Dead" is so far the third remake of a George A. Romero zombie feature. This one actually had some potential to be a better-than-average DTV feature, but it fails miserably even at that. I did get some minor enjoyment out of this feature, largely from its build-up and a few really cool special effects scenes. But some missed-chance opportunities in its script and bad zombie effects nearly ruined it for me. Even so, I still have the feeling that this movie has the potential for some sort of cult following, either now or in the distant future. I don't know.I would only say, watch this one if you really want to. Otherwise, stick with Romero's highly underrated original.5/10P.S.: And where was the psychotic Captain Rhodes, huh? Oh yeah, he got eaten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite disappointed (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I had seen the Dawn of the Dead remake a few years back, I was thrilled for a follow up to that style of remake because that movie (dawn) was a perfect reflection of today's times just as the Romero original for its day. But when I had seen the coming attractions for Day of the Dead, my emotions were killed by a jagged rock called "disappointment" because it went nowhere near the Romero original (which will always be a disturbing classic)! So being bored and in need for entertainment, I rented the damned thing and what I think is, even the brave heroic antics of the very cute Mena Suvari can't even save this movie. The movie should be called Night of the Dead since most of the horror began at night and generally ending during the next day break. Also you have way too much CGI in it to the point that the effects were very cheaply done, and zombies crawling on the walls like roaches a million miles per hour. Oh, not to mention that if they wanted to throw CGI in there so much, why haven't they shown the graphic transformation (face wise) of an infected person with a bloody nose and white pupils to a green pigmented, green toothed, maniac covered in boils and open soars and it seems that they tried to cover up a lack of good dialog with gore and murder (which was also cheaply done). As opposed to the original, what (in my opinion)makes the movie such a classic is that you have the inner turmoil of the characters who all interplay with one another in a very bad situation. And despite the on going Romero style of slow zombie movement, I must say that even "Diary of the Dead" was better (zombie wise) because it shows that despite the dead slow and sluggish movements, they can still creep on you in droves making them very dangerous. Also, for me, I already know who's the true deviant in the movie as opposed to the decoy, but then again, wouldn't you be suspicious of a Dean Kane stand in dressed for a night discotheque madness amidst a zombie invasion in hick town, USA? The only good parts for me (humor wise) was when the amputee Rhodes was crawling on Mena's character in the air shaft, barking and when Nick Cannon's character (Salazaar)entered the bright lighted lab said "it looks like a puffy video". Perhaps, in the science of expressive art, the movie still holds true to the reflection of these days and times, nothing but cheap interaction and mega fast over kill for a flash second of a cheap thrill.</fullReview>

I thought it was interesting, I mean there's only so many ways you can tell a zombie story,, we all know the legends,, and what they do ,, so they idea is to have interesting characters,, and have the zombies do stuff they never done before,, climb walls,, walk faster stuff like that. I felt the movie wasn't that bad,, it could have used some better characters,, but the make up and effects were kick butt. the zombies did pretty cool things in this movie, so that was fun to watch,, I just think this would have been better maybe with a little more plot and storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small town is quarantined after a virus breakout, civilians and soldiers try to survive.A missed opportunity to remake a cult classic Day of the Dead (1985)and/or follow up the surprisingly effective 'Dawn of the Dead (2004).Horror director Steve Miner is on bad form here, the film suffers from a cheap digital TV show appearance, there's some awful camera work, a bad script and story logic. The tone changes throughout, unsure whether it's wants to be a comedy, a parody of Return of the Living Dead or a solid zombie film. There's some ridiculous segments, the wall crawling zombies, the vegetarian gags, you could spend hours pouring over the problems with this film.As a standalone movie without any references to Day of the Dead it may have worked with some tweaks as a cheap and cheerful low budget zombie comedy. However, in reality it's waste of some directing talent, good actors including quirky looking Mena Suvari and Ving Rhames.As a fan of Romero's Day or Dawn's remake you may want to give it a miss or be sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the course of one lifetime, an actor can enter the silver screen and make a profound name for himself. Ving Rhames has done just that. Beginning in the mid 1980's this industrious actor has indeed carved a niche. In the course of his many movies, one is never surprised by his ability to convince an audience. Therefore, it is strange to see him in an offbeat film like " Day of The Dead. " Ving Rhames plays Captain Rhodes, an experienced hard nose officer who's orders include encircling a Colorado town with a military cordon and not allowing any of it's citizens to leave. The town's people have suddenly come under military quarantine, due to an airborne virus which has been released. Anyone with flu like symptoms begins with a cough, followed by nose bleeds and finally succumbs to becoming a flesh eating zombie. Despite Rhames' top billing, it's Mena Suvari playing Sarah Bowman who carries the movie, without once flaunting her feminine charms. Stark Sands playing Bud Crain is quite the surprise as is veteran actor, Ian McNeice who plays Paul the DJ. The movie story is a semi-copy of the original Romero script, but instead of having the monsters slowly creep up to their victims, these creatures are quite capable of moving at incredible speed. Nevertheless, the military gets the credit for creating the disaster and it's the audience who is frightened out of their chairs. A good movie which would have been better with Rhames at the helm. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's start with an important disclaimer - I'm pretty generous when it comes to scoring a film. I like good films and score accordingly, and I like bad films if they're entertaining enough, and score accordingly.When it comes to the Day of the Dead remake, my scoring system goes out the window. I normally score movies by the feeling they leave me with. The films I can watch over and over (Secrets and lies, Dawn of the dead remake) I'll score highly. Films like "8mm" or "Random Hearts" that either grossed me out or sent me to sleep will score low. But with this film, I actually had to start at 0 - and add points for things I liked.So... I gave the film 2 out of 10. Half a point just for featuring Ving Rhames, even if it was to trick people into thinking this was a real sequel to "Dawn of the dead 2004". Half a point for "Bud", the cutest zombie this side of the apocalypse, and a nice little shout out to "Bub" from the original film. I gave one whole point, believe it or not, for AnnaLynne "Drunkface" McCorde. I thought she made a cool zombie killing chick. And it's not coz she's a hot chick either, I'm one of those gay homosexuals, so that had no influence on me.The majority of the film unfortunately was fairly ridiculous. I don't have a problem with fast moving zombies (as I said I love the Dawn remake, and the 28 Later films)... however the zombies in this film were sped up to Keystone Cops level.I thought it was silly that the infected people instantly seemed to rot away as soon as the virus zombified them, it just didn't make sense. Also the fact they could seem to defy gravity by crawling on walls and ceilings also detracted from the enjoyment of the film.Overall, a disappointment. With some luck, George A Romero will return as a zombie upon his death.... and dismember the people responsible for this mess.</fullReview>

The excuse, the scientist says some people have a natural immunity but once bitten they're infected. We find this out later in the movie.2. Ving Rhames eating his eyeball made me laugh.3. A zombie hides under a corpse.4. A zombie crawls on the ceiling.5. Mena has no bullets in her gun. When asked why her response is "It's complicated." 6. Nick Cannon can not act.7. The zombies move weird.8. Zombies disintegrate when lit on fire.9. The Mother of Mena and her brother can understand the radio, even though she's a zombie.10. Zombies use mops and other objects to hit ventilation shaft. Since when can zombies use tools? 11. There is vegetarian zombie that they keep around after.12. Zombies use machine guns.13. A zombie climbs a fire escape ladder.14. Nose bleeds, random nose bleeds, why? See my first point.I gave this 2 because of the production value and set. Apparently, they could afford costumes, make-up, special effects, CGI, and military vehicles and set locations. But apparently they couldn't get script writing or directing or editing. I hated some of those shaky camera shots.I liked the locations: Military facility, Hospital, Radio station, etc. Only if Snyder had directed this along with the writers of Dawn of the Dead 2004. (Which rocked), things could have been better. The locations could have worked if they set it back in Milwaukee and had this at the Day of the outbreak or the following day. We could have seen some survivors at Fort Pastor, or the Hospital where Ana worked. They then could have added the radio station and maybe some people trapped in their houses and even some still on the street.This movie was a disgrace.</fullReview>

Instead, it is another "for dumb teens only" horror picture that lacks any real scares, is laden with awful clichés and ultimately fails because it bares the name and thus, seemingly tries to live up to the standards set by the infinitely better "original". The producers saw the opportunity to put a big name on a small (figuratively speaking) movie in efforts to grab some cash and did so without any regard for how it would effect the finished product.This film is awful, make no mistake - but had it not set people up to see a remake of a classic it may have passed at least as a mildly entertaining failure as opposed to a total waste of time that is offensive to it's own genre. This is where you find the divide amongst IMDb forum users, horror/zombie fans who hate it and regular people who didn't seem to mind it. That being said, one quote from the message boards rings true for everyone, "Enjoy it all you want but this is NOT a good movie."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Dead... At Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombie films are part of a thriving sub-genre that we never seem to tire of and, even though this is far from being the pick of the bunch ? and is the loosest of remakes, bearing very little resemblance to the Zombie-meister George Romero's original ? it's passable enough entertainment. In 28 Days Later zombies evolved so that they were able to sprint after their victims instead of shuffling around on two dead legs, and in this one that evolutionary process moves one rung further up the ladder by allowing them to defy the laws of gravity and skitter around walls and floors (although they strangely forget they have this power when they briefly have our hardy band of survivors trapped in a ventilation shaft).Mena Suvari is the plucky heroine here, a no-nonsense soldier who still manages to look vulnerable thanks to a slightly over-size uniform. She has reluctantly returned to her home town as part of a detail ordered to quarantine it because of a virus that suddenly mutates, turning its victims into fast-moving, ravenous zombies. Once the virus had taken hold, the rest of the film follows her and a random group of individuals' increasingly desperate attempts to escape their clutches. There are a few moments of tension but, too often, when situations that should be heavy with tension are created by the writer, director Steve Miner completely botches things. Subtlety obviously isn't Mr Miner's forte; instead he chooses to rely on comic-book violence ? which is fine in this kind of film ? and all too soon things begin to resemble one of those interminable video games in which the main character charges around an endless succession of corridors firing indiscriminately at anything that moves.This is a very short film, which is probably just as well because, although it manages not to overstay its welcome, it doesn't really feel very short. And you can just bet Pegg &amp; Co are kicking themselves for missing out on the idea of a vegetarian zombie because the idea belongs in a horror-comedy like Sean of the Dead rahter than a relatively straight horror flick like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above average Zombie fare that is nothing close to George A. Romero's 1985 underrated film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere in Colorado, in a small mountain town. There's an mysterious outbreak that is slowly start affecting human begins. While there's an road block in the town without letting people leaving the town, those who are sick or not. Sarah (Mena Suvari) is a soldier, who's trying to find her troubled brother Trevor (Michael Welch) and her mother to get out of their home town. While her brother is always with his girlfriend Nina (AnnaLynne McCord). Slowly those people died from the unexpected virus that affects people but the recently dead are turned rapidly into fast spider-crawling zombies. Which they attack any humans in sight. Now Sarah, Trevor, Nina, a soldier named Salazar (Nick Cannon) and another soldier named Bud (Stark Sands) are trying to get out out of the town before the undead are taking over the whole small town.Directed by Steve Miner (Forever Young, House, My Father The Hero "1994") made an decent if messy Zombie movie that tries to be completely different in its own right but the screenplay by Jeffery Riddick (Final Destination) that suffers the most. This very loose remake of "Day of the Dead" is sloppy film-making/storytelling at its finest for it's "B Movie" roots. Suvari handles the role much better than expected as Sarah (One of the few named remaining characters of the Romero original). Cannon is OK as one of the heroes but he's completely miscast and his comic one-liners don't work here. Ian McNeice does his role well as the Radio D.J. Paul. One of the best things of the "Day of the Dead" remake is casting Ving Rhames as Captain Rhodes. Although his supporting role is brief but it was nice to see him in another Zombie feature after the much more successful remake of "Dawn of the Dead". Also the character of Dr. Logan played by Matt Rippy is much different than the original. One of the few highlights is this movie is seeing the Character of Sarah crawling in the air shaft to safety, while an zombie is trying to get her."Day of the Dead" was originally made for theaters but it went straight to DVD and it is easy to understand why. The movie isn't that poorly acted by the cast, the director is using a bit too much at flash cutting by moving plot points (Which it's something is extremely overdone today) and screenplay by Riddick has some plot holes &amp; the third act needs works. At least the producers of "Day of the Dead 2" and "Creepshow 3" did improved with casting actors, we seen before. This new re-take isn't very imaginative to say the least, the make-up effects are not very good and the CGI effects are a bit too cheap. I seen much more low-budget films, they had effective used of CGI Work. I think this Zombie feature should have handle much better, especially since there was so many producers on this. They probably had different opinions of the screenplay for better or worse. But at least, The filmmakers tried very hard to make another successful Zombie remake of "Dawn of the Dead". While it is watchable, it is modestly entertaining misfire. I just hope, they won't remake "Land of the Dead" soon. Good music score by Tyler Bates (Halloween "2007", The Devil's Rejects, Slither).

		<shortDescription>You can't purify the dead...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the original Day of the Dead is my personal favorite of all the Romero "Dead" films and all you 1 star giving "purists" can "purify" my knob.Secondly, titling this film "Day of the Dead" was stupid.Thirdly, get over it.It's flawed...but as pure entertainment it succeeds.As a remake of Day of the Dead...it ain't.Get over it.They're not ruining the genre; they're enhancing it. Think of it as a (fast zombie) sub genre if that helps you maintain your purist integrity. But you people need to lighten up (or maybe light up) and just embrace it all. Watch Fido or Dead and Breakfast?it's all zombie love! There are exceptions, of course. I'm compiling an "Avoid" list on my Netflix review page (BZMR or Bub's Zombie Movie Reviews). Number one on that list will always be (coincidentally enough), Day of the Dead 2: Contagium. Here's my question: if you give THIS film only 1 star, what do you hold in reserve for such a ridiculously BAD film as Contagium? Your credibility suffers, you see. If you think THIS film only deserves one star (the least you can give it) then you mustn't have ever seen a truly BAD movie! Also, your spelling usually gives you away.You just can't put films like this up against the work of an artist like Romero. But they can be appreciated on a different level. Just watching Contagium as a rock bottom basis of comparison should add another 3 stars to your rating of THIS film. If you've already seen Contagium and still think THIS film deserves only 1 star, then I just don't understand you.And Mena Suvari kicks so much more total zombie butt than that chick did in the Dawn of the Dead remake? ?or maybe I was distracted and the whole thing really sucked? Bub says check it out anyway!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not even sure where to begin to comment on the crapfest that is "Day of the Dead". I put that title in quotes because the only thing this movie has in common with the movie that it is supposed to be a remake of is a part of one character. Yes Bud the zombie from the original gets something of a reprise.I thought going in that it would be fun to see a remake of the movie that is arguably the weakest in George Romero's original 3 movies. I was wrong. Given a bigger budget and modern special effects how could you possibly make a movie that looks worse than a film that was made for about 14 dollars? The makeup effects were pitiful and unimpressive and looked fake. The gore effects were unimpressive and looked fake. The cinematography was terrible. The cgi was just plain stupid as well as unimpressive and fake.The worst part of this movie was the script closely followed by the direction. The original movie was a sequel and built on what had come before it. This "script" is written as a complete standalone. The whole zombie outbreak begins in this movie and the script tries to come up with a plausible explanation. Well the explanation was just plain lame. It's been done before and done better. The original didn't really try to explain how the zombie plague came to be. It was an unknown and used to good effect that way. Trying to explain it just takes away from the suspense. Not that there was any real suspense in this movie anyway. I'm not even going to go into the plot holes. I'll just say that suspension of disbelief is possible in some movies but this one needs you to be brain-damaged to believe any of it. And I'm sorry for implying that a brain-damaged person might like it. Can anyone explain to me why these zombies burn up like vampires in the sun at the slightest touch of fire? Were they all alcoholics with too much booze in their blood? Why do they run around like super-zombies one minute and then shuffle around looking at nothing the next?So on top of the lame script we have Steve Miner's lame attempt at directing. All the crowd zombie scenes were done in such a way that it didn't really look like what it was supposed to be. It could have been drunken sports fans after their team lost a big game. It was all dark and shot from a distance for the most part. Miner is just lame enough to throw in some occasional camera shake and slow motion in an attempt to make it look "cool". Combine that with the shoddy cgi and it's really just irritating. Every single thing in this lame attempt has been done before and been done better.And here's the thing that's really stupid. This is another zombie movie without zombies. The dead don't come to life and crawl out of their graves. Instead 75% of the town turns into "zombies" at the same time and starts eating the other 25%. Unlike the Dawn of the Dead remake, which this thing tries to emulate in part, it isn't a slow process. Unlike 28 Days Later, which it also seems to try to emulate a bit, the process isn't fast. It's fairly slow. Except when it's fast. And apparently even though it's a virus, the people that are "naturally immune" to the virus can get covered in blood and guts but don't become infected unless they are bitten. Except that they sometimes do. Oh and there's a "boss zombie" who is faster and smarter than the other zombies because he was the head scientist on this project, see? In other words this crapfest doesn't even stay true to it's own premise and keeps contradicting itself. So what we end up with is a zombie move without zombies, a horror film without horror and a remake that isn't a remake. All they did was take the title of a movie with a built in fanbase and try to trick them into seeing this piece of crap which unsuccessfully tries to ripoff other movies. The ONLY bright point in this thing was Mena Suvari. Unlike a lot of others I thought she did a pretty decent job. Unfortunately for her, her character was just as badly written as the rest of this "movie".Stay away!</fullReview>

And Mena Suvari. These are two well-respected actors, and so this was going to be an AWESOME zombie movie! Argh...what a let-down! My husband and I were both shocked at the quickness with which Ving Rhames' character was killed off. We were positive he was going to be brought back to life as an all-powerful zombie, but he wasn't. It was sad. Are things that bad for Ving that he needed to take a role in the most horribly done zombie movie EVER??? This was not a good film for Mena Suvari, either. While she is usually a capable actress, her performance in this film was very flat. There was nothing redeeming about it.I felt cheated by this movie. It was a waste of time. I hope Diary of the Dead is better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A total hack job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is nothing anywhere near the premise set up for any of the "of the dead" movies. Steve Miner has done his own movie here and placed the title of the Romero work to try and draw fans from the "of the dead" movies to see his hack job that he has done here. It was a total let down in ever form of the expression. Ving Rhames does not reprise his role from the Dawn of the Dead movie and most of the characters would never make it in any actual Romero movie. In my opinion do not rent this movie if you expect it to be of the caliber set by the Romero films. Anyone who has enjoyed the Romero films will be sorely disappointed by this film especially due to the addition of the spider-man zombies and yes believe it or not gun toting zombies firing at people. Steve Miner has lost total base with what Romero was trying to portrait in his of the dead series and he should go back and watch the original series if he is to ever take up another Romero film in trying to bring it up to date for the viewing audience. I hope this helps those thinking of renting this film much less buying it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well first off giving this movie a 3 out of 10 is being nice from what i have seen of it so far, not being finished and what i have read here. when i picked it up to rent along with diary of the dead my first thought was awesome maybe the same guys who remade dawn decided to give day a shot. i honestly never liked the speed of the zombies in the new version of dawn of the dead but as it stuck mostly to the original story line i was OK with it. After seeing the opening for this supposed remake of day of the dead, i had already determined that they had fallen far from the original story line. *(spoiler of original) In the original day of the dead made by George A. Romero the world had already been overrun by zombie's and the military aspect was a group of military people hold out in an underground bunker, going out every so often hoping to find survivors by way of helicopter. with all to only end in tragedy as all good zombie flicks do with only a few people getting out alive, and in my opinion the funniest zombie moment i have seen with a zombie named bub. (end spoiler of original)* well i do plan on finishing this movie and seeing just how bad it really is and then promptly giving the director a lot of hate on his site if i can find one. and then i may see the alternate ending to see what this idiot thought it should have ended like. hell i'm fine if no one survives in a zombie flick at the end just as long as the damn thing is believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disgrace to Romero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is not a remake of 1985s Day, the new version is a disgrace to the wonderfully crafted story lines of its predecessors. The new Day strays far from the roots of Romero's previous efforts and alters the entire view of a zombie movie. Sub-par acting, poor scripting, poor writing, and over the top makeup and special effects truly ruin an opportunity to update a "straight to video" classic in 1985s Day. Instead, the movie tries to violate all previous zombie efforts by countering every innovative idea in the past 40 years of zombie movie history. Fortunately, Romero only had his name tied to the movie as a reference for the story, and hopefully, others will learn from this excruciatingly painful take on a horror master's classic vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Dead... or Resident Evil remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a few issues with this "remake". As a remake, you want to preserve a similar storyline, yet update effects, dialogue, and characters. The characters names that were kept had no connection with their origin (aside from being in the military of course). Bud (a.k.a. Bub) is given a bit of a back-story, but could've been written out all together. The underground bunker only becomes relevant in the last 30 minutes of the movie. Worst of all, the origin of the virus is explained.What about the stars of the movie? Of course, the undead. This is when you have to forget you're watching a Dead remake. As in the Dawn of the Dead remake (which I enjoyed), the zombies can run. This adds to the terror, yet believable enough to keep you entertained without completely taking away from the original series. In Day of the Dead, they also jump, repel, and scale walls and ceilings. Transitioning to a zombie is a bit ridiculous. One minute you're carrying on a conversation, then you kinda zone out for a few seconds, and *poof* your eyes turn white, skin's already rotting, and you're looking for food (unless you're a vegetarian).I kinda liked the actors. Mena Suvari isn't a great female lead. Ving Rhames plays a military version of his Dawn character, but was underused in this film. Way too many teenage characters. Credits even got the lead character's name wrong and didn't bother putting in the names of some of other characters in the credits. Dialogue was fairly cheesy and storyline was lazy and kinda predictable.Why a rating of 4? If you remove the Dead name from the movie and market it as just a zombie movie, it's a good B-movie. Plenty of kill scenes, if not a little over the top. Makeup was pretty convincing. A good movie to watch at 2 in the morning when the bars close.As for the climax ending... turn the movie off. You can come up with a better one by using your imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK what can we say about this film. The only one who could act in it was mina suvari whos focus probably held the movie together. Though annalynne mcord held my attention to the screen for just being stunning....... I'll forgive her for poor acting but no one else! I wonder if suvari was rolling her eyes at everyones silly acting. The script seemed to be written by a 15 year old. There was practically no building of characters or plot twists thatweren't expected. On the plusside I was entertained the whole way through the movie. All I will say is I'm glad during an apocalypse some girls still wear lip gloss and push up bra's.... Also the zombie effects, gore and the way they moved was better than 90% of the zombie movies out there, I seems strange they would invest such cool effects for a movie with no script and amateur camera work! Anyway don't expect much and don't take it seriously just sit back and enjoy. With the amazing effects and mina suvari as lead actress you would think they could have done so much more with this, never mind. PS it has nothing to do with the original movie as best as i could tell for those geek fans of romero! Oh and look out for one of the lead actors eating his own eye when he's turned classic :-)</fullReview>

The quality of the script, the direction, the acting are all what you'd except from a film made by a cable channel. Romero's films had social context and underlying messages. This film says nothing about humans aside from the fact that they can't remake good films. Say what you will about zombie movies, but the few rules that zombie movies share, such as zombies not having the ability to do human things are not present here. One of the characters becomes a zombie and doesn't attack people because he's a vegetarian, a fact that is mentioned offhand in the beginning of the story. Also there are zombies driving cars and climbing walls. Don't waste your time with this garbage dump, if you've never seen the original "Day of the Dead", watch that instead. If you have seen the original "Day of the Dead" and want to see a remake, grab a few buddies and film one in the backyard because it'll turn out ten times better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day of the Dead (the original) is a good movie. Day of the Dead (the remake) is a piece of unwatchable trash which has nothing to do with the original. It's more cheaply made than a super 8 movie shot by a monkey.How can everything in a single movie suck so bad? The story, the effects, and especially the actors (if they are actors, that is.) The zombies, for some reason, develop super-powers allowing them to walk on ceilings and run at amazing speeds. How stupid. Even more ridiculous was the short blond's idea to keep the zombie soldier with her...why? WHY?? Because she likes him? Because he follows orders? What? I guess this was the attempt to re-use the Bub character from the original. But that character had a purpose to exist. This movie doesn't!What was the point of calling this movie Day of the Dead? Obviously, as with Diary of the Dead (which is worse than this one), George Romero is making a final effort to cash-out his name and zombie franchise for a few extra bucks. There's nothing wrong with that, but when fans of his old movies get screwed out of their time and money because of this lame trash, that's ripping people off.This movie is a fraud. Do not watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few points to start off. It's Poorly made, has terrible actors,and the plot is virtually nonexistent witch leads to a huge exposition scene at the end.Now lets talk zombies. The zombies are capable of advanced acrobatics at one point one seems to jump a clear four feet to catch hold of a ventilation cover (there's someone on the other side crawling inside the vent.) While on the subject of the zombies something that actually had me laughing on the floor of my room was a transformation sequence in witch a man in a hospital bed instantaneously turns into a zombie his face rots and his eyes glaze over in about three seconds and before you know it he's eating his wife.So amongst the vegetarian zombies(No seriously) The zombie out of the Matrix that dodges bullets in a corridor with four people firing at him and the fact that every zombie runs and fires weapons you have no fear of confusing this with the Romero classic, witch is probably the only good thing you can give this film.Up points. Nice special effects that is literally all I can think of and they are no where near as good as Tom Savini's.

		<fullReview>Yes you may find the concept of zombies to be 'silly', but you can at least still see genuinely interesting ideas within the subtext of zombie classics from the likes of Romero.Unfortunately, Day of the Dead fails at both style and substance. It's not a remake of the Romero film of the same name...more a re-envisioning. And after watching this, I can't help but feel a pointless one at that.The story is lame and the characters are a bit rubbish. In particular, the character of Nina had me rolling my eyes. She couldn't decide if she was scared or without fear...it grew immensely annoying.Yet the character of Salazar grew through-out and turned into quite a likable character, particularly due to Cannon's genuine acting. Outside of that, the acting proved inconsistent. Sometimes I was genuinely impressed by Suvari; at other times, not so much. But this is due to the lacklustre script. Like the story, it proved flat.The music was nice (yay), lots of shaky-cam (neigh) and the make-up/props were not too bad (meh).At times, I actually felt like I was watching Left 4 Dead: The Movie (a compliment, I suppose). But I advise you stick to the game, and I advise Romero fans to look elsewhere too.This was going to receive a low 5, but the ending annoyed me so much that it had to get a 4. There's nothing new here for zombie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Romero's stuff. So don't take this the wrong way... This movie should never have been called Day of the Dead! If at all Steve Miner and Jeffrey Reddick should have left Romero's name off the movie and called it "The Day before The Day Of The Dead".There were only a few loose similarities to the original film such as: A character named Capt. Rhodes, another named Sarah, and the Zombie du jour... 1985 "Bub"... in 2008... "Bud". Bud the vegetarian, he doesn't like human flesh! I have yet to see a Zombie chew the crap out of a head of lettuce.. Bud, who loves Cpl Sarah. Bud should have been drooling over everyone in that Hummer. Even the original "BUB" had limited expression. BUD acted more like a child, not a Zombie.If there was no reference to Romero's version, this would be a great zombie flick. It had the "Zombie Nouveau" style like 28 Days Later as well as a few classic "moaning shufflers" in the mix. Because of the title "George A. Romero's Day of the Dead" it was a disappointment.The upside... it had plenty of moments the kept you watching. Plus the "Black Satire" of the Horror Genre from the character Salazar is worth the watch. Let a friend watch this with you, but don't tell them what it is, if they are a fan of the Genre they will enjoy this movie. You tell them what it is... watch the disappointment flow.</fullReview>

The zombie movements - crawling around ceilings, jumping like Spiderman with a rattlesnake in his knickers, hurling themselves out of high windows and not even breaking bones, just getting up and running! Awful!!!! 2. The "Beautiful" factor, so typical of modern horror. One of the best things about Romeros original trilogy was the fact the protagonists were very "ordinary" looking, like run of the mill folk. Here we are expected to accept Mena Suvari as the karate-kicking, kick-ass heroine, an Army Corporal no less! Oh do me a favor, she looks about 13. Another massive gripe is the casting of Dr "Frankenstein" Logan, who is ridiculously handsome and looks like he's wandered off the set of Desperate Housewives and ended up here by mistake. Shocking! 3. Bub! - This was the biggest travesty of all. In the original movie, Bub was a fascinating character, subdued and passive, with no explanation to his temperament given or indeed needed, and the relationship between him and Logan was a highpoint. Here Bub is renamed Bud and is a dozy, annoying Army private who becomes somewhat passive after being bitten. He spends the next 30 minutes staring at Suvari's butt and swooning and the reason he has no desire to bite people? You sure you're ready for this? OK, don't say I didn't warn you... he doesn't bite people because before he turned into the walking dead he was a VEGETARIAN!!!!!!!! I scored this movie 2 out of 10, and I was being generous. Probably only suitable for the cerebrally challenged or teenagers. Or are they one and the same?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible remake with CGI zombies and digital blood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A town is infected with a flu-like virus that ends up turning the populace into hungry flesheaters.When the military comes in to quarantine the joint a ragtag group of survivors led by Mena Suvari try to escape to safety."Day of the Dead" is bad to the bone,even by the zombie movie standards.Here the zombies not only run around fast as hell but gain superhuman strength and can shoot.What happened to creepy walking dead from Romero's zombie movies or Lucio Fulci's gorefests?The action is fast paced and there is lots of digital blood.The gore is lame and computer generated,so I was extremely disappointed.The love story between Mena Suvari and zombified soldier is beyond retarded.It's okay to keep the zombie in a car,because he was a vegetarian in his human life.Avoid this piece of garbage like the plague.3 out of 10-only for lovely as usual Mena Suvari.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new breed of zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's a pity that more and more titles get shoddy remakes, although i don't consider them remakes, but rather a rip-off of the name of a good movie, just to make people go to theaters to see the piece of garbage that someone has convinced people to produce and release. I mean, seeing the first 3 Alien movies again, just prior to watching this makes me think whether it would have been more suitable to have Xenomorphs instead of zombies in that particular situation, doing the same exact actions, but I guess we can't have 2 Alien movies being released about 6 months from one another. What I'm trying to say is what is the point of zombies when they are running and jumping and retaining their memories and intellect but still losing half their face, getting a pale complexion and being interested only in taking out and your guts? And oh, yeah, a VEGETERIAN ZOMBIE?!?Looking back, I think it's more suitable to call the antagonists of the movie "The Infected", since they're not really the creatures we git used to calling zombies. I mean the expression itself "You look as dead as a zombie" implies someone lifeless not firing a gun or driving a car or climbing up a ladder.And what about the moment in older zombie movies where people thought the zombies are their relatives and would discover they've been bitten not until they're 5ft away from them(or even closer) In this movie they were running and jumping so fast you barely have a chance to get to know what the hell is going on.The first 2 Resident Evil movies had proper zombies, and those movies are not that old, so why is the trend to make zombies do all that complicated stuff they do in this movie? There is no suspense, no proper freak-out moments, it's just carnage. Reminds me of (Oh, yes) AVP:R. And last but not least I think this film is in the wrong category because, as was the remake before it "Dawn Of The Dead" i see this movie not as a thriller or a horror, but rather like a dark comedy(especially the bits where the infected drag a corpse with them to finish it of later), and if there are people who think this is a real horror/thriller movie, that's a cause for concern.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a re-make in the loosest sense possible but thats a blessing really because it shouldn't be associated with any of Romero's work anyway.What the film has going for it is tangibly threatening zombies - nu-zombies as it were, the kind that run and bite and even jump, made them seem like they could easily over-run the town. Their abilities made the scenes of carnage and chaos seem quite authentic and disturbing. Mena Suvari does well as the soldier trying to get out of the disaster, reacting the most appropriately and believably through out. This is where the good points end.The rest of the film is just a giant cliché, padded with over the top, needless "Look at what we can do" special effects. Steve Miner obviously didn't get the memo about token black comedy characters being phased out in the late 90s. All the characters act more like they're playing a game of paint ball then trying to fend for their lives against hordes of vicious, fasting moving monsters with whole-heartedly pants dialogue littering every scene. The zombies act more and more inconsistently through out the film, the 'friendly zombie' is poor beyond words and the zombie soldiers who ran out firing their guns actually made me laugh.Its not a crime that this is a bad film, its a crime that its a bad film bearing the Day of the Dead's and George Romero's name which will no doubt entice people to watch what is essentially a very poor knock-off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie because it 'took place' in Leadville, CO. I mean, who wouldn't want zombies in Leadville, if you've ever been there, you understand where I'm coming from. The creaters of this movie have made it painfully obvious that they have never been anywhere near Leadville Colorado. Apparently timber line holds no meaning for them. Last time I was there, it didn't take half an hour to get across town. The dialogue was also pretty cheesy. I was pretty fond of Bud's character. I mean who wouldn't be fond of a lovable vegetarian zombie. All in all though, the characters lacked depth, I wouldn't have felt bad if they'd all died. In fact, that would have been pretty pleasing. All in all though, I wasn't impressed, I'd rather watch resident evil any day. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A VERY pale shade of Romero.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited when I first saw this DVD. After all, Snyder's "Dawn of the Dead" was a taut, chilling and darkly humorous retelling of Romero's (arguably) second most famous zombie tale. Plus, Ving Rahmes! I was thinking that Ving's cop character from "Dawn" somehow survived and made it to the "Day". Then I watched it. Sigh. There were some okay aspects that make this at least an average "zombie flick". The titular undead citizens were genuinely creepy (the brief scene in the hospital where one crawled on the ceiling stands out) and the action/gore sequences were entertainingly over the top.The problem is, the title of this movie shouldn't have been "Day of the Dead". Perhaps "Nose Bleed" or "Project: Wilfire". Aside from a few cannibalistic corpses and an ass-hole military guy (Cough!! Nick Cannon!! COUGH!!), there is VERY LITTLE that connects this to the original 1985 original.Don't get me wrong; I'm all for well-done "re-imaginings" (Battlestar Gallactica anyone?). With this straight-to-DVD release, though, it almost seems like the filmmakers made a zombie movie and somehow got a hold of the rights to Romero's movie in order to sell copies. Maybe I'm wrong.One thing I do know. Romero it ain't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies are not supposed to be fast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with George A. Romero with the concept of fast Zombies are stupid. Zombies should rely on stealth over speed, since a decomposing corpse's legs would fall apart if they ran as fast as the zombies in this movie. I also found the crawling on the ceiling a bit much. If you think about, if you came back from the dead wouldn't you be a little stiff? You would think they would have a little rigor mortis setting in. I'm a bit of a Romero purist on this issue. I found the writing for this movie horrible and hardly very interesting at all. I also hated the remake of the "Dawn of the Dead". However, I enjoyed "28 Days later" and "28 weeks later" since they were not really Zombies. Because of this I will let them slide. I actually enjoyed those movies.</fullReview>

I can understand a monster/zombie movie with a bad scripting, bad effects, and bad acting because I am watching it to see zombies rip the flesh off young girls or pick at the entrails of townspeople. I did not rent it to see the "vegetarian zombie" This is not a boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, bay get bit by a zombie and becomes one but does not eat her story! To have zombies that do not eat people is like having Oreos with cream filling. Does George Romero know what you are doing because I am telling on you!!!! .....and in Colorado of all places.... sheesh.And need I mention that 3/4's of the movie actually takes place not in the day as the title hints, but the night. I am becoming overly picky but you are distorting the visionary genius of a great man!!!! Have you no shame?!?!?!?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Waste of Money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was not George Romero's "Day of the Dead". This movie does not even closely resemble the original and should have a different title altogether. The remake of "Dawn of the Dead" was a decent adaptation that was somewhat in line with the original (I emphasize "somewhat") but this flick is a different beast altogether. I really hope Romero did not sign off on this hunk of corn-filled poo.What we have here is a low budget film and horrible screenplay that degrades and makes fun of the social commentary the original "Day of the Dead" possessed. Were the filmmakers even aware that the original was part of a trilogy (or quadrilogy if you count "Land of the Dead")? Apparently not as the zombie plague has not even struck yet when this newer version begins. In fact it's just contained in one small Colorado town! WTF?? Die-hard fans of this genre want world wide zombie apocalypse! The original "Day of the Dead" was more realistic with its Army references than this pile of trash. Mena Suvari (I doubt I spelled her name right) is totally unbelievable as a U.S. Army Corporal. In fact her corporal stripes are so large it looks like the wardrobe department found them on sale at Disneyland. Moving on, Nick Cannon's character makes fun of "Bud" because he's a new enlistee and bumbles around a lot. Hey, Nick! Guess what, you didn't have any stripes on your collar either so I guess you would be relatively new as well. Did the people who wrote this screenplay pull all of their Army references from "Sgt. Bilko"?? Pauly Shore's "In the Army Now" was more authentic. Jesus. Oh, and the fact that good ol' "Bud" keeps saying "Yes, Ma'am" to a junior non-commissioned officer is awesome. If anyone had said "Yes, sir" to me while I was in service, they would have immediately been corrected. You would say either "Yes, Corporal" or "Yes, Sergeant" not "Yes, sir or ma'am". And poor Ving Raimes. He at one point uttered that he didn't know what was going on. Well he should. He was in the previous remake of "Dawn of the Dead"!! Looks like he just needed a paycheck.Speaking of more unrealistic moronic items, do most gun shops here in the U.S. carry automatic Kalashnikov AK-47s?? How come the 9mm's all sounded like they had silencers on them? When our fearless corporal drives through a bunch of zombies, there's not a spot of gore anywhere on the Hummer. And I mean nowhere and they had to have run down like 20 of the damn things!! Oh, and Army Hummers don't use keys or have doors that lock. Civilian Hummers do. What was the point of the fat radio DJ?? Why did people decay instantly when turning into a zombie?? Decay was just part of the natural process and evolution throughout the films. This was instant and frickin' dumb. How come everything everyone does is amazingly stupid??? Skip this film if you're going in looking for a remake similar to "Dawn of the Dead". This is NOT a remake. It is a zombie film with a different take on zombies and that's it. I gave it one point for some of the gore effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start? This movie blew on so many levels...The plot contains no references to the original at all. I understand it s a remake, and nobody wants to see a frame-by-frame version. Setting the story in a small town instead of a Military compound is ridiculous though! Granted, the movie does move to some sort of missile silo later in the movie...for maybe the last 15 minutes.Almost none of the characters are the same in this one. Captain Rhodes for instance, dies in the first 20 minutes. To top it off, it wasn't even his classic death from the original.The cast is horrible. Like, Sci-Fi channel horrible...Nick Cannon can't act at all and probably shouldn't...ever. He was the worst character, but they were all pretty bad.In classic Romero films, the zombies movie slow and are dumb. In recent zombie movies, they run. Cool. In this movie they run up walls and, dart across ceilings, plus they all move like they're having seizures. It's terrible.The effects are pathetic in this movie. It's so painfully CGI that it hurts.Just avoid this film at all costs.</fullReview>

Nor the fact that the CGI sucked, the plot was all over the place, it hardly resembled the original movie in any shape or form...Well, you get the idea.All I'm saying is, if you're expecting Day of The Dead (2008) to be the kind of re-make that Dawn of The Dead was...Don't hold your breath or you will be as utterly &amp; bitterly disappointed as I was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK... The movies overall spirit is right on the mark. Director Steve Miner wanted to make a zombie movie and he did. The problems with this movie lay in the meat of the script. The characters in this movie cover the normal span of what you would expect in the zombie movie genre. Everybody is basically too smart or too dumb for their own good. I would like to believe one of these days a perfect zombie film will be written. It is obvious why this film went straight to DVD.Movies often interpret military rank and file with little to no understanding. A corporal in the US Army has no rank first off. They may be a Non Commissioned Officer but with little to no authority. Nothing drives me crazier, as a former military man myself, than somebody calling a US Army Non Commissioned officer "Sir or Ma'am." The movie try's to play off of this in the beginning but still doesn't get it right. A corporal is simply referred to as "Corporal." Nothing more nothing less.I hate judging a movie simply on its depiction of our men and women in uniform but it ruins it for me because no effort is put into such a basic piece of the film. Suvari's rank on her uniform's collar and hat looks like they were pulled out of a Cracker Jack box. Head down to your local GI Shop and buy the right props. While you're at it pay the guy behind the counter to tell you how the military is structured.I did enjoy the fact that the zombies were able to literally run around until they started crawling up the ceilings. If somebody is going to make a film about zombies a couple of basic rules should be followed. Read a Max Brooks book for pity's sake. The movie takes too much time and liberty recreating zombies. Passivity within the zombie community can be achieved if you are a vegetarian according to this film. If the writers and directors would have spent more time developing the characters, this film would have been so much better. This film instead focuses too much on gore without substance.The films structure follows what you would expect of any zombie film however. The Grade B characters are introduced, the zombies come around, everybody dies and there are head shots aplenty.This film is worth a look if you are a fan of the genre. If you are expecting to find the utter perfection of the first film you are going to be sorely disappointed. If an attempt had been made to follow the footsteps of the original this remake would have had the potential for excellence. The "shoot and escape" concepts of modern zombie films is getting a little tiresome.The whole point of the original film was to show the effects that long term isolation has on people no matter how safe they might be. This film instead focuses on the escape plan...again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason you should watch this movie is to possibly enlighten yourself on what a zombie film is not, as well as what a terrible, in every aspect of the word this "film" truly is.First off, I'm not going to go into detail about it, but there's a vegetarian zombie. yes, its an oxymoron. apparently these zombies retain parts of their human selves, and one of them apparently retains his predilection for plant matter, rather than human flesh and brains. i mean come on, at least make him eat SOMETHING alive.Secondly, zombies CANNOT, i repeat CANNOT: crawl on walls or ceilings, jump abnormally high or for long distances, use tools, turn on each other, understand human speech, locate specific addresses, fire weapons, perform medial tasks such as taking out cases from the back of a truck of or in ANY manner, especially in a civilized way, as these "zombies" appear to do. if ANY of the above are used, which they all were, you do not have a zombie film, or even a good film at all, you have a stinking pile of refuse(crap).i thought that the one saving grace would be ving rhames, but i was wrong to put my hope in him.the make up was acceptable for a low-budget film. i could let that slide, i wont let a lack of money get in the way of me enjoying a film. past that, EVERYTHING was terrible. i mean I've seen really low budget movies where the CGI wasn't all that terrible, but this was despicable. mina suvari wasn't bad though, and ving was, well, ving.they used the worst possible sound effects, like the sound tech literally said "hmm, lets use splatter sound effect number....5." The extras looked as if they were given no direction on how a zombie would act, what so ever. it was so bad that it seemed that they had never even SEEN a zombie film before.one of the worst things is that when they turn, its sudden. they'll stop in mid-sentence and stare off into space. then immediately their skin will rot then the eyes will turn gray. sooooo bad.i don't want to say much more, because there's just too much to say, but this is NOT a zombie film, and this is NOT even an almost entertaining film. its so mind boggling to think about why somebody would put this slump of vile camera shots and sounds together and actually put their name on it. i hope that the entire film crew is mortified of what they have thrown together: a disaster.this director has succeeded in taking a brilliant classic and completely bastardizing it all the while completely disrespecting George Romero as an artist. if you see this in your local movie rental store, please completely ignore it. if you are a big fan of zombie films, it will get your blood boiling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: Day of the Dead 2008, very light spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I received a screener for Day of the Dead yesterday and watched it last night. I'll write the following and try to avoid spoilers but if it takes spoilers to make you decide not to watch the movie, then I'll give you spoilers.First off, the cover art (zombie vomiting, eyeball in middle of mess)is deceptive. It never happened in the movie and would only have made it worse if it had.This is NOT a remake of the Romero classic Day of the Dead. The zombies aren't zombies. They're infected, much like 28 Days/Weeks Later. Whatever they've got, they don't go into it much during the movie, just a trite ridiculous explanation and some graphics showing cells being infected.Now, before I get into it, the good. The movie looks good. The DP did quite the competent job on it. Its well lit, the scenes are well composed and there are some very nice shots, particularly of sunset/sunrises over Colorado. OK, that's the good. I mean that ALL of the good. What they did with the movie was terrible.The script is terrible but let's face it, scripts in zombie movies are less important than having a sense of story. I know they're supposed to go hand-in-hand but they don't alway. In this case, there seemed to be a lot of improvisation, a fair amount of after-the-shoot-is-wrapped ADR/story lines implanted. A good example is the 'hot girl' (I think that's how they identify her in the end credits) who decides to walk home through the woods. After about 20 shots of the tattoo around her belly button, she's attacked and pulled off screen. Wow. Rather than show the obligatory splash of blood to show something bad happens to her, a big wad of flesh is thrown into a puddle. Hey! Its the tattoo! And the bellybutton! The actors are fine, just not given much to work with. Mena Suvari (who is actually an excellent actress)is given a thankless task. I'm guessing she saw what Sarah Polley did in the Dawn remake and thought that was a plan. Having said that, its a little ridiculous that anyone expects her to kick arse and take names but that's the role. Hope she didn't thank anyone for it. What made Polley's part so much better was that she didn't kick ass. She was just trying to survive. Polley was good. Not Suvari's best work. Probably her worst.AnnaLynne McCord, fresh off a stint of the now unwatchable Nip/Tuck. In the show, she is Portia Rossi's daughter who is Anally-Obsessed-Because-She-Wants-To-Be-A-Virgin (henceforth referred to a AOBSWTBAV which really doesn't seem shorter)and who poisons Julia by putting mercury in her fruit cake and serving her slices over the whole season. Heck, I've wanted to poison Julia more than a few times, but doesn't anyone in Hollywood know...NO ONE eats fruitcake. AnnaLynne looks good just standing around. She really is a beautiful girl but its a good thing that she can't act her way out of a bag; No one expects her to in this film. If the film had a more competent director, they'd have convinced her to at least skin off her clothes at some point and give the viewer something to see, something that Nip/Tuck's been trying to hint at all season.Ving Rhames, also a fine actor, is mostly wasted. Just when I thought he was going to get kind of interesting, he vanished in the movie. Won't spoil what happens to him; Its already rotten.The 'zombies' become infected and their eyes turn white. Their skin instantly becomes porous and shredded and they get hungry. They'll apparently eat anything. One of them grabs his own eye out and downs it. Its the Zombie Ourobourus. They also get superpowers. They jump, leap, crawl on ceilings. They jump out of buildings from four stories up and keep going. The film editors use a BS technique to make them scary where they accelerate their movements by 50% and then jumpcut their motion so, fast as they seem, they look like they're on top of you instantaneously. Its editing room nonsense, but that's the movie.Summary: Walk, don't run, away from this movie. Do not pass it and decide to grab it in the pile of rentals. Do not buy it. Avoid it. There are some things that you can't unsee and there are some moments in life you'll never get back. Here's a gift. 1 1/2 hours to do anything you want...don't waste it on this dreck</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Zombie Movie bites the dust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well well what can i say about this movie that hasn't been said. Coming from the genre of movie lovers that grew up with original classics such as Night of the living dead/dawn of the dead, i was expecting a modern version of the original day of the dead.The first 15 mins i thought the film stood a good chance of succeeding yet after the hospital outbreak and the following predictable plot i was gutted that another zombie flick had bitten the dust. Why oh why didn't the film start off from the ending of the modern DOFD is a mystery. Surely this would have been a better story than some town getting infected with some Resident Evil style T-virus?The zombies weren't consistent at all. We had one guy climbing the ceiling then others jumping in harmony from hospital windows, then others driving around, even firing their guns???? The end part in the tunnel with 'bud' the zombies were suddenly docile similar to the original ones yet turned into 100m sprinters after they spotted the heroine. As for Captain Rhodes eating his own eye and turning into a terminator style machine this didn't cut the mustard. And why do we have to have corny one liners from stupid squaddies who ccome from the ghetto? Is it really necessary. Kills any atmosphere the film had if it had any in the first place. The bunker sequence was awful. They apparently find this place. After 20 secs a hundred zombies break thru and to their amazement they find the doctor who just so happens to be involved in the whole ghastly affair. Then we have the usual stuff of being locked in a room full of gas canisters. Surprise surprise!!!! If this is the future of zombie flicks then i despair. As for people saying George Romero would have been any better then i can remind you of his last poor attempt in Land of the dead. Is there any director out there that can bring the suspense and atmosphere back that us Zombie fans want?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The excellent zombie-film or more precisely zombie-thresher Steve Majner has removed really smart horror-action. At once it is visible - 18 million dollars have spent knowingly. In my opinion that have removed this best last decade. 1. A film very dynamical. Without failures, sagging, pauses and to that similar. Action begins from first minutes and proceeds till the end of a film. 2. All is removed on the fair static chamber without fashionable nowadays slow motion shooting and shootings by a hand-held camera. Therefore to look this it is pleasant. Any shivering, fragmentary shots and clips. 3. A minimum of computer effects. 4. The make-up of the zombie and effects connected with it are magnificent. 5. Many real tricks with participation of stuntman. 6. Actors play qualitatively. Therefore the film was pleasant to me more than other untwisted films of this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor remake/rethink of the Romero semi-classic where no one cared enough to do more than phone in their contribution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of some military accident a small town is quarantined because the dead are coming back to life.Focusing on a young woman in the military from the town (who has returned home as part of the army force) and her friends and family it is a just okay horror film (if and only if you don't take it as a remake of the George Romero film).Directed by Steve Miner, a man who can make some enjoyable if unremarkable films (My Father is a Hero, Warlock, Soulman, Halloween H20), this is clearly the work of a man on auto pilot and a man who's too long in the TV trenches (Miner has been producing and directing for TV a great deal over the last decade). There is no tension and no passion. The film is put together reasonably well but you can tell no one really cared. A case in point is Ving Rhames, as the head of the military force. For the first time I've ever seen he phones in his performance and is such a non-entity that I wasn't even sure it was him.As a remake of or compared to, the Romero film of the same title, which is not mentioned anywhere that I could see on screen, this film is beyond bad. It simply takes the idea of the military and zombies and mangles it. Its awful. Its completely unconnected to any of the Romero originals or remakes and exists purely in its own twisted little world.3 out of 10 on its own. 1 out of ten if you think its related to the Romero cannon of films.(Lastly I have to wonder are we actually at the point where any grade "C" actors and actresses can be put into a uniform and called soldiers? No one looks like they were in the military. Maybe its the war in thee Middle East, but no one really looks like a soldier even remotely.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some genius decided to set this 'remake' of DAY of the Dead entirely at night, and it's this level of stupidity (that exists throughout the entire movie) that makes it such a mess, and something of an insult to Romero's brilliant original.So, what exactly is wrong with Steve Miner's Day of the Dead '08?Well, firstly, the zombies in this one (the result of a man-made flu-like virus that has run amok) possess super-strength, run like the clappers, fire guns, have the ability to leap like a panther, and crawl up walls like a spider. And fire causes them to instantly disintegrate (which proves pretty handy at times). Is that daft enough for you?No? Well how about this?one of the zombies doesn't attack the living! The reason: when he was alive, he was a vegetarian. If he were dead, Romero would be spinning in his grave (or crawling from it, to tear out the entrails of those responsible for this movie).And as if to irk the bespectacled father of the modern zombie movie even further, Steve Miner has another of his creatures eat his own eyeball (which makes no sense whatsoever), and turns the scientist responsible for the outbreak into a super-zombie: more intelligent than your usual reanimated corpse, this one crawls around the ventilation ducts of his top-secret lab, grabbing victims from above.The casting for this remake is also pretty bad, with diminutive Mena Suvari playing a tough soldier (she's pretty, but totally unconvincing), Nick Cannon as the stereotypical bad-ass with a love of weaponry, and a selection of young, good looking no-names chosen to appeal to the teen demographic. And to top it all, Ving Rhames, who starred in the recent (and decent) Dawn of the Dead remake, returns for this film too, but as a completely different character!Finally, the excellent slow-burn tension, oppressive atmosphere, social commentary, and realistic make-up effects of Romero's 1985 gore-fest have been replaced by mindless spectacle, MTV style editing, and cheesy CGI enhanced splatter.As you have probably surmised, this film is something of an embarrassment: full of plot holes, jaw-droppingly awful moments, and general shoddiness that will no doubt cause Romero-philes to froth at the mouth in rage. But at the same time, it is this complete and utter idiocy (along with some fun action set-pieces and a fair smattering of gore) that also makes the film rather compelling viewing and ultimately quite entertaining.Miner, who has proved in the past that he is capable of making a reasonable movie, manages some effectively scary moments, with an escape from a zombie infested hospital being the highlight of the whole shebang: the heroes crawl through an air duct, followed by a relentless, legless creature (ie. he has no legs?not legless as in completely drunk), and escape into a car park where they are set upon by even more of the undead. This scene is pure popcorn horror, with lots of bloody mayhem as the living dispatch the dead in a variety of gruesome ways (with Cannon using a saw attached to a crutch as a very effective weapon!).Not the completely unwatchable disaster that I had heard it was, but certainly not worthy enough to bear the title 'Day of the Dead', Miner's film can be fun, so long as you try and forget about Romero's masterpiece (difficult, I know) and just revel in its schlockiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS AHEAD**** Why was this named Day of the Dead other than to cash in on the history of the original? It has no resemblance (other than character names) to the original and comes across as a 28 Days Later ripoff rather than a Day of the Dead remake/homage.....Let me break it down.In the original Day of the Dead, the zombie epidemic was in full force, in this "remake", the "zombie" epidemic/virus outbreak is just starting. (?).....In the original, the characters spent the majority of the movie in an army bunker, in this they spend 5 minutes at the end of the movie in some sort of lab in the woods. (?) In the original, the zombies are slow (from decay, etc.), in this, they are superfast and can run on the ceiling (but can't jump up to a ventilation vent cover?).........In the original, the zombies are killed by a shot to the head, in this they can be killed by heating them up like popcorn until they explode. Maybe the "rage virus" does this to you.The characters had no resemblance whatsoever to their original counterparts.....since everyhting else had changed, why even use the original names. The character of Bud was totally misused and quite frankly stupid in this movie (vegeterian zombie wont eat meat or the women he loves, yet a mom zombie tries to eat her children)....no consistency whatsoever.I guess since Rhodes was a racist in the original, they had to make him a black man to be politically correct in this one.......dumb, dumb, dumb.Acting was sub par (Nick Cannon acting like a bad ass is a joke, looked like Urkel with a gun) and the effects were Sci Fi channel at best (high budget sci fi channel movie)......On its own, and by a different name, this would have been in the top 30% of the slew of direct to video zombie flix hitting the market, but as a DOD remake, it does not even come close to filling those shoes.....it doesn't even try them on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard that Day of the Dead had been re-made I was slightly sceptical as the original wasn't that enthralling. But I thought hey i'll give it another go, I shouldn't have bothered. Poor casting, poor acting, over use of special effects. And though I am not entirely sure but if this is supposedly a re-make there is very little if none left of the original. Poor film unless you feel the need to watch I wouldn't bother. Hollywood once again simply stealing old ideas that were not very good to begin with."In this terrifying remake of the George Romero classic, a group of scientists, military personnel and civilians find themselves battling for their lives against a plague of flesh eating ghouls. When a band of survivors seek shelter in an underground military bunker, they find themselves trapped with an even greater danger that lurks inside."Even the synopsis doesn't make the film sound exciting apart from the use of the word "terrifying". Which the film is not. I think that to be fair this film is going to do moderately well at the box office as it matches the interest of stupid cinema and the audience been dumbed down. What a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, another George Romero remake of one of his 'Dead' films, and the bar drops another few notches. After the disappointing remake of "NIGHT" in 1990, then the terrible remake of "DAWN" a couple of years ago, we now get a truly disgraceful remake of "DAY", showing just how much film-making attitudes have changed since Romero's "DAY" debuted in 1985.This movie has definitely been aimed at audiences where character, story, logic, and patience is a hindrance, and that colour and movement is all that matters.Like a bad music video, this new "DAY" continually beats you over the head, thinking that over-editing and drug-induced pacing is all that is required to make a horror movie work.Steve Miner, who has directed enjoyable genre films such as Friday THE 13TH PART 2, HOUSE, and LAKE PLACID, seems to be trying to channelling the "talent" of Michael Bay or Marcus Nispel, shaking the camera and jump-cutting like crazy. Is it a contractual obligation now to shoot a film in this fashion? The acting is awful, the dialogue worse (what do you expect from the writer of FINAL DESTINATION and TAMARA), and any layers and satire is certainly gone.While officially a remake, "DAY" more or less takes elements from Romero's film and then attatches them to a plot that is closer to 28 WEEKS LATER and I AM LEGEND. The element involving Bud is crude and awkward to say the least, and doesn't make any sense in context with the rest of the film.Gore is plentiful, but is practically all CGI. One longs for the complex, expertly handled on-set effects by Tom Savini, who gave us some truly eye-popping effects in the original "DAY".The way is left open for another, so I guess we'll have to endure a remake of LAND OF THE DEAD, directed by someone as non-talented as Marcus Nispel. Can't wait. By the way, the Australian DVD release date is May 14 (through Force Entertainment).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was a HUGE disappointment...:-(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay. Where do I begin? Well, let's start off with Steve Miner. Okay, as Donald trump would say, YOU'RE FIRED!!! The special effects crew, did the best that they could with such a low budget. (And trust me that is apparent.) This was nothing even closely resembling the original. NOTHING. This was not a way to pay homage to the great Mr. Romero, this was a requiem. I gave this 2 stars simply because it does have a lot of gore and such. I was deeply saddened by the lack of some of the central characters in the original. Where was Bubs? The mad scientist? The sneaky little homage to Stephen King. (If I even have to tell you about it, then you haven't seen the original enough.)Bubs was an important part of the movie. Romero was trying to say something to his audience. Instead, we are given a vegetarian zombie named Bud. Yes, I did say vegetarian zombie. :-( Maybe that was good for a chuckle, but come on, seriously. The lack of any true character building at all was missing as well. Instead of a bunch of maniacal military men taking over, instead we are given the military good guys, Mena Suvari. They weren't underground until the last 20 minutes or so of the movie. Again, a central theme in the original. Even as just another zombie movie, it would have been disappointing. True, Romero fans are going to be upset. I'm surprised that Romero himself isn't upset by this movie. Unless of course, he hasn't seen it yet. But to bill this as a Day of the dead remake is a joke. This movie is a disaster. This should have been a SciFi original. (They probably would have had a bigger budget..LOL.) My guess is that Mena and Nick did this for the paycheck. To be honest, I probably would have as well. However, as it stands this movie is a waste of time and a movie that should have went to a director that LOVES Romero, instead of one that is trying to get famous trying to do what Romero did and failed. He is now #2 of all time worst directors. (#1 of course is Ulli Lommel.)I hope that this was helpful to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was excited when I came across this movie, because the old one used to scare the hell out of me when I was little kid. This movie totally kicked ass. The zombies in this flick were more fierce and faster then anything ever seen before. It is a pure fright-fest that scares up a storm. This movie had a unique cast that you probably wouldn't normally see in a zombie flick, including Mena Suvari(American Pie 1&amp;2), Nick Cannon(Drumline), AnnaLynne McCord(The Haunting of Molly Hartley &amp; 90210), Michael Welch(All the Boys Love Mandy Lane and Twilight), Stark Sands(Generation Kill), Christa Campbell(The Wicker Man and 2001 Maniacs), Matt Rippy(Boogeyman 3) and Ving Rhames(Dawn of the Dead and Animal). This movie features some gruesome special effects and a new breed of gut slinging zombies and is very fast paced and intense and will have you jump out of your seat as these zombies ravish a small town and a group of survivors fight to stay alive. I definitely recommend this hard core flick. It kicks ass!!</fullReview>

Next time you people sit down to type up a movie complaint on here, write a screenplay instead. Otherwise, quit whining.True this film had plot holes. And true, it didn't relate to the other Living Dead movies we know, save for a few character names. But so the hell what? You've already seen Romero's Day of the Dead. Stop bitching that you didn't see it TWICE.My honest critique, having just finished the movie, is that it was 90 minutes of running, shooting, and splatter. I had fun watching it. Romero's works are holy to me. This wasn't one of them. But I still thoroughly enjoyed this movie, because it delivered exactly what it tried to . . zombies and chaos. Even the effects were good, so don't avoid it just because it's straight to video.Don't knock this one until you've tried it. And don't try it until you're ready to accept this isn't the 1985 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***CONTAINS SPOILERS***First off, I am a big fan of George Romero's. Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, and Land of the Dead (I have not seen Diary yet). I've seen all of the originals and enjoy them immensely. A good storyline and common sense driving the action makes a great zombie movie. With that said...This movie is a huge disappointment. First off, the character Nina must be bipolar to flip-flop as much as she does throughout the movie. First she's the scared girl who can't do anything for herself, then the bad-ass, then back to the scared girl, then back to the bad-ass. Terrible.Secondly, the only two people I actually thought were at least half decent in their roles were Mena Suvari and Ving Rhames. The whole recognition thing is just a joke (you'll understand when you see it), but I'm not slamming the actors for that, the whole story is just bad and the plot mechanics are nearly missing. I honestly cannot tell what Jeffrey Reddick was thinking when making the screenplay.Third, the special effects make up is a very nice touch, it really looks good. But the CGI special effects are, for lack of a better term, laughable. When you can tell the zombie who is lit on fire is standing in front of a black backdrop, the fire's light not even matching the bouncing light on the zombie, and the excruciatingly abrupt (and quite frankly, stupid) way they die just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. If you are trying to do some justice to the series, you either go all out (such as the remake of Dawn of the Dead) or rely on an actual stuntman sheathed in flames.Fourth, the action is too predictable. Just like almost every single other zombie movie, one character fires off almost an entire clip into a zombie's chest, then another shoots it in the head and says, "You have to shoot 'em in the head!" It was necessary the first time it appeared in a movie, and understandable the second time...now it is just old and no longer needed at all. People understand that to kill a zombie, you sever the head from the body or shoot the head.***** Watch out! MORE SPOILERS BELOW *****The invincible 'never-need-to-reload gun' comes into play. The zombies can crawl along walls and ceilings, stock humvees are bullet-proof, and canisters of compressed, flammable gas don't launch backwards after being ignited (for every action there is an equal an opposite reaction, thank you for not watching Mythbusters, Reddick). Also, apparently nobody ever noticed the missile silos that were along a dirt road in the small, bumblescum town in Colorado.I regret watching this movie. I honestly do. It's such an embarrassing addition to the zombie genre that they should not be called zombies anymore. They should be called 'Mr. McLeapyPants' and 'Mrs. ICanCrawlAlongTheCeiling'. And I can now tell why it is a straight-to-DVD movie, because this most certainly would flop at the box office.Even to a hardcore zombie fan, I cannot recommend this film. The 2008 version of Day of the Dead is an embarrassment and there is next to nothing to enjoy, unless you like movies that have big guns and zombies and even that cannot save this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well let's see. They've remade Night of the Living Dead in the early 90s, then about 4 years ago they remade Dawn of the Dead. So it would make sense to remake Day of the Dead, right? (Whoever heard of remaking sequels? Hmmmm)Well, the surprise here is that this is hardly a remake of DOTD. Sure, it's got the military in it and zombies, so that counts right? By that logic, 28 Days Later is a remake of it. This gives a fresh new look, while still satisfying our zombie needs. Yeah, they went with the "new" zombies, the ones that can run (and climbs on walls! Woah!) but in a way that makes them a little more scarier. I mean, imagine trying to get into a place to escape the zombies, what would be more freaky? The slow walking zombies coming at you thus giving you at least 5- 10 minutes to get in there, have a quick cup of coffee, and find a good hiding spot? Or the zombies faster than an NFL running back coming at you full speed? Thought so.Well, first the major important part of a zombie movie: Yes, it is gory my friends. These zombies don't mess around. They wont leave leftovers at all if they have to! Oh and these zombies are a little smarter, kinda using what Romero is using in his latest zombie movies. You know what this means? Zombies with guns, zombies that DODGE attacks, zombies who use tactics to sneak on their victims. Oh and a nice little zombie who sorta stays human as he stays friendly and even attempts to save our heroes.And then there's our characters, who we do seem to care for. Mena Suvari does good, but man does she look hot in military gear! All about them camouflage pants! Damn! And I don't care what anyone says, I actually liked Nick Cannon's character! Yes he seemed stereotypical but it works for this movie and he just cracked me up! All I can say is they should have stuck with the alternate ending!So if you love zombie movies, and if you love them extra bloody, then I would totally recommend this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off all I wanna begin by saying that I am a Dutch so sorry for all the misspells.Second I wanna say that this is my first review EVER. But I just had to say something about this!!I just paused the movie about 2 minutes ago after watching for 28 minutes and 41 seconds precisely.Being a HUGE zombie fan I was looking forward to this movie just as bad as I am looking forward to lets say.....The Dark Knight!!! But what I just witnessed in the first half an hour is absolutely terrible. It makes it even more terrible if you compare this crap to the original Day of the dead movie, or any other George A Romero movie or remake we all know about.I cant believe that i saw a zombie walking on the ceiling like he's freakin Spider-man. I cant believe i saw so much CGI blood that actually looked like CGI blood when a girl was attacked and electrocuted by 2 zombies. I can go on and on and on about the first half an hour but i wont because then i wouldn't be done in an hour or more.In the original Day of the dead almost the entire movie took place in the underground bunker. I fast-forward this movie a little bit to notice that maybe the last 25 minutes of this movie take place in the underground bunker!!! What the! is that!!! I mean Day of the dead is ABOUT THE UNDERGROUND BUNKER just like Dawn of the dead is ABOUT THE MALL!! Am i right...or am i crazy??I'm gonna try and finish the movie now but i don't think that there is anything that can save the last hour of this movie that is to come. But wish me luck.And as for you stay away from this!!(part 2)Well i finished the movie and i was right about one thing there wasn't anything that could save the last hour of the movie....it actually just kept getting worse.I was wrong about one thing do and that is that they weren't in the bunker for 25 minutes.........is was even shorter!!!!But that wasn't the only thing that annoyed me off in the rest of the movie. Here are some examples.1 even more spider-man zombies 2 vegetarian zombie (supposed to Bub from the original movie) 3 lots of cgi blood 4 nick cannon acting like he's Rambo 5 very very bad acting by annalyne mcCord 6 no (good) underground bunkerAgain i can go on and on and on I have to say that it was a long time ago since i was THIS disappointed about a movie!Thank you for reading...have a nice one</fullReview>

They stole the name of a really great zombie flick and replaced it with 87 minutes worth of people taking steaming dumps on Romero's idea.This is the worst zombie movie I've ever seen in my entire life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day of the Dead (2008) 1/2 (out of 4) Remake of George Romero's film has a small town in Colorado being shut down for what they're told is some sort of flu virus. Of course, the government is lying and they're actually turning into zombies. It's no secret that I'm not a fan of the original film but it's a masterpiece compared to this thing, which is just another cheap rip off that ranks as one of the worst remakes out there but, to be honest, this isn't nearly as bad as the name-only sequel to Romero's film. I'm not one against remakes so that's not my problem with this film. My problem is that it's so incredibly cheap and poorly written that you can't help but be bored throughout the entire film. Once again we get horrid CGI effects, which are among the worst I've ever seen. The effects are so fake looking that you can never take them serious and why producer's opt for this poor effects is beyond me. Another problem is the direction, which makes for one incredibly ugly movie that never has any sense of direction. The movie also uses CGI effects to speed up the action and this again just makes the film look incredibly poor. The cinematography will certainly give you a headache as it moves around with no sense of what it's trying to show (or not show). The performances are all pretty standard and that includes Ving Rhames in his small role. As bad as the movie is there are a couple good moments including one where Rhames, turning into a zombie, eats his own eyeball. As for the zombies, they are all incredibly bad and lame. When the humans turn into the zombies, we get more CGI effects that transforms them in the matter of seconds but none of them have anything going for them. The gore effects are equally bad as well. This is more of a reimagined version of the Romero film but there are a few hold overs from that film including the character Bub, although he's called Bud here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost as bad as Flight Of The Living Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing entertaining about this movie was the decapitations and gore. The storyline is ridiculous and the acting is horrible. And what's with Nick Cannon and the whole token black guy thing spitting out racial b/s every five minutes about "white folks always splitting up" and "just cause a black man has a sharp instrument it's considered a spear"? Even though I consider myself a die hard "Romero-slow-zombie" fan, I do enjoy the occasional running zombie film. This film, however was a total disgrace to both genres, seeing as how it couldn't decide which path to take (some of the living dead run, some walk, some even crawl on the ceiling). No offense to Ving Rhames, but just because you're in one successful zombie film doesn't mean that the next one will be as great.Lots of guns, explosions, gore, blah blah blah...but that's about it. No social commentary, no emotion. I'd probably watch Flight Of The Living Dead again before I popped this into the DVD player one more time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was good, into great but good. Sure the Zombies are different to your usual foot shuffling variety, but to be honest I applaud that. The Zombies where different! They could think! They had intelligence. they had super powers (ok that was a bit too much at times). The plot was pretty thin, but its a Zombie movie. they follow a basic story as is.Most of the comments on here are from the Zombie-rati (See what i did there), who have made up in their minds that if it isn't Romero, than it isn't worth watching! This film needs to be given a chance. Give this a go, its better than some of the big screen horror out there!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst zombie-movies ever made i think. And i've seen many of em. I actually used to respect Steve Miner for his contribution to Lake Placid, Halloween and Friday the 13th 2+3. But this is by fare the most painful thing i've seen from him. Don't't talk bad about Uwe Boll's house of dead if you praise this. It's just as bad. Crappy acting from mediocre actors. And why on earth did Ving Rhames do this film? He's already done a zombie remake. "Dawn of the dead" which is a great film. Zack Snyder the director is of the new age. Miner is outdated in the horror-field. It's the new generation of directors job to make these films now. Look at The hills have eyes. Great film, great director. Look at the sequel. A script from Wes Craven, German director. It stank up the whole industry! It's a shame to say it, but maybe these guys should think about making other stuff? I am a big fan of Craven, but i'm also a big fan of horror. And these old guys a?n't giving it anymore. Day of the dead should have been a first-time director's job. Someone young and hungry for success. Miner is a great TV director. Hss made a lot of good shows. Stick to that. I can't say how disappointed i was when i saw this. I love the original. Which had great gore. This remake was an embarrassment. cgi gore through the whole thing. If your making a zombie-movie. Make sure you can finance the gore first. That is what those movies are about. To all. Stay clear of this very low quality film from an outdated director, bad actors and a pathetic production. Sorry guys...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Calling all zombie fans....One user has said this is the best zombie film since Planet Terror. Might be right as there has not been another since Planet Terror has there? or at least one with a moderately half decent budget.Let's take this from the point of view of a what most people will want to know who like zombie films and hail George Romero as the master....is the film any good and how is Day of the Dead re-imagined from the original.Remember when the DOTD remake came out and most of us all spat at the idea saying what a travesty? I for one thought I was proved vastly wrong. Zack Snyder took the basis of the original and re-interpreted the idea in what turned out to be an excellent film, on it's own merits. Good characters, good story, gore and a decent run time with a very nice budget. Let's not forget that DOTD remake revived mainstream zombie interest! Since then though it's been slightly down hill with some poor further attempts released. Even Land of the Dead wasn't that great (mainly due to studio interference) So now we have Day of the Dead. Not really a remake of such but more a cash in to get our zombie juices flowing and gain interest. Let's make one thing clear, the only thing this has in common with the original is a few character names and zombies...and a military presence. Nothing further. This film is not a remake or re-interpretation, so don't get your hopes up.Now, there are a fair few out there who didn't like the idea of running zombies when DOTD remake came out. If you didn't like that then you'll hate this. Not only do the zombies run they: Jump - leap - run through windows - play dead (??) - drive cars - understand what's being said -(most importantly) THEY CAN CRAWL ON CEILINGS!! Maybe someone thought this would be a great idea but I have this to say to that person....NO NO NO NO!!!!! I keep referring to zombies. I find it difficult to see the zombies as 'zombies' though. They are more like crazed maniacs. Think 28 days later (which was not a zombie film people!). Also, remember how in zombie films zombies look how they do because they are rotting or because they have been eaten? Not really the case here. The virus (or whatever) turns people, makes a change at DNA level and makes their faces all strange and horrible looking.The casting of this film is wrong, everyone is young, apart from Ving Rhames (why did he decide to have any part in this?). The cast don't have much to work with via the non-existent script and hence everything has a slightly diluted and cheap feel to it. There's plenty of gore but I honestly couldn't give a toss because I'd lost interest in the film after 30 minutes and just wanted to watch everyone die.If you're going to watch this you MUST remember that this is not a remake and not a re-interpretation. This is a cash in, nothing more. It's no wonder the film has been sat on the shelves of the studio for a year now. They shouldn't have bothered releasing it.In an ideal world, the impatient cash hungry studios would have waited for Zack to finish 300 and then signed him on to the project. I think Universal (or whoever had them) sold the rights on....probably because Zack wasn't available and they knew the movie would be crap.We can now only hope and pray that George brings us back to where we should be with Diary of the Dead. If not, I fear the zombie revolution has come to an early end....again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not so much a remake of the Classic George A Romero film but a re-imagining. In this world the zombies are like superheroes, leaping from great heights, running super fast even crawling on the ceiling it's a far cry from the origins of the brain dead and a move towards the quick shock pace of recent films like '28 weeks later' or 'Flight of the living Dead'. The trouble is that with so many zombie movies about there's nothing here that hasn't been seen before in one film or another. The characters are stereotypes, the dialogue is stilted and the effects aren't always that good, but I'm a sucker for any zombie movie so if like me you can overlook that then this is certainly worth a watch. The gore level is high, its got Ving Rhames in it (for a bit) and the lead is played by Mena Suvari who is pretty enough and spends the film looking great in army fatigues while kicking butt. It is pretty text book despite the director trying some camera tricks to add to the atmosphere and the spooky tunes and it travels along at a fair old pace but when all is said and done this isn't a great film, it won't win any Oscars, but it does do what it says on the tin. Blood, guts and gory it will do until George's new one 'Diary of the dead'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow,one of the unusual cases where I think the low score on IMDb is unjust and inaccurate. At first I almost passed on viewing this, based on 1) the fact that this movie was not released in theaters and went straight to video distribution, usually a bad sign. 2) The poster/advertisement is awful, and gives the false appearance that the budget for this movie was &lt;$10,000... 3) the director of this zombie movie is the solid, but not currently A-List director Steve Miner (Friday 13th II &amp; III, Warlock 1, House 1... all fine B horror movies that I liked very much).So imagine my surprise as I found that while watching this horror/adventure unfold, it progressively kept and retained my interest throughout in this fast-paced and well executed horror/action/adventure. Anyone that has enjoyed Robert Rodriguez's "Planet Terror", or Danny Boyle's "28 Days Later", will easily enjoy this movie, even if it doesn't quite reach the quality of these 2 named movies; it is acceptably close.The scares were plentiful, and the tension was kept high throughout. The comic relief character (you'll know whom I refer to) adds some well-needed appropriate humor moments to help soften the tight tension that is built throughout.Mena Suvari was great and convincing in her military role. Ving Rhames is, as always, very solid; I only wish his role had been bigger, but still a nice contribution to the flick. And frankly, the whole ensemble of supporting actors were great, but I don't want to spoil your experience by describing too much. If you like horror/adventures, this movie will be very satisfactory.My one complaint is simply in the attempt to market this movie as a "remake" of the original "Day of the Dead", which frankly, seems pretty inaccurate; as aside from containing zombies, the plot has nearly no resemblance whatsoever to George Romero's original zombie movie. However, this should not dissuade you from watching an otherwise very pleasing horror/adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!it was interesting to watch this attempt of a remake, i was personally expecting a direct remake like night of the living dead (1990),if your die hard Romero fan i would give this film a miss,for it doesn't stay true to the original, for the story is noticeably different, for example the setting is different they are not in a underground bunker, in this the infection starts in a small Colorado town, which is being quarantined due to a epidemic of a mystery flu,furthermore there is only one character remaining from the original to make it into this remake, captain Rhodes played by Ving Rhames,who already has taken a role in a remake of Romero's classic Dawn of the Dead, taking the role of Kenneth ,but his character is completely different to the original, for example he isn't insane and threatening scientists and his screen time is shorter, his death was no where near as amazing as the original Rhodes with a memorable line of "choke on em" as he is be devoured by the blood thirsty undead, but for Zombie fans it is worth a watch with interesting zombie designs such as the different body mechanics to the classic zombies, its not a bad change but it may irritate some die hard fans, for example the zombies can now jump,climb ceilings and run and are super strong, the make up is brilliantly done for the zombies look believable, the special effects are decent especially in the hospital scene where Nina's dead stops mid sentence and shows an interesting CGI clip of the virus attacking the brain and his eyes turning white. All in all this isn't a to bad of a film its very average with alrightish acting but the running screaming Nina gets annoying, the camera is a bit shaky and trying to get a survivors perspective of running away from the zombies to engross the audience into the film, the zombie's are alright and the special effects and make up a good,lots of blood and gore, ridiculous amount of swearing,horny teenagers and some kick arse action scenes, a great Friday night movie to watch with some friends. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing that's any good about this are the gore and action scenes. The plot is boring and atypical and characters are flat and one-dimensional. In other words, this movie is totally typical of modern day zombie films. It shares nothing in common with the original other than the title. Being consistent with unrealistic biology in zombie films, the monster's heads seem to be made of cheese as skulls can be cut as cleanly as a hot knife through butter via a swing of a knife taped to a stick. If you want my opinion you're much better off re-watching the original even if you've seen it a dozen times. I would only recommend watching this if you're a person like me who has to say he's seen absolutely ALL zombie films in existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, it didn't disappoint, but ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit it. I had it in for this film early on. No, not because it's a remake of the Romero zombie flick. The words "A Steve Miner Film" popped up on the screen, and I was tempted to switch the movie off right then and there. With the exception of Warlock, the guy has basically directed the same horror film for 20 years. Then my misplaced optimism kicked in, "Give him another chance. You've found some gems in unlikely places. After all, you hated Romero's Day up until the very end when it blasted you with genius and completely reversed your opinion." Okay, okay, fine.And so the film opens with two young couples making out in some backwoods cabin not unlike the trademarks of some other movies Steve Miner has directed. You might have heard of them. They're called "Friday the 13th parts 2 and 3." Zombies meet cheesy 80s slasher clichés? Uh, huh. At this point I banged my head against my laptop's keyboard and muttered, "I hate being right." Again, the temptation to axe the Netflix stream beckoned for me. The movie has made its thesis statement ? it's declared it's intentions ? and it's planning on indulging in my pet peeves within the genre.Turn it off, Jay! Make everyone happy! Why, oh why, keep watching a movie you know you'll hate? Answer: sometimes in genre crap you find something special. Like Sleepaway Camp 2, April Fool's Day, and Wolf Creek. Optimism must prevail ... even if I am a pessimist. Thus, I descended into a small town on the brink of a zombie epidemic. A long line of cars await at a blockade, trying to escape a quarantine. Many people have fallen ill, an ominous sign in this genre. A few wandering corpses litter the forest and dark alleys. But the full blown undead outbreak has yet to occur, and I couldn't help but wonder, "why not take a cue from Romero, and just start the movie post-zombie apocalypse?" I mean, what part of discovering a zombie infestation is still interesting? Nevermind.We meet Sarah, played by the petite Mena Suvari whose acting ability might be able to convince us this blond bright eyed woman has not only been through boot camp but is a commanding officer if only the script didn't undermine her performance with lines that suggest she's a still a little girl in high school. Then there's Nick Canon, whose acting talent has no prayer of convincing us that he would have survived basic training with his "gangsta bad self" attitude. Nick, I hope the zombie of Lucio Fulci bites your testicles off and eats them. Don't worry, though, you'll have company because the staple dorky white vegetarian played by Stark Sands really needs a violent castration too.But what am I saying? That would be creative gore. It's not like a movie like this would have the balls to ? oh wow, a zombie just ate his own eye. Huh. Okay, maybe an appropriate gruesome end will befall them after all.Films of these nature require at least one scene of utter undead chaos, and Day of the Dead sets up the bulk of its carnage in a hospital where all the zombies-to-be have congregated. As the mayhem revved up and zombies went wild on the survivors with the frenzied intensity of an epileptic seizure enhanced by an LCD overdose, I couldn't help but notice the uncanny resemblances to the genre crap parodied by Robert Rodriguez's half of the GrindHouse doublebill. Then it struck me: this movie would be an absolute blast if it had a sense of humor. What's that? A vegetarian Zombie? Right. Give me sec so I can revise my previous statement: "this movie would be an absolute blast if it had a *good* sense of humor." (and a chick with a gun for a leg couldn't hurt either.) For the climax of the film, the leftover fodder descend into an underground lab for the obligatory explanation behind the current situation. Cool. Now I know a scientific experiment went awry causing all this chaos. Thanks. But, I don't suppose there's also an explanation as to how this lab can go unnoticed under a seemingly secluded building in the middle of the woods where kids dare each other to enter so they can spy on big brother and his girlfriend who come here for sex all the time.Believe it or not, there is such a thing as being an optimistic pessimist ? someone who continues to watch out of hope while knowing it's only a matter of time before Super Zombie shows up to do battle with the hormonal Veggie-burger Zombie. Of course, you probably know us optimistic pessimists by our more common title: morons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget the whole "Romero is God we hate this film" talk, the original Day of the dead was awful if you ask me. Going into this I figured anything was an improvement, it was. Before someone screams "Romero is God", Night of the living dead and Dawn of the dead are two of my favourite films (not just horror films), but DOTD was just a rehash of the first two, basically the same story and characters but with more gore. Thats not always a bad thing, but compared to the previous two it shouldn't be as "sacred".This version of Day of the dead does absolutely nothing new. Lots of characters who gradually start dying horribly, some will survive, some wont. At the end you wont be blown away but you will have seen what you wanted in a zombie film.</fullReview>

F/X better than ordinary and zombies are zombies. A small town in Colorado has been infected with a fast moving virus; and the military tries its best to quarantine the town to contain the infection that is causing the residents to turn into zombies. A small group of survivors put up a good fight to stay alive and discover the secret operation that led to the virus outbreak. Some gruesome scenes and images...thats fun. And there is some pretty sick jokes that are NOT funny. Starring are: Mena Suvari, Nick Cannon, Michael Welch, AnnaLynne McCord and Ving Rhames.

		<fullReview>I just watched the remake of the third-in the time line of the George A Romero "...of the Dead" zombie movies, the remake of I think 1982's DAY of The Dead. I spent the first 20 minutes bitching at how the movie appeared to not be taking place well well into the zombie outbreak (it started in Night... and was worldwide in Dawn ... if not earth wide in the original Day...) but in this one the outbreak only just starts! And it is a flu that causes it (not in line with the continuity of the other movies.) Once you get that far into the movie and stuck watching it once you get past the fact it does not at all correspond to the original storyline, despite the fact that it sucks, there is some entertaining stuff. There is many many many decapitations. There is a lot of zombies eating humans and parts where if you have a black sense of humor it is hilarious. There are also some funny "F you MFer!" type moments when the 'virgin' girl character that you expect to be all shy swears like a sailor.It is a pity this movie has to take place "In a small town", why do recent horrors have to take place in Yokelville USA hasn't that been done to death? Why can't horror movies take place in Megapolises' like Time Square where there is hundreds of thousands of people all in zombie agony? I don't give a @#$$% about some insignificant small town's horrors. It is also really really annoying that the black character does that whole homey talk &amp; behavior thing, why does every black actor in a movie have to get scripted to talk Yo yo this, it's not how real people in real life talk.Anyway this movie is easily better than any of the Return... Of the Living Dead movies. If you count it as a Romero zombie movie which I only do because of the Name, which must have took some cash to acquire the rights to, it's the worst of the Romero movies. All the same I kind of enjoyed hating it while I watched it.57%/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, the good news: There's excellent talent in this film. The bad news: It's completely wasted! Shortly after the great 2005 remake of George Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD, along came this half-hearted attempt at remaking his sequel, DAY OF THE DEAD. "Half-hearted" might even be too strong of a word. Try "half-baked, pea-brained, sleep-inducing fiasco"! Yeah, that works much, much better. Never mind that it's got Mena Suvari, Nick Cannon, or Ving Rhames (a carry-over from the DAWN OF THE DEAD remake?) Trust me, while they are good actors, this film isn't one any of them would want listed on their resumes. Now the story, if you can call it that: Somewhere in Colorado, a mysterious flu-like virus has decimated a town... Oh please, do I really need to tell you the rest?! Blah-Blah-Blah... Zombies... Blah... Running and shrieking... Blah-Blah-Blah... Jumping implausibly high... Blah... Even climbing upside down on ceilings... Blah-Blah... Survivors trying to get out... Blah-Blah... Ving Rhames eats his own eyeball... Missile silo... Huge explosion... BOOM! THE END! Not much else to say, really. Avoid it like the plague it is. And if you think the zombie genre couldn't possibly get any lower, look out for DAY OF THE DEAD 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite bad films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get this out the way... 'Day of the Dead' (2008) is awful. Pretty much everyone absolutely hates it. I can completely see where they're coming from. If you've heard negative criticism about this film then it's probably justified. However, saying all that... I still enjoy it every time I see it.The title has been lifted straight from (zombie Godfather) George A Romero's 1985 dark and brooding film of the same name. And, if you've seen the original Day of the Dead and are wondering how this remake relates to it, it can be summed up in one word: names. Many of the characters share the same names in both films.Perhaps the 2008 film's main fault is that it shares the name of a classic and people therefore attribute words like 'remake' and 're-envisioning' to it. Plus Dawn of the Dead was remade in 2004 (and it was actually highly thought of!) and Ving Rhames stars in both, leaving many people to wonder if Day 2008 is a sequel to Dawn 2004 (it isn't).So... on to the faults. For a start there's the casting. Not only is Ving Rhames' presence confusing, but he's the best actor there and he's completely underutilised. Then you have Mena Suvari as the tough solider in charge. That just doesn't ring true. She neither looks nor acts like she's in the military and is more the 'token pretty face.' Many people have pointed out how the film is called DAY of the Dead and most of it takes place at night, plus the survivors don't reach the missile silo (the 1985 version's setting) until the end of the movie. The zombies seem to turn at random whenever the story needs another scare and - most bizarrely - they have the ability to run up walls like giant spiders (but only when they're attacking pointless extra characters - when they're chasing Mena, they kind of forget they can run up walls and just run blindly into her gunfire) One plus point people seem to agree on is that the zombies' are well made up and look pretty grisly. However, despite all the negatives, I still watch it ever now and again. If you can forgive them for using a classic zombie movie's name and look at this as nothing to do with the original, then you might find enough fun in it to keep you entertained for an hour and twenty minutes. And, if nothing else, you get to see a vegetarian zombie (no, seriously).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmmm! Not my cup of tea I guess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not my kind of movie. I knew this but tried to ignore this train of negative thought and gave it a chance and resisted turning it off but I wish I did. It couldn't have been more stereotypical at the start as a zombie film; young teenagers, unnecessarily quick editing and dodgy mise-en-scene topped sadistically with over exaggerated diegetic sound. The minor characters are dismissed straight away. The movie developed more positively and had a flash of decent acting as Ving Rhames, came into the film. The plot is about a government experiment gone wrong and is sketchy and lacks enough beneficial logic about the implications of it. The subsequent area is affected and hence quarantined, the movie follows the characters, in the town including a female soldier who takes charge by taking her sick mother to a now zombie infected hospital. She looks after her brother and his girlfriend and also another male soldier who is a private. This is probably the best thing about the movie, in that she is the one who takes action, and becomes decisive, rather than the usual stereotypical female who relies on the men. Maybe this is an oasis in the desert in terms of anything to like about this film. I'm not spoiling anything in saying that characters die, but what makes this movie so annoying is that they respond to their families being violently mauled, maimed to death the same way as if your team loses a match, or your favorite meal is out of stock at a restaurant. Most of the characters are subsequently two dimensional at best, maybe it is the absence of true directing from Steve Miner, which makes this movie so bad, the camera angles don't have enough to either create fear or sympathy, they are not involved enough. The special effects are also terrible, although I admire the indie low budget vibe, it can't always work when movies like this attempt to over shock with gore. Maybe it is just because I am not a big fan of gore. To be fair a few days before watching this movie I watched maybe the best horror film of all time, "The Shining". The bar was pretty high I learnt a lot from comparing the two about how gore is not always what makes a film scary but it's more the editing and sound which makes it scary or not. Both are sadly lacking in "Day of the Dead". Another reason why the characters ruined the film was not the script but more the fact that I didn't like them. They have their moments but they are too set in their ways to deserve liking. I didn't really care about the ending and whether or not they survived. This is the contributing factor in me not liking this movie. I am not saying this is the worst movie ever made; there are positive aspects, which will certainly be enjoyed for fans of zombie horror. This is also an alright movie when you just want an entertaining thrill ride, something not too taxing, but if you're in the mood for class this is not the movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never had I thought that a movie could be made so poorly as Day of The Dead Is. The movie doesn't even take place in the day!? Everything about this movie is bad. The acting, the sound effects, the plot, the zombies, the special effects, everything! I had to write a review to warn people about Day of The Dead. If you think this is a remake you would be wrong. The only thing I did like about this movie was the leading lady was pleasing to the eyes. Everyone who worked on this movie should never be able to work on a movie again and I mean everyone! This movie was torture to watch cause it was so bad. I cannot stress how bad this movie is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many parts in this movie that I rolled my eyes to.. Where to begin? The zombies shoot, jump, climb and use mops? I mean really? I never have high expectations for zombie movies because its mainly blood and guts and I almost always like the zombies movies I watch, but this.. This was torture. The main character was annoying and all her companions were just as bad.. The script was basically non existent, they could have turned up on the day, scrapped the whole thing and that would have improved it. I could have written it myself! Summary; Don't watch the movie, unless you like watching movies you're going to hate. If you care about story line and character development and like having your IQ higher than 60 I suggest you steer clear, I'm pretty sure my IQ dropped significantly watching this. But maybe that's just me! The makeup was good though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't waste your time if you're thinking about seeing this. They cast Ving Rhames in this film in an obvious attempt to trick people into thinking that it's connected with the Dawn of the Dead remake.....It's not in any way shape or form.The characters in this film are obnoxious to say the least; I don't think there was a single likable character in this entire film. The fact that they cast a rapper as a main character should tell you something. It's sad but you'll find yourself waiting for these people to die off as you watch this.The zombies/effects are crap. People go from breathing to decomposed in a matter of seconds. One zombie is even a vegetarian zombie because he was a vegetarian in life. Oh and apparently one zombie has Spiderman powers because it was a scientist. There's not a single decent scare to be had from these lame monsters.Do your self a favor. Avoid this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Insult To Romero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film offended me as a Romero fan, this film offended me a zombie movie fan and this film offended me as a human being. This film was so terrible, in fact, that it inspired me to write my first ever IMDb review.I will start off by saying that I'm not even sure how this can be called a "remake" of the original Dawn Of The Dead. I don't see how this could be called a "re-imagining" of the film either, for that matter....The original film starts off in a post-apocalyptic world. The dead have been rising from their graves to eat the flesh of the living for some time now for an unknown reason. In an almost "Omega Man" theme, the characters of the film fear they are the last humans alive on earth. They live together in an underground military bunker as three distinct groups of people in general disharmony with each other - the scientists who wish to understand the problem, the soldiers, who wish to destroy the problem and the civilians who simply wish to enjoy whatever bit of their life is left to enjoy.Much of the conflict in the film, in fact, involves the characters interactions with each other rather than their interaction with the zombies. The original Dawn Of The Dead had a very bleak, claustrophobic atmosphere to it that is responsible for it being my favourite of Romero's "Dead" films. The vast majority of the film takes place in the military bunker, as it is the only refuge from the carnage surrounding them. They leave only to gather the dead as "specimens" for scientific study and to look for survivors.This "remake" has none of this. None. The film starts at the beginning of the outbreak, for one. Also, a reason for this outbreak is later given in the film. The outbreak is also contained to one city for the duration of the film, it is not world-wide. While they do end up in an underground military bunker, it is only toward the end of the film. The rest of it they are running all over the place and there are people all over the city, completely missing the themes and indeed, the entire basis of the original. There are scientists, zombies and soldiers - but their function in the plot is completely changed. The true enemies are not the other people in this one, it's definitely the zombies.They did bring back the idea of the "sympathetic" zombie, Bub, however he is not been "tamed" like in the original - Instead he is docile and non-threatening because, get this: he was a vegetarian during his life. They then explain that he kept this trait through becoming one of the undead. Hearing this made me feel like I was going to cry. It was THE most terrible concept I have ever witnessed unfold in cinema. - And I'm a huge fan "so bad it's good" B grade horror.As far as I'm concerned, this film is a remake in title only. Nothing else has any more in common with Day Of The Dead than it does with any other zombie film. In my honest opinion, naming the film this was a shameless, almost criminal attempt at a cash-grab. They were hoping to sucker in poor die-hard horror fans like myself, who would feel almost "obliged" to see such a remake if it were made.Wow. I can't believe I've made it this far into my criticism of this being called a remake without mentioning "running zombies". Believe me, that really hurt too - But the Dawn Of The Dead remake was guilty of this crime, too... And as much as I hate to admit it, that remake wasn't all that bad. So I'll leave my zombie elitism out of this.If this film was not marketed as a remake of Day Of The Dead, it would have fared considerably better among critics and fans alike.... However, that's not to say that this movie wasn't terrible as yet another 28 Days Later clone, either...The acting was god-awful with the exception of (maybe) Mena Suvari. Stale lines, even more stale delivery.Nick Cannon's role as Salazar was tasteless. He provided a "token black character" for the film in that he was given such stereotypical one-liners that they verged on outright racism... How many times do we need to hear a black character say the "Man, that's some (fill-in-the-blank) s**t, right there!" line in a film until it's not funny anymore? My personal favourite was when, in response to someone saying they were a doctor, Salazar said "Maan.. Ain't nobody here wanna hear that CSI bulls**t!". I was honestly speechless. I find such a stereotypical portrayal of an African-American character kind of ironic in this film, being that Romero's Night Of The Living Dead was one of the first mainstream films to give the lead "hero" role to a black man.The film overall, while extremely fast-paced, somehow managed to loose my attention consistently throughout. I found myself struggling to pay attention just so I could write this review to warn you people. In the world of zombie films, this one honestly makes "Children Of The Living Dead" look like "Zombi 2".</fullReview>

A complete disgrace and how they could tarnish Romero's name by adding it to this is despicable . Zombies don't have superpowers and cannot leap over tall buildings or run along ceilings. Do not be fooled by the names featured ,why those chose to work on this is a complete mystery and would be very interesting to find out how they feel having wasted their time working on this drivel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BAD, really bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, the zombies in this movie is NOT Romero zombies, Romero zombies are DEAD that comes from the grave, they are afraid of fire and shamble slowly, they can only be killed with a head-shot.in dawn of the dead (1978) they changed it from dead rising to an infection, but the zombies where still stupid and moved incredibly slowly.But in this movie they completely changed it, now zombies work in teams, dragging people around, they also climb walls and run extremely fast trough virtually anything. And apparently the wounds zombies have just pops into them for no reason after infection.What was fine with dawn of the dead was that the zombies where somewhat realistic, they moved slow (probably because of blood coagulating in their veins) they where stupid and didn't seem to notice each other.In this movie they turn in a few minutes, and mutates into super-zombies sprinting like there's no tomorrow and climbing the walls in a suspiciously exorcist fashion, they also posses a certain degree of intelligence and work (as mentioned) in groups.Well, enough complaining about the zombies, now it's time to complain about the characters and the plot, well most of the main characters are extremely annoying and do the normal clichés such as shambling around in dark rooms so that other people think their zombies, hiding their bites and looking at them all the time when they think no one's looking.The plot is fine though, but what can you expect, the original was awesome, and this is a remake, so there is not much they can screw up in that aspect Otherwise, a pretty bad movie, it has it's moments though</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>life is just too short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to stop watching this in its entirety, did some chapter-skipping, but in the end just stopped watching this altogether. I cannot think of a single reason to make this movie except that somebody hoped to make a quick, cheap buck by taking a ridiculous script and slapping the well known title Day of The Dead on it in hope that enough people will buy or rent the DVD, giving it a chance that it ultimately doesn't deserve. some people like to point out the low-budget, but many talented people have made incredible films with less or even next to nothing, so it is no excuse what so ever. I am willing to admit that i might be biased in the sense that i really love Romero's originals and that i don't really like running zombies at all, but that is in the end a matter of taste, and while Dawn of the Dead (2004) was a competent remake, this is, first of all, not even a remake, and it is a really terrible film. The actors do a terrible job although they don't have much of a choice with the even worse dialog. I don't know what went on in the editing room, i'm not sure i want to know, but whoever cut this thing did a worse job than most cheap exploitation flicks from the 70's. The fast running zombies (that are sometimes able to climb on the ceiling and jump 10 meters into the air, and for some reason, sometimes aren't) seem to have been made by pushing the forward button (seriously, check out the hospital scenes, they literally just fast-forwarded). This might have created a nightmarish effect had any mood been established at all, but alas, no this is utter s**t, and not worth watching at all, life is just too short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve Miner..... Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Miner.... Why? Why would you pick on a Romero Classic and pick on it for something it's not.Steve Miner does a really good job on Friday the 13th Pt. 2 &amp; 3, Halloween H20 but when it comes to him remaking a George Romero Classic, it really sucks.I have many problems with this film.1. This remake does not follow the original plot and it has nothing to do with the original film. I'm not saying I wanted it to be a carbon copy of the 1985 classic but I didn't want it to jump off the train tracks and go into the bin.2. Why, oh Why is it set at night time. It's called Day of the Dead and most of the film takes place at night time. I seriesrously don't get it.3. Thinking to develop the Bub, Bud character was stupid because seeing him as a human at first sight and opening his back story is just not scary. The original Bub is must more frightening because there are references that he was human but he was unknown to be a human in the film and they just showed him as a Zombie which was great.4. As the film continued on it just got more boring. At the beginning it was terrible, but when the middle and ending came I was just even getty about how this film went.5. Why is the Doctor Logan character unlikeable. I liked the Original Logan character, he was calm, preserved, patient and always ready to help. Now we have a Logan who betrays the victims, a complete idiot and he's just rude. It's not the Doctor Logan I remember.6. I wish that Steve Miner wouldn't have carried all of this crap into a hospitals etc. To be Honest I didn't mind the Zombies rioting in the hospital. That was the only watchable scene. Even if I say this, that isn't saying much though. He should have kept the entire situation inside the under ground tunnel with some different twists and turns.7. The Captian Rhodes character in the original was selfish, high mighty, proud and despicable. In the remake we don't even see him that much and that really disappointed me. 8. Lastly, I want to point out how dumb the plot is. It's like we've got two different stories trying to nudge in. We've got teens being stalked by zombies and then we have another scenario of a road jam, traffic jam. I think Romero's plot is tones better.Give the film a watch as I did but be warned. It is terrible. It goes up there with the Psycho &amp; Black Christmas Remakes: Worst Remakes. And to be honest it is on the same level as Black Christmas, a classic that is remade, and then turned into something it's not. For anybody's sake stick with the Original. 4.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Oh, we are alive and running normally. Now we are dead, and can move like spiders across the ceiling at very high speed." If you like the sound of that, you will like this. If not, then I salute you.This film was made by someone who'd seen zombies running along the ceiling at him in a video game and thought 'whoa, that's cool!' It may work in a game, but it doesn't here.The characterisation was so dire as to be worthy of special mention. One example: "so it's a spear because I'm a black guy?" less then two minutes later "Yeah that was pretty gangster."The plot started well enough then quite comfortably moved into the ludicrous. As if more proof of the game-playing origins of the script (by the way I love video games but I also Never confuse them with good film ideas) we have a 'super zombie' in the bunker.This is a terrible film. I only hope that, in posting my review of it, I stop just one person from seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Day of the Dead" is an extremely entertaining and enjoyable zombie romp.**SPOILERS**In a small Colorado town, Corporeal Sarah Cross, (Mena Suvari) is upset with the quarantine orders given out, as it traps her with brother Trevor, (Michael Welch) and his girlfriend Nina, (AnnaLynne McCord) while a virus is loose in the area. While stuck in the hospital looking over the patients, most of them suddenly go insane and begin attacking and eating both survivors and hospital staff. Along with Army personnel PFC Salazar, (Nick Cannon) and PFC Bud Crain, (Stark Sands) they manage to escape from the town and head into the wilderness for safety and come across the bunker where the virus was created, forcing them to deal with the zombies of those already infected in order to survive.The Good News: There was a lot in here that worked really well. One of the biggest pluses is the extremely high quantity of action scenes that propelled the film into having a high-energy pace. The fact that the majority of the first half takes place within the hospital is inspired, allowing for numerous and plentiful high-quality action scenes. The set-up, with their blank-states and unresponsive nature, complete to their eyes glossing-over and attacks, to the first outbreak, where they manage to launch a series of massive swarming attacks on just about everyone in sight, making for a great visual as dozens-upon-dozens are bitten, grabbed and generally devoured by the zombies, causing massive amounts of bloodshed and gore to be unleashed in the cramped spaces of the hallways, as well as the different barricading tactics employed, that are helpful in making it a lot of fun. The crawl through the heating ducts, complete with ambush attempts, as well as the encounter and eventual escape the second time around is just as good with the dead soldier crawling after them in the duct and dragging along after them, is just a great way to go about it. The escape attempt, which has several great battle tactics, is also filled with action as the confrontation in the water-fountain and an extended chase through the parking lot, as well as the swarming victims found there and the methods used to fight-them-off, are a lot of fun and offer up some really great scenes. The attack on the town, from the power-plant and the car-swarming, to the dragging-away of victims and the ambushes in the alleys, is also packed with action, and these scenes are just filled with suspense, bloodshed and a lot more to really win over the viewer, and the firefight at the highway-checkpoint is really great. Even the radio-station scenes, from the brawling with the zombie throughout to the race to get inside before the zombies can get there and the ambush play, it gets some high-energy scenes going which is played off nicely with the finale's scenes in the bunker. Those feature tons of action with the swarming, gunfights, and massive hordes of zombies inside, which is the real purpose of those scenes. The fire-fights in the hallways and in the central pit are done perfectly, the zombie-doctor gets in some good scenes that provides this with some extra spice at the end, and overall this has tons of action. Also worthwhile is that it has some suspense going for it as well, as the walk-through of the friends' house, with the bloodied-furniture and surroundings, as well as the discovery-of-the-bodies is top-notch suspense, as well as the two different forest attacks, complete with the sounds in-the-distance that are great introductions to the ensuing mayhem. As expected, the blood-and-gore in here is incredibly high, another big factor, with tons of gags and bloodied bodies strewn about. The last plus here is the zombie make-up, which is really good. With their rotting faces and bloody-wounds, it gives a nice look, along with the other positives.The Bad News: There was a couple areas in here that didn't work. The biggest issue is the use of fast zombies in the film, which is a practice which needs to be done and finished. They're not more threatening, they go completely against the norm and are a total disgrace and disservice to traditional zombies out there, and while that does move the film along faster, the general practice of including them automatically lowers the film simply by the nature of their appearance. Another problem in here is the film's complete wash-over of whatever is causing everything to happen, since there's nothing mentioned about the mechanics of the virus, only why it was created. Missing is the way it turned victims into zombies, so it suffers a little. The length of time it takes to mention anything about it is an issue as well, even though clues are dropped all throughout, but to officially declare the cause to a virus a little earlier makes it a lot easier to accept the earlier behavioral changes a lot easier. The last true flaw here is the totally fake CGI, which manages to drive the viewer right out of the film. This is shown in the car crash during the town rampage, where the body flies out of the car and begins rolling down the street, flopping-and-twisting all over, before it gets up and charges with a slight gimp in its walk, which just looks ridiculous and utterly terrible. The scenes of them on fire at the end, as well as the fireball charging through the complex are completely and totally fake, which is the flaw. One could argue about the sacrilege of the movie being remade, but the others are truer flaws.The Final Verdict: Aside from completely inconsequential areas, this one manages to come across as one of the better examples of the genre and is highly entertaining throughout. Highly recommended to fans of the style, actors or undiscerning zombie-aficionados, while those who consider it sacrilege should heed caution.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language</fullReview>

Sometimes the movie was a bit to analogical, like the scene when they decided to let that zombie live and let him drive with them in the car. OK they tried to explain it that he is vegetarian but at such an situation i would not try out such a thing, it seems George A. Romero tries to make the Zombies more human like again and i guess one day the Zombies will act like normal humans in films which got to do something with George A. Romero.

		<fullReview>Right from the beginning I was laughing at the utter lack of research that went into the entire military angle of the movie. Saying, "Yes, Ma'am" to a lowly corporal is ludicrous and to see military personnel heading into town alone and without any gear is just ridiculous.Beyond that, the story is lame, weak and loaded with far too many coincidences - especially when in a town of thousands, the same few people keep miraculously run into each other. Besides zombies having the ability to scale ceilings and move at vampire-fast speeds, these undead still harbored some intelligence - though I don't know why mom followed her son's voice to the radio station when she could have eaten anyone else around her. And I guess the zombies get remarkably dry inside since they can turn to ashes in an instant - and you can also thrust small knives through their skulls into their brains. Wow!The biggest shock was to see Mena Suvari and Nick Cannon in this. Worst still, what was Ving Rhames thinking? "Dawn of the Dead" was the best Romero remake I've seen to date and Ving's appearance in the movie (along with the phenomenal Sarah Poley) was a perfect addition - but didn't Cannon, Suvari and Rhames read the script?If Reddick had been a better writer and Miner a better director this may have been something worthwhile. Instead, it's not even worth watching for any reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are no words that can describe the anger and disgust that this film will throw upon any hardcore fan of the original.the zombies are cheap looking, the stunts are cheap looking and ALL the "actors/actresses" make you cringe with their bad dialogue and over the top acting. if this was a real remake the story would be very familiar, but no, they even changed the dam story, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in some cases, but if you have seen the original they (survivors) are in a underground missile silo, in this one they are in a small town that I swear you could film a few episodes of Dawsons creek in. I mean.......the whole point of a remake is to modernise an old film with at least a similar story - dawn of the dead, chainsaw massacre, the hills have eyes, Friday the 13th all took the original films, stuck with the original story but modernised it, but this film doesn't even do this! I mean i can point out the similarities between this disgrace and Romeros original masterpiece in 2 sentences. Sarah and Rhodes are in this and a pussy zombie called bud ( apparently calling the zombie bub like in the original was far too complicated) and the missile silo is in it for the last 15 minutes when the survivors take refuge there. AND THATS IT.........THATS WHERE THE SIMILARITIES END!!! Rhodes is portrayed by Ving Rhames, but instead of being a brilliant character like the old one, they just kill him off in the first half of the movie, my only guess is that Ving Rhames realised just how bad this film would turn out and begged that his character could be killed off as soon as possible. The zombie "Bud" is a (not joking here) VEGETARIAN!!! JUST SHOOT ME PLEASE, a vegetarian, why??? i would have been more satisfied if they just didn't include this character in the first place, but no!they took bub changed his name and made him to a vegetarian.....?????WHAT????.I HATE THIS FILM!!! There's even a scene where one of the zombies jumps on the ceiling and starts crawling.....seriously a zombie crawling on the ceiling, what were these people smoking when they came up with this idea??? i suppose what i first intended to write was a review, but it turned into an angry rant, but who can blame me?? honestly i mean this is such a kick in the balls to all the people who were looking forward to seeing a good decent remake like what they did with dawn of the dead but got this pile of puke. Any way , if you ever want to experience what it feels like to switch from a good mood to a suicidal mood in a matter of moments, watch this awful monstrosity, but if your a fan of the 1985 version then don't expect anything resembling a good movie.BY Scott Dewhurst</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the hell? So after the first remake, Dawn of the Dead, I had some hope of this being an alright remake... Boy, was I wrong. As stated many times before, what's with the zombies being able to defy the laws of physics? Climbing on walls, ceilings, and being able to jump 15+ feet in the air. They start off trying to add some form of realism to the movie with the virus but go completely sideways with what you can do after you become infected. Aside from that, the real special effects were decent, but all the computer animated stuff reminded my of the crap shoot that was House on Haunted Hill 2. What's with these directors thinking CGI blood will be better than the real thing? It looks horribly fake and probably cost more to make. Besides a few names and a character similar to the original such as Bub, named Bud in the remake, there's no real connection to the original. At least the remake of Dawn of the Dead took place in a mall for most of the movie. These people didn't end up in an underground army base till the last 10 minutes of the movie. Further more, the original Day of the Dead was suppose to be a continuation of Dawn of the Dead. This is a completely different movie from the first remake. New outbreak, new cause of the infection, new zombie powers.. Christ, overall I think if they would put a little more though into how to relate this to the original and a little less Resident Evil in this movie it could of been decent, but they didn't.. so this movie ended up blowing goats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie, Bad Reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I also thought this film had something to do with the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead but was quickly disabused of that misconception.You can bemoan that confusion all you want, in no small part due to the casting of Ving Rhames in both movies, or you can watch the film on its own merits. Doing so leaves you with the enjoyment of watching a well made zombie movie that has an entertaining story, is competently directed, has good pacing, is well acted, and has just enough good old fashioned gore to satisfy your zombie blood lust.Is it as clever and funny as Zombieland? Not by a long shot. Does it satisfy your desire to see a remake of a Romero classic as does Dawn of the Dead (2004)? Not even close. But it's still well worth watching if you're in the mood for a newer zombie flick that isn't a plot deprived gore-fest that exemplify 70's and 80's zombie movies.In closing the casting of Mena Suvari as the corporal was fairly accurate. There are a fair number of moderately pretty, uneducated women in the military. It's a simple way out of a dead end life and they truly have it quite easy. Or as we who have actually served would say, "It's a skate job."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie I tried to understand what went on when they were making it. If the people in charge had any passion or cared about what they were doing they wouldn't have released the movie in the state that it is in. The script and plot are such a mess and I was offended by the amount of mistakes and stupid things in the movie. Zombie climbing the ceiling? Vegetarian zombie??!! And zombies decaying instantly is stupid although not as stupid as a vegetarian zombie. What the f@!# is this was what I was thinking 30 minutes into this movie I paid $2 to rent. I felt like I had raped my DVD player after watching it. Given the choice I would rather brutally murder myself and have my mutilated body dumped in a swamp than give this any more than 1 star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far better than could be reasonably expected from a direct-to-DVD horror movie shot in Bulgaria. Miner has made some truly awful movies in his career and the tacky DVD cover art for 'Day of the Dead' suggests more of the same. But for whatever reason, he brought his A-game to the set, and working from a screenplay by the creator of the 'Final Destination' franchise, produced a genuinely entertaining horror movie. There's nothing particularly fresh here, and it bares little resemblance to the 1985 original; playing more like '28 Days Later' transplanted to small town America than anything from Romero's cannon. But there's good performances, real suspense, buckets of gut-munching splatter (though too much CGI blood - UGH), some cool make-up design, and production values well above expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Dead??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are you kidding? Dawn of the Dead was such an entertaining flick, by no means an Oscar Winner but certainly a well thought out display of zombie gore and emotional interaction between likable and interesting characters.. Dawn of the Dead even ended well, paving the way for an intense sequel with a spoiler sneak peak of what's to come for the characters at the end of the movie. Day of the Dead is not that sequel.Day of the Dead is almost laughably terrible. The acting is shallow and boring at best. Yes, Ving Rhames is in this, but somehow the producers managed to make Ving look amateurish and uncomfortable. Not only is Ving not the same character as he was in Dawn of the Dead but then they had the audacity to kill him off with the first thirty minutes and turn him into a pathetic, eye-eating, legless zombie. The zombies look fake and in no way menacing. The editing is sloppy and choppy and quite frankly, by the end of the movie I was really just hoping to see all of the unintelligent main characters end up zombie feed. The only thing that saved this movie from making me really angry was the fact that I had it recorded it on DVR and I could fast forward through most of it and then have the satisfaction of hitting 'DELETE' when it was over.Don't waste your time. Try again Steve Miner and Jeffrey Reddick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In fact I would never waste time to write on such a bad film. But since the director Steve Miner had a place on all horror movie lovers' memory by directing "Friday the 13th" 2 and 3, I want to say a few words. After all those years without shooting a blockbuster, Miner gets a cast which is above average, gets a decent budget, he also gets the name "Day of the Dead" (being a remake of George Romero's original one from 1985). The sorry thing is that he blew this chance. The main reason being that; Romero's original film has been affecting all horror movie makers for years, describing some standards for this genre. Everyone is familiar with this realm. Yet, Miner successfully lacked a single spark of unique interpretation, let alone adding anything original. Result: Nothing will thrill you, unless you are 12...period! Which reminds me my new opinion again: I think less movies should be made. The more they make, the less we care...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually this film wasn't that bad at all, the main problem with it is is that its labeled as a remake to the original 1985 Goerge Romero film, thus it being a remake it is pretty much destined to get hammered by critics for either not staying true to the original or something like that, if you watch this as a remake and you start running comparisons, then you yourself are destined for disappointment.DAY OF THE DEAD (2008) tries to bring something new to the table and there's nothing wrong with that, unfortunately this film is a remake like I said, it doesn't stay true to the original at all, in fact its not even a by the numbers zombie film but its not a bad film, the actors did an okay job, the direction was tight, but no one will see it that way because like I said its a remake, somehow I felt at times like they tried to add something to what Zack Snyder did when he introduced the fast moving zombies in his version of DAWN OF THE DEAD, only these guys might have gone a little to far.My point, you will not like this film if you watch it as a remake or see it as a by the numbers zombie film, if you decide to see it, watch it as a stand alone feature, it will save you the disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title summary says it all, this movie basically "Dawn of the Dead 04+Shaun of the Dead+Resident Evil Degeneration=Day of the Dead 08".If you are the "hardcore zombie fanatic" that hates movies like 28 days later, 28 weeks later, I am Legend because "those are not zombies" or similar arguments then you most likely will not like this movie. But on the other hand if you have re-watched 28 days again and again because you liked it so much this will be a nice fresh movie that will not come up to the par of those movies, but close enough to make it enjoyable.This movie isn't the type that is going to be nominated for best acting or any other similar awards but is has enough things to keep you "zombified" while you watch it to the end if you you like the "non classic zombie" movies listed in the title.Has cool zombies similar to 28 days, has main characters who are not pansies and just standing around screaming like little girls, has cute female actors, had a few comedy scenes/comments similar to Shaun of the Dead but not near as funny (but how many are?).So like I said if you not a "hardcore zombie fan" who hates 28 days and are instead a zombie/apocalypse genre fan who likes "end of the world" movies then this is right up your alley for a good 1-1/2 hour of time spent enjoying your favorite genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great when taken on its own!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I keep reading all this rubbish about comparing it with the past greats. It was obviously never intended to be another chapter of those great movies. I am some what taken back by the behavior of the black soldiers as my son is in the marines and would never behave that way. But then I have to remind myself that the producers are just trying to add a little silliness to the movie. Anyone can clearly see that it wasn't intended to be a movie that depicts something that could happen in real life. Such as the remake of "Dawn of the Dead", which gave a great feel of possibility. I also think naming it Day of the Dead brought on a lot of the criticism as many of us loyal to the remakes and originals are waiting for the sequel to the remake of Dawn of the Dead. If they had just named it something that made it its own then I think attitudes would have been far different. I personally loved the movie once I observed it on its own merits. The special effects were great, (accept the burning zombies that explode, seemed tacky and cheaply done), the super jumping zombies were unique and the climbing the walls zombies were also a surprise. Over all I really liked this movie. My only wish is that someone would make a movie that would show mankind fighting its last great fight. DawnOTD remake was great but why can't we see the military and people in general banning together for an epic battle to save their cities and countries. What, you mean no one thought of just getting into tanks and rolling over the bastards. Something as epic a battle as seen in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogies. And how about some more realism such as only the freshest zombies can move fast, as they rot they should naturally begin to slow down. All that aside, I really would suggest every zombie fan see this at least once and make up their own minds. If you want action, great sound and video quality, all covered in blood. This should do it for you!!!!! Personally I hope they make a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're reading the reviews for this movie, you probably aren't after the next Dr Zhivago or Lawrence of Arabia. You want a horror movie and probably a zombie movie to boot. Well, this follows the usual conventions of a horror movie - it's got kids in the woods making whoopee, false scares, people who take a while to figure out what's going on even when it's painfully obvious, the works.There's gore to be had, and the special effects are about average. The main complaints I've seen for this movie is that the zombies are high-speed (which has been the case for a while now, see Resident Evil (2002), 28 Days Later (2002), and the remake of Dawn of the Dead (2004)) and that the zombies 'don't follow the rules'. Well look - after a million zombie movies, do we really need another one where they follow the rules? Didn't think so.The plot is utterly predictable, some of the premises are reeeally shaky (watch how our heroes discover a secret government installation - COME... ON!) and a lot of the acting is B-rated. But there are moments which can only be described as 'really cool', a few good scares, and some great comedy (I am referring here to what happens when the military fall foul of the zombies - gotta see that if nothing else). Mena Suvari puts in a good show, Ving Rhames is watchable as always, and B-rated acting isn't as bad as, say, the second instalment of Universal Soldiers (1998) which should be shown in film schools' Crap Acting 101 classes. I think most of the ratings and reviews on this were a bit unfair. If you like your horror and your zombies, you need to give this one a go. It might even pave the way for the next step in zombie horror... ZOMBIES WHICH NEGOTIATE! Okay, that sounded a lot scarier in my head somehow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near as bad as others are saying. A pretty cool zombie flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, I did not have any hopes whatsoever when I went into viewing DAY OF THE DEAD (2008). Not only was it a remake of what I view as the best entry of GEORGE A. ROMERO'S zombie series, but also because it was being made at TARUS ENTERTAINMENT, the schlockmeisters who brought us the completely unrelated/unwatchable, DAY OF THE DEAD 2: CONTAGIUM which bears no resemblance whatsoever to the 1985 film &amp; the even worse CREEPSHOW III. However by the time the film was over, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I really liked the film. DAY OF THE DEAD (2008) despite the title &amp; claims of the film-makers, IS NOT a remake of the criminally underrated 1985 GEORGE. A. ROMERO zombie epic. The films couldn't even be more different in terms of story supposing they tried. The film is not set in an underground bunker either, although the characters do venture into one, in the last fifteen minutes of the movie, in an attempt to stop the infected zombies from escaping town &amp; spreading the virus further. MENA SUVARI heads out a talented cast that also includes such names as NICK CANNON &amp; DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) star VING RHAMES. In fact I'm going to go with my very strong hunch, that the only reason VING RHAMES was cast in the film was to lure fans of the highly successful box office smash hit DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004), into thinking this was a direct sequel to that film, for which it is not, Rhames doesn't even play the same role in the film, instead, he plays an army commander named RHODES, an entirely different character played by Joe Pilato in the original film. Aside from the character name of Rhodes being taken, other names borrowed from Romero's original (but bear no resemblance to the characters they are named after in that film) is DR. LOGAN (presented here as a cut throat &amp; uptight medic), who is one of the scientist responsible for outbreak, but never once operates on the creatures to find out why they are the way they are. SARAH, SALAZAR &amp; BUB (the zombie), here re-named BUD, a handsome if naive young soldier, with a crush on Sarah, who is eventually bitten to become a zombie, but yet shares none of the homicidal tendencies of the other zombies. In fact, he retains pretty much all of his memories before his death. Regardless of all this, DAY OF THE DEAD (2008) does however share many similarities to DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004), the zombies are "sprinters" i.e. fast moving, snarling, growling creatures that were seen in that film &amp; also a virus is responsible for the outbreak. These two things, along with Rhames casting &amp; the fact the film is billing itself as well as remake of the famous GEORGE A. ROMERO film, are the only two things the film has in common with DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004). STEVE MINER does well behind the camera, managing to redeem himself some what after the disastrous, LAKE PLACID/MAJOR MOVIE STAR &amp; the mediocre HALOWEEN H20. The acting is good &amp; the special effects/zombie make-up are pretty cool. Miner &amp; company also manage to deliver a few suspenseful scenes &amp; the beautiful scenery is well captured on film. Rhames is turned into a zombie about midway into the film with his legs torn off. In fact a similar fate would befall his character in PIRANHA 3D (Minus him turning into a zombie.)On the down side I will say the film did have a few problems with it: The plot was none to original &amp; there's also a stupid teen love story going on &amp; the usual clichéd storyline, wherein the teen brother of Sarah (Suvari) has a disdain for her because she was "Never around" for him &amp; his mother &amp; some of the CGI was pretty crappy &amp; cheap looking. But perhaps the biggest mystery the film has going for it is this: Why pay George A. Romero a ton of money for the rights to use the title of his film &amp; character names, if they were just going to do a completely different story? Why not call the film something else &amp; re-name the characters, instead of wasting what was no doubt a few million for the rights? I mean, again I understand that the film-makers were no doubt hoping to lure fans of the highly successful DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) into thinking it was a sequel when it was not, but if they were going to go through all the trouble of paying to get the rights, why not do a full on remake of the 1985 original? The film-makers could have even called this something else &amp; it no doubt still would have sold, what with the strong pedigree of talent both in front &amp; behind the camera including HALLOWEEN H20/LAKE PLACID/Friday The 13th Parts 2 &amp; 3 director Miner, FINAL DESTINATION writer JEFFREY REDDICK &amp; American PIE star MENA SUVARI. I'm also not to sure that making the main characters be in their late teens to late twenties was a good idea either, somehow they lacked that emotional depth the other characters had. DAY OF THE DEAD (2008) also boasts what has to be the worst cover to ever grace a zombie movie, even of the direct to DVD variety, a zombie puking outward, with eyes, fingers, ears &amp; even a bird claw in the vomit? I mean seriously, this is the best box art they could come up with? This made the film not only look even cheaper, but also like something a sixth grader came up with on his computer, as a sleeve cover for the home made zombie movie he made with pals over a weekend!All in all, despite some silly moments such as a zombie crawling up a ceiling(???) I highly recommend DAY OF THE DEAD (2008).***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may have zombies and the title of a Romero movie-but this film isn't anything like in his league. The similarities between the original are (thankfully) sparse. The Army involvement and "Bud" the pet zombie.I am not sure what is intended with this addition-is it a follow-up to the superior remake of Dawn of the Dead? Probably not-but they should have got someone else apart from Ving Rhames to play the Army guy,it merely confuses an already messy film.The story is very haphazard and everything is thrown into the mix early on- like having Keystone Cop speed staccato editing of fast moving zombies. It does not build up or make use of any sense of tension. Talking of "sense"- the character service the inane plotting despite totally contradicting their previous actions and beliefs. The "You can see I am a Rap Artist 'cause o' my attitude" Salazar character very nearly shoots Bud, his comrade when he is bitten. Cue a stand-off discussing why they should off him forthwith. However, when Bud becomes a zombie-everyone including Salazar lets him be: FOR NO REASON!!The director eventually tries to offer up a solution and explanation by throwing in the "it was all are own fault, playing God and creating a virus" idea, straight out of the equally terrible Resident Evil series.So much of this film derives from other sources- not necessarily a bad thing- but none of it improves on it or adds anything remotely new. Low points include: When zombies are firebombed, you get sub-standard Blade style explosions of ash. Bored of zombies walking slowly-lets crank up the speed of the film a little and have them run around like super-fast polio sufferers. Silly running not bad enough for, eh? Why not have them scurry up walls and run across the ceiling like spider-man?!! HOW???!!!! Since when did becoming one of the undead turn you into Peter Parker? The worst thing is despite all the blood and gore and running around- it was simply boring.</fullReview>

It's not a remake and it's no sequel to the 2004 DOTD remake either, it's just something to cash in on the recent resurrection of the zombie genre. The result is OK if you are into zombie movies. You get to see Mena Suvari walking around in tight military clothing and killing zombies. I for one enjoyed that a lot more than "Diary Of The Dead" by the mighty Romero. If you want to see really fantastic horror movies just leave the Romero franchise behind and move on to "Silent Hill", "28 Days Later" and "REC".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had all the potential required to be decent to great. It had money, good actors, a decent budget, and a good location. The problem is clear. First, the director swayed away from the original script of the original day of the dead movie. Sometimes it's OK to change the script a little as we observed in the Dawn of the Dead remake in 2003 which was AWESOME!. Second, keep your scenes simple. I think the director spent way too much time and effort trying to have elaborate scenes with dozens of zombies when he should have concentrated on quality scenes with one or two zombies. Third, never give your zombies supernatural powers, i.e. the ability to climb walls like spider-man or the ability to have super strength. I think that there is even a scene where zombies are being electrocuted, catch on fire, and continue to eat their victim while all this is going on. Fourth, spend more time with character development. Most good movies, horror or otherwise, spend at least the first 15-20 minutes of the movie trying to introduce the main characters, and then give you follow up information throughout the movie. This keeps the viewer intrigued throughout the movie. Fifth, always try to link sequels when you can. Ving Rhames was a key character in the 2003 dawn of the dead, and it would have been awesome if he had somehow survived the original zombie outbreak. Speaking of which. If this was supposed to be Day of the Dead, wouldn't this movie have occurred years after the original zombie outbreak or did I miss something. All and all this movie is classified as a missed opportunity for greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much from the fraud of a remake that was certainly bound to be. And it is actually. This IS NOT a remake of Romero's masterpiece. But what the heck? so much the better! How about going on a fresh start on this one and simply take it for what it is: a darn good horror movie, for a change. Who cares about the so-called "Zombie rules" as long as the film gets the audience on the edge of his seat. And it did as far as I was concerned. OK the film is not so good as the DAWN remake, but fair enough. Just don't take too much into account the first 5 minutes around the usual brainless teenagers partying. It goes wrong early enough in the film to get intrigued, and finally scared. I consider myself a very peaky movie-viewer. This one is worth seeing for sure!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as everyone is saying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting this movie to be a disaster, based on what everyone else was saying. But after watching it twice, I must say it was better than expected.The plot was about what you would expect from a zombie movie, and nobody ever said that Romero's movies were overly complex. There was some cheesy and inconsistent dialog (the crooked doctor ridiculing the young troops for their incompetence, then defending the wounded boy when he's about to be killed by his fellow soldier, then abandons them all without a second thought a few seconds later?) The depiction of the military was very poor (license plates on Humvees, Captains supervising Corporals, etc) but that is to be expected in most movies wherein our armed forces are represented. Please note, DOTD 2004 did a pretty poor job in this area as well (a 3-star general with a totally messed up beret making a media statement, come on!!) I thought the actors actually did a pretty good job in this movie. They were almost universally young, good looking unrecognizables and the way they portrayed their private first class characters was believable.The zombies climbing on the ceilings and other acrobatics were not as annoying as some have made them out to be. The way the "Bud" character was handled a little on the lame side, but I have a feeling that was a last minute script change after the director realized he would otherwise have to kill off the most likable character very early on in the movie.Anyway, this is not an attempt to redo Romero's 1985 work, but is a decent stand-alone, low budget horror film. Give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 3 worst zombie films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can now say I've seen the worst three zombie films ever created. After sitting through this piece of crap, the three, in no particular order are this, Rising Dead, and Flight of the Living Dead (or sometimes referred to as Plane Dead). I went into this film with mediocre hopes. I didn't expect it to even be in the same ballpark as the original Day of the Dead, but I expected at least a similar story. This is a completely new story using the same name as another film, and acknowledging the fact that it's doing just that. You do not make a remake and completely scrap EVERY single piece of story that was in the original, that just does not make sense.The basic story for this film is that some kind of cold is sweeping the quaint Colorado city causing everyone to get progressively sick and then get nosebleeds. Turns out that when you start getting those nosebleeds, shortly afterwards you're going to turn into a super zombie. These guys are like G-Virus zombies on even more steroids. I have never seen another zombie film where zombies are able to perform Spider-Man like feats and hope I never come across another. Zombies should not be able to stick to walls, I'm sorry.My other big upset for this film was Nick Cannon. I understand that every movie that has come out within the last decade is required to have the "token black guy" but why does he have to be so damn annoying in this film? Every line out of the guy's mouth was more ear-gougingly painful than the previous. The only time I liked the character is when he had some common sense in wanting to kill the zombie they were 'saving' for no good reason.I guess it all comes down to the fact that I'm very disappointed they chose to title this Day of the Dead. Hell, even if they made it another Return of the Living Dead sequel I wouldn't have been so upset. Those films are supposed to have some comedic slapstick value, and that's exactly what this movie had. Unfortunately, I don't think that was intentional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the worst zombie movie I'll ever see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprisingly forgiving of zombie movies. I enjoy the Return of the Living Dead movies on a certain level. I didn't even mind Children of the Living Dead. But this movie is on approximately the same level as House of the Dead.The problems with this movie aren't limited to just the script, which is pretty poor. First of all, Nick Cannon's character has slipped into self-parody. Second of all, there are threads created that are never resolved, and not even in a likable way. Notice all of the references to her gun being unloaded, and that "it's complicated?" This is not funny to use it as a gag. It's not a joke - it's just poor writing. The bigger problem is with directorial choices. Steve Miner has directed some fun movies, (notably Warlock and House) but he appears to be trying to channel Uwe Boll's style with this one. Immediately after leaving the hospital, there is a fight sequence that involves randomly changing up slow motion and fast motion. This is both irritating to watch, but absurdly comical as well. It's hard to take the dead as a threat when they are acting like they limp, but are moving about 1.5 times as fast as normal humans. After the group finishes off a slew of dead, the zombies from the hospital all decide to simultaneously jump out of their respective windows to attack our heroes. If this were a musical, I would probably think this was a good directorial choice. But it's a horror movie, and some semblance of realism goes a long way to making it scary.There are lots of silly things like this throughout the production.I watched Flight of the Dead, and didn't feel as bad about that movie as I did about this one.Perhaps the movie would be more acceptable with a different title? The movie has two things to do with the original. First, they have some of the same character names. Second, there is an underground military bunker. But for some reason, the bunker reminds me more of Resident Evil than Day of the Dead.Part of the reason that the original was titled Day of the Dead is that the plague has reached a point where the dead are the dominate species. This movie deals with what appears to be an isolated outbreak in a Colorado town.I don't think I could say enough to persuade people that this isn't worth seeing. But that isn't true. It is entirely worth seeing, since it makes us feel like we could make a movie.(Note - I only rated this two stars because I've got a soft spot for zombies of all types, even spider-man ones.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really a remake - a very "pleasant" surprise...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I read a comment that totally slandered this movie just before I actually saw it and had very low expectations. Fortunately this movie was a very pleasant surprise. First of all - it's not really a remake of one of my absolute favorite zombie movies - Day of the dead (1985?). The only thing these movies have in common are zombies and a military facility that plays a role in these movies. Oh - and decent acting too, especially this movie was very well made and acted in my opinion. I also think the effects in this movie are quit good, and the pace is pretty high. This movie works more in the typical "american horror movie" way with quick scares built up on graphical and sound effects while the old movie had a more "end of the world"-atmosphere to it which made it so strong, and which this movie perhaps falls short on. Needles to say - it IS a little predictable at times. But so what - that goes for a LOT of movies out there today.I would propably best describe this movie as an action/horror - a classical zombie movies mixed with "Resident evil" and a hint of "28 days later". All things considered - it's a very entertaining and well made zombie-flick for us fans, and a pretty decent horror movie others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honestly, A Very Bad Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly enjoyed the George Romero zombie flicks and am very disappointed when some rookie director comes up with a 'remake' of one of the master's titles. A rookie in the sense of trying to capture the dark, gritty, viciousness of the zombie epidemic as envisioned by Romero in his earlier films. Steve Miner has directed episodes of Dawson's Creek, (which explains some of this film's truly boring dialog and Ken and Barbie type characters)and Smallville (which has effectively turned Superman into a soap opera).What Miner has done here is show us that he can capture all of the plot lines, and zombie behavior previously shown in a dozen zombie flicks, put Mena Suvari (of American Beauty) in the lead and make a horrible horror movie.While this film might appeal to young folks who don't understand the art as developed by Romero, those who do will undoubtedly turn away from this one after the first half hour. It only takes that long to get an idea of the poor characters. Suvari plays an army Corporal (who carries a gun with no bullets. Why even pull it out?) Ving Rhames has a small part, perhaps wise enough to not stick around. Suvari's character is remarkably calm in the face of danger despite her seemingly bad decision making. The rest of the cast are like refugees from a Dawson's Creek episode.The zombies seem to do extraordinary things one moment (like crawl on ceilings and run real fast), but when it comes to attacking the lead actors they seem inept.Suvari's character wants to keep a colleague-turned-zombie around amongst the fleeing survivors. Why? She barely knew the guy.This picture doesn't do any justice to the zombie film genre. it ranks down there with the very low budget. The title was used to possibly draw attention to it's existence, nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you love zombies, and don't expect a Romero remake, you'll be alright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the title and description of this movie would lead you to believe that it's some sort of remake of the George Romero version of Day of the Dead, it very much has nothing to do with that movie, or even the Romero zombie universe from what I can tell. In the Romero universe, the origin of the outbreak is never revealed, there is no clear reason for why what happens happens, it just does. In this movie, they eventually explain exactly why people get infected, and who did it, and in the end, the all but contain the infection, which never happens in the Romero universe.Having said that, if you enjoy zombie movies, this could be a lot worse. The acting is decent, the special effects and gore are about what you would expect, sometimes better than what you expect. I would recommend it as a rental if nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mistake to call it a Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not giving this 1 because it's bad but it's not quite that bad. Sure their pretending its a remake of the 1985 movie which it's not.We have a character called Bud who becomes a friendly zombie, we get into a bunker (but we're more than 2/3's of the way through the movie before that ever happens) and thats about all that's anywhere close to the 1985 version.People change from sick, to dead, to zombie far too fast. They also made them all into super zombies, able to run fast, jump long distances and run/walk on walls &amp; ceilings. That's the only real new idea this film brings to the table. Oh, and that Zombies explode when exposed to fire.It steals a lot from Resident Evil and even goes as far as to steal from that sci-fi great "The Andromeda Strain" by calling the project that creates the virus "Project Wildfire" (the name of the underground bunker in The Andromeda Strain).You don't get enough character development on any of the people to care who lives or dies. Their very weak idea on how to use Zombie Bub before killing him was truly laughable in it's lack of both creativity and unoriginality.They defeat too many Zombies much too easily and far too many of them live at the end. It's a very weak ending with 3 of them escaping alive and the fake-out scare right at the end.I thought Romero had sullied his good name before but this has truly dragged whatever was left of his good reputation through the mire and beyond. I wouldn't even recommend this to the most die-hard Zombie movie or Romero fans.</fullReview>

It really wasn't all that spectacular, but it was a nice way to kill an evening.Not original, not even remotely close to being anything other then nonsense from the word go. Not bad, not great, just mediocre at best, which i can understand why it's a direct to DVD.What would make something like this really enjoyable would be if it didn't take itself so seriously. Movies that are trying to be more then what they are often fall short of their intended goal.It would be nice to see a zombie move that doesn't take itself too seriously and has just enough camp for it to be worth purchasing.Of course if that happened, then everyone would just say that it was ripping off Evil Dead and Army of Darkness...Oh well &gt;8^P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i'll start by saying that the film isn't all that bad, considering it not to be related with the Romero films except in title and some of the character's names, of course, as so many have said.to start with, the "creatures" depicted are alive before "turning", therefore they cannot be zombies, they are more victims of some sort of virus, much like in Resident Evil, than anything else.it's also odd that a virus that destroys the neural synapses can enhance physical capacities, but that's what fiction is all about, i suppose.other than that, there are a few interesting scenes, the same usual clichés and, of course, predictable ones.all in all, there are worse films than this, only i feel it's not fair to have it associated with the Romero saga, since it differs so much from them (much like this last remake of Dawn of the Dead did, with those speed zombies).</fullReview>

These things do not shamble towards you, they RUN at you full speed, made for some really hair raising scenes.You really have to go out and buy this movie, its definitely in the top 10 all time awesome zombie films.

		<fullReview>I'm not really a gore-film fan (I like horror of the Steven King's type though) but I was quite positively surprised with this one. There is nothing special about the plot, we have again humans turned into bloodthirsty zombies, yet now the zombies look for the first time really horrifying, dreadful, and dangerous like starving wolves and not just like poor stinky folks, slowly decaying and moving like mindless robots (who you'd rather pity than be scared of). This time the zombies are like beasts - fast, deadly, with eyes filled with a mixture of hate and hunger. And here I think I can say there is more to this movie than just the blood and the torn flesh, because we see what is left of a human when his humanity (soul) and intelligence are gone - a pure predatory instinct, a naked hunger for flesh. This is nothing but our primordial nature - something we have hidden with the presumption that we are the state-of-the art beings on this planet. Remember movies like "American psycho" and also "Wolf" with J. Nicholson. NEVER UNDERESTIMATE HUMAN NATURE!!! This is not something that we don't possess, nor it is something we should suppress - it is something we should control.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason this movie was a let down is the title. It doesn't really fit the night dawn and day trilogy as the outbreak is not global. I was expecting a "remake" of Day of the Dead. What I got was a very fast paced zombie movie. It really doesn't get into the social problems that were such a big part of the original film. The survivors in the original had as much trouble coping with each other as well as the zombies. This movie shouldn't be compared to the original except to say that it borrowed a few aspects from the original; the zombies were intelligent, one even befriended the survivors, the survivors retreated to an underground bunker but thats where it went wrong. By the time they were in the bunker the movie was at its climax. I was really expecting more, like the classic Romero safe zone where the survivors are actually enjoying themselves before everything goes to hell again. This safe zone is where Romero likes to build a relationship between the audience and the characters in the film. All the same, this movie definitely belongs in any RomZom collection, just overlook the title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad In It's Own Right, Awful When Measured Against The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last few years have seen a resurgence in the popularity and overall volume of zombie movies. There have been quality releases, such as the remake of Dawn of the Dead, Forever Dead, and Automaton Transfusion. However, the remake of Day of the Dead may very well rank as the worst zombie movie to come out in a very long time. As a pure zombie movie, it's bad in the context of poor casting and poor direction. However, when viewing it from the more critical stand point of being a remake of the original film by George A. Romero, this film is simply a celluloid mess.The original Day of the Dead came to screens as something other than what George A Romero originally intended. Suffering from a severally trimmed budget, and problems with Universal Studios, Day of the Dead became a much smaller scale film than Romero had originally intended. However, this ultimately made for a good film, allowing for some good characters, interesting plot, complete with Romero's social commentary, and a memorable villain in Captain Rhoades, and a memorable character in the zombie known as Bub.In the remake of Day of the Dead, the original concept has been clearly forgotten, as are the themes of social commentary, and well developed likable characters. Ving Rhames turns to the zombie genre, this time out taking on the role of Captain Rhoades. This time out however, Rhoades has been removed as the films true villain, and overall screen time and impact are so short, that it's really a waste of the talents and time of Ving Rhames. Mena Suvari is horribly cast the main hero of the film, an Army Corporal returning to her hometown after the zombie virus as begun to annihilate her hometown. Nick Cannon plays the part of the bad ass, machismo Army Private, and while not giving a particularly good performance, due in part to the horrible script, Cannon does manage to bring some charisma and toughness to the character.This time out, the Zombies follow in the vain of Dawn of the Dead, in that they run, jump, climb, and yes you will be reading this correctly...crawl across ceilings. Once infected, the Zombies come to life after a momentary catatonic, dead state, and without explanation, begin to rot and deteriorate immediately. It's an interesting idea, but never fleshed out well enough to make sense or impact.What really drives a stake through the heart of the movie however, is the truly cruel bastardization of the zombie character known as Bub. In the original, Bub was the equivalent of the lab rat, used in experiments to domesticate zombies. Bub was a docile, emotive zombie, who not only expressed memory of things such as music, and verbal communication, but also expressed the capacity to care for living beings. It was in this that Bub truly became to the stand out piece of the film, and arguably one of the most popular characters in any zombie film, ever.In this remake, Bub is a recently enlisted Army Private with a crush on Mena Suvari's character, Corporal Cross. "Bub" becomes a zombie after sustaining bites...and takes his place as the docile zombie in the crew of heroes. However, no true time is taken to establish Bub's docile nature, other than that he will listen to anything Suvari's character says, acting on the memory of his infatuation with her while still living. Ultimately, Bub comes off as a mere target of constant on-liners and trash talk from Nick Cannon's character, and ultimately becomes nothing more than comedic relief, rather than the cornerstone of the film and concept of zombie evolution.Another original character bastardized for this film is that of Dr. Logan. In the original, Logan was the lead scientist looking for a way to domesticate the zombies, his prize pupil being Bub. Part of the heart of that film was the relationship with Logan and Bub, in that Bub actually cared about Logan. It was also well established that Logan was not so much eccentric, as he may have been flat out crazy. There is no Bub/Logan relationship in this film, and the remakes version of Dr. Logan strays far from the original. While this is not necessarily a horrible thing, Logan seemed to exist only to ultimately become the 'super zombie' nemesis for the films climax.Had this movie wasn't associated with the original, it could pass as an admirable, but flawed attempt at a quality zombie film. However, being a remake, while saddled with so many clichés and shortcomings cripples the film. I'm not sure what George Romero himself thinks of this, or if he has even seen it, but I can't imagine he's flattered or all together happy about it. In the end everyone will form their own thoughts on this film, so I would say only to go in with an open mind, not clinging to the original, hoping to see constant nods and odes to it. Simply view it as a zombie film, and perhaps you will enjoy it. But if you are a Romero loyalist such as myself, this film will probably leave a very bad taste in your mouth. Day of the Dead it is not, rather it is truly Dud of the Dead.</fullReview>

Screenplay is threaded with deja-vu's, they use almost every "trick" in the book, that has been used ad nauseam already and they aren't even trying to invent new ways of selling it. Oh wait, "zombie love" actually IS something new, but trust me, it's not as exciting as it might sound. The acting was sub-average on most part, but often it was interrupted by Razzie award kind of acting, except the actors whom I'd nominate, wouldn't actually get a Razzie, because they suck too much to ever make a career to which a Razzie could make a dent. I mean, why kick a dead horse? There are exceptions in this movie though, but very rare and their attempt to rise the quality of the movie equals the attempt to improve the taste of rotten egg pancake by spreading chocolate and honey on it. Sounds better, but it's still completely revolting.I would recommend this movie to anyone who intends to half-watch it. You know what I mean, watch it with a boy/girlfriend. I guarantee it will eventually redirect your/his/her attention away from the screen. For this alone, it gets a 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake? No. Great gore fest zombie romp? Yes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what is with all the awful reviews on this? I mean come on, this movie rocked. Yeah so it wasn't the greatest and yes I do know it doesn't follow the original whatsoever, but this was a heck of a good time. What's with all the bashing? I am a HUGE fan of the original Romero films, and yes, this wasn't even close to par with those but this wasn't nearly as bad as people have said it is. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. It is your typical zombie flick that we've seen a hundred times but who cares? It is still fun to watch. You have to have an open mind. If you truly love horror, you should enjoy this. I thought Suvari and the rest of the cast did a good job. I was saddened at Rhames small role though. This had gore galore, which in my book is awesome. The gore was OK, it was CGI and I did think it could have been better, but it wasn't horrible. The zombies looked pretty cool, they weren't the lame zombies we've seen too many times. The story is nothing new but I didn't care and neither should you. If you want a good fun gore fest, then this should work just fine. Don't expect high quality, just look forward to enjoying yourself and you will be satisfied. I know I was. Next up is Diary of the dead. Can't wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>S_W's review of 'Day of the Dead' (2008)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Day of the Dead' (2008) In comparison to the original. . . there is none. No characters are the same. The setting is completely different. The plot is entirely different. The only similarities this film has to the original is a title and a couple character names. Even though Dr. Logan is now a 35 year old hospital physician.Without comparison. . . the SFX were horrendous. . . decapitation and head explosions looked like something from '96. 1896. Even back then it would've probably been pretty bad. The zombies look like utter morons running around. Their arms flail all over the place (yeah, that makes sense for a dead guy, flailing arms like a chimp). And. . . they can climb on ceilings and walls like Spiderman. Yeah. I kid you not. It looked like something out of Resident Evil or House of the Dead or whatever that one wicked video game is.The acting is pretty awful. Even from (and especially from) the adorable Mena Suvari. Ving Rhames, the only shining light I had for this movie, is gone within the first 40 or so minutes and ends up playing a mockery of a zombie. Nick Cannon, or *cough* Salazar (trust me, he's no Antone DiLeo), plays an over-the-top moron jerk for most of the film.As you watch, look closely at the military personnel. And find me one that actually knows how hold a goddamn gun. I mean, yeah, these are National Guardsman, but still. . . they DO see combat, so they should probably learn how to operate their equipment. Also, someone should tell Mena. . . bangs are a big no-no in uniform. The military requires you to clip those back. Especially when they're covering your eyes, you blithering idiot.As far as actual film-making goes, the writing is stiff and contains a pretty good amount of outward spoken monologues. You know how much I hate that. Remember The Wicker Man remake? That's what I'm talking about. (Girl walking alone in Woods: "It's so over! Huh? What's that?") Seriously. I believe it was Syd Field who said that, in addition to unintentional humour, outward-spoken inner monologue is the biggest mistake a writer can make. Guess what else this film had. The direction and cinematography, too, are fairly bad. Though it might be the fault of the editor, as the cuts are almost unwatchable at times.I'm writing this review as I watch the last 15 or so minutes. So, correct me if I'm wrong (but, as a Romero fanboy, I don't think I am), but the bunker was a PRETTY important setting in the original right? Well, guess where they've just arrived. Yeah, the military bunker. With 15 minutes left.- - - So, the rest of this will be my old 'Credit 2 Credit' review, my thoughts as it happens.Awesome line: 'Some people have a natural immunity to specific viruses.' Now, can someone please explain to me exactly how one's body would develop a 'natural immunity' to a man-made, unnatural virus? That is just a totally ridiculous statement.Wow. So much for conservation of ammo. They just put about 200 rounds into this ghoul and it's still standing. That's preservation, folks! Preservation of the dead, that is! Dr. Logan's death was kinda cool. I'll give them that. You knew it was going to happen soon, but that was actually a good way to go. Me likey.Does anyone else hate slow-motion death scenes? Seriously? They're so melodramatic and remind me of something from a freaking daytime soap. "Sarahhh, runnnn!" Doesn't get much more lame than that, to be honest.So, this fire plan is okay, I guess. I mean, it does what it's meant to do, but does no one notice the one smallllll problem with it? The fact that they're well below the Earth's surface in a CLOSED nike site? So when large amounts of fire course through the tunnels, I'm pretty sure they'd have a bit of a problem. . . breathing. Suspension of disbelief doesn't extend to lack of oxygen, sorry.But hey, at least they get to ride home in style. Who wouldn't want to drive away from a zombie invasion in a pimp G Wagon?Wow. That ending shot. . . is like a less scary, much lamer version of those scary maze games online. Sad.- - - Well, it's over. Finally. The film, though terribly made, with almost no cinematic value, including very low quality writing, directing, editing, acting, and SFX artistry. . . was still watchable and held my attention long enough to get me through it. So, for that, 'Day of the Dead' (2008) receives: 3/10-AP3-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuinely good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a zombie fan since I was eleven and saw Dawn Of The Dead (1978) in a neighbors basement. I was hooked from that moment on and since then I've spent countless hours watching every movie from this genre I could get my hands on. In many cases I've been disappointed and at times disheartened, but in this instance I don't mind saying that I am happy to have watched this movie.I heard a lot of bad comments about this remake before ever setting eyes on the film. Much of what I heard revolved around Nick Cannon being in it. I'll grant you his performance is at times over the top but I believe that was the film makers intention for the character he's portraying. Cannon himself actually does a pretty decent job in his role and although I'm not about to rush off and buy all of his movies, I don't see where the negativity about him is coming from. At least in this case. In fact, the comments I heard about all of the acting being overdone and cheesy are totally unjustified.Overall, everyone in this movie provides a good performance. Most of the acting is solid enough and I found everyones performance quite enjoyable. In fact I would have to wonder how many critics bashing the movie have actually watched it, or at least watched past the first ten minutes. The special effects are well done, the weapons are well chosen, the settings are great and the story is good enough to keep your attention through the entire movie. There are some very tense moments and some genuine "make you jump" moments as well.To add to that, for fans of zombie movies, there are plenty of references to the original Day Of The Dead. Those references are well placed and timed so that people who haven't seen the original will find them enjoyable but fans will get the point. Granted this movie is entirely different then the 1985 version but it's different in a good way. The story here adds to the concept of a zombie outbreak, takes it one step further and does it very well. There are some new twists to old ideas presented, and in this day and age without new ideas the zombie movie would, itself, be dead. Pun intended.If I had to compare this film to any modern movie I would say it is easily as good as the Dawn Of The Dead remake if not a little better at times. It blows away all of the lousy low budget zombie movies that have hit the market over the past seven years with the exception of Zombie Wars. I'd say their about on par with each other, though this movie looks better and obviously had a bigger budget.If your a fan of zombie films and don't mind the new "hyper zombie" then check this out. If your a horror fan but you don't really like zombies, or you go for the old stiff, slow walking zombies then skip this movie and save yourself the trouble of writing a bad review.On a final note, if you've read the other reviews here, I've seen Plane Dead (aka Zombies On a Plane) and it's a pretty good movie in my opinion. Not quite as a good as this, but well worth watching for decent acting, a good story and some fine zombie horror. It's also rife with good special effects, lots of gun play and the all important witty dialog the could only come from people faced with being eaten alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty damn good -spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd been warned against this film by so many people and with a straight to DVD release in the uk i didn't expect much. I remember seeing the trailer and thinking how terrible it looked but, I actually loved this film!!!It does everything a good zombie flick should do - a half decent story line, scare you a bit, keep you in suspense and have tons of gore! This film delivers on all four. There's been so many remakes and wannabe zombie films out recently every man and his zombie dog has had a go so its not surprising that the quality has left something to be desired. Half way through 'Day of the Dead' 08 I was thinking 'this is nothing like the original so why be classed as a remake?' But then once the action gets going and your treated to complete mayhem and oceans of very well done gore you start to see beautiful references; The likable, innocent, male love interest character shockingly takes on the role of 'Bub' from the original and is aptly named 'Bud'. He retains some of his personality and hilariously refuses to eat people because he was/is a vegetarian. He is not studied by a 'Dr Frankenstein' but tries to shoot the 'undead version' and save his would be girlfriend. The one thing I really wanted to see was a few survivors holed up in a claustrophoebic underground bunker and I did! ...The few survivors take refuge in an old log cabin in the woods, upon exploring it further they find it leads to a secret scientific research bunker where scientists were not only researching the virus, they created it. Genius, not only are we treated to major factor of the original but we finally learn the cause of the outbreak, something quite rare especially for a Romero homage. We are also treated to a csi style take on a microscopic view of the virus taking a hold on the central nervous system - something the virus was original intended to do, designed as a biological weapon to disable enemy troops which mutated and turns people into flesh eating hordes of the undead - believable in my opinion. The photography is pretty damn good too except for the blatant fast/scream shots taken directly from 'dawn of the dead' remake, but it had to link its to somehow, even if it is copying.We have the gun ho soldier using a makeshift spear, a machete and about ten different guns all utilizing the fx budget to maximum potential. The director has got the suspense down to a T or is that Z? I even felt my heart rate increase at one point which hasn't happened for a while maybe because i watched 'Black sheep' recently which failed terribly in that department so i was in need of some edge of your seat entertainment, who knows but it works! The zombies run, climb ladders and even scuttle upside down on ceilings and walls, i wasn't sure about this at first but upon thinking about it i quite like it, it shows the virus has well and truly taken ahold of their brains and the subject will stop at nothing to feed on human flesh, they will do everything within their physical reach to gain that, even if t means falling 2 stories out of a window or setting themselves on fire at an electrical genrator, zombies are stupid don't you know! Theoretically when they've rotted a bit, these actions will diminish. The only complaint I have about this film is as soon as the virus takes hold the skin is instantly rotten, this pays for me a personal tribute to 'Hammer Horrors Plague of the zombies' so i'll let it slide but usually this shouldn't happen and isn't really explained. There are no deep meaningful lessons to be learned here, no Romero-esquire principals of society today or statements of war and world leadership, there is however a zombie flick that ticks all the right boxes and doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't, I can finally say after a long time of watching all the god awful crap that has been made that this film will firmly take place on my shelf of zombie films. I am an absolute zombie fanatic and tend to take films seriously but with this one - come on, who cares? It wasn't nearly as good as the wonderful 'dawn of the Dead' remake, nor does it try to be but, it has a load of good points and not many bad - get a few mates round, a crate of beer, sit back and enjoy the film. Its a thousand times better than 'Diary of the Dead' urrgh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent film worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. People get caught up too much on the semantics of a movie and sometimes don't just sit and enjoy it. I like to watch zombie movies not because I want to see witty dialog, stellar acting, political undertones, etc. I just like seeing zombies get blown away in as many ways as possible. The effects in this movie are similar to those your might find in a USA Network made for TV movie and they are a heck of a lot better than a Sci-FI Network original movie.This movie is not a mirror image remake of the 1985 version (Which I own and love), it does have parallels to the original, such as the tame zombie named Bud, an underground missile silo/bunker/lab, mad scientist, gung-ho soldiers, government cover-up, strong female actress in lead role, etc.The zombie's did things in this movie like running like a cheetah on crack, climbing on the ceiling, jumping high into the air, breaking through barriers, etc. That in my opinion diminished the movie a little, but, they where tolerable and I still enjoyed the movie.The plot of this movie was not that bad, in my opinion it felt like a grade B movie, but, I didn't feel like I wasted my time watching it like I did with movies like JUNO, SLEUTH, etc, that have gotten rave reviews on IMDb ,but, their plots are in a class by themselves, like maybe a grade Z-.As for my opinion about George Romero after this movie, I still absolutely love his work and will continue to watch his movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was HORRIBLE! The only reason I gave it a 2 is for the somewhat good gore factor ... That's it. Awful acting, the zombies were a cross between spider-man and EVERY ghost in the endless stream of Japanese horror remakes as they have the super ability to crawl on walls and ceilings. Mena Suvari as the tough military girl just didn't cut it either. I think after this atrocity in film making she will be lucky to land supporting rolls in Sci-Fi originals for the remainder of her career. There was absolutely nothing original about this film. Just another sub-par movie trying to capitalize on a legendary title. I hope George Romero never sees this piece of garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as they say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people are ripping on this movie so I had pretty low expectations when I saw this, so maybe that's why I liked it so much. Admittedly it's not a masterpiece, and not as good as Land of the Dead or the previous Dawn of the Dead remake, but I was pretty interested in what was happening and I wasn't bored. Mena Suvari's presence surely helps. Also some nice tongue-in-cheek one liners.I think the fact that they named this Day of the Dead creates a false sense of expectation. It really has nothing to do with any Romero film or even the previous Dead remake. It's just an adventure/escape flick involving zombies.I don't really get why so many people get hung up on the "running"/"wall-climbing" aspects of these zombies. Because of some digital slow-hand-cranking (ie - film speeds up to make the zombies seem even faster) I thought that was kind of interesting. I actually like it when people try twists on a theme and not just stick to the rules. If you want to see "classic" zombies there are hours of that at the rental store.There's not much social commentary (well none actually unless you count "not trusting the government"). I don't really watch zombie films to look for the social/political messages, I get enough spam as it is. It did give me that apocalyptic/trapped feeling though so I would say that this film worked for me. Just ignore the title and don't associate this with Romero. Actually I thought Romero's social critiques in the original trio were pretty interesting, but again that's not something I really look for in a zombie film. This is just a fun, short wild ride with zombies and Mena Suvari. Worth a solid rental, but maybe not 11 bucks in a theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is more of what the Dawn of the Dead remake should have been. Although, we get less characterization here, we get a lot more zombie action.The movie shows the beginning of the outbreak and what happens to the people at the hospital and the soldiers who are trying to contain it. It's kind of like the scenes you wish were added to Dawn of the Dead and weren't.The zombie makeup and gore are very good. The action is very good. Not too much of a plot, though.Don't expect a real retelling of the original Day of the Dead. This movie is a far cry from that one. This one is an offshoot of the Dawn of the Dead remake. So, it kind of feels like it takes place in their universe and we are seeing all we didn't get to see with that movie. We even get an explanation of what the virus is and where it came from.I gave this movie a rating of six. I would have gone higher, but there was way too little characterization for my tastes. I really didn't feel like I knew much about the characters. I'm hoping they added some of this to any deleted scenes that might appear in the future.As far as the zombies go, they were actually scarier and more aggressive here than they were in Dawn. And there are some great shots of them.This movie is better than I expected. Don't pass it up, it's really not that bad. And you might want to watch it back to back with Dawn of the Dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with those who are are lamenting the fact that Romero's name and classic film title are attached to this. With that being said: As its own movie, this is not bad. It is kind of a new take on the zombie classic. The zombies were more supernatural (I will not spoil anything. Just do not expect the classic zombie prototype) than usual but I found myself enjoying the movie way more than any of its recent peers. There was a lot of suspense and non-stop action that made the movie worthwhile. If you are looking for a remake of the classic you will be horribly disappointed, so do not do it. I will not go into the many, many reasons why. Just take my word for it and go in with no expectations. You just may enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK granted the movie doesn't exactly deserve an Oscar nomination, it's not a bad movie at all! I am a huge zombie movie fan, and I enjoyed this title. It's on par with Land of the Dead. This movie does have its flaws: the CG blood doesn't look that cool, and would have been better if made the "old fashioned way," and the character development isn't all that great. Also, the description for how the virus broke out and is affecting some people but not others is pretty lame. Mina Suvari and Nick Cannon do a pretty good job, though. She's an enjoyable character, and he's the wisecracking, ass-kicking "doesn't take any crap" character which every zombie movie needs... So the worst kind of zombie is a fast zombie, and that's the flavor for this movie. They aren't just fast, but are portrayed like most movies show vampires: they have superhuman agility and a fatal flaw (don't wanna ruin it, even though it's not really important). This may not be worth an entire movie ticket, but is definitely worth your time. Rent it, or download it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a perfect day,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>not by a longshot. At some point it struck me that when the zombies appear to be smarter and turn out to be faster than the humans, something has been lost in the progress. But is that enough to make this movie unlikeable?At the beginning the movie starts very slow and I felt like I was watching one of these teen horror flicks as lead players all appeared to be twenty something. In fact they were. Now why does that disturb me? Mena Suvari plays a good lead role, but also an somewhat unbelievable one as she is a corporal in the army, but doesn't look the part. She seems more like a photo model who just stepped of a catwalk showing off the latest army gear clothing line. This is shown whenever she handles a gun: you can almost see her thinking: I need to keep it as far away from me as possible as it is going to make an awful loud bang when I pull the trigger. Neither do Cannon or Sands act like the privates they portray, but more like a couple of high school students walking out from a fraternity party. Especially Cannon who tries to be funny but isn't. He reminds me of the many funny sidekick attempts that drags down a movie when done wrong.More believable are McCord and Welch who play what they are. Young people caught in a bad situation and making a run for it, while fighting of the undead.The storyline itself wanders all over the place instead of concentrating on one tale. At several moments we get sidetracked with stories of people who hardly matter for the whole tale and we even get to follow two groups making their way through the zombie apocalypse. This all dilutes the strength of the story. The movies gets weaker because characters at some moments make really stupid decisions, like when Suvari drives her Humvee off the road into the dark wildlands with a predictable result. How stupid can you be? Or better why does the script have her make such a stupid decision. As a soldier she ought to know better.This movie isn't an unmitigated disaster but there is a reason why cult classics work and that is not just because it was the first or put on a pedestal for no good reason at all. Movies, unless handled by a great director, better stick to a simple tale, using a fitting cast. If that is in place good music, dialog and the rest can make the movie better. This remake fails to attain that basic setup and it is why it fails.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was seriously excited about watching this re-imagining of George Romero's 1985 classic of the same name, but wow was I in for a massive shock and not a good one. Even with a veteran horror director like Steve Miner and a decent $18 million budget this film has no right to go by the same name as the 1985 day of the dead. Everything is computer generated so what was one of the 1985 films strongest features (Tom Savini's spectacular horror make-up) is lost and the zombies themselves are somehow able to climb the walls like insects. The acting is extremely substandard and the story gets lost along the way. This is a great discredit to the previous 2 remakes that were well made and overall much better films. The 1985 version is one of my favourite horror films and I feel betrayed by this shockingly bad version. Not just a bad film compared to the previous films in this series but definitely one of the worst horror films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Romero directed "Day of the Dead" in 1985, a nihilistic little masterpiece. Director Steve Miner would release a film by the same name in 2008.Fans of Romero's film were unsurprisingly disappointed with Miner's feature. Romero was political, unconventional, satirical, and took his time when building tension. Miner, in contrast, is simply interested in making a teen slasher movie. In his film, humans run from monsters. End of story.Still, at the very least, Miner's trashy film is more tolerable than Zack Snyder's "Dawn of the Dead", a 2004 remake of Romero's 1978 horror classic of the same name. Where Snyder tries desperately to be cool, hip and glossy, and where Synder tries pathetically to "construct characters with depth", Miner's content with basics: humans run from monsters. Shoot. Print. End of story.Actress Sarah Polley was the only bright spot in Snyder's flick. Mena Suvari, cute in uniform, is similarly one of the few bright spots in Miner's. She plays Sarah Bowman, a US Army Corporal struggling to escape a Colorado town infested with zombies. Like most bad horror movies, or most contemporary remakes derived from allegorical source-material, the "monsters" here are now something "literal" and "carefully explained": the product of a government designed virus gone haywire. Such literalism epitomises Miner's entire film; humans run from monsters. End of story.6.9/10 - With little connection to Romero's film, Miner's "Dawn" works fairly well as a standalone, B-movie. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Similarity to the Romero classic stops at the name. The premise of this 'version' is quite different- the zombie plague breaks out during the course of the film, as opposed to being well established as in the Romero original. Whete the original 'Day' took time to develop characters , suspense and drama using largely unknown actors unfortunately this film rapidly turns into a brainless shoot em up, packed with cliché upon cliché, there are so many ludicrous moments, it is astounding the actors did not stop during filming and question that no one would ever behave in the ways the characters do. Its a shame, because the film obviously cost a lot of money, and the sound, effects and sets are well done, but there is some very dodgy camera work and editing with the zombies being speeded up and given odd behaviour such as being able to defy gravity. Even the usually talented Suvari is just drifting through this film, her face having 'what am I doing here' written all over it. Nick Cannons character is so appalling as to be deeply offensive to anyone with half a brain. The plot holes are just a joke. No one seems panicked at the mayhem taking place, other than the screaming blonde girl with the tight vest, the gun shop packed with untouched automatic weapons that wasn't locked, and so on and so on. A waste of time better spent doing absolutely anything else. This film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I pity Ving Rhames all the way to the bank.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indeedly a Interesting Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie, Day of the Dead (remake), to me is considered one of the most outrageous zombie films I have seen in my life. The characters itself are dull, melodramatic?no sort of a "Wow" factor when I was watching them. Mena Suvari, the main character I guess is the only one who actually seemed to want to act in this film. However that Nick Cannon character after observing him in The Killing Room-- I would've expected him to do something better than act like a gun-ho serious sam type of character. The zombies themselves also present to me another negative feeling about them. In this movie the director gives this new ability of them having one previous ability or thought they had as a human and be transferred into a zombie. This means that the army-zombie characters were shooting a Military Grade Assault Rifle, Pistols, doing Parkour/Spider-Man mumbo jumbo, and even protecting another human from another damn zombie. The idea itself of having one previous ability destroys the idea of a zombie, because a zombie is just a dead human reanimated due to some virus and only has the idea to eat human flesh. They aren't going to go pick up Grandma's AR-15 and shoot a couple of rounds into the scary fox around the corner. To finish this all up, I disliked this movie greatly and this is my rating of the movie Characters: 3; Mena Suvari was the only person that I actually liked.Plot: 1; It seemed so dull and boring that I honestly could've wrote a "zombie" survival movie like this in probably 1 hour.Special Effects: 4; It had cheesy special effects, but it's still pretty good for a low-budget film Scare Factor: 1; I was laughing at the idiots throughout the movie Political Correctness: 10; I loved the fact that they didn't do one of those stupid Andromeda Strain films with one homosexual, latino, Asian, female, and middle eastern. Thumbs up! Score: 3.8 but I'll round to a 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't shoot vegetarian zombies in the head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why directly associate this flick with the Romero original? I guess it ensures a bit more money in the long run. Coming into this film as a remake is only going to make it suffer in comparison.Funny thing is; Day of the Dead 2008 isn't all that bad for undemanding horror fans. It's chock full of decent grue, is very fast paced and violent as hell. The negatives, however, outweigh the positives. Mena Suvari is terribly unconvincing as a military officer and Nick Cannon is utterly intolerable, spewing some wince inducing lines that he must have come up with on the spot. The zombies are strange, to say the least, moving at ultra fast speed and even climbing walls. The editing is also quite annoying and the orange filter look is somewhat distracting.But...as brainless entertainment on a slow night the film is OK. There is plenty of nitpicking if you want to go there; the Bub character from Romero's original seems to be present here in the form of Bud; a character who doesn't want to eat humans once he's zombiefied because in life he was a vegetarian (stupid!!!); the zip-zap change from human to ultra violent zombie in the space of a mere second; the supernatural abilities the zombies possess (huge jumps, ultra fast, wall climbing); the fact that once exposed to fire the zombies suddenly disintegrate...and how on earth do these characters realize from the get-go that shooting them in the head does the trick? And what crack shooters they are! Bammm, and they all hit the head, no matter the weapon! Actually, that's more negatives than I thought. But anyway; I may have been in an unusually forgiving frame of mind when watching it. As a time filler for horror lovers Day of the Dead 2008 is OK. Nothing more</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's your typical, "zombie-apocalypse-Army-commandos-who-don't-follow-orders-" type of movie, with Mena Suvari at the helm of a cast that includes Nick Cannon and Ving Rhames. You could do worse with a movie like this, but, you know. Meh.Suvari is a tough Army chick who tries to contain her town, which is having an epidemic of zombies. There's the typical rundown of the characters, the sickly mother (guess what happens to her?), the tough Army leader (Ving Rhames, who has about fifteen minutes in the movie) and the comic relief (Nick Cannon), all for an action-packed ending.If you never see it you won't miss a thing, but "Day of the Dead" isn't all that bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny this is called "Day of the Dead" when nearly all the zombie action occurs at night.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, as a zombie movie it is not all that bad. However, I can not score this movie any higher as it makes itself out to be a remake of the Romero film of the same name. If this movie had simply been titled something else the one character of Bub and a few other scenes would have been considered tributes, instead they also steal the title and make for what is the most part a completely different movie. As if simply borrowing the title of one of Romero's classics would make people flock to see it. Then they throw in Ving Rhames to try and connect this film to the superior "Dawn of the Dead" remake. Here the story has a town full of people suffering from flu like symptoms. Cue the sinister music as you know what these symptoms will lead to for the most part. Though the end result was surprising to me at times as I have never known a zombie to do some of the things these did. Example, I have never seen a zombie shoot up to the ceiling and crawl on it for a time before, what exactly caused this outbreak one might ask, perhaps a radioactive spider was the source? We have our survivors as a boy and his gal, along with his sister and some other military dudes survive for a bit here. The gore is good and bad in this one as once the chomping starts it is fast and relentless, but sometimes it is computer generated which I absolutely loath. As I say in my summary nearly the entire film happens at night. They would have been better off calling this night of the dead or something. Zombie attack would have been alright as well, but they should have never tried to pass this one off as a remake. It does a good job at zombies being everywhere causing chaos, but nothing matches the scene in the beginning of the original day at the beginning of the film in the town where the guy uses a megaphone to try and call for survivors, but only finds a lot of zombies walking the streets. If it were called something else I would have perhaps given this movie a five or six, but thanks to the title I am giving it a four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difference Between this and Other "Dead" Remakes is Night and Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was only inevitable. Someday, somebody somewhere would remake the third film in the legendary zombie saga helmed by George A. Romero. First, there was Tom Savini's directorial debut with a remake of "Night of the Living Dead," which was a load of nostalgic fun for genre fans. Then, Zack Snyder spun the genre on its head with his "Dawn of the Dead" remake that helped usher in a new generation of zombie flicks (as well as a long-awaited return to the genre from Romero himself in "Land of the Dead") and now here we are, for better or for worse, with an update of "Day of the Dead".Unfortunately, it's for the worse. Director Steve Miner, who himself has a respectable track record with films like "Halloween H20" and "House," seemed like an okay choice for the job, yet the end result is a film that is sloppy and unprofessional on nearly each and every front. In this version of the film, the military -- which includes Mena Suvari in a career-killing role sporting unflattering fatigues -- is brought in to quarantine a small town after an outbreak spread by a common cold is turning its citizens into the living dead. Along for the ride are Ving Rhames -- not reprising his role from the "Dawn of the Dead" -- and Nick Cannon, as a wise-cracking, albeit, irritating force to be reckoned with.The film was originally intended for theatrical release but was shelved for a few years before seeing the light of day, and it's easy to see why after witnessing the mess that it truly is. The CGI is downright awful, and is rivaled only by the pathetic excuse for acting from Cannon and some of the lesser known actors who portray the teenagers. There are some twists on the original that, while hardly effective, are at least admirable. Bub, the lovable zombie from Romero's original, is transformed into Bud, a love-struck vegetarian zombie. Unfortunately, this whole bit is so silly you can almost hear the sound of palms hitting faces behind the scenes. To his credit, Miner puts on a fast-paced show that keeps the pain to a minimum. At the very least, zombie fans will find some cheap thrills in this "Day of the Dead" redux, but serious horror fans and George A. Romero enthusiasts need not apply.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fleet On Their Feet Zombies Electrify "Day of the Dead" Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only have "Friday the 13th 2" director Steve Miner and scenarist Jeffrey Reddick reimagined the classic 1985 George A. Romero zombie epic "Day of the Dead," but they have also expanded the scope of the action so a lot more activity occurs outside the bunker. The ending is really cool and you'd never know that this chiller was filmed in Bulgaria from the terrain. Clocking in at 85 trim minutes, this hair-raising zombie movie boasts some of the fastest turning times for infected folks to mutate into undead flesh-feasters. Furthermore, when these zombies put it on the hoof, they can haul carcass. Indeed, some can even defy gravity and scuttle across the ceiling! The action transpires in a small Colorado town after a flu-like epidemic happens and the National Guard is summoned to set-up roadblocks and keeps citizens from leaving the area. Aside from Ving Rhames, Mena Suvari and Nick Cannon head a cast not known for their horror chops. You get to see actor Michael Welch here before he made the "Twilight" movies and played Mike. Zombie fanatics should have a feast with this high-octane, skillfully-made saga that never bogs down. Of course, despite being a rehash of a drop-dead gorgeous original, "Day of the Dead: The Need to Feed" is worth a look. This horror movie lives up its R-rating with several gruesome scenes, especially one where a zombie twists off another zombie's head off and the head-twisted zombie pukes bright red blood! The story starts in Leadville, Colorado, in an abandoned house where Trevor Cross (Michael Welch of "Twilight") and Nina (AnnaLynne McCord of "Fired Up!) are making out with another couple. The other guy, Kyle (Hugh Skinner) grosses his girl out when he starts bleeding from the nose. Director Steve Miner shifts briefly from this scene to a roadblock with vehicles lined up for about half a mile as the military, principally the National Guard, inform motorists that they have been ordered to keep the town sealed off for twenty-four hours. One of the Guardsman, Corporal Sarah Cross (Mena Suvari of "American Pie"), convinces an irate motorist to take his young son to the hospital in town rather than drive to Boulder. You can see the weird look in the child's eye and it doesn't take much to figure out that he is heading toward a major life change. Captain Rhodes (Ving Rhames of "Pulp Fiction") is in charge the quarantine. Miner shifts back to Trevor and company. Kyle's girl refuses to have anything more to do with him and Trevor and Nina are heading back to town to neck. Kyle catches a ride with them and the girl walks off in the wood. You guessed it, she never makes it out of the woods. Moments later, back at the roadblock another Guard vehicle wheels up with Salazar (Nick Cannon of "Underclassman") and Bud Crain (Stark Sands of "Flags of Our Fathers") and Sarah takes Bud with her. They drive to her house. Ironically, Bud says that he was hoping for something exciting, and Sarah warns him that nothing exciting happens in Leadville. Sarah surprises Trevor and Nina making out on the couch in her house. Sarah has come home to check up on her ailing mom, Francine (Linda Marlowe of "Becket"), and she takes her to the hospital.About twenty minutes into the plot, things really start to pop. At the Pine Valley Medical Center, Nina's ill father falls victim to the flu and attacks his wife. Miner uses some really cool looking, animated special effects shots of the virus plunging through his system moments before the father mutates into a zombie. He goes berserk and mauls his wife, while Trevor and Nina scramble out of the room. Electrical power technicians turn into zombies and destroy the city's electricity. Sarah and Bud manage to escape from the hospital. Outside mass hysteria afflicts Leadville while everybody seems to turn into a maniac. Sarah is describing two dead people to a scientist when things turn ugly at the hospital. Moments afterward, Captain Rhodes dies as zombies assail him. Sarah realizes that they need the keys to a Humvee and she crawls into the ventilator shaft to reach Rhodes' dead body to retrieve the keys. Guess Reddick forgot that military vehicles don't require keys. Anything when she finds Rhodes in a room, she runs into Salazar. He explains that he hid in a closet. They get the keys and clamber back into the ventilator shaft. Sarah is the last one up. At mid-point in the action, "Day of the Dead" really generates suspense as Rhodes awakens and scrambles after our heroine. Rhodes seizes Sarah by the boot and follows her into the shaft. There are moments when it doesn't look like Sarah is going to make it. Instead, Rhodes bites Bud and he begins his rather slow conversion but Sarah refuses to let Salazar kill him. Eventually, Bud will turn into a zombie, but Sarah never loses hope for him.People usually cough and/or bleed from the nose before they transform into zombies. Miner and Reddick pull out all stops. These ravenous zombies are fleet on their feet. They make the conversion from human to undead so fast that it catches their victims off guard. "Girlfight" cinematographer Patrick Cady and Miner monkey with shutter speed to accelerate the action and Miner slices out frames to accentuate the celerity with which these zombies pounce on their prey. The filmmakers had many errors with regard to the military uniforms, but this doesn't get in the way of the rapidly paced action scenes. Mind you, none of this is remotely believable, but Miner and company maintain the momentum as our little group eludes the zombies. No, "Day of the Dead" doesn't qualify as the best zombie movie, but it is certainly action-paced and exciting nonsense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are you rushing? You're not going anywhere interesting or new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To get the obvious out of the way... no, this is not "really" a remake of Day of the Dead, if that is what settles whether or not you give this a try. It might have been smarter to title this something else(particularly in light of the fact that the parts where they sort of go for redoing details of the Romero classic are almost invariably the worst of this... the Bud thing increases in ridiculousness the further you watch of this), but hey, the entire thing shouldn't suffer on account of that one batch of lousy decisions. No, really, hear me out here; it's got plenty of flaws on its own, and it's so much fun to dig in, and poke at all of them. I'd like to point out, for example, that this flick is *extraordinarily* insecure. I'm not kidding, it starts out being excessive in trying to scare the audience, and it then proceeds to attempt to outdo itself, on a continuous, nay, *constant* basis. People's exhibit A: the Ecstasy-driven zombies(who, I might add, on occasion run in such a manner that there is reason to investigate the theory that death and resurrection can have the side-effect of spastic arm movements) go from unseen(in the way of Halloween and other excellent pieces where the fear of the unknown is used like that), to being hideously overexposed in about 77 minutes. Yep, that's how long(read: short) this is, before the credits roll. And it's fast-paced, too. If you can get excited about this, a lot does happen. Heck, there's even one or two scenes that have potential, like the "who had the nosebleed" bit. I suppose what prevents it from being, well, good, is the acting. In some cases, I will grant that there are long-time masters of the craft who could not make the lines these poor people are given to work with work on the best day of their career, however, the material is not the sole reason for the success rate of that aspect. Suvari can actually muster up a decent hard-ass type when she needs to, if she doesn't physically look like she could take on a wingless house-fly that was getting on in years. And Welch... uh... he did nice on Joan of Arcadia, don't know what happened here. Rhames is cool, though I wouldn't rent this just for him. Cannon looks and acts like a lost Wayans brother, and those of us who have since cursed the decision to give Love Don't Cost a Thing a chance remember him from that crap. He is not quite as painful a presence here, then again, it's nearly impossible to reach those levels of suckitude. Most of the humor is not funny, and a lot of it is cringe-inducing. You may also sort of recognize the name Steve Miner. Allow me to refresh your memory, and you will soon remember why you knew you had to blot that part out, be it with liquor or bashing your head against solid surfaces, full well knowing that the potential loss of other brain-cells would be worth it for the blessing of forgetting him and what he's made prior to this. After Friday the 13th Part 2 and 3, neither of which I've caught and that I understand are fine, he made House, Warlock, Forever Young, My Father the Hero, Big Bully, H20 and Lake Placid. The mere realization that not only has his head not been thrust upon a spike to warn others to not release pure crud, no, he is still directing ought to be enough to question the legal system. In spite of that, honestly, he does show a hint of promise here and there. The stylization doesn't detract from the horror(and does genuinely add a little), and there are a couple of sequences that manage to creep us out and/or spook us(with that said, a several of those parts, that seem like they were meant to be serious, get unintentional laughs, and the whole simply is not that impressive). This will strain your ability to suspend disbelief, unless your skill in that area is akin to that of a trained professional. There is a little sexuality, no nudity, mild to moderate amounts of gore, violence, disturbing content and language in this, and all of is it gratuitous. I recommend this only to the biggest fans of movies surrounding the subject. It is simply not The Dead's day. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big horror film buff so unlike some people who comment I can't really compare it to the 'classics'. That is probably a good thing since it meant that my enjoyment of the film wasn't hampered by seeing how well it measured up to standards set years ago. I watched it for what I think it was trying to be - a film that makes you jump in some scenes and make your adrenalin pump in others between the odd gross out. For me it did that. My only real criticism is that the ending seemed rather abrupt and anti climactic. While I won't spoil the ending it just didn't seem a satisfying conclusion to such a fast paced movie. I was waiting for the twist of the 'it's not really over' moment which was only really done in a token way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Literally seconds into the film, it's fairly obvious that this story will bear absolutely NO resemblance to the original "Day of the Dead". So why call it a remake? Well, my friends, that's why the world keeps shunning this film as an excuse to make money rather than a legitimate work of art.Cons: --The fact that Nick Cannon is alive and steps in front of cameras? At least they cut that horrible "It's a bad day to be a zombie." line that nauseated us all in the trailers. (I think it was cut anyway? I don't remember hearing it?) --Some weak writing and performances. --Some pretty crappy effects here and there. --Some absolutely RIDICULOUS missteps in logic. I'm not the kinda guy who looks for things like that just so I can complain, but God damn. Zombies breaking right through windows, then seconds later, being stopped dead in their tracks by another window; zombies jumping at great distances &amp; crawling on the walls and ceilings, but then not being able to reach a few characters peeking through an air duct; zombies' heads exploding because their bodies have caught fire, (funny, but WTF???) --Some absolutely HORRIBLE sound-editing. --The cliché "No. Don't shoot him. He's my friend." "BUT HE'S A ZOMBIE NOW!" "I don't care. I'll take care of him if I have to, but nobody else is allowed that privilege." Not only is this cliché present, but it's taken a little bit too far? --One of the zombies didn't eat people? He was a good guy? He retains most of his humanity too. Why? Because he was a vegetarian in life. ...No. Just no. --A happy ending... Are you kidding me?Pros: --Decapitations. A lot of them. Headshots and car impacts make for some fun as well. --Mena Suvari is cute. --Some effects were okay. --Directing wasn't too bad. --I actually really liked the cinematography. --The zombie make-up was decent. I appreciate it because it's elaborate and in such great numbers. --As with all of the screw-up spin-offs of Romero's "Dead" films, (this means all but Savini's "Night" and Snider's "Dawn"), they tried to explain the outbreak. Their explanation here was actually decent, in my opinion. However, it shouldn't be there. That's not what George's movies were about. In his films, we didn't need to know how the outbreak started, it was all about how the survivors reacted to it. So I didn't know if I should put this point in the Pros or Cons list? If this wasn't a remake of "Day of the Dead", then it would be a purely good thing. --But this film's most important Pro: Laughing at every single one of the Cons I've listed.This would be a mildly decent zombie flick if it weren't for the ending and the "Day of the Dead" name. Watch it for mindless fun.6/10 on it's own. 1/10 as a remake. I'll give it a 4.5/10 overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very different from the original, so try to be open-minded about it. It's good that they use some of the original names like Sarah, Capt. Rhodes, Salazar, Dr. Logan, and Bub. (Who is renamed to Bud in this one.) Some parts remind me of 'Planet Terror' Also in this one, Capt. Rhodes didn't have too big a part and wasn't corrupt like in the original. Dr. Logan is a lot younger but very selfish, and Salazar is black and has those funny one-liners. The zombies are pretty cool. There are a lot of new characters, and some characters from the original have been taken away. Most of the movie takes place at night and they don't get to the underground missile silo until the end of the movie. This one has a lot more action than the original, but I still like the original better because of the gore effects! In the small town of Colorado, a virus has been spread. The military has been called in to help with the quarantine, and help people throughout the town. Later, the virus spreads even more, and some people take refuge in the hospital, and the radio station. If you love zombie flicks, I highly recommend DAY OF THE DEAD!!!</fullReview>

It really has nothing to do with Romero's movies although it shares the title of one. A flu like virus sweeps thru a small Colorado town and the military seals the town off while they try to "control" it. The infected eventually turn into our beloved flesh eating zombies, which can only be killed with a headshot. The makeup is good, some cool kills and there is plenty of gore. The zombies are the fast moving "maniacal" kind like in 28 days, or the Dawn remake. As far as the acting goes, it is fine for this kind of movie, I've seen a helluva lot worse zombie flicks. And to the people who are complaining about "no plot"....are you kidding me? what kind of plot do you need other than the viral outbreak, and trying to survive the zombie onslaught?

This version of Day of the Dead is incompetent and looks like it killed his big screen directing career. The $18 million budget must have gone to someone's pocket, because not a penny of it is on screen. Calling this straight to video quality would be wrong, it's syfy channel TV movie quality. Was funding pulled during production? Was Miner fired? There has to be some explanation for the shoddy work on display. The acting is almost entirely terrible. Mena Suvari does her best to maintain her dignity and AnnaLynne McCord proves to have none. Besides McCord's rear, there's nothing of value in this stinker. Avoid.</fullReview>

But you never know, could be interesting, right? Like the Dawn of the Dead remake? Wrong.This is honestly the most boringly awful "zombie" "film" (I used these two terms VERY loosely here) I have ever seen, and I watch all I can find.Even if you try to pretend this movie has nothing in common with the original, it's still beyond atrocious. Not even remotely half-way through this movie I was craving for it to be over.The actors who portray characters-in-name-only of the ones from the original film, are pretty mediocre. Ving Rhames' presence could have been good considering how great he was in the Dawn of the Dead remake, but even he couldn't save this mess.The movie seemed very anti-climactic throughout with a very boring and forgettable score. Terrible CGI, terrible gore, etc.This "movie" isn't even worth an in-depth review, because it seems they didn't even put in a decent amount of effort.Avoid this movie like a horde of zombies. Watch the original Day of the Dead (1985) instead, as well as Night of the Living Dead (1968) and Dawn of the Dead (1978).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a bit hesitant to watch this but I liked the modern remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' so thought I'd give it a go as I was interested to see a modern take on the original's plot.Despite the name, this film has nothing to do with the original.Instead you have the standard 'army sealing off a small town' plot, but despite a miscast Mena Suvari as a army general(!) and annoying stereotypical black guy it still looked like it had potential. This all disappeared as soon as the zombies turned up. There seemed to be no internal logic; is it airborne or passed on by bites?, why does everyone change at the same time?, why do people go from normal to covered in open sores in a split second?, why are zombies not only running but jumping about like the modern version of vampires? By the end it was like watching a film based on a video game, and a bad one at that. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was complete disappointment. Meena Suvari does not suit the role.She rather looks like a porn star(schoolgirl version). The movie hardly takes grip and drags through out. I just waited for it to finish.It looks like a cheap C grade horror flick and lacked any originality. The the movie starts well and seems to build suspense. There are few thrilling scenes in the beginning. AS the movie progresses it goes downhill. The movie is completely predictable. In end they kill all the zombies, assuming that all of them are summoned at that place, without bothering about the ones which might be elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably a lot of horror fans view of remaking anything of Romero would be to consider it blasphemy. On the other hand, the remake of "Dawn Of The Dead" was pretty decent, so I was willing to give this remake a chance, especially considering (1) I didn't think too much of the original in the first place, and (2) I heard this so-called "remake" only took a few minor details from the original, opting to mostly do its own thing instead.How is it? Well, the production values are mostly decent, not surprising since the production company (Millenium Films) has made a reputation for making straight-to-video movies with above average production values. One quibble I did have with this movie was that a fair amount of the movie is lit in an ugly urine-colored light, and that some night scenes are TOO dark. Maybe the darkness was to tone down the gore so that they could get an "R" rating. In fact, there are a few moments when violence happens offscreen, perhaps for the same reason. But there is still plenty of gore to be observed throughout. The movie is also fairly fast-paced and is never boring. Maybe I wouldn't recommend the movie if it was playing in a theater... but as a low-cost rental or a cable selection, it will do the job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be judged in context: a decent zombie flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie seems to be getting an unfairly bad rep. Sure, this isn't going to win an Oscar anytime soon (Golden Globe maybe), but that doesn't make it such an unpleasant experience. I have watched every Romero-based zombie movie, and this isn't nearly as bad as Land of the Dead but falls somewhere short of The Dawn of the Dead re-make.The action is well-paced, and the dialogue isn't as bad as most cheap horror flicks. I like seeing "fast zombies" as opposed to the lumbering ones in the 70s and 80s flicks. None of the effects in the movie stood out as being cheesy or stupid, and the gore was on par with Tom Savini's style.If you a want a decent no-thought-required zombie flick, then check this one out. For other commentators/raters, don't judge too harsh.Spoiler!! Ving Rhames dies quicker than, well, a black guy in a movie :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A seriously flawed, but very entertaining remake of the zombie classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well here we have it, another remake to throw on the pile. By this point, so many great horror films have been given the redux treatment and they've varied in quality. Some like the remakes of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'Halloween' have turned out surprisingly good, while others like 'The Fog' have been disappointments. Both the first and second films in George Romero's 'Dead' series had already been remade and both are examples of good ones, but what of this remake of the 1985 sequel? A film that I love very much. Honestly, it's not too bad when all things are considered.Pros: Decent performances from the cast. Lots of beautiful Colorado mountain and forest scenery. Stylish direction by Steve Miner, which is better than this film deserves. Some really good monster make-up and gore effects. A good score by Tyler Bates, who also happened to do the music for the 'Dawn of the Dead' remake. It's nice that the makers of the film didn't just make a xerox copy of the original and actually tried to make this stand on it's own. Fast pacing. Some cool ways of dispatching the zombies.Cons: Doesn't bring anything new to the zombie genre. The shaky camera thing gets really old. A few really bad lines, which make some of the actors look bad. Too many characters, and too short a running time, for us to get to know enough to care for. Ving Rhames is wasted in a thankless role. Not much plot. Unnecessary set-up for a sequel.Final thoughts: Going into this I didn't have very high expectations. Nearly everything I'd read about it was negative, but after finally seeing it for myself it's really not so bad. It's not something you'll want to see again and again, but if you're in the mood for a mindless zombie movie, then this is an entertaining example of one.My rating: 3/5</fullReview>

The actor and his character are annoying and unlikable..I wonder if in the script he was referred to as "token black guy who spouts stereotypical one-liners" instead of the characters name. Im sure most people would yell "Dat was gangsta!" after killing a zombie. Just awful.A decent rental, but Romero's shoes are in no danger of being filled...or even shined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a time when it seemed that Miner would develop into a director of note. His half-baked "remake" of DAY OF THE DEAD lays to rest, once and for all, any such notion. Dumb is dumb, and bad film-making speaks most eloquently for itself. It boggles the mind to think that someone given all the tools (not to mention a proved blueprint and a competent behind-the-scenes crew) could screw up so badly. The "talent" (the on-screen players) are a big part of the problem: whatever their respective talents, acting ain't one of 'em. To a man. I've seen Public Access shows better than this. (In fact, I've written and directed some of them, myself.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This in-name-only remake of 1985 Romero classic works more like a sequel(or prequel don't know) of Day of the dead 2: Contagium that from an actual remake. Good news: this one is ten times better than DOD 2: Contagium. The bad news is that being ten times better is not enough to be a good movie. This movie redefines the term "running zombies", this zombies are on fast forward all the time, the cgi-fx looks bad and its a complete non-sense (and not even funny) but its very action-packed and full of zombies every were. Looks like a Resident Evil rip-off some times. Mena Suvari is eye candy and Ving Rames have a very small role here. Its not a complete waste of time if you can watch it for free.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT a new ROMERO remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why this is listed on Romeros page. I guess because he is given some credit on the original script. Still,I was,as usual,very dismayed at the overall quality of this film. I guess once you are used to Romero..nothing else comes close. Zombies don't run,don't think and don't use weapons..LOL. Still,the movie was at least watchable but barely. If you are totally bored and are in the mood for a zombie film and cant find a Romero,Fulci or 70's Italian zombie flick,then this will do..LOL. In a pinch it is OK. I do not,however,plan to buy this to add to my collection. The acting is a bit overdone and the film just sort rumbles along without really giving you the apocalyptic feel that most good zombie flicks seem to do. This just seems to be mindless shooting,violence and gore..which will probably appeal to the younger generation as most seem to think that is what constitutes a good movie these days. Hint for new directors or wannabe directors: There is a part of the movie that is called character development that is what makes us really relate and care for the people in the film..this film has none. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not NEARLY as bad as you have heard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me state my position on zombie movies. I do NOT think that George Romero is a God. I think zombies that run are FAR scarier than the lumbering ones that you can easily escape from. I think the remake of Dawn Of The Dead is not only superior to the original, but the best zombie movie ever made. Finally I think that the remake of Day Of The Dead has been unfairly dumped on, but is so far superior to the boring-as-hell original (directed by Romero) that it's not even funny. Director Steve Miner has crafted a fast moving, atmospheric, gore filled zombie flick that has not gotten the support it deserves. Not a follow up to Zack Snyder's Dawn Of The Dead, it takes place in a tiny Colorado town where the Army is trying to quarantine the town's inhabitants. Mena Suvari is an army corporal, who just happens to have grown up in that very town. She's assigned a few new soldiers, including Nick Cannon, to secure help secure one of the towns checkpoints. There is a cold-like virus loose in the towns that, when it kicks in, rots human flesh, and turns the people infected into zombies. Zombies that, like in the Dawn remake, run like track athletes. The movie starts quickly and never slows down. There's no shortage of zombies, so trying to escape from the town proves to be every bit as difficult as you'd expect. The zombies are also different in the way that they retain some of the intelligence and personality they had when they were alive. So we get scenes like a platoon of dead soldiers coming at survivors, wildly (perhaps uncontrollably) firing their weapons. It's also the first time we get a bit of zombie cannibalism, as they turn on one another. Mena Suvari gives a good performance in your typical tough chick role. Plus she looks really good in Army green. Ving Rhames turns in a cameo as her superior, not a reprise of his Dawn Character. The biggest negative about the movie is Nick Cannon. Although I don't think it's necessarily his fault. The character is so stereotypical, it's borderline insulting. He plays the put upon black man that rants about all the things white people do, and has no shortage of attitude and street slang. Why does the black man's character have to be so degrading to the black man? We even get typical mispronunciation of words that must sound "street", even a few "aights" thrown in there. He almost singlehandedly brings the movie down. Fortunately there's a lot more going on. Like I said, the movie never stops moving. The survivors never get a chance to take a breath, as every place they think is safe, is quickly overrun. There are some great visuals here, topped off by several zombies leaping from the upper windows of a nearby building in an attempt to feed on our heroes. Director Steve (Halloween H20, Lake Placid, Friday the 13th 2 and 3) is horror veteran and knows how to keep things rolling. Lots of action, lots of gore, and good scares. I don't know what the problems were with this movie that kept the studio from releasing it theatrically, but it's a shame they didn't support it. Go ahead and rent it, you will be pleasantly surprised. I was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Zombie Film Destined to become a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its been said in here that this remake of George Romero's "Day of the Dead" is a remake in name only. Thats almost true. There is one other tiny similarity. They are at one point in an underground compound that is adjacent to missile silos. But other than that I was hard pressed to find one similarity to the original Romero classic, "Day of the Dead". Both movies are fun but this one will keep you on the edge of your seat, or under it.The story follows a brother and sister as they attempt to survive the spread of an infection that is turning people into flesh eating zombies as they try to make their way to safety from two separate locations. Unlike the zombies of the original George Romero movies these Zombies resemble more closely the "infected" as they were portrayed in "28 Days Later" and "28 Weeks Later", being fast, somewhat powerful and agile which does increase the tension factor when confronting the zombies. The zombies are scary and the acting is superior for this type of fare, not what you'd expect in a zombie movie. Particularly the star character, Sarah Bowman.Bowman is played by a really impressive actress named Mina Suvari. I remember Mina from her role as the french girl in "The Muskateer" and was impressed with her command of this performance as the tough, stubborn and good hearted soldier and survivor. Ving Rhames is good but his role too small, but Mina carries the movie by being a believable young female non-com trying to manage a crisis in a male dominated military and in a crisis on domestic soil. She is believable, likable and makes you identify with her character from the moment she appears on the screen. You're rooting for her the entire movie. Her brother not so much. Her brother is played by Michael Welch and is a generally annoying and unsympathetic character throughout the movie and its hard to during the action scenes at times to not root for the zombies where he and his girlfriend (AnnaLynne McCord) are involved.In a nutshell, if you like Zombie movies or movies about doomsday type survival situations then you're going to love this one. The acting is overall above average, with an out of the ballpark performance by Mina Suvari as the tough yet always aware of her own limitations young corporal who keeps the balance when all hells breaking loose.This ones going right up there with 28 Weeks later, and the original Romero Trio. This ones a keeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie didn't do much with my emotions, I didn't care about what happened to any of the characters. I didn't find it scary or exciting, but I wasn't bored either. This is not a movie about the undead. There aren't people coming back to life, people turn into these things because of a flu that turns them into flesh craving super strength creatures. The cast did well and the story was interesting enough to keep my attention. I'm assuming that the Army and the one zombie that doesn't crave human flesh are the reasons this movie is called "Day of the Dead" because that's the only thing I can relate between the two. Not bad for a movie that hasn't been in theaters, most movies that go straight to DVD are like this one. People who are into zombie or zombie-like movies might want to see it just for the hell of it, but don't expect something as amazing as 2004's "Dawn of the Dead".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you believed all the very negative reviews posted for this movie you would be forgiven for thinking that it's the worst horror movie ever made. (That's Alien v Predator 2 by the way!). It sets out to be a zombie movie with a difference. The difference being that the zombies don't shuffle slowly around with bemused looks on (what remains of) their faces. These zombies can really move!. It's true to say that this is not a remake of the Romero movie. It comes over more of a 're-imagining'. The gore effects are excellent. The movie is fast paced and though the plot is somewhat predictable and the cast overpopulated with irritating teenagers (does anyone make horror movies these days that don't have teenage casts?) it succeeds in holding your attention throughout with a few decent scares. To sum up - it's an entertaining, fast paced zombie movie with gore galore. What else do you want in this genre?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than 'Land of the Dead' and most other zombie flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I would ask you to not pay too much attention to all these other reviewers whining about this film. This is the biggest point I would like to make.Perhaps the reason for the moaning is that this film does not have the 'horrfic' factor that dawn of the dead had, and is inclined to lean toward the action gore flick side of a genre.I thought this was a very good movie. Admittedly, I am certainly not an amateur movie critic who believes my say so is gospel, which those who are reading this will identify with. But i would like to point out a few reasons why I thought this film was good : - 1) A good budget - which equates to having very good special effects, some very nasty ones too, which will make you smile.2) A speedy beginning yet it delivers the storyline adequately.3) Zombies return to Dawn of the Dead 'Vicious, fast and rip face to tatters' style, instead of the slow bumbling zombies which was seen in the last film.4) Whilst watching the film, I was thinking how this is how a Resident Evil game-to-film conversion should have pursued. Although they are entirely different story lines, my point being is that in this film you get to see basically everyone in town get ripped to pieces and in other zombie films, you may see about 10 deaths before the town/city appears deserted.On the negative side, I found myself quite annoyed with the stereotypical token black man portrayed by Nick Cannon. The constant one liners were cheesy and misplaced. The lack of thought regarding the character development was a metaphorical bullet to the storyline and did quite a nasty job at stripping the tone of the movie reminiscent to how Ryan Reynolds character did in Blade:Trinity.Even if you do not concur with the for and against points which I made you would certainly agree that once viewed this is NOT a film like Fido nor Flight of the Living Dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been "Day of the Deviant Dead"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this 2008 re-make, re-invention or homage, or whatever it is supposed to be, is entertaining enough for what it was, then it was a massive slap in the face to the legacy of Romero and the original "Day of the Dead" movie.Yes, I might be a Romero fanboy, but when you take an established movie such as "Day of the Dead" and decide to do this to it, what director Steve Miner apparently decided to do, you should be aware that you are Stepping on a lot of toes here.First of all, I must say that I saw very little resemblance to the original movie, aside from there being zombies, Bud was there, and soldiers were there. Aside from that, then this 2008 version was nothing more than a less than mediocre zombie movie slapped with an impressive movie title, cashing in on the success of the 1985 classic Romero movie.Secondly, then there were just so many bad things in the movie and so many things that make you go 'no, just no!'. For example, the zombies were fast, agile runners and impressive jumpers. That just never sits well with me in any type of zombie movies. And the sound that the zombies were making was just too much. It sounded like feline predators most of the time, and it was so bad that it was becoming a nuisance to the movie. And what was up with the zombies being able to climb upside down from the ceiling or scale a wall while moving on all four. No, it was just way too ridiculous.Thirdly, then while it was a good thing, I guess, that they had Bud in the movie. Then they had just taken that iconic zombie character and totally mauled it, turning it into something nowhere near as characteristic as what was seen in the 1985 movie.Alright, well don't get me all wrong here, because not everything in the movie was bad. The zombie make-up was, for the most part, actually quite good. And that is a MUST have in a zombie movie. The make-up, prosthetics and/or CGI must be realistic and believable. And the special effects and make-up teams were really pulling their weight in this 2008 version of "Day of the Dead".As for the acting in the movie, well, lets just call it as it was; adequate. Nothing outstanding to be witnessed here, perhaps given the fact that the cast list wasn't all that impressive. Personally I think it was kind of odd to see Ving Rhames in this movie, as he had also starred in the re-make of "Dawn of the Dead". Sure, it was two different characters, but still...It should be said that this movie is very fast paced, right from the very beginning. And that does count for something, because you will not be bored throughout the course of the movie.For a zombie aficionado there isn't much to come after here in the 2008 version of "Day of the Dead". And I bet that you are most likely to find the movie so deviant from the original "Day of the Dead", that you will, like me, be puzzled by why this movie carries the same title.However, all in all, then I am rating "Day of the Dead" a less than mediocre rating of four stars out of ten. It just wasn't an outstanding or memorable zombie movie. And the fact that it such a shameless slap in the face to the original movie, just stung me to the core.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor remake of an underrated masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small town in Colorado is placed under quarantine by the US military when it is hit by a mysterious flu-like virus. Corporal Sarah Cross, a former resident of the town, &amp; her family &amp; a couple of soldiers are the only survivors when the infected turn into fast-moving flesh-eating zombies. Barely escaping a bloodbath at the local hospital, they seek shelter in a nearby nuclear missile silo. But what they don't know is that the silo they're in is also a clandestine military research facility where the virus originated.George A. Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD was the third in his landmark zombie series &amp; his personal favourite, a film that was incredible in its depiction of a world gone mad as it fell into the hands of the zombie hordes as a group of increasingly unstable human survivors hiding out in a nuclear silo attempt to find a way to destroy the zombies, only to fall prey to their own destructive impulses. Since then, the film has become a cult classic due to its intelligent script &amp; awesomely gory visuals.Since the millennium, the zombie genre has received a boost thanks to the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD &amp; the British chiller 28 DAYS LATER. Zombies became popular again, since then spawning about a hundred such films over the past fourteen years. In 2007, Millennium Films, purveyor of heaps of cheap &amp; nasty Steven Seagal action flicks, decided to buy the rights to the remake of Day of the Dead &amp; make it their way. Getting on board is Steve Miner, director of films such as Friday THE 13TH PART 2, Friday THE 13TH PART 3 &amp; HALLOWEEN H20: 20 YEARS LATER. These films suggest that Miner's expertise lay in slasher films, but that won't stand in his way to make a zombie film.The original Day of the Dead was an underrated masterpiece, only recently getting more fans thanks to lovingly crafted DVDs &amp; the resurgence of the zombie boom. But this remake is the complete opposite ? a travesty that fails to reach the original's level &amp; a dead weight in the genre. For a zombie film, this remake neglects its potential fanbase &amp; was made in the same cheap way that the studio had did with its other films ? shooting the film in Romania &amp; hiring American youngsters who had a brief 15 minutes of fame in the film &amp; were seen no more after this.Steve Miner is a director whose specialty is in making slasher sequels (he did have a minor hit with the supernatural time travel flick Warlock but that was about it), not zombie films. It shows in this effort, Miner's lack of familiarity with the type of film he is making proving to be apparent here. The script has been haphazardly written, with only minor lip service paid to link it with the original ? the nuclear silo from the original was the main setting for the story ? here it is nothing more than the setting for the climax; the characters of Dr. Logan &amp; Captain Rhodes are here but changed drastically &amp; have negligible impact. And the zombies themselves? The zombies in this flick are nothing more than a cynical marketing ploy to draw in those who are na?ve in their expectations about watching horror remakes ? another corpse to add to the pile. Here the creatures have been designed to copy the success of the fast-moving zombies in Dawn of the Dead &amp; 28 Days Later with no limits to how they move ? they can even climb on ceilings! This really breaks with established zombie film rules ? there's even a stupidly-written scene where the survivors encounter a group of zombie soldiers charging forward whilst firing M16s in the air. This was the final straw for my expectations.Yet after all that, the film does have a couple of pluses in my book. The acting is reasonable &amp; the action scenes, even after you deduct points for lack of care put into it, work with a reasonable intensity that will entertain slightly. That keeps the film from sinking into the lowest score.George A. Romero would be insulted by this stupid flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mena Suvari is a sweet decent actress. she shone in several 90's movies, whether they were comedies, or erotic dramas, but here she tries her hand at a horror flick. Did she do well? I can say, that maybe she personally was not bad, but the movie itself is a mediocre attempt to make yet another zombie kill film. They are aplenty, they run, kill, eat, attacks, roar, yell and do frighten... There is nothing new, and all the clichés are here galore. That was not a really poor film, but so predictable, so obvious, that yawn appeared soon, and ReWind button became a Must. Sad but true, the movie drags along and never grabs our real attention. Can be viewed once and then very quickly forgotten</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only if you REALLY love bad zombie movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the worst films I have ever watched with an absurd plot full of holes. Just comparing this film with any George Romero film (even the weakest), Resident Evil, 28 Days after or any other good zombie film is offensive. This film has only one thing: The name, which is used to attract Romero fans to this very bad film. We can see zombies with very Cheap make up, I am pretty sure you can see better ones any Halloween. Action scenes are really awful and boring. The actors do not fit in their role. I like Mena Suvari in other films, but she does not fit in her role. You can enjoy some of the dumbest dialog lines of film history, and the story is full of inconsistencies in characters actions, again and again. I mean, it is not just that they are dumb, a lot of characters in horror films are dumb. It is that they are not consistent, they do one thing and the next minute they are doing the opposite for no reason. In addition, yes, they are really dumb. Trust me, there are hundreds of better ways of spending 85 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stay clear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies which will make you go "what the hell", "oh come on", "you didn't see that??", "he was right there!!".Poor story, poor acting, frustrating logics... This is just not how you make a good movie. Watching this movie will not make you happy. It's easy to compare it with Dawn of the Dead, of course. These two movies should have about the same budget, but you can easily see where the talent went. Makes you wonder sometimes, how these really poor stories even make it to a movie. You'd think there are some people around to put a foot down, but... Not in this case, apparently.This movie will make you more frustrated than satisfied. It will not stimulate your intellect in any way. Stay clear, even if you're a die-hard zombie fan. Dawn of the Dead is a really great alternative, and as is happens, one of the best zombie moves ever made, remake or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WAY better than Diary of the Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was anticipating George A. Romero's Diary of the Dead for so long. As a HUGE fan of Romero, after watching Diary, I was EXTREMELY disappointed to say the least. I'm not even going to get into it because that's not really the subject matter here.However, I was pleasantly surprised at how the Day of the Dead remake made me yell out, "awesome!!" quite a few times during the film. After seeing all the negative comments and the 4.4 stars on IMDb, I wasn't expecting much. But it had a lot more of what I wanted out of a zombie flick than even Mr. Romero put on my plate for Diary. Even though this had nothing to do with the original, except for the names of the characters, I still give it a 2 thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is NOT for everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may contain spoiler!. This is the remake of George A. Romero Day of the Dead which was the third movie in the dead series and this remake is not connected to Dawn of Dead Remake in 2004. I don't know why I am calling this a remake, when the plot and characters in this movie are totally different from the original.The movie opens where a Teenager Trevor and his girlfriends are at his house also with his best friend with his girlfriends while they are on the sofa, the best friend nose starts to bleed then they start arguing and are told to leave by Trevor. As the couple are still arguing and then she ends up walking home alone in the wood, then she sees Something in a long white coat then she starts to ruining and falls to the ground then get drags away screaming.The movie then goes to a number of people who are stuck in traffic as the military have closed the road, Trevor sister is one of the military crew, when she gets home, she sees her brother on the sofa with his girlfriends not looking after their sick mum, Their mum who also get a nose bleed so they take her to the hospital and when they reach the hospital they notice that all most everyone there has got a nose bleed.All of a sudden the ones that had a nose bleed freeze they don't move a single muscle and then you can see there eyes turn into ice or something.Then they all start to attack everyone in the hospital, some every good gory scene which also involves one zombie that can crawl on hospital roof fast, which made me laugh.Then the military leader is attacked by the zombies as the rest of team have got away from the zombies, meanwhile Trevor and his Girlfriend are on street of hell, and they get into the DJ Station just in time then they find one Married couple and The Owner of the house who let them in. Back to the hospital rest of military crew need to get out of the hospital and when they do, which has got to be the most action packed scene I have ever scene in any horror movie, Blood, body's and head flying all over the place, I loved that scene but some might find it cheesy.I don't what to ruin the movie for you, This movie is very entertaining, If you are huge fan of George A. Romero or if you like slow zombies I would say give this movie a miss As the Zombies are total different They are scary but nothing like you ever seen before as they Run, Jump like frogs, Crawl on roofs and are Smart too.The things I didn't like in this movie was that fact they had some silly dump scare scene that do not work and One or two actors can been annoying at times but rest of the cast can act. I enjoyed the movie. I give it 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psycho Crazy Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't know what other people were talking about, but it was really good. I absolutely love ZOMBIE movies, when I seen the trailer it was OK looking, but when I seen the movie it wasn't cheesy,it was actually scary, if it can make you jump then it does its job. Some things were unbelievable like a military quarantine but the military are not wearing mask to help prevent getting sick. In the remake of dawn of the dead the zombies ran, but these Zombies run super speedy gonzales fast, and do other unworldly things (but guess what Zombies are unworldly, and you can do anything in movies) So what I suggest is give the movie a chance, hell I like it, you might too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast Forward Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Leadville, Colorado, the army leaded by Captain Rhodes (Ving Rhames) seal off the town to contain an epidemics of a mysterious disease similar to influenza. The locals are not allowed to leave Leadville and the Pine Valley Medical Center is crowded of sick people. Corporal Sarah Bowman (Mena Suvari) was born and raised in Leadville and goes to her home with Private Bud Crain (Stark Sands) to visit her mother. Sarah finds that she is ill and takes her to the local hospital; however, the sick people suddenly transform in flesh eater zombies with fast movements, attacking the non-infected humans. Sarah, Bud and Private Salazar (Nick Cannon) get a jeep and head to the town exit to escape from the dead. But Sarah listens to the voice of her brother Trevor (Michael Welch) in the radio and she drives to the radio station where Trevor is hidden with his girlfriend Nina (AnnaLynne McCord). The group of survivors drives to the isolated Nike factory seeking shelter, where they disclose an underground facility of the army. Sooner they discover that the scientists were researching a biochemical agent that has mutated and initiated the fatal outbreak."Day of the Dead" is not a remake of George A. Romero classic; actually it is a flawed action movie developed in a fast pace and lots of gore. I did not like zombies moving fast, since the slow movements are creepy; but the intention of this movie is to have fun with black humor (the vegetarian zombie is hilarious), and not to frighten the viewer. The mignon Mena Suvari is very beautiful and has a good performance. Unfortunately the character Trevor is unpleasant and has weird and unusual attitudes. In the end, this movie entertains and is underrated in IMDb User rating. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Dia dos Mortos" ("Day of the Dead")Note: On 06 May 2016, I saw this film again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than some people are stating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched a screening of this and was surprised as i was expecting a low budget, bad makeup, bad acting attempt. But was pleasantly surprised (if you can call a blood and guts movie pleasant). The actors were good , the make up and effects of a reasonable standard , the storyline to be expected with all these type of movies, but the zombies themselves were a little different than usual to breath a little freshness into an overdone genre. I wouldn't rate as a classic zombie but compared to most is as good as you'll get in this genre. A few of the actors are well known which i wasn't expecting , so for all those that have given this bad review i cant see why as you can never expect a classic or fresh product on this genre. But i'd recommend a rental of this DVD when its out to all the living and the dead out there</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Zombie movie since Planet Terror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has gotten a lot of crap from Zombie movie fans.Did you guys actually see THIS one or did you accidentally see "Day of the Dead: Contagium", the crappy low budget "sequel" made in 2002??Steve Miner (Friday the 13th part 2+3) has made the most action-packed zombie movie I've ever seen. After the first 20 minutes the action never stops, with the most spectacular head shots and decapitations ever seen in a zombie flick.The zombies are also the wildest one's since the Italian classics "Nightmare City" and Fulcis "Zombie 3", as they almost ninja like jumps through windows, attacks cars and in some instances climbs on the walls ;) And like in John Woo's Hard Boiled the heroes never needs to reload their weapons even though they spend the entire movie gunning down an endless stream of zombies ;) The movie isn't to take very seriously, as you can tell it was made with the tongue slightly in cheek.No, it's not a new classic, but it's damn entertaining. Just turn of the brain for 90 minutes ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following from 300 director Zack Snyder's remake of Dawn of the Dead in 2004, it was obvious that the third of the classic George A. Romero trilogy would be rebooted too, from director Steve Miner (Friday the 13th Part III, Lake Placid, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later). Basically the town of Leadville, Colorado has been sealed off to contain the break out of a new influenza-type epidemic, with symptoms of cold and coughing. The Pine Valley Medical Center is crowded with people becoming sick, army Corporal Sarah Bowman (American Pie's Mena Suvari) was born in the town and goes with Private Bud Crain (Stark Sands) to visit her also sick mother. Taking her to hospital as well, soon enough the true signs that this virus infection is much more deadly occur when people start transforming into flesh-eating, fast moving zombies. While Captain Rhodes (Ving Rhames, he was also in Dawn, here he's a different character) and his troops try to stop the spread of zombies getting out, without success, Sarah, Bud and Private Salazar (Nick Cannon) try to get transport to head out of town to escape the living dead. The journey is halted though when Sarah overhears her brother Trevor (Michael Welch) speaking on the radio to get help, and they find the radio station studio run by DJ Paul (Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls' Ian McNeice), and Trevor's girlfriend Nina (AnnaLynne McCord) is hiding too. The remaining survivors head for the nearest place to hide, inside a Nike factory, where a military base is located underground, and the infected Bud is still alive, due to the fact that he is vegetarian. In the end, while all the others are killed off by the infection or the dead killing machines, they seem to all be burned alive in the compound, while Sarah, Trevor and Nina escape and overhear that apparently the situation has been contained, but one creature still lives. Also starring Michael Welch as Trevor Cross and Matt Rippy as Dr. Logan. The zombies being fast is I guess a good way to kill people faster, and there is just about enough blood and guts to watch, but it isn't as good as the predecessor, but not a terrible horror sequel. Okay!</fullReview>
