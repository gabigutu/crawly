		<shortDescription>A long-time sufferer of the "Alien 3 Syndrome"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Day of the Dead" is a film that is an unfortunate sufferer of the "Alien 3 Syndrome". And, no, I don't classify those that are affected by the syndrome to be disappointing final entries in a trilogy. To suffer from "Alien 3 Syndrome", you must follow two exceptional films, and the entry that has preceded you must be so exciting and action-packed that when you dare take a grimmer, more deliberately paced approach to your material, you will become universally reviled, with many people failing to notice that you have more than your fair share of merits on your own. In fact, "Day of the Dead" has a LOT of merits - even more than the film that its syndrome is based on. While it doesn't quite approach the greatness of "Dawn of the Dead", it is still an intelligent, first-rate horror effort and stands as one of the best genre films of the 80s.In this final entry of George Romero's "Living Dead" trilogy, the walking dead supposedly outnumber the humans by a ratio of 400,000 to 1. Twelve people who have devoted themselves to studying and wiping out the zombies hole up together in an underground missile silo, and for all we know, these could be the last twelve living humans on the face of the planet. Most of these people don't capture our sympathy like the foursome who holed up in the shopping mall in "Dawn". Half of them are gung-ho soldiers who seem to take great pleasure in threatening the scientific team, and Romero spends much of the first half focusing on the bickering and intense conflicts between these people. In fact, for over an hour, the hordes of living dead get very little screen time, as the story focuses on the tension between the characters, and the efforts of an off-the-wall scientist to train a captured zombie named Bub to act human. Compared to its predecessors, this long section of the film may seem slow and talky, but it is always interesting and, for the most part, effectively performed by its unknown cast. Besides, it all eventually leads up to a corker of finale when the zombies finally invade the compound, and most of the humans become showcases for the brilliance of Tom Savini, who outdoes even himself in the gore F/X department.While most of this material is very grim, "Day" ironically has the most hopeful, upbeat conclusion in the trilogy - which, alas, is its only major shortcoming. The quick transition to the final scene is so abrupt and unexpected that the audience feels cheated, leaving the impression that the production ran out of money before the whole climax could be filmed. Indeed, Romero has often expressed his unhappiness about being underfunded for this project, which prevented him from creating a truly definitive final chapter for the trilogy. But while "Day of the Dead" may not quite be the ultimate finish to one of the greatest trilogies of all time, it is still a very satisfying conclusion (at least until Romero gets funding for his long-rumoured "Twilight of the Dead"). It may not be popular among everyone, due to many unfair comparisons to its superior predecessors, but on its own, it is about as good as horror films get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another zombie classic from Romero. Highly recommended!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Day Of The Dead' is one of the greatest sleepers in the history of horror movies. A flop when originally released almost twenty years ago, its reputation has slowly increased over the years, and now is generally regarded as a classic. I certainly underestimated it for a long time. In my opinion Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' and 'Dawn Of The Dead' are two of the greatest horror movies ever made, but I always thought that 'Day...' was a bit of a let down. But after watching it again for the first time in several years (via the highly recommended double disc "special edition" DVD) I must humbly eat my words. This is a GREAT movie! Romero and special effects Tom Savini do wonders on a limited budget, and the movie is full of suspense, a claustrophobic atmosphere and plenty of gore. It probably flopped the first time around because it's so bleak, but now that's one of its strengths. Interestingly Romero features a strong female protagonist (Lori Cardille) and a strong black supporting character (Terry Alexander), something not all that common in horror movies. Both actors give good performances, the soldiers led by Rhodes (Joseph Pilato) are all suitably ultra macho and deranged, and it was cool to see John Amplas ('Martin') in a supporting role, but the two stand out performances are by Richard Liberty ('The Crazies') as Dr. Logan (who the soldiers refer to as "Frankenstein"), and Howard Sherman as Bub, the zombie he has tamed. The sequences between Logan and Bub are just terrific and add a whole new level of pathos to the movie. The only negative comment I can make about 'Day Of The Dead' is that it brings home the depressing fact that George Romero hasn't made a truly outstanding movie in close to twenty years. I really hope he makes his long threatened fourth Dead movie 'Dead Reckoning' and that it turns out to be his masterpiece. But whatever happens he has already carved his name out in horror history as the creator of three classic zombie movies that just get better and better as the years go by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third film in George A. Romero's immensely popular "Living Dead" trilogy is by far the bleakest and most complex film the director has ever worked on. "Day of the Dead" received a lot of negative press upon its release in 1985 - people picked apart unsavory characters, OVER-acting from a no-name cast, and outlandishly gory special effects that only Tom Savini himself could be proud of.But none of this makes it a bad experience really, does it? I don't think so. For the reason that I usually detest zombie flicks, I have worked up a fondness for the works of Romero and over the last two weeks have separately watched each film in his trilogy."Night of the Living Dead" (1968) virtually defined a new genre of horror movie-making and basically set the standards for the many zombie flicks that would follow in its footsteps. Next up to bat was the most praised film in the trilogy - "Dawn of the Dead" (1978) - which was more of an action film than a horror movie and was nothing short of epic. Then came "Day" in 1985, which got the tongue-lashing that I described earlier.However those that did like it, praised the Savini effects, its complex, plot-driven characters, and satire. While "Day" is certainly a step down from "Night" and "Dawn," "Day" is more of a claustrophobic horror movie and that allows it to stand on its own as a fitting end to Romero's trilogy. It's more in sync with the tension of "Night" than it is with the adrenalin-laced action, zombie-slaughterfest that was "Dawn."A team of civilian scientists and a loose army unit clash with each other's motives after they have taken shelter at an underground military base from the hordes of living dead that storm the surface above. The civilian scientists aren't seeking to eradicate the zombies like the soldiers are hell-bent on doing, but are instead trying to get to the bottom of what is causing them to be what they are.In doing so, they need live zombie specimens, which are held captive in a maze of dark underground tunnels where they're corralled like cattle. We later get what is one of the most profound and moving experiences in the entire trilogy with "Day," when we see one zombie, nicknamed "Bub" by one particularly eccentric scientist, who eventually learns what it means to be "alive," so to speak."Day of the Dead" obviously isn't a perfect movie, but is more or less a fitting conclusion to one of the most daring film trilogies in the horror genre. It may be best to not watch "Day" thinking it'll be anything like "Dawn" just because it has military men blasting away mercilessly at the living dead. Zombie slaughter is few and far between and much of the first hour of the film is clashing dialogue between the characters.The darkest day in the world - "Day of the Dead."9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very gruesome and claustrophobic zombie movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1985 this zombie movie virtually went by unnoticed except for many Romero fans. It was virtually dead a week or two after it hit the theaters. Many attribute its failings to the other many horror films released that year including "Re-Animator", "Fright Night", and "Return of the Living Dead". All these movies were R though and day was not. Romero stuck to his guns and made a very gory movie. Unfortunately, when dawn was released there were still many independent theaters, but by 1985 the chains had taken over and one thing chains do is not show movies like this. So it went by unnoticed and those that did notice it usually had nothing good to say about it other than the zombies looked really good. So suffice to say, I wasn't expecting much when I bought this movie except the zombies would look good. However, I am happy to report that I was very pleasantly surprised. The movie mainly takes place in an underground facility though there is the scene at the beginning in the town. I wish there were more scenes above ground as the one there is, is very well done. In the underground facility there is a lot of bickering between some scientists and some army guys who look and act nothing like army guys. Then again who knows how long they have been down there so people are bound to crack. There are also a couple of guys who may be army, but act like civilians and definitely have cooler heads than the rest of them. There is also a doctor who is trying to teach the zombies how to be more docile. All the wildness and arguing eventually leads to a major meltdown which leads to of course zombies penetrating the base and this leads to a very good gory finish. Not quite as good as Dawn, but not as far off as I was lead to believe this movie is very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest special effects ever, and that isn't even the best thing about this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero's zombie movies have always been standouts in the genre. Easily the best zombie movies ever, and contenders for the best horror movies ever. Night of the Living Dead (his first movie) set the ground work for every single zombie movie to come after it, and Dawn of the Dead, which came 10 years later in 1978 set the new standard for splatter and gore flicks. If you ask me, without George Romero's zombie trilogy, horror movies would have never been the same.Day of the Dead takes place after the entire Earth has become over-run with zombies. Every human must either hide, fight, or die. The movie follows two groups of people: doctors and army men. The army men pose as the bad guys in this movie (just as Mr. Cooper did in Night of the Living Dead) and the doctors pose as the good guys (as Ben did in Night). The groups of people are hiding out in a secluded underground base. The zombies await outside, while the humans try to come up with a plan to eliminate the zombie plague. Day of the Dead falls at the end of the trilogy. Being made in 1985, zombie movies were already high on the charts. Since the popularity of Dawn of the Dead, especially in Europe, a ton of independent film makers were pushing out these zero-budget zombie flicks faster than you could watch them. Finally, in 1985, George Romero and Tom Savini grouped back together to show the kids how it was done. Day of the Dead fixed all the mistakes that occurred in Dawn of the Dead, and turned out to be the perfect zombie movie. Day of the Dead IS the best zombie movie ever made.The main mistake that was fixed was the way the zombies looked. In 1978, Tom Savini (special makeup effects) was fairly new to the job, and couldn't take on the very large amount of zombies he had to apply make-up to. Therefore, he simply painted their faces blue. Here, Tom Savini had his own team of make up artist. The zombies in Day of the Dead look far more disgusting and gross. Facial decays and bite marks were abundant in this movie. Not only that, but every zombie looked different. No two zombies looked exactly the same, which added a small shock element every time a zombie appeared on screen. The gore in Day of the Dead was even more amped up than Dawn of the Dead. It looked more real, and came in much higher amounts. Day of the Dead ranks up with some of the goriest movies of all time; only Cannibal Ferox and Dead-Alive surpass Day of the Dead. For the way the gore looked, Day of the Dead holds the trophy for the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie - bar none.While the special effects have greatly improved, they aren't even the main reason I favor Day of the Dead over every other zombie movie. The reason Day of the Dead is, and always will be labeled as my favorite, is for the extremely serious tone of the movie. The characters in this movie (with the small exception of the doctor) are extremely serious and brutal in tone and pose an even bigger threat to the good guys than the zombies! It's Night of the Living Dead turned up to 11! The characters in this movie (especially Captain Rhodes) are very, very well written characters, although I wouldn't hold then as high as the characters in Dawn of the Dead. Day of the Dead is an extremely serious zombie flick with absolutely no humor whatsoever. It's serious, it's brutal, and has an extremely thick script with plenty to offer. Remember to bring a barf bag!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good tension and sick gore with only a few failings in the plot and the failure to paint a convincing Armageddon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Months after the first dead rose from their graves, the world has seemingly become overrun. Deep in a storage bunker in Florida, a group of soldiers and a group of scientists have formed an uneasy alliance in order to try and discover something that can help reverse their spread. However Dr Logan is not making the progress that the soldiers require and Captain Rhodes becomes increasingly impatient and erratic as a result. Things continue to worsen as the zombies gather above and Logan's work gets more worrying.Having seen and enjoyed (if that's the word) the remake of Dawn, I decided to re-watch the three originals on their own values. While I had seen the other two before, this was the first time I had seen Day and assumed that it would be bigger than Dawn was (in the same way as Dawn extended the ideas from Night). In that regard I was a little disappointed to find that the film stayed on a rather small scale and didn't manage to really convince me that the world was actually over on the surface of the earth. However this is not to say that it is not a good story in itself, because it is, albeit very different from both Night and Dawn. To me it lacked the social commentary that was to be found in Dawn but it is still tense, gory and gripping. The claustrophobic nature of the bunker and the battling characters means that tension is easily created even when the zombies are distant and seemingly pose less of a threat than the humans do to one another. The film is a little weak at points ? the medical experiments are given too much time and the character of Bub is not clear as to his reasons for being included as much as he was. I didn't like the idea of Bub, the film didn't seem to know what to do with him other than using him to fill out the story ? Logan's progress with him seemed such a waste of time that, even if that was the point, it didn't work.When the gore comes it is very hard to watch and a little sickening at times ? bodies are ripped into and ripped apart in full bloody colour ? as a horror it succeeds because I was looking a way quite a lot of times! Even though Shaun of the Dead has made fun of these slow zombies recently they still manage to be very effective here ? I personally find them scary as they are relentless and simply wish to kill. True, the fast ones are scarier but these ones are too. The cast are more than just victims and are reasonably well drawn and acted. They have to be engaging or else the tension between them wouldn't work and, while hardly totally real people they still are good enough for a horror movie and they are not just fodder to rip apart ? even if they are clearly penned as 'goodies' and 'baddies'.Overall this is not the best of the trilogy but it is still a good horror film. The tension between the characters creates as much of a threat as the zombies do ? even if some of the plot isn't that good. It all builds well to a gory finish that really only lacks teeth because both the film and the actual ending both fail to really show just how bad things are and never convinces that the world has come to an end in the way that the whole trilogy suggests it has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romero's finest film to date...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw DAY OF THE DEAD at a drive-in; the second half of the double bill was DAWN OF THE DEAD (which I'd seen a dozen times by then, most often at midnight showings). I was stunned. DAY OF THE DEAD was as tight and as dramatic and as frightening as anything I'd ever seen. Although I'd championed Romero's movies in the pages of magazines like Famous Monsters of Filmland, Fantastic Films and Fangoria for years, I was totally blown away by the savvy evinced in DAY OF THE DEAD. No more of the tell-tale amateurishness of a "regional filmmaker," no more overindulgence: this is Romero at his very best, and a great movie by any standards. For critics who espouse the virtues of DAWN OF THE DEAD over DAY OF THE DEAD, take this simple test: watch them back to back, as I did the night DAY OF THE DEAD opened. If you're still not convinced, you may be a zombie yourself...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The third film in the "dead" series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead (1985) was the third film in the "Dead" series. For awhile this was going to be the last chapter until recent events have changed the mind of the series creator George A. Romero. Whilst it was going to be a huge budgeted venture for Romero and Laurel Films, a small budget and a few extras limited the scope of the director's vision for this film. But like all good film makers he made do with what he had around him and made a dreary and depressing film.Society is dead. Zombies have overran the living and the survivors can only be found in very small numbers. One of these groups are bunkered inside an old underground bomb shelter. The survivors inside this subterranean military installation have been divided into three groups: the soldiers, scientists and civilian employees. Stress, sexual tension and a dire situation have split the group even further apart. The dead have been growing in numbers outside and dwindling supplies have made everyone desperate. But within the base their is some order. But what will happen with that collapses?The third film of the series is not as great as the second film but it's a good film. Performances from the actors may be uneasy and the tight budget restrains the director's vision but it still succeeds as a very frightening and depressing horror film. Savini and company have made the gore more realistic and nauseating. Gone is the cartoonish blood and cheesy gore effects. State-of-the-art splatter effects have been included adding a whole new element to this awesome trilogy. I have to strongly recommend this film. If you love the first two, you'll definitely enjoy this this installment of the one and only trilogy of cinema!Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Great American Horror Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cinema is wasted on cinema. Most cinema is bedtime stories for adults." ? Peter GreenawayConsensus seems to be that this is the worst film in George Romero's zombie trilogy. Personally I think it's Romero's best film, and one of the bleakest, if not best, horror movies ever made.Three points. Firstly, what people fail to realise is that the humans are actually the bad guys in Romero's zombie universe. They are adept at selling out their friends, stabbing their companions in the back, acting violent, brutal and flittering away their lives with mindless banalities. In contrast, the zombies are representative of a kind of primal humanity which, because it always remains at the core of mankind, can not be escaped. In this film, we have a group of people trapped in a military bunker whilst thousands of zombies wait outside. The humans are divided into three groups: the hastily militarist right wing, the scarily experimental left wing and the apathetic (and hedonistic) middle ground who just want to drink and live peacefully whilst the world goes to hell. Romero's point, though, is that despite their differing ideologies, everyone is selfishly looking out for their own interests, no matter how altruistic they may seem.Secondly, this film acts as a precursor to fare like "The Mist", in that it is about a small group of people who, when put under extreme pressure, begin to turn against one another, exposing their prejudices, insecurities, sexist feelings and petty jealousies. Romero's point: a small group of humans can be far more divided, vicious and bestial than any number of ravenous undead.Thirdly ? and this is what distinguishes the film from all other horror movies ? the film says that because most, if not all, actions are motivated by self interest, mankind is ultimately doomed. Forget all the ancillary themes often attached to this film ? Reganism, the threat of nuclear war, feminism, Aids etc ? while they're valid, this film takes a far grander, far more hopeless, view of things.The zombies and the humans are divided by what Freud called the pleasure principle and the reality principle. The zombies, as a kind of stripped down, primal version of humanity, simply eat, breathe and wander about looking for food. Satisfying their primitive instincts are their only purpose. As one scientist says, "they gain no nutrition from the flesh they consume." In other words, they eat solely to satisfy a desire to eat (much as wealthy nations no longer eat to survive, but to prolong pleasure). Humans, in contrast, are able to defer instant gratification, constructing a variety of long term plans.What the humans in this film realise, however, is that the rewards of the reality principle, of all their long term schemes, are no more advanced or noble than the drives of the zombies. The lead scientist in the film, for example, conducts experiments not because he wants to save humanity, but because he is thinking about future accolades and scientific prestige. These themes are summed up in one scientist's interactions with a domesticated zombie called Bub, who performs only when rewarded. "They can be tricked into being good little girls and boys," he says, "same way we were tricked into it on the promise of some larger reward."For the humans, however, any chance of a long term reward is slowly being eradicated. The last survivors on the planet and unable to fathom any future, the humans increasingly see no point in surviving. "It's the beginning of civilised behaviour," one scientist says, pointing out that the zombies operate on the same performance/reward level as humans, "civil behaviour is what distinguishes us from the lower forms. Civility must be rewarded, if it isn't, there's no use for it. There's just no use...for it at all."The notion that there is "no use" for any and all human actions is expanded when one character discusses the various immigration papers, tax returns and official documents that the American Government stored in the bunker. All this information stored, all these records kept...toward what end? What is the use of human history? To what goal does it climb?Ultimately, the world Romero creates here is one that is ruled by self interest. Goal oriented, man's actions are guided by pleasure, constantly striving to achieve his ambitions and protect his interests. The only easy way to get someone to not spend their lives as a Machiavellian power zealot would be to persuade them that they will enjoy an eternity in heaven. Heaven being pleasure incarnate.Man is merely a dopamine zombie, fingering his neuro-chemical G-spot in one form or the other, no distinction between low-order pleasure and high-order pleasure. By a similar argument, we'll never achieve true happiness through the pursuit of pleasure because we can never be truly comfortable while we are in a pleasurable state. If we're experiencing pleasure it's because we must need something. Take temperature. Only if we're too hot or cold will we be able to experience the pleasure of a cold drink or hot bath. Once our temperature has stabilised, we're indifferent to either experience. If we are in no danger or need of any kind, we're in a comfortable but indifferent state. Sensory pleasure is not happiness, it is joy. The state of indifference is true happiness.Now reconsider the final scene of the film, where the female character escapes and sits on a beach with the apathetic, hedonistic middle men who refused to fight throughout the film. They haven't escaped. They've become 21st century zombies. Get your mind around that, and this film will have you slitting your wrists.8.5/10 ? Ignore the one dimensional characters and the $500,000 budget. This film attains a depth of utter hopelessness that few films match.Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold, harsh sequel to DAWN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cold, harsh sequel to DAWN with superior special effects and a viciousness that froths at the mouth. Aside from the brilliant opening sequence where the dead are introduced, the film does lack contrast and has a monotony about it.There is evidence of the dead developing conscious rather than instinctive will in the character of "Bub". The film's central location, a large underground mine, is plenty claustrophobic and serves as another storyline decision that addresses both Romero's financial constraints and thematic concerns.A sequence where zombies are rounded up in a pen is very suspenseful, as is the climax where the living dead prisoners go on the rampage for a feed.NIGHT had a strong black character, DAWN had a strong black and a strong female character; this outing has a fiercely independent white woman who isn't obsessed with the plays for dominance the male characters engage in. It is their undoing, of course, and all character arcs follow their inevitable curves.Bleak and filled with despair, this is another courageous work from a director whose best years were twenty-five years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this might contain a spoiler for someI still think this movie is very underrated, even for it's release. if people watched this movie and thought it was bad probably missed the point. if you were expecting lots of blood and gore then you were out of luck i'll give you that. but what do all Romero movie's have in common? the element of a few people locked up in 1 place with friction, tension and hope running out.and not only that but in every movie (night,dawn and day of the dead) there's always one person that ruined it for the rest of the bunch in night that would be the man in the cellar with his bitten daughter. in dawn it would be the clumsy "fly boy" in day of the dead it would be captain Rhodes (which is my personal favorite character in all three movies) and maybe even pvt. Miguel Salazar for disregarding Sarah's safety.now there is a remake of day of the dead as well, I haven't seen it yet. it's not out in the Netherlands but i already dislike it, the fact that captain Rhodes (Joe Pilato, who was very good in his character) is now replaced by (with all due respect) Ving Rhames.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very fitting quote from the film, which applies to more reviews here than it should do.This film has it all and I have always preferred it to the previous instalments, which were somewhat lame in comparison, though 'Dawn' was indeed fun. I'm an 80s child as it happens, if I'd been alive and old enough to see 'Night' when it came out, I might have been more 'shocked', which is essential for a good zombie movie.I honestly can't see the beef with this film, it's one of the greatest horror films I have ever seen. Sure the zombies might not be as convincing as the Italian versions with their 'Thriller' style make-up, but who cares? Not I!Anyways, the story is a progression from the last film, where zombies have virtually taken over the whole world and only a handful of survivors remain. The film depicts a doomed species in a hopeless state of affairs that is truly apocalyptic. To top it off, some of the most arrogant, self-centered people (of those who remain) are trapped in an old army bunker; trying to escape amidst fighting each other. This really achieves a choking, claustrophobic atmosphere that 'Night' had but 'Dawn' failed; a mall isn't that confined, and..a gun store? Come on! All these people have are a few rounds and their wits to survive thousands of zombies - I'd be bricking my load!To take the film up to true 'Classic' status, we are given some of the most memorable and lively characters put to film. The show stealer is Joseph Pilato as 'Captain Rhodes'; he..was...awe-inspiring! 'Memorable Quotes' should be filled with his script. He really does throw his all into the film and deserved an Oscar, or a new blood vessel! Two others come to mind; the sweet but crazed Dr. Logan, or 'Frankenstein' as Rhodes called him, who sadly passed away in 2000, and the zombie that he tames - Bub! They just don't make 'em like this anymore. (sigh)GORE, GORE, GORE!!! This film certainly has it by the bucketload and it is very disgusting (and realistic) at times, the soldiers being literally pulled apart and feasted on at the end is quite foul but undoubtedly cool. "Choke on 'em! CHOKE ON 'EM!' Rhodes gasps as they eat his intestines!So basically, screw the people who worship 'Night' and 'Dawn' as some sorts of almighty monoliths of greatness, and watch 'Day' - it's far superior. Needless to say (but what the hay) if you're a fan of 80s horror then you will LOVE this. It is gory, intense and slightly fun at the same time, qualities which the other films did before, but not nearly as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Conclusion of a Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of stressed survivors, composed by soldiers and civilians, share an underground military bunker surrounded by an increasing number of zombies. When the commander of the base dies, the tyrannical Capt. Rhodes (Joe Pilato) occupies his spot and the friction with the team of scientist reaches an uncontrollable level. Meanwhile, Dr. Logan (Richard Liberty), the leader of the scientists, develops a kind affection to the zombie Bub (Howard Sherman), showing signs of insanity. Sarah (Lori Cardille), the helicopter pilot John (Terry Alexander) and their alcoholic friend William (Jarlath Conroy) are the only lucid persons, being threatened by the rest of the survivors and the zombies. 'Day of the Dead' is a great conclusion of the George Romero's trilogy. Yesterday I watched it again, maybe for the fourth or fifth time, and I found a very claustrophobic story, having excellent nasty special effects. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): 'Dia dos Mortos' ('Day of the Dead')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Day of the Dead' is definitely my favourite of George A. Romero's 'Dead' series, although I have yet to see the latest installment, 'Survival of the Dead'. 'Day of the Dead' focuses upon a group of survivors who have holed up in an underground missile silo in the Florida Everglades. Tensions run high betwixt the military and the scientists; the scientists wish to study the undead while the army just wants to blow them away. Joe Pilato is wonderful as Rhodes, a thoroughly nasty piece of work, and he has some great lines like, 'You got 'til the count of five and that's two ya wasted!'.Lori Cardille stars as Sarah, a scientist; and she is joined by Terry Alexander as John, the helicopter pilot; Jarlath Conroy as William McDermott, a brandy-swigging electronics whiz; and Antone DiLeo as Private Miguel Salazar, an increasingly unhinged soldier who is Sarah's partner.The blood and gore of 'Day of the Dead' is incredibly graphic, with bodies ripped apart by zombies in unflinching close-up. But there is definitely a vein of dark humour which helps to lighten proceedings and provide some much-needed comic relief.Along with Pilato, another great performance is that of Richard Liberty (RIP), who plays Logan, an unorthodox surgeon who is experimenting on captured zombies and who is referred to as 'Frankenstein' by the soldiers in his midst. Logan is especially interested in a captured zombie he has nicknamed 'Bub' (Howard Sherman), because Bub is displaying distinctly human characteristics.I highly recommend this, but be warned: it is not for the faint-of-heart!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Savini is a God. This movie proves it. The Wizard of Gore makes his hallmark stomach churning SFX sequence at the end which make the seemingly long movie infinitely watchable. There's not really a great deal of story in this, the third in Romero's zombie sequence, but for what it's worth, it is carried out in such a way that if such a phenomenon had occurred, one could believe the actors in their roles. Paranoid leaders, megalomaniacal, crazy, even headed, rational and easy-going characters fill out the story, each achieving their purpose...It's easy to write this off as Romero's weak point, but when one considers who is who and what they do, it really comes into its own. Sarah and Rhodes argue on different ideological grounds - Sarah hopes to end the zombie problem if given time, while Rhodes is losing grip, having been given command of the now skeleton crew following the death of his superior.The ancillary characters play their parts well, each supporting the story like most dramas would, but this is not a drama. It could also be seen as a look at the corruption caused by power and how it culminates in an inability to function, but ultimately it's an opportunity for Tom Savini to orchestrate a bloody orgy at the end where the evil gets its comeuppance, and the zombie horde triumphs and dines in style! 10 out of 10 - not the greatest story-wise for Romero, but it has so much gore and style that it deserves classic status! Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slightly flawed, ambitious masterpiece (potential light spoilers), **** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Day of the Dead", the gore fest so loved by fans of the carnivorous "Night" and the skewering "Dawn" is used not so much for generic horror thrills, but is posed by creator Romero as a scenario concerning more deeply rooted issues regarding humanity than the more predominantly social elements underscored by the previous films. Presumably set some time after "Dawn", "Day" finds the zombie epidemic that began with unknown origins in the first film having grown to insurmountable proportions. Killing the dead is of almost no use at this point beyond saving time, our conceptions of which provide one of the themes "Day" is predominantly concerned with.Considered disappointing by most upon its initial release and still viewed as the weakest chapter of Romero's trilogy (soon to be widened with the now upcoming Land of the Dead), "Day" requires a different viewing lens than its more renowned predecessors. In "Night" and "Dawn", hope for survival was one of the predominant links between the audience and the human protagonists. In "Day", the humans are down to what may be the last band of survivors, a motley crew of soldiers and scientists holed up in an underground storage facility, hoping to hold out long enough that some practical means of overcoming the zombie epidemic can be found.In many ways, "Day" paints its characters with little more than contrasting strokes of black and white, and while the sometimes exaggerated presentation makes it nearly inarguable as to who will ultimately live and die, many viewers don't engage the performances properly within their context. If "Night" and "Dawn" were eagerly perceptive of racial issues and consumerism in the midst of an encroaching unknown, "Day" surpasses both of them in terms of its examination of the human condition and its disintegration in the absence of the protective stronghold of society. This seemingly nihilistic look at human values ultimately gives way to a more optimistic conclusion, and it is this striking perception that ultimately makes "Day"'s themes far more universal in nature. The dozen characters that remain at the start of the film bicker and fight often with little provocation, or at times even reason, but these conflicts aren't a distraction from "Day"'s core; they are absolutely essential to it.Unfortunately, this aspect opens the door for the film's lone flaw; Joseph Pilato's turn as the tyrannical Captain Rhodes (as well as some of his faction's near-outlandishness) pushes the overall credibility of the performances to hazardous levels in contained moments. Fortunately, however, even the potential damage waged by this factor is largely countered by the film's subtly exaggerated, "Twilight Zone" texture, the triumphant qualities of which range from the cavernous underground look imbedded in the composition, the subtle winks Romero still manages to slips in for adherents, and more than anything else, the relationship between Dr. "Frankenstein" Logan (Richard Liberty) and a captured, ultimately docile zombie dubbed "Bub" (Sherman Howard). Respectively, their performances are delightfully (but subtly) cheeky and endearingly awkward; Howard conveys emotions and nuance through body motion with great effect. As it is, "Day" is inarguably the most ambitious of Romero's trilogy, and a flawed masterpiece at that.In "Night", the flesh eaters were largely alienated from the humans warding them off; they were an inexplicable, distinct "other." "Dawn" loosened the boundaries, drawing a brilliant parallel between the stumbling zombies and the mindless consumerism fostered by the shopping mall the survivors holed themselves out in. "Day" takes the equation to the next logical step: "They (the zombies) are us," declares the doctor. A baser, less civilized version of ourselves, but the bitter irony of it ultimately lies in the obvious fact that the zombies' hunger for flesh isn't just dissimilar to the division of our own factions, but is a far less malicious attitude than those demonstrated by their live counterparts. Instinct drives the undead, not desire, and in Dr. Logan's teaching sessions with Bub, past memories are rekindled, and the progress that follows is akin to watching a child discovering the joys of life for the first time, through the re-introduction to basic daily objects, music, and the same kind of rewards system used to condition people in a typical social setting.An attempt to look past the cynicism of the Reagan years is no more apparent in "Day" than through the spiritually motivated John (Terry Alexander). "Maybe we bein' punished," he says. "Maybe the creator wanted to show us we're getting to big for our britches, trying to figure his s**t out." Whereas "Dawn"'s characters found comfort in the paradise of society, "Day"'s characters long for the distractions that made up their former life. In denial of her own humanity's decomposition in midst of their situation, Sarah (Lori Cardille) looks with intimate longing at a photo calendar in the films haunting opening scene (ultimately also a poignant bookend for the film's hopeful conclusion). With not much left, time really does seem to be the only luxury these characters have left to savor.Despite having far more on its mind than the average horror film (and make no mistake, the thematics are integral to the screenplay, rather than being pretentiously overplayed), "Day" still delivers the goods when he time comes. Savini's gore effects and make-up are ages ahead of the pasty look of the zombies in "Dawn" (which is not to say the cherry-red blood of that film wasn't effective in it's own manner). However, the film's real sense of tension comes from its epic sense of impending claustrophobia and involving use of framing. The aforementioned opening shot captures the enclosed, no-way-out mentality the characters have no choice but to deal with, while another early shot of the undead masses lurching through the barren streets of a debunked city is one of the most effortlessly haunting images in modern horror, and a continual reminder of Romero's skills as a genre filmmaker. "Day"'s resonating intimacy is perhaps the most long-lasting trait of this dark horse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brisk, enjoyable elaboration of the zombie series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third instalment in Romero's series of zombie films is a mixture of the thoughtful, the satirical and the downright gory.The zombies are generally more of a sideshow in the early part of the film, with more emphasis on the semi-military group dynamics of the humans under siege. Romero expands upon this theme, by contrasting the 'egghead' Dr Logan (Richard Liberty) with the twisted, action hero-gone-wrong Captain Rhodes (Joseph Pilato). Both are anti-heroes in their different ways, fitting in with the 'Dead' series' clever refusal to countenance good and evil. Logan represents a fascinating, if potentially deluded and irrelevant academia; Rhodes a stunted, shoot-first, ask-questions-later militarism. Both are dismembered, neither approach shown to be 'right' or effective in the face of the undead onslaught.Again, the zombies are wonderfully crafted, though there is less poetry and surrealism in their depiction than in the magisterial "Dawn of the Dead". Barring perhaps the pivotal scenes of Dr Logan, with his application of behaviourist theory in training a lone zombie in his lab. These experimentation sequences have the sort of evocative use of sound that runs throughout the earlier film: the same sense of melancholy and dislocation, and Romero clearly relishes elaborating the 1978 film's core theme of the zombie regressing to previous learnt behaviour. There is a woozy, ambient calm to the scene where he tries to instill in the zombie a liking for Beethoven through textbook behaviourism. Otherwise, the music tends a bit towards the post-Carpenter 1980s norm.Performances are excellent, make-up and assorted guts present and suitably incorrect. However, whilst Lori Cardille is excellent, she could have been given more to do, and the progression towards the resolution is rather more contrived than in the previous two films. There are stretches towards the end where it gets close to standard action territory, and several characters are barely developed.This hasn't quite got the style and engagement of the previous films, but works on the level of a satirical exposure of mainstream action films and of dry academic theory. "Day of the Dead" is an admirably cynical and at times thoughtful piece of entertainment, always holding the interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Third entry in Romero's 'Dead' films is another great zombie flick, rich with social commentary and horror. It has rightfully developed a devoted cult following.The zombie outbreak continues, leaving scientists and military officials trapped in an underground facility. The scientists hope to study the zombies, but tensions are growing high among the refugees.Director Romero considers Day of the Dead to be his favorite zombie effort, and it truly is an outstanding and smart zombie film. It's a perfectly effective horror film, especially enjoyable for the hard-core horror fans. Romero does well building an increasing feeling of tension and claustrophobia with this film. He creates some great characters and plenty of sequences of intense drama. There's a good share of scares, especially the memorable opening scene and climatic chase through the underground caves. It ultimately comes out with a tremendous (and bloody) finale that showcases some incredible gore effects. Makeup guru Tom Savini returns to create the highly gruesome makeup work.The cast isn't bad, but it's really bombastic Joseph Pilato who steals the show as a villainous military captain. Romero fans will surely enjoy this flick, while the weak of stomach had better be warned!*** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dead Rule Over All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the eighties, horror was big business again. George Romero, and his genre-bending zombie films, had been elevated to iconic levels. A few years had passed since "Dawn of the Dead." The time had come for another entry in the series. Originally envisioned as the ultimate zombie movie, budget cuts had Romero scaling back his vision. "Day of the Dead" was released in 1985, the same year as "Return of the Living Dead" and "Re-Animator." In comparison, the down-beat, slow-paced "Day" disappointed fans. For years, the film was considering the weakest entry in the trilogy. Time, however, was on its side. Now, many people list "Day of the Dead" as their favorite of Romero's original trilogy, including the filmmaker himself."Night" showed the beginning of the zombie apocalypse. "Dawn" had society on the verge of collapse. By the time of "Day," the dead outnumber the living. A small group of scientists and soldiers hole up in an abandoned missile silo. The scientists, led by fearless Sarah and eccentric Dr. Logan, attempt to study the living dead. The soldiers, meanwhile, want to exterminate the zombies and lord over what remains of humanity. Whatever shred of order remains breaks down in time and, soon enough, the dead rule over all.As the series evolved, one prevailing theme rose above: Humanity's ultimate downfall won't be because of the undead but because of mankind's inability to communicate with each other. This idea comes to the forefront in "Day." The inhabitants of the silo are a powder keg, waiting to go off. The soldiers are belligerent, sexist, and racist. If they worked with the scientists, the human race might have a chance to survive. Instead, military leader Rhodes and his even-worse men use the situation as an opportunity to boss the others around. Even before zombies invade the base, guns are pulled. Another reason people were disappointed by "Day" initially is because it doesn't appear to be taking a sharp look at any social issue of the time. However, through the film's characters, it becomes clear that Romero is criticizing the pro-military attitude of Reagan-era America. Military aggression is painted as little more then a grand pissing contest, allowing the film to take aim at Cold War escalation.The sole element of "Day" that everyone likes is its treatment of zombies. The film delves into what makes the undead tick. Dr. Logan dissects zombies, cutting out their organs. The film gives a fascinating glimpse into the inner workings of the zombies' minds. As future entries in the protracted trilogy would make clear, Romero had always planned for the zombies to evolve over time. Enter Bub! While the other zombies Dr. Logan captures are mindless shamblers, Bub is the Zombie with a Soul. He mumbles words. He studies relics from his human life. His mind is visibly blown when he is introduced to classical music. Bub has emotions too, mourning for his father figure and even taking revenge. Many of the characters in "Day" are prickly, hard-to-relate-with. Everyone loves Bub.On first viewing, "Day" can come off as somewhat abrasive. Many of the cast are intentionally obnoxious. Captain Rhodes is an authoritative dirtbag, willing to gun people down because they disagree with him. His primary henchman, Steel and Rickles, make lewd comments and release high-pitched laughs. Private Salazar is in such a constant, high-strung state that he becomes impossible to relate too. Everyone swears and screams. It's not the fault of the cast. Joe Pilato and the others certainly give it their all. Characters this broad and aggravating don't make "Day of the Dead" the easiest watch.The other cast members are easier to relate too. Lori Cardille's Sarah is steely and strong. Richard Liberty gives a memorable performance as the unhinged Dr. Logan. Crazy though Dr. Logan might be, his enthusiasm makes him fun to watch. Jarlath Conroy provides much needed levity as Bill, the alcoholic operator. Terry Alexander as John, the Caribbean pilot with a thick accent, gives a solid performance. The heroes provide a pocket of sanity in the world of intense emotion that is "Day of the Dead." Of interest to most horror fans is the gore. "Night" invented the splatter flick. "Dawn" upped the ante, creating the zombie gorefest. In the wake of super-explicit Italian rip-offs, George had to push the limit. "Day" features the most graphic zombie violence up to this point. While body parts are bitten throughout, the film really cuts loose in its last act. A zombie with a split abdomen sits up, his guts spilling out. An infected arm is cut off and the wound cauterized. A man's neck is tore apart, his head pulled loose, screaming all the while. Another has his face tore away. Rhodes gets the nastiest death of all, literally torn in two, his intestines pouring out. The scenes of zombies gorging themselves are stomach-churning even to this hardened horror fan. Even the undead are dispatched in interesting ways, such as one that has his dead bisected by a shovel, eyes twitching. The zombie make-up has improved considerably. The blue face paint of "Dawn" gave way to detailed appliances. Continuing another trend started in "Dawn," the zombies have personality too. We see a zombie football player, zombie clown, a ballerina, a bride, a soldier, and more.It's been a long road for "Day of the Dead" from disappointment to classic. It's now spoke of in the same quality as the first two of Romero's undead classics. Each one of the original trilogy works in its own way. I happen to prefer the first two over "Day" but you can't say Romero's third undead film isn't as personal or inspiring.</fullReview>

Tom Savini definitely outdoes himself here, a huge improvement from this film's predecessor.Day of the Dead has it all: zombies that actually look like walking corpses, realistic gore that makes you think you are seeing the real deal and great actors portraying awesome characters.From beginning to end, this is an apocalyptic film that actually FEELS like it's the end of the world as we know it.

		<fullReview>It's a shame that writer / director George A. Romero didn't have enough of a budget to create a true apocalyptic feel to this third film in his living dead series. Still, what he does manage to create is a sense of intimacy as a limited number of characters are having a hard time dealing with the proliferation of zombies that has overtaken society. He focuses on a group of soldiers, scientists, and other personnel in an Army bunker, and the give and take between these people is some of the grimmest stuff that one will ever see in this genre. What "Day of the Dead" delivers best is a believable portrait of people under tremendous stress. And nobody bothers with any sort of moral "filter" anymore, instead indulging themselves in the most ignorant attitudes possible.Lori Cardille (daughter of Bill "Chilly Billy" Cardille) stars as Sarah, the sole female presence among this group. Her friends are chopper pilot John (Terry Alexander) and communications / electronics expert McDermott (Jarlath Conroy). The primary human antagonist is the extremely memorable Captain Rhodes (Joseph Pilato), who's sick and tired of the scientists - specifically, Dr. Logan (Richard Liberty) - in his company. Logan is nicknamed "Frankenstein" for good reason, as he giddily goes about carrying out his experiments. His greatest success is a zombie named Bub (Sherman Howard), whom he has managed to humanize to a degree.The film is admittedly talky for quite a while, but it's never less than interesting. Romeros' dialogue is good, and as fans know there are some choice quotes that come out of Rhodes's mouth. (Including his final one.) Tom Savini's wonderfully effective gore is an asset, of course, but never becomes the whole show; it enhances the drama instead. There is some very good atmosphere in the cave scenes, and the zombies themselves remain forces to be reckoned with. The acting is definitely impressive; also in the cast are "Martin" lead John Amplas, Gary Howard Klar, Taso N. Stavrakis, and a young Greg Nicotero, who was Savinis' assistant on this show. Ernest R. Dickerson, future Spike Lee cinematographer and eventual director in his own right, was a second unit cameraman here.As a conclusion to what was initially a trilogy, "Day of the Dead" is worthy of its predecessors and a damn fine horror film. In fact, some fans even prefer it to "Dawn".Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love George Romero's work, because despite being contained to a few genres he always manages to make you think deeply about what's going on. Thru subtle emotions, the unsaid fatigue, it's all masterful. Besides I never saw what the big deal was about specializing in certain genres. By now, everyone knows about the early production problems this film faced, the problem being that its initial much larger budget and script lead to the studio's wanting of the film to be more accessible for mainstream (God I hate that word) audiences. In other words, for more money, Romero would have to soften his film's impact; less gore, less gloom, less striking macabre visuals. Of course, Romero stuck to his guns and instead went the route of cutting down on his script.With that out of the way, I'll elaborate on why the human characters are so great in this one. In. "Day of the Dead", the characters presented are very much so on the brink of collapse. Time is running out, and the main argument of the film is how pointless it is to keep dwelling on a problem that just can't be solved. Instead, the directive should be to renew. The beauty of the film is that when you think about it the actual antagonist is hard to discern. Many would claim Cpt. Rhodes, played by the awesome Joseph Pilato, but if you really think about it his actions are only rational. In the presence of 'Dr. Frankenstein', its only natural violence would break out amongst the survivors. Is Dr. Frankenstein the villain, for his disregard of the sanctity of the dead? The pure insanity of Richard Liberty as Dr. Logan (a.k.a. Frankenstein) is so perfect. The character is clearly mentally unstable, but the thing that makes him human is Bub (played by Sherman Howard). The two share an almost parent-child relationship, making the film that much more dynamic. And Mr. Howard, he's easily the most memorable zombie ever, period.The rest of the cast is pretty solid, starring the likes of the beautiful Lori Cardille, Terry Alexander and Jarlath Conroy.Aside all the wonderful dark cinematography, its amazing opening (gotta love the alligator) and claustrophobia -causing atmosphere, the film also delivers the goods. The gore effects, curtsey of Tom Savini's team, are astounding to this day. The make-up effects are spectacular, Gregory Nicotero making sure each zombie is as unique as it is gruesome-looking. If you haven't seen "Day of the Dead" you know nothing of horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romero at his best &amp; zombies at theirs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the dead is a follow up from dawn of the dead by the same director George A. Romero. The story takes place underground in an abandoned missile silo , where a group of scientists and soldiers are barricaded in.Now let me explain something. After the release of the successful dawn of the dead in 1979 Romero intended to end his "trilogy of he dead" with a big budgeted follow up. But because of major budget disputes and the artistic need to release the film unrated, Romero was granted ?3.5 million for the budget, just under half the initial ?7 million he had at first. This forced Romero to scale back his story, rewriting the script and adjusting his original vision to fit the smaller budget. so the movie we see today is completely different from the one we were intended on having. Apparrerntly the script for the original version is leaked all over the Internet but i haven't read it yet. But i wouldn't change this movie for the world its the essential horror film , just look at how many other films and TV shows have used material from Day of the Dead - resident evil extinction ( the zombie using the phone like bub) 28 days later( with the physcotic military &amp; keeping the infected alive for testing) the band GORILLAZ use audio from day of the dead in the beginning of the song, south park made an episode about zombies and borrowed a lot of elements from Day of the dead.I must say that the opening scene in this movie throws you into the action head first, the characters land the helicopter in a city and use a megaphone to see if there is any survivors. but then the undead rise and within seconds,there are literally hundreds of the undead around the city. the first thing i noticed when i first watched this film, was just how genuinely scary the zombies looked compared to the blue skinned ones from Dawn of the dead. These zombies look outstanding, Tom Savini i salute you! The phsycotic military leader Captain Rhodes ( Joseph Pilato) is a truly outstanding character. I mean he is such an ar*ehole and you are always hoping throughout the movie that he gets killed (and trust me you wont be disappointed). Now I've heard people say that this movie is full of terrible acting, but i find it really good. Its not too over dramatic or bland its just right. I also hear people say daft sh*t like " There was no action until the last 10 minutes" and "All they did was argue all the time". well thats okay i suppose, they weren't exactly lying, but it only makes sense that everyone in the movie is at each others throat. They are the last people on the face of the planet, there is bound to be a lot of tensions!I gotta go all out and say this film has the best zombies ever in it. they can tear limbs off like its no problem, and the eat everything they can from humans, unlike some zombie films where they just eat certain parts, and that makes these zombies seem all the more scary. The special effects are out of this world . Back in 1985 i couldn't imagine what the peoples reactions were to the gore fest in the last 15 minutes of the film. Tom Savini at his best no doubt, he received a Saturn award for his work on day of the dead and he more than deserved it. Another aspect of the movie that does it well is the soundtrack, its brilliant and helps set the dark tone the movie goes for. I Always liked the dawn of the dead soundtrack but i think this one makes dawns just sound a bit sillyThe trailer for this films describes day of the dead as "the darkest day of horror the world has ever known" , and it is well worthy of that statement. This movie has to be one of the darkest, most claustrophobic and gory films in history. that being said, is it a good film? plain and simple - YES!!By Scott Dewhurst</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Dead/Courageous Woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the Romero films, this one is my favorite. I don't even count "Survival and "Diary." I found Lori Cardille's portrayal of Sarah riveting. Unlike Milla Jovovich's Alice of Residen Evil fame, Sarah's a real woman. There are so many layers of horror coming at her, and most of them come not from the zombies, but from the men around her. Rhodes, Logan, Miguel.Folks watching this forget that she is the only female. That's huge. Her cabin fever is magnified just by this very fact. There's no mother-figure, or female colleague or little girl to to whom she could be a mother-figure ala Alien 3. She's trying to save the world with her only power, her power as a scientist ala "I Am Legend." Her confrontations with Rhodes and his men are terrifying and yet realistic given the circumstances. It's obvious they weren't handpicked for this mission. Much like something out of a prison movie is Sarah's experience after Rhodes takes command. Rhodes and his men are not simply on edge, they are hanging off the edge with nothing more than a pinkie finger. I kept feeling Sarah was in physical jeopardy, especially of some kind of sexual assault. When taunting her boyfriend, one of Rhodes' men says when contemplating what might happen with Sarah if something happened to Miguel. "Maybe some of the rest of us can get some loving." The men resent her for being so "competent" when wrangling the zombies despite the fact that she was cool-headed. She's also concerned that too much is being asked of them when it comes to wrangling the zombies. Take the scene when upon her return in the helicopter Miguel, her boyfriend, is commanded to wrangle zombies for another scientist's experiments. She knows Miguel is PTSD and beyond exhausted and so volunteers, but she is barred physically by his seniors. If she were a man, she'd be hailed as their emotional leader, but they hate her because she's not in a corner weeping profusely. They can't seem to understand that she's very much affected by everything that's going on but because she is not fitting the stereotype of a weak and whimpering woman who needs a big strong man she's reviled.Her scenes with Logan too are disturbing. Her research and his are very different. Hers is biochemical, while his is clearly behavioral. She wants to cure the zombies, while Logan wants to train them to do tricks and obey orders. He's not her colleague. He's her competition because he want to give the men quick answers while she wants to reverse everything, a process she knows may take years. Logan even alludes to the fact that she's expendable to Rhodes as a warning, telling her basically that she has to watch her back.Miguel, who obviously presented himself to her in a better light in the beginning of their relationship, becomes more and more diminished by the stress of the zombie apocalypse. He's suffering from PTSD and hates Sarah becomes she doesn't visibly collapse like he is. He's broken and resentful that she's not broken too. It hurts his male ego, and they grow apart quickly. He even physically slaps her in one scene. In some ways he's worse than Rhodes and his men because at least with him she should have had some expectation of support and comfort, but he has absolutely none to offer her. Just before the physical slap he is found awake, watching her, HATING her. Still, even after he is bitten, she protects him, but he betrays her by releasing the zombies into the bunker. He's a punk, a coward and vengeful and uses his religion to self-deceive. At no point does he do anything to protect or aid her. If he was so religious, he made no effort to share his religious experience with anyone, especially not Sarah.Sarah's only fault is that she naively expects in the wake of the horror that everyone should be reasonable. This is how she's broken. She's in denial. But it's a kind of hope that she has, a hope that is groundless.Of the men in this movie, only John shines. It's almost as if he's only hanging around until he can make Sarah see the futility of what she's doing. He tells her, "I don't believe in what you're doing here, Sarah darling." As an African-American woman who actually got to see "Night of the Living Dead" in the movie theater in 1968, I've been gratified to see Black men portrayed in zombie flicks who weren't hoodlums or thugs. God save me from zombie flicks like "Gangs of the Dead," "Dead Heist" and "The Horde." I wanted the zombies to chomp on the protagonists in these movies. Oh, and in "The Horde" the Black men were more monstrous than the zombies. If you hate Black thugs and bad cops, I recommend you watch "The Horde." If I'd been a character in that movie I would have pitched myself off the top of the building and into the zombie horde. I live and work with Black men like the ones in "Night of the Living Dead - 1968," "Dawn of the Dead - 1978" and "Day of the Dead - 1985", and even in "Land of the Dead" where the zombie chief is a Black man who was an auto-mechanic. These I can relate to, so thank you George Romero.Frankly, I'm glad the original budget for this movie was slashed. I'm glad they were forced to rewrite the script. I read the original and hated it. I think this made it possible for Romero to feature a woman with realistic problems in the wake of a zombie apocalypse. I learned too that of the first three, this is Romero's favorite. Now will someone tell me why Netflix doesn't carry it. The horrible 2010 version is the only thing you can view with them.Lori Cardille rocks!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sui generis zombie cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By far, this is the most serious and dramatic zombie movie ever created. Yes, you can have a dramatic feature inserted in a Horror movie that deals with the undead, military stations, and scientific sub-plots."Day Of The Dead" gives the audience a message in the kinds of "Cannibal Holocaust" when it comes to humanity, a scientific revolution that isn't necessary something good, human instincts and even greed, betrayal, and violence.Forget about the previous "Dead" films because "Day" takes a more mature and critical orientation. It's more of an intelligent Horror film that tries to focus more on the plot and character development. But it doesn't forgets about gore (oh, it's glorious gore), action, and genuine fear.This is in my opinion, the most unique zombie film that tries to not copy clichs in zombie cinema. This one takes things further and explores emotions through a zombie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not like this flick at first. It took video and a few extra viewings to appreciate it. This flick grew on me-unlike Land of the dead-which was just stupid. I wish they had done more in the city, but understand budgets and time. Overall, I started with a three and ended with a seven on this one. And I saw it in a theater back in 1985. the most horrific part of the experience was watching Mick Jagger and David Bowie do their video of 'Dancing in the streets'. I remember friends look at me and say 'what the *beep*'?' Awkward stuff. This movie was a 'grower'. It took a few viewings to like it and I remember people cheering when the headless zombie met the shovel. Great stuff.

		<fullReview>Acceptable though inferior third part on George Romero's Zombie series initiated in the original classic film Night of the living dead and with expert make-up artist , Tom Savini along with Greg Nicotero . This powerful horror film with more budget than George A Romero classic film , one of the most successful independent films of all time that was initially dismissed as exploitation, but when was re-released , it struck deeply with a disillusioned youth angry . Here there is a team searching for survivors of a terrible crisis that began almost a year earlier . Flesh-eating zombies taking over the world and scientific experimenting on zombies . It deal with a small group of military officers and scientists (Lori Cardille , Terry Alexander) dwell in an underground bunker as the world above is overrun by zombies . As creatures trap a female scientific named Sarah and an army of angry soldiers commanded by a stiff-upper-lip officer called Rhodes (Joseph Pilato) . There a scientist wants to study them .This gory film contains chills , thrills , graphic scenes of cannibalism and violence , dismemberment and other scary carnage in which real pig intestines were used during the gore scenes. Gruesome third film, combining gore, 'bona fide' frights horror and in dirty style with simple characterization . The first time the Zombies appeared was in White Zombie(1932). From then on Zombies remained a firm staple of terror B-genre , bringing the dead back to life was a popular pastime in the 30s and 40s . The early zombies were basically genteel beings and generally likable and agreeable types . Romero created in Pittsburg his own production company Image Ten Productions with his friends, John Russo among them and they each contributed 10.000 dollars and formed the budget for his first Night of living dead movie which made Romero world famous and he gave birth to the modern Zombie genre . Most of the zombie extras in this film were Pittsburgh residents who volunteered to help in the film . This follow-up that doesn't hold up to its predecessors is mostly set in an underground bunker , but results to be relentless claustrophobic and talky for over an hour . The underground facility was not on a soundstage , it was shot in the Wampum mine, a former limestone mine near Pittsburgh, that was being used for a underground storage facility Day of the dead is even gorier than the first two "Dead" films . Unlike the other pictures this one has no truly agreeable roles to root for . Being easily the least of the entries and the lowest grossing film in George A. Romero's "Dead" trilogy. Nonetheless, it's gained a cult following over the last two decades and director George A. Romero claims this is his favorite film out of the original "dead trilogy". This trilogy formed by Night of the living dead, Dawn of the dead and this Day of the dead were of the first successful independent terror productions influencing and inspiring countless imitations, copies and rip-offs . Romero gave birth to the modern Zombie genre and the film has had a lasting importance , giving interesting consideration to the violence executed by the zombies . And many years later Romero directed Land of dead (2005) with high budget played by Simon Baker , Asia Argento and Dennis Hooper . And also an inferior remake in 1990 by Tom Savini with Tone Todd , Patricia Tallman in which again a bunch of people are pursued by ghouls Zombies .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a scandal that such a brilliant film as "Day of the dead" has been overlooked for so long, and still pretty much continues to do so. In fact, being an avid horror movie consumer and favoring zombie movies especially, it is only now that I've been lucky enough to get a copy of this. I'm so glad about that! "Day of the dead" is, to my mind, not only the best of all Romero's zombie flicks, but also in the top three of all zombie movies ever made. It has every single asset that I consider desirable for a zombie film to be perfect: a claustrophobic environment with little realistic ways out, characters pushed to the limits, paranoia, darkness (literal darkness as well as an obscurity, a density of word, thought and mindset that clearly reflects the apocalyptic world that they now live in), powerlessness, lots of quality suspense, and gore. Many of those elements are missing in an awful lot of zombie movies."Day of the dead" is also ahead of its time (1985) in special and makeup effects and, beyond that, in the general pessimistic mood that is now sadly a reality. There is nothing funny, redeeming, thrilling about the new world dominated by zombies; the heroes of this show do not make a point of killing zombies as if it were some sort of hunting expedition with lots of adrenaline. They are simply the last humans standing, a group of scientists and military who happen to have survived so far (how, and why them, is never told), and trying to live another day in an underground facility (which is one of the best settings ever devised in a horror movie). Some kind of science project or experiment is also taking place, with a Dr Logan leading it (great character, that one), but this doesn't leave for much optimism. Basically, the gray, primary, claustrophobic setting, the rivalry between the military and the scientific communities, and the sickness and nightmares that ail the heroes let us know early on that we're in for a gloomy tale."Day of the dead" is also worth watching because it introduces elements that are completely original in the genre, and have still (to my knowledge) either not been used at all, or have been so only recently.My score is a resounding 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the "Dead" trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero's third installment in his famous horror quadrilogy is a well acted thriller on a more subdued scale than his previous entry, 1978's Dawn of the Dead. It benefits from the strongest acting and special effects of the entire series. In my opinion the effects of Day even outshine his latest zombie movie, Land of the Dead. They aren't as frequent as those found in Dawn, but when they hit they hit hard. I loved the location of the film, the isolation of the mine and caverns really added an eerie feel to the whole thing. The daytime shots of the zombies shambling into the streets en masse at the start of the film is probably my favorite apocalyptic zombie scene ever put to film. As mentioned before, I believe this features the best acting in any of the "Dead" movies as well. Lori Cardille (who strongly resembles Carrie Fisher), Joe Pilato, Howard Sherman and the late Richard Liberty are all top notch here. Detractors of the movie frequently point out the script that Romero wrote but wasn't allowed to film due to budget limitations. While his original script would have called for a movie on a much larger scale, it is the smaller and more personal scale itself that makes this my favorite of the series. Not to be missed by anyone who calls themselves a fan of horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the zombies are almost a distraction...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No movie in the history of cinema has made my critical radar as confounded as this one; it seems like I've given no other film more chances to earn my approval, but lately it has really started to grow on me, to the point where I can (almost) see what people mean when they call it "the best in the trilogy." Of course, I'm not going to go that far, but I am going to praise it for what it is: a brilliant depiction of a desperate situation, the nihilism of existence after existence (as a human being) has been rendered meaningless, and a reminder of why humans would be better off conforming to the zombie plague instead of trying to fight it.My initial viewings always were soured by the human characters, who were unpleasant or apathetic enough to drive me to indifference or contempt. Yet, considering "Day of the Dead" as a progression of the situation created in "Night" (for all the zombies roaming the countryside, there are still a lot of humans, too) and "Dawn" (okay, the zombies have the upper hand, but there are still a FEW humans left), the handful of characters gathered in the elaborate underground shelter are at a dead end (as one of them sarcastically intones: "Maybe we are the only ones left."). Romero has always cleverly implied that the zombies, who act on instinct, are really less 'monstrous' (and indeed, less scary) than the humans battling them. This point is boldly underlined in "Day of the Dead," where military and science is at war, unable to work cooperatively toward common goals; in such a desperate situation, it makes an ironic bit of sense that the most apathetic characters also turn out to be the most sensible.Lately, I have really come to appreciate the human element of Romero's films. Whereas I was once a 12-year old staying up late to gaze in wonder at exploding heads and severed limbs in "Dawn of the Dead," lately the zombies have begun to feel like periphery to the overriding themes of human relationships. Roger Ebert once described the zombies as "blameless," and he's right--they are innocents who just happen to thrive on warm flesh. By comparison, the humans are selfish, manipulative, and hopelessly flawed in their actions, which ultimately determines the downfall that causes the inevitable third-act zombie riot.Though Romero seems to be more ambitious than can be sustained for 100 minutes, his effort is admirable--"Day of the Dead" is a fine showcase for Tom Savini's gore, memorable characters (especially Joe Pilato's loathsome Rhodes), and down-to-earth writing (working from a truncated script). Here's hoping "Land of the Dead" continues in this difficult, uncompromising direction...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated zombie classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the events of "Dawn of the Dead", it seems the world has been populated by the undead and a group of soldiers with researchers hide underground in a cavern mine shelter bunker. They are rounding up some zombies so they can study them to see if they can be taught and can be domesticated like animals, they have a special semi-intelligent zombie named Bub (Howard Sherman) who has a small bit of humanity in him as a doctor named Logan (Liberty Sherman) is training him to be like us. However the sour and mean spirited Captain Rhodes (Joe Pilato) gets nosy about who might be a traitor for he might unleash the darkest day for everyone.Highly underrated entry of the George Romero living dead saga! it was a flop at the box-office and got critical mixed reviews unlike the first two "Night of the Living Dead" and "Dawn of the Dead" were hits and acclaimed as classics. However it was discovered again on video, DVD, laser disc and Blu-Ray over many years as it's now hailed as a classic of the horror genre and from the 80's. Here the zombies are more improved then the Grey-faced simple ones from "Dawn of the Dead" and the gore here is very realistic and stomach-churning thanks to the magic of Tom Savini and crew creating the grossest special effects shown in a 80's horror movie. The music score by John Harrison is not as good as Dawn of the Dead's score from Goblin but it's very effective for 80's music, this is an excellent Sci-fi horror movie that rocks the house for it's nice performances and graphic gore galore.It's definitely not for the faint of heart but it's one hell of a fun ride for fans of zombie movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing too different. Maybe more of it. This the third in the George A. Romero trilogy of the flesh-eating undead taking over the world. In a high-tech underground bunker, a group made up of military and scientists dwell together actually cordoning off zombies to experiment with. There is some talk of even trying to domesticate these gut-suckers. The military would rather be rid of the walking rotted flesh; just as much as the scientists would keep a few alive. One mad scientist may have just crossed the line. A new commanding officer seems determined to let all hell break loose. Let the fun begin. Some pretty damn grisly images. F/X deliberate and pronounced. How hard is it for Romero to "out-gross" his followers? He leaves little to be desired. And there is a chance you'll get to taste your lunch one more time. Cast includes: Lori Cardile, Terry Alexander, Joe Pilato, Anthony Dileo Jr. and Don Brockett the chief Zombie.</fullReview>

I don't know if they intended to make Miguel such a loathsome character or not, but geesh! It isn't because he is mentally falling apart from stress, as Sarah so aptly points out in the beginning, but not only is there little character development for him, but what we do learn is that he does nothing to stand up for himself or his girlfriend, and doesn't speak up at all when he screws up, whether it's his fault or not. I just completely resent his character. Dr. Logan, aka Frankenstein, is even likable in his insanity.

		<fullReview>As a zombie aficionado is it impossible to not have watched the Romero zombie movies, especially as they are such big milestones in the zombie genre. And also as they are the zombie movies that has the most heart put into it, no pun intended.This 1985 movie, directed by George A. Romero, is the third of zombie movies in his lineage of zombie storytelling. And it continues with the usual bleak world overrun by the living dead. Society has collapsed and the world is in disarray, with small clusters of people struggling for survival. But it is not the threat of the living dead that proves the only danger is the new dying world.Romero does a great job at telling the story he has in mind, and it is presented in a very enjoyable manner, which makes his movies quite entertaining and watchable.The story in the 1985 movie "Day of the Dead" is about a group of soldiers and scientists who have barricaded themselves in an underground bunker facility. Here they try to survive the dying world around them. Some scientists are studying the living dead in order to understand more about them and to control them, a study which does not sit well with the armed military forces.Granted that this movie is from 1985, so the special effects and zombie make-up is a bit outdated by today's standards. But it still works fine though, and the effects are still believable. But in the Romero movies it is not the special effects that drive the movie, it is the story and the characters; the special effects just help to progress the story and add a visual imagery to the dying world.The acting in "Day of the Dead" was quite good, and there is a very memorable gallery of characters in the movie. And there was even a very memorable zombie known as Bub. And they had managed to cast some good talents to portray the various role and characters. I must admit that I was surprised to find out that special effects master Greg Nicotero was in the movie.I assume that you are already familiar with this 1985 classic zombie movie if you are a fan of the zombie genre. If you are not, shame on you, then it is about due time that you get around to watching it. In fact, watch all the Romero zombie movies, as they are important to the zombie genre.I have watched "Day of the Dead" several times, as I have with all of Romeros movies, and it can sustain multiple viewings, because the story is so well-written and executed on the screen."Day of the Dead" receives a seven out of ten stars from me. This is a good, wholesome zombie movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being that I'm a "The Walking Dead" viewer I thought I'd check out some zombie history; you know, go to the archives and see how zombies used to roll.Although I've seen at least a couple of Romero's Dead movies I hadn't seen this one. This was rather unique in that a band of living was able to hole up underground to survive the zombie apocalypse. They were a mixture of military men and civilians. Right away you could tell there was a contentious relationship between the two camps and being isolated subterraneanly didn't help.There were some interesting characters in this film. The military commander was an angry, loud, power hungry guy who was fed up with the civilians. There was a doctor, teasingly called Frankenstein, who was trying to domesticate the dead. And my favorite character had to be John (Terry Alexander), the Caribbean guy who was the epitome of cool. He was also the most rational and better still, he was a helicopter pilot."Day of the Dead" is a good ol' fashioned zombie movie. No CGI, terrible musical score, and plenty of blood and guts.</fullReview>

The screenplay is the real winner here as Romero writes a mean follow up to Dawn?which is commendable. There is a brilliant segment about the attempt to domesticate the zombie, echoes of which were present in a small sub-section of World War Z, the book. The gore quotient is remarkably high for a movie of the 80s with the last fifteen minutes straight from hell, thanks to Tom Savini, the SFX guru.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another interesting addition to Romero's franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far George A. Romero has been able to produce film after film in his zombie franchise with expert directing and writing. Both Night of the Living Dead (1968) and Dawn of the Dead (1978) had intriguing and likable characters that quickly hooked its audience into the world at which they fight to survive. Romero seems to be performing a study on the human condition when it comes to solitude. Although each installment has pretty much ended all the same way and has settings similar to each other, the story never feels the same, which is great. It keeps the viewers attention to detail tight.The last two settings took place in a house, and then a shopping mall. This time, we are no longer on the ground. Now, viewers will follow a group of survivors that end up taking shelter underground. There we are also introduced to a couple of scientists and a very tiny militia. What makes this particular story line different from the other installments is that Romero starts writing more about the psychological aspects of zombies. The scientists begin to learn that if zombies are treated like kids, they could become obedient. Whoa, that's new. Sadly, nothing would be complete in the story if there wasn't any friction. This friction comes from the militia ran by one heck of captain that needs some chill pills. Not only does he care less for anyone else, but he also is quite trigger-happy. The thing is although these characters are gravitating, they don't feel as magnetic as the ones from the past two films. Again, the cast to this movie are very much no name actors. Yes, some went on to future projects but others stopped soon after. I don't understand how actors that take part in a widely successful movie, decides to drop out of the film industry. Wouldn't it make sense to continue? Lori Cardille who plays the female lead makes her character very strong and that's commendable. Terry Alexander plays a Jamaican pilot that adds clever dialog to the plot. Joseph Pilato as the hotheaded captain is definitely good as being a total jerk and a coward all at once. Richard Liberty plays Logan, one of the scientists and he is able to make his studies sound quite authentic. And the most interesting character of all is Bub (Sherman Howard), a zombie specimen that Logan uses to show everyone else that they can be controlled. Quite a convincing performance.Michael Gornick's cinematography is well done. His shots of the underground tunnel are unique and give a better idea to how much limited room this group has instead of being in a house or shopping mall. The gore is probably more or less the same as Dawn of the Dead (1978) but the finale is possibly the goriest of them all (thanks to Tom Savini's visual effects). If you get queasy, it won't be fun for you. Finally John Harrison's music did work in places while others it didn't. Its difficult to understand why Romero never hired an actual composer for his films except for William Loose from Night of the Living Dead (1968). His score was the best of all three films.George A. Romero's third entry in his zombie trilogy continues to add new ideas to his self-made genre. His characters feel real and the element isolation is still prevalent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, those were the days (of the dead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so most hard core zombie lovers drool over Night of the Living Dead (its underlying racial undertones providing some thought-provoking moments). Then, this was followed by 1979's Dawn of the Dead, to which many people paralleled it with an attack on consumerism. Them in 1985, came Day and people said...what? Any hidden themes are unclear. Some say it's an attack on genetic modification and god-playing scientists - maybe. But it, as the tagline suggests, is the darkest day in horror.It's not as action-packed as Dawn, but for claustrophobic nature and tension, it really can't be beaten.Watch it. Then watch it again. It's about the remains of human lives when they're forced together with people who they share nothing in common with. The undead take a backseat. Definitely my favourite in the saga.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The walking dead equivalent to 'Return of the Jedi'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though they've lost their fear factor for me, zombie films are my favorite junk food; I just can't get enough of them and 'Day of the Dead' is the peanut-butter-filled Twinkie of the lot. Romero's original Living Dead trilogy set the standard for American zombie movies and this is the walking dead equivalent to 'Return of the Jedi'.In 'Day of the Dead', there's the veneer of a story focusing on a group of government assigned scientists and military personnel posted in an isolated underground mine-come-research facility sometime after the zombie apocalypse. The film follows a collection of characters who are undeniably more interesting than the throw-away 'meat' posing as human beings in most modern horror movies. We could go on and on about the Romero(ian) social commentaries &amp; satirical subtexts about government conspiracy and the breakdown of civility in contemporary America but, let's face it, the bread-and-butter here is that 'Day of the Dead' is the film that finally makes a zombie the protagonist! The real hero here is Howard Sherman's 'Bub'. The most emotive and 3-dimensional character in any of Romero's films. In a performance that genuinely rivals Karloff's 'Monster', he has to be one of the greatest (and most under-appreciated) characters of 1980's cinema.Also unique to 'Day' ? and rare to genre films of the time ? is a strong female lead. The story is largely told from the perspective of Sarah, played by Lori Cardille, and Romero admits that placing a heroine front and center was a bit of a self-imposed penance for years of writing jelly-armed damsels in distress (a la 'Barbara'). Sarah is no 'Ellen Ripley' and there's never an epic hero-moment for her but she's more than passing and has some great moments at the beginning of the film.'Day' is also the most Lovecraftian of Romero's films with mad scientists who manage to come off as the least insane of the bunch and, with 'Bub', we get the zombie epiphany that there really is more going on inside those decaying skulls than we ever hoped or feared; zombies have memories of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My new favorite dead movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After this review being accidentally deleted, I am not going to go into as much detail. So I have seen every "dead" movie, except for diary of the dead, which I hear is good and I have yet to see. Anyway, until a couple of months ago, I wasn't even aware of this movie's existence! Ya I know, I have been living under a rock... But hey this one was the lowest grossing of the dead movies and considered the black sheep of the "dead" series. I heard about this film from none other than James Rolfe from cinemassacre. So last night, after seeing his review, I became determined to sit down and watch this film. I went on Netflix and immediately found it. Then the rest is history. I was in love. From the awesome zombie in the very beginning, I knew this would be an okay film. I love the setting, underground in a claustrophobic area filled not only with zombies, but with insane military characters. Now the zombies are spot on. From the sympathetic and heart jerking bub, to the bloody zombies in Dr Logan's lab, the zombies are just as good as ever. The characters are also well done. There is the heroine Sarah, who gets hit on by the other soldiers and some of the worst insults and death threats from Capt. Rhodes. She is a very good character. There are Rickles and Steel, some of Rhodes brain dead goons too. The other characters are okay too, but they are kinda generic and similar to other "dead" characters. There is John who would actually be a very good character, except that his Jamaican accent. It is really annoying and I can barely understand what he is saying. But the person that steals the movie is Capt. Rhodes. Allow me to demonstrate, "I just said I was willing to shoot ya if you didn't get back in your chair. You didn't get back in your chair." The guy is a total son of a gun. I mean he is a real mean guy. Joseph Pilato's performance is terrific and I think he should have gotten way more work and more mainstream attention. The other great character is Dr. Logan. He is crazy and weird, yet he always wants everyone to be "civil". His relationship with Bub the zombie is really sad and tragic and it is exactly the same as Frankenstein and I love it. Now I re watched dawn of the dead recently and I have to say, it was good. But still not as dark as day of the dead, and I like this movies darker tone. SOMEONE GET Joseph PILATO WORK HE IS A TERRIFIC ACTOR.

		<shortDescription>The greatest zombie film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead is an under-appreciated masterpiece. George Romero intended to make "the Gone with the Wind of zombie films" with this, and though the budget held him back from his original vision, I definitely feel he succeeded with that goal in terms of quality. Taking place an indeterminate time after Dawn of the Dead, the world seems to have been totally overrun by zombies. The first two films both primarily took place in a constrained area where the people inside tried to survive the zombies, in the first film that constrained area was a house, and in the second film a mall. Day of the Dead primarily takes place in another constrained area, an underground military base. Sarah, a doctor, is the only female at the base, and is only on good terms with a few other people there. The soldiers collect zombies for the lead doctor Logan's (nicknamed Frankenstein) experiments, and he attempts to domesticate a zombie he calls Bub. The unstable Captain Rhodes begins to get fed up with Logan's seemingly pointless experiments, and things soon take a turn for the worst. And when you're in a world filling with walking corpses that eat people, the worst is some serious stuff.What makes this film so great are its themes on society. It shows how such a small group of people will make the same decisions a large group of people will, good and bad. In a group of only 12 people, people divide themselves into different groups and take a strong attitude to those with a different view than themselves. The other aspect that makes this film so brilliant is Bub. It shows that zombies still have a memory of their former selves, and haven't totally transformed into mindless creatures. The acting is great all around, particularly Joe Pilato as Captain Rhodes. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day Of The Dead: First Came Night, The Dawn Now The Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead is the third movie in George Romero's Dead Trilogy (or as I like to call it: The Trilogy Of The Dead). Many of you have read my reviews of Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead and if you have you know how much I just love those movies, so Day of the Dead has a lot to live up to to me. And let me say this right away it lived up to it! Day of the Dead was much lighter on the zombie vs human action but it made it up with human vs human drama, great drama at that. But I'm getting ahead of myself, the plot is that the Dawn is over now its time for the day, humans are outnumbered by 400,000 to 1 a small group of survivors live underground. Now that that's out of the way as I said the drama and writing in this movie is an improvement from the first two. The dialogue is still like George Romero's; being realistic , witty, and entertaining to watch. The characters in this one however, were much more miserable and dark. The main protagonists were good you root for them and relate to them, but they are pushed aside by three other characters Bub, Dr. Frankenstein, and Rhodes. These three characters are in no way at all alike and in no way at all people you want to relate to. Let me start with doctor Frankenstein: Frankenstein is a scientist who has to conduct studies on the zombies to determine if they can be domesticated, he is the pivitol mad scientist, he has good intentions but is driven mad by it, he is a joy to watch. Second charterer I want to talk about is Bub. Bub is a zombie that's being trained by Dr. Frankenstein, the performance given by Sherman Howard is pretty incredible, and not just for a zombie! he brings across the instinct of a zombie but at the same time you can see the learned intelligence and traits, he is a very dynamic character who changes throughout the movie, its great. And the last character I want to talk about is Rhodes; this guy is a jerk, one of the worst human beings you can ever meet. Joe Pilato gave a great performance in this role, he's angry, intense, paranoid and all around one of the best "bad guys" in movies. A big factor in this movie is its setting being underground without contact, you can truly feel the paranoia that is affecting the characters, making everyone become irritable, angry and afraid. This is where the fear comes from in the movie, not so much of the zombies but the fact that you're trapped with nowhere to go. That being said the zombies are still pretty scary! The makeup has really improved from 1978 with Dawn of the Dead, it looks incredible and is probably my favorite interpretation of the zombie "look", gore effects are incredible too with two ills that are really good, I wont tell you them but if you watch the movie chances are you'll know what ones I'm talking about. One of my favorite parts of the movie is when our protagonist enter the cave. It becomes full of red and blue light and gives it a 1950s pre code horror feel, something Romero has had experience with in Creepshow. As with the first two movies the music changes but still fits with the movie. Night had a 50s horror feel, Dawn had a much more fun but still unsettling sound to it, when day came along its music was much more ominous, dark and tells the audience that "everything is lost". Day of the Dead. How does it stand after this many years and up to its predecessors? Very good, great actually! It has great writing, good music, make up was an improvement, memorable characters, and much much more with this movie. Day of the Dead completes one of the most perfect movie trilogies with a near perfect finally. Keeping in line with the rest of the Trilogy of the Dead, Day of the Dead gets a 9.5. I advise everyone to check it out, it's one Netflix and needs some more recognition other than "cult classic". "First there was "Night of the Living Dead" then "Dawn of the Dead" and now the darkest day of horror the world has ever known"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the outset, the film is typically George A Romero broody, instantly making clear that the protagonists are in grave danger, looking upon a neo-holocaustic Zombie infested ( though you don't see this, immediately ) world, I personally would have put Day of The Dead as easily my favourite, I know people say its all talking in a bunker, its called atmospheric... but stellar performances from Joe Pilato, Terry Alexander, G Howard Klar and especially Howard Sherman as Bub, the zombie, puts it easily at the top imo, and there is no accidental comedy neither.... its a must watch, if not just for the real GaR fans, who appreciate a decent story with their gory....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are all people zombies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't tell you the story, as many before me did that.The only thing I like to add is that I didn't particularly like this movie. The sets are fine, the special effects quite convincing. There is no lack of gore or blood. But the acting is a bit stiff, but adequate. No there are two aspects of this movie which left me empty handed, so to speak.First of all the plot. There is no way you can predict the ending of the movie. That is not because they came up with something brilliant. No the movie just abruptly ends on a coconut island. Far away from the zombies. There is however no big finale leading to this end, so it actually makes no sense.What bothered me most about this movie however is the lack of a likable person. The zombies are bad to the bone, but so are all human characters, whether they belong to the medical staff or the military. There is no person to sympathize with and that is killing the movie. You just watch all the horrors passing by without emotion. You are not involved in the story and you actually don't care what happens to all these people. Their characters are disagreeable and you feel no compassion at all, which makes this movie too far from reality and too far from humanity to fully enjoy. In NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD you could identify with most of the characters, in this movie you can not. That is why I rate it 6 out of 10, which is a shame, for it is a well crafted horror movie indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enormously Graphic, But A Letdown For Other Reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third and, for twenty years, the final film in George Romero's "Dead" series, DAY OF THE DEAD was probably the least successful of the original three films in the series that began with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD in 1968, and continued into DAWN OF THE DEAD in 1978. Some of this had to do with the ambitious plot that Romero had in mind in trying to train certain zombies to become more domesticated, a story that not only would have required a substantial budget but also would have required that he could guarantee an 'R' rating for the film before the budget would be set (of course, no such guarantee could be made, at least not here). But a more basic problem is that Romero made the mistake that so many other horror filmmakers fall into and that he should have avoided: he didn't (pardon the pun) "flesh out" his characters as much as he had done before.In DAY OF THE DEAD, the zombies now occupy every square inch of America, if not the world. All that seems to remain of humanity has now gone into an underground bunker outside of Fort Meyers, Florida; and what we see of it is not particularly comforting. On one side, there's a half-mad scientist (Richard Liberty) conducting experiments on various zombies, including a promising "specimen" (Howard Sherman), in order to train them not to chomp on people, and being loosely supported by his rational colleagues (Lori Cardille; John Amplas; Jarlath Conroy). And on the other side, there's the foul-mouthed military guys led by a screaming maniac (Joe Pilato) who are intent on destroying Liberty's experiments and leaving the bunker, even though humanity is outnumbered 400,000 to 1. They see their chance when they find out that Liberty has conducted some of his extremely gruesome experiments on some of their men, and they kill both Liberty and Amplas. But of course it doesn't get them anywhere, and it leads to the enormously graphic and ultra-gory climax, courtesy of Tom Savini's special make-up effects and prosthetics. Pilato's demise, hastened by Sherman's zombie shooting him, is particularly wrenching to watch, but richly deserved.There are a number of things about DAY OF THE DEAD that work quite well. The initial scenes set in a deserted Fort Meyers have the feel of the opening sequence of THE OMEGA MAN and of much of NIGHT OF THE COMET. And the sequences of Sherman's zombie reading Stephen King's book "Salem's Lot" and listening to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony have a really good resonance to them. What I felt bought this film down, however, was Romero's penchant for allowing Pilato and the other actors playing the military guys to wildly overact and with a lot of rather idiotic profanity thrown in; it was very headache-inducing because it went on for far too long. The thing that saved this film from going below the "6" rating I gave it, besides the aforementioned end of the world imagery and Sherman's performance, was, of course, Savini's make-up and prosthetics genius, even though these sequences are all quite stomach-turning even by 21st century standards.Romero would turn to other horror subject matter (MONKEY SHINES; THE DARK HALF) before returning to the zombie sub-genre in 2005's LAND OF THE DEAD, but DAY is where he just may have run out of gas as a director. The film nevertheless still holds up for artistic and photographic reasons, even with all its flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely graphic, but a well made movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being the third in the series of the "of the dead" series from George Romero, it's not surprising that to me, it's the worst one out of all of them, but it's still good. I absolutely loved Dawn of the Dead, so comparing this to that, it didn't par up at all. Not as much action, not as much humor, and way more gore. I like it most of the time (I'm not a gore hound) but this went way overboard. It was kind of sickening to look at. I would give this movie a lower score if I was comparing it to the others completely, but I'm reviewing it as its own movie. There's not too much action, so if you're looking for that, stay away. The zombies look as great as they ever have, the situation is better, everything just has a great end-of-the-world atmosphere to it. It's mostly believable and it works on all levels. The complaints I had earlier are why I'm giving it a 7. It's a well made movie, but it didn't get a place in my heart like Dawn of the Dead did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant film and a seminar on special make-up effects rolled into one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any serious zombie-phile will tell you that Dawn Of The Dead is the best walking dead film the genre has ever spawned. I'm not here to refute that claim, but at the risk of blaspheming the church of the undead, if we're really assessing the merits of each of George Romero's legendary offerings, we might have to be honest and admit that Day Of The Dead is the most successfully realized film on Romero's resume.This is a tricky conclusion for me to draw, especially since Dawn Of The Dead ranks very high on my personal best list. Certainly, adding in factors like sentimental value and viewing frequency, I don't hesitate to say that I love Dawn more than its troubled follow-up. However, by stripping away the camp elements and setting the feast within a claustrophobic underground silo, Romero amps up the pure horror angle in Day, and while there is still plenty of commentary condemning the society of the living, it is presented in a subtle way that naturally augments the plot instead of driving it.I'm aware that I have to tread carefully here, because that last paragraph could almost be construed as a mild criticism of Dawn. That is certainly not my intention, and I would like to state for the record that I view Dawn as a uniformly perfect film, and though I have yet to pen a review of it, I can assure you that it would undoubtedly get a "10" from me.Perhaps it's the tone of Day that merits the rather audacious claim I made in the opening paragraph. While Dawn peppered the still-unsurpassed set-pieces of Tom Savini wet-work with humorous interludes that lent a much-needed respite from the increasingly hopeless situation we follow our troubled survivors through, Day Of The Dead doesn't offer any breathing room. Rather, the aura of pinned helplessness that comes to such brilliant life within the film's subterranean silo is sustained throughout the film unabated, and we follow our characters as they traverse through a spiral of inhumanity and desperation, finally leaving them on a doomed paradise where they have escaped from the crumbling world around them to live out the rest of their lives in seclusion and ponder the failure of the human race.If there isn't any comic relief to be had, it's not because the cast of largely unknown actors don't do their best to ham it up. Joe Pilato nearly steals the show as the sadistic but pathetic Rhodes, whose Napoleon complex ultimately leads his men to their delicious ends. Most of Pilato's dialogue is priceless, but even as admittedly silly as things get at times, the entire ensemble plays out their tragedy in an ultimately realistic and believable mode. Humans are stupid, as we've already essayed in Night Of The Living Dead and Dawn, and the ridiculous squabblings we see happening here are right on the mark as they essay the deterioration of the psyches of these unlucky survivors whose fear and isolation reduce them to a level below the humanity they're struggling to rebuild.The idea of an "intelligent" zombie could be downright ridiculous in the wrong hands, but Day's "Bub" is perhaps the genre's most memorable and endearing creation. Bob Sherman's nuanced performance is a high-point in a film full of them, and while the scenario could have easily been mined for camp gold, the wisened and thoughtful portrayal here is a perfect fit in a movie that sincerely asks you to take a zombie apocalypse seriously.Of course, we can't review Day Of The Dead without mentioning Tom Savini's masterfully rendered effects, which find the maestro outdoing anything we had seen from him before, or have since. While Day features significantly fewer feasting scenes than we were privy to in the more epic Dawn, Savini uses every bit of zombie mayhem as a chance to dig deep into his make-up kit and up the gross-out ante to levels previously unattained. Savini's attention to detail is so thorough that it's almost disturbing, and while I can't admit to ever seeing someone's guts slide out of their stomach to the floor in real life, I'm fairly positive that it would look exactly like it does when we see it in Day. The effects build in intensity throughout the film, culminating in a ludicrously disgusting series of grand guignol come-uppances for Rhodes and his villainous lot. I would highly recommend that fans of this film seek out a video called Scream Greats Volume One, in which Savini talks extensively about the effects he created for this film, and shares several priceless anecdotes about the realization of the unforgettable sights we see within. Savini had already proved himself as the unparalleled master before Day Of The Dead, but the smrg?sbord of delights on parade here ensures his statue in the lobby of horror's hall of fame.Yes, Day isn't as epic as George Romero had originally hoped for, and in many senses, its relative simplicity makes it more akin to Night Of The Living Dead than Dawn. But the fact that Romero made such a masterpiece out of a troubled production only makes this film that much more special. What could have been a mess is instead a damn strong statement, and a worthy successor to a film as definitive as Dawn Of The Dead. For that alone, we have to consider Day an unequivocal success.Those who shun this as a sub-par sequel should really take a fresh look. You may be surprised at what you discover.</fullReview>

I wasn't so sure if was going to be any good at first but when I watched it, I couldn't believe I haven't watched it before! It has been said to be the weakest but I think it's underrated. If you liked Dawn Of The Dead, you are in for a treat!

		<shortDescription>The Dead Have Won</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero, the legendary director of Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, brings us another entry into his "Dead" series. Armed by amazing gore effects by Tom Savini, Romero makes another fantastic zombie film. Romero never fails to entertain.The humans have lost the war (as another reviewer once wrote) and now the dead have taken the world. A group of scientists and soldiers hide in an underground mining facility to find a solution to the zombies that exists above. Not all goes as planned...Romero has created one of the favorite genres of movie-going audiences, the zombie apocalypse. This time the zombies aren't black and white, they aren't blue, they actually look like the walking dead! The gore was very realistic and I applaud Tom Savini for this.I personally feel like Dawn of the Dead is the best of the Romero zombie films, this one wasn't bad, but it wasn't the as good as the first two, it was better than Land of the Dead (which wasn't bad either). Day of the Dead just wasn't as good as the previous films in the series.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A severely underrated zombie masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily the best 'DEAD' installment behind Night Of The Living Dead. Suspenseful, thought provoking, and disturbing. It's really sad that it's as underrated as it is, being bashed and unfairly labeled as the black sheep. It deserves much more recognition and praise than it already has, given the outstanding quality of the film. I'm shocked that the overrated Dawn gains more notoriety. The mood of Day is sinister and the atmosphere is unsettling and claustrophobic. There's also a strong sense of dread and hatred throughout. Without a doubt Romero's darkest piece of work (both literally and figuratively).The character development here is top notch. Strong, literate, and fairly unidealistic. Probably the best in the series! We have the stern and determined female protagonist (Lori Cardille), the cruel authoritative military captain (Joseph Pilato), the goodhearted pacifist helicopter pilot (Terry Alexander), and the nutcase scientist who means well, but is devoid of any real logic. As we've all come to know, character development seems to come last or not at all in a good majority of horror movies. The cast gives great performances. The actors who play the soldiers led by the captain all come off as barbaric and deranged, and it was cool to see John Amplas ('Martin') back again in a supporting role. The two stand out performances though are by the wonderful Richard Liberty as Dr. Logan (who the soldiers refer to as "Frankenstein"), and Howard Sherman as Bub, the warm and sympahetic zombie he tries to domesticate. The sequences between Logan and Bub are terrific and add a whole new level of pathos to the movie. The socio-political subtext is probably the best thing about the movie. It's a subtle, believable, hard-boiled reflection of the real-world tension between science and the military. Next to Night Of The Living Dead, it's the most powerful in the series. Dawn, Land, and Diary's subtexts are very weak in comparison.Day Of The Dead is not only one of Romero's finest pieces of work, it also stands at the forefront of zombie flicks and, all around, is one of the best horror movies from the 80's. It holds up extremely well today, far better than the woefully dated (though still enjoyable) Dawn Of The Dead.</fullReview>

It's a really interesting conflict. every character had his own point of view. Some of them were depressed, some of them just didn't care about nothing and so on. It's a really interesting movie. The murder scenes looked very realistic and the zombies looked much creepier than in Dawn of the Dead. The acting was really great.

		<shortDescription>10/10; a masterpiece; one of the finest American films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romero is a film-making Maestro, a man capable of taking whatever budget and means are handed to him and producing a masterful work that shines in nearly every area. "DAY OF THE DEAD" has a tight script, a minimal score that adds to the suspense with a pumping bass line and keyboard, decent acting from a cast of unknowns, top-notch editing and effects and a vicious story that is more or less the final say on the themes explored in the previous installments. Romero's movies are all about the fragility and artificiality of society, with the zombies representing mankind's true nature and the survivors about to descend into zombie-like chaos themselves. The soap opera takes center stage this time, with a host of well-drawn characters, each with differing ideas and none with a real plan; viewers itching for action will have to sit tight while Romero lets his parable play out (please ignore the mental inferiors on this site who claim these scenes are boring; in dying civilizations, attention spans are the first thing to go).A lesser director would keep the gore consistent throughout the film, which would quickly become monotonous. Romero will do no such thing. He is the Mr. Miyagi of horror directors, carefully doling out samples of gore here and there when he feels you've earned it and finally rewarding your patience at the very end with the rawest, sickest bloodbath imaginable and surely the highlight of the great effects artist Tom Savini's career; I've never seen anything else like it (by the way, it's a testament to Romero's brilliance that he keeps developing his characters even as they're DYING; we learn which ones panic and which ones calmly accept their their fate). It is an operatic *aria* of gore and suspense, and we can only hope this trilogy remains preserved in a vault somewhere so that future civilizations can appreciate it after the zombies take over. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The third film in the dead the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Romero's favorite dead film. He did not get the budget he wanted so he feels he did not do the film he wanted.Though Day of the dead is still a great zombie film. This one take's place in a underground bunker.Sherman Howard gave the best zombie performance to date as Bub a zombie being used as a lab rat by Dr. Logan. Bub the zombie displays intelligence and makes this film stand out from it's two predecssors. I do not want to give too much away, but if your a fan of the zombie genre you should buy this film. Romero once again proves he can do more than one zombie movie and keep it fresh. From the start of the film when you see that "civilazation" has been overwrought by zombies to the film's climax when the zombie's invade the bunker this film is definitely captivating. And I should add the late Richard Liberty who starred in Martin as well as Day give's a stellar performance as Dr. Logan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and bleak picture for mankind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead is usually considered the weakest of the first three Romero Living Dead films. I can understand this. The story feels like it moves very slowly, there's not as much tension, and the characters are largely unlikable, or unintelligible. However, this is the goal of the horror in this story. Yes, they are largely safe, but they aren't getting anywhere, and they know that eventually they will die. Thus, their only hope is to find a cure.This is the darkest and saddest of the original Living Dead movies, but there are a few serious weaknesses. Notably, the sound is poor, and it is difficult to understand some of the thicker accents. The poor balance of the level makes it difficult to deal with extremely loud and quiet sections.Not to say that it isn't worth seeing. It's worth seeing enough times to understand how bleak the situation gets.Update to my review:After watching Day of the Dead on blu-ray, with the sound cleaned up a bit, the movie improves a whole lot. It's made much more clear how much despair is going around, and the hokey dialogue is made much more forgivable by the high tensions. It might be to the film's benefit to include some sense of time frame. From what I can tell, this takes place years and years from the time that Night and Dawn took place. This makes a big difference in how we view their behavior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine your one of the few people who survive the earth getting infested by zombies. Now your stuck in a military bunker with less than a dozen other people and your experimenting on the walking dead.Somehow in the middle of all of this the humans still find a way to end up in two opposing camps. Romero may be trying to capture the human factor of the original Night of the living dead but here it only seems to get in the way of an otherwise great zombie fest.The makeup is first rate and the gore is delectable but in my opinion this may be the weakest of the four Romero zombie movies.None the less this is required viewing for any horror fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad end to a great series--UPDATED 12-9-04</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First came Night of the Living Dead, then Dawn of the Dead..Now the darkest day of horror the world has ever known... It was the darkest day for this legendary series... While boasting without a doubt the best FX in the series, Day lost out where the other two succeeded...Story and characters. Did anyone really care when any of the army men died? Or when Miguel got bitten? I didn't, and no one else did either....While Night and Dawn had just so-so effects (orange blood in Dawn?), the stories were great....George, I know there has to be one more story to be told in this series....please find it and make it... Don't let the sun go down on this DayYou know what, at the time, I stood by this review. But, with the new feature the IMDb is offering, I can finally come back to this and say...I was wrong. "Day of the Dead" is a great film..it just took awhile to get what George was driving at. This film is a scathing look at how isolation and claustrophobia can cause people to snap under the weight of the developing situation. Brilliant look at human emotion under great strain. While not "Dawn of the Dead", "Day" succeeds on a deeper darker level. Good film after all, and more than well worth a watch.3 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*May Contain Minor SPOILERS*This film is the third and final (as of today) installment in George A. Romero's infamous `Dead' trilogy. With all due respect to `Night of the Living Dead' and the brilliant `Dawn of the Dead', this is my favorite film in the series. It might even be the best film of the zombie genre. It would certainly rank as the most underrated.Released in 1985, this was the culmination of carnage. Most of the world had been ravaged by the dead, and the few survivors have gone underground to devise a survival strategy. It's never clear whether or not there are any other survivors left on the planet aside from the cast of this movie, which helps add an atmosphere of uncertainty. The mood is very grim and depressing, which is one of the factors that led to an abbreviated theatrical run. Most people chose to watch `Return of the Living Dead' instead, because it was more of a dark comedy and didn't take itself seriously. But this aura of hopelessness was what Romero wanted. In `Night', he wanted a movie that would shock audiences. In `Dawn', he wanted to make some strong social commentary. I mean c'mon, would you be ecstatic to have zombies as YOUR neighbors?The movie stars (among others) Linda Cardille, Joe Pilato and, in an unforgettable performance, Richard Liberty as Dr. `Frankenstein'. It takes place inside of an underground facility in Florida, where a group of civilians, scientists, and soldiers try to find a solution to the zombie plague above. Most of the actors turn in very strong performances and really make the film seem real. The only quarrel that I have is that the military men seem a little mentally unstable, but perhaps this was intentional given their surroundings. Cardille's character Sarah seems to be the voice of reason among the group, but she has a difficult time convincing Captain Rhodes (Pilato) that their research is producing any quality results. Their words soon escalate to violence and a war brews, not between the surviving humans and the undead, but between the living themselves.In typical Romero fashion, this film contains some great dialogue, particularly the scene when Sarah is in `The Ritz' with John and McDermott. There is gore galore, which should please any hardcore zombie movie fan. Trust me this film is not for the faint of heart. I'm giving this movie an 8/10. It's not perfect, but it's darn close. I kind of wish Romero could have made the film as he originally intended (buy the special edition DVD and you'll know what I'm talking about). Hopefully the rumors that there is going to be a fourth film in this series are true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm biased, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...I still enjoy a romp with Romero's trilogy-capper at least once a year. Why am I biased? Well, I'm a horror movie buff for one, and second, I had the good fortune to play several zombie extras in this film. Still, I'm also a generalist film fan, and although much underrated, "Day of the Dead" is worthy addition to the Romero zombie mythos and a well-crafted film in its own right.Rather than dissect the film one more time, I'd like to take a moment to praise the recent DVD reissue: it kicks! This is the best edition of the 1985 gut-muncher I've ever seen, better even than the original theatrical release, which I saw premiere several times, including its Pittsburgh opening with scores of zombies in attendance. The DVD features a fine interview/making-of documentary as well as a tasty commentary track with Romero, make-up wizard Tom Savini, producer Cletus Anderson, and lead actress Lori Cardille. Also included are a behind-the-scenes reminisce from Savini &amp; Co., and another commentary track by director Roger "I am not Quentin Tarantino" Avary, along with the usual DVD gobbets of stills, trailers and the like. Anchor Bay has very classily repackaged this film and is to be commended.The Romero zombie mythos has fascinated me since I first saw "Night of the Living Dead" at college back in the (very) early 70's. "Dawn of the Dead" (1979)* was an absolute revelation and gave me deliciously creepy nightmares for weeks after first seeing it. By the time "Day of the Dead" was released, I wasn't quite as impressionable, but the intelligent, somewhat talky script expanded upon Romero's cynical view of humanity in a way that complemented my continued fascination with extreme special effects, which Savini delivered with affectionate relish. The acting is mostly good to very good (and, no, I never had a problem with Joe Pilato's vein-popping high dudgeon; given the situation his character is in, I would have been chewing the scenery as well). The only true disappointment I have with "Day of the Dead" is that it wasn't the full vision that Romero first intended. Perhaps he will have the opportunity to lay the dead to rest someday, hopefully before he joins them himself.*Please note: although the IMDb credits the film as a 1978 release, it was not actually released in the U.S. until Spring of 1979, which is why I so label it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST HORROR MOVIE EVER MADE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead is the best horror film ever in my opinion. It has everything a horror fan could want. It's claustraphobic, it's scary, it's depressing and it's gruesome.I seriously doubt that zombies will really rise from the grave in real life but if they did then I am sure that this film is the most realistic if such an event were to happen.(BIG SPOILERS AHEAD-DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM) In the film, the military and the scientists are at each others throats. Everyone is apprehensive in the film and you're on the edge of your seat just wondering what fate each character will suffer. It's a truly disturbing film because the zombies have taken over the world. Not just a town, not just a city but the whole world. The characters are trapped underground with low stocks of food and weapons and time is running out.The great thing about this movie is the fact that the good guys are hopelessly outnumbered. Unlike most horror films where the good guys are equipped with all the weapons they need, these guys are not. There just doesn't seem to be a way out for these characters. This is the scariest film in George A. Romero's horror trilogy. In the first film-Night of the Living Dead-the zombies only seem to have taken over a small town. In the second film-Dawn of the Dead-the zombies seem to have only taken over a shopping mall and a few cities. But in this film the living dead have taken over the whole world. (END OF SPOILERS)This is a truly great movie which doesn't get the respect it deserves. I strongly urge any serious horror fan to purchase it and watch a film that truly lives up to it's hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing compared to Dawn of The Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of The Dead is the third of the series...fourth if you consider Lucio Fulci's Zombie, which was supposedly an answer to Dawn of The Dead. But since I haven't seen Zombie, I can't compare Day of The Dead to Zombie to know what is the best episode coming after Dawn of The Dead...Day of The Dead gives explanations and shows some experiments on zombies. They tried to give an intelligent story to a zombie movie. I like movies with good stories and scenarios, but a zombie film's main element shall not be the script. Day of The Dead sure has good gore effects, but not enough of them. The movie's length is 104 minutes, and approximately 70 of them are nothing but talking. Talking is a good thing...when it has a point, but in Day of The Dead, it doesn't really have one. Dawn of The Dead had attaching characters, surprising plot twists, interesting gore effects, a fun and SO entertaining atmosphere. Day of The Dead has nothing of that, except maybe for the gore effects, that are pretty improved. The actors are good, that's true, but their characters are hollow...there is no atmosphere or mood, too much pointless talking, and finally it doesn't really move, overall. It seems like they made this film only to make money, because they could be sure they would have...because Dawn of The Dead was the best zombie film ever made (along with Braindead and Bad Taste). Not SO bad, but watch Dawn instead, this one isn't impressive at all...I give it 5/10, and this is generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine over-criticized sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such an underrated movie. Romero's third ?Dead' film has always lived in the shadow of the first two ?Dead' films. While there are many parts of ?Night of the Living Dead' and ?Dawn of the Dead' that are superior, ?Day' still holds its own and has some improvements over the first two. I'm not saying its better; its just not nearly as weak as horror fans have made it out to be.The Acting- People have complained about the over the top acting in the film, but honestly, what ?Dead' film has great acting? They all have pretty much community theater acting in them. Its not like the leads in ?Dawn' were Hopkins, Pacino, and Streep. ?Day' just has the same scenery chewing we've seen in the other ?Dead' film (and most horror films for that matter). Atmosphere- the setting of the underground bunker is far more frightening than the house or mall in the other films, it is a great step forward in the series, very creepy. The makeup- Gone are the painted gray and green, K Mart bargain Halloween makeup of ?Dawn'. The zombies are in ?Day' far more unique and disgusting. Overall all the makeup fx are leaps and bounds better than the other films. The Plot is well structured giving a nice introduction and setting up the tense situation. Many have complained that the ending is abrupt, but its hard to say just what people think they are missing, those who survive, survive, and its pretty clear they are, any further action at that point would be exaggerating the escape. As far as Bub goes, he is the thing many zombie film lover hate, and that is a ?thinking' zombie. There is that sect of horror fans who just want stupid, vacant, zombies incapable of speech or the ability to use tools, but Romero clearly has a purpose with ?Day's zombies, taking the mythology further. And one can only imagine it helping in a fourth ?Dead' film, a plague of thinking zombies, more formidable than the ones in previous films. You cant just repeat yourself, you have to cover new ground, and, regardless of what its detractors say, Romero did that task well in ?Day of the Dead'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just plain creepy as all get-out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Again I consign myself to a minority (I've done so before by arguing that *Jaws 3-D* is the worst of that franchise, and *Superman III* the worst super-hero film ever made) by saying that I find this film to be the creepiest of the three *Dead* movies. *Night of the Living Dead* is great (upon first viewing) because the audience is caught up in the confusion of wondering just what the hell is going on; *Dawn* is great because of its satiric jabs at the bourgeoisie. But *Day of the Dead* is horrific because we know just what's coming.Leonard Maltin dismisses the first hour of the movie as being overly-talky, but this hour is not a wasteful exercise in plot exposition as much as it is a means to building up a nearly-fatal backlog of suspense. We all know the point will finally arrive when the zombies will burst in and gnaw on our hapless human protagonists; and when it does, it is a god-awful, terrifying spectacle.The "shoddy production values" of this film make it all the more creepy. It's true that the characters look like refugees from a mid-70s cop drama, but that flaw is strangely appropriate. These are characters who are essentially trapped in a world where time has ceased to exist, and their reactions to their imprisonment are unsettling.All in all: *Day of the Dead* is a great film, far and away the most suspenseful of the three.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deep zombie flick? Well, not really deep, but it has its moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always had an appreciation for a good zombie movie. Day of the Dead, the third of George A. Romero's 'Dead' trilogy, is possibly the best I've ever seen. This film is more than just a bunch of scared humans running from and getting eaten by the living dead. There's a real power struggle here ? and, strangely, it has nothing to do with the dead. This is a masterful horror film. Although I didn't find it terrifying in the least, it does what it sets out to do: show the plight of a bunch of randomly congregated humans trying their best to stay alive. It provides this and so much more. Here we're given more than just a need to stay away from the zombies: we're given complete and utter desperation.With Night of the Living Dead, George A. Romero proved that, with a small budget and lack of great special effects, it was possible to create a truly great horror film. Dawn of the Dead, my least favorite of the three, continued the story. So after the night and the dawn, it is day. The setting of most of Day of the Dead is underground, where a small group of people have created a refuge from the hungry, walking dead. They have a commander, who has just been killed. A power hungry, angry tyrant takes over, declaring himself the ruler of the small group. This guy is completely ruthless and unconcerned with the importance of survival for everyone. Sarah, a very strong woman, constantly challenges this self-made dictator, causing him to become angry with her and her friends. This includes John, a pilot who has a helicopter. There is a scientist who they call Frankenstein. Frankenstein mostly stays in his makeshift lab, experimenting on dead zombies. He has figured out a way to somewhat tame them and make them almost like pets. His "star pupil" is Bub, a very calm and intelligent zombie who plays a large role in the climax of the film. All the while, the refuge is protected by a sturdy fence. Thousands of zombies have lined up, just waiting to feed on human flesh.Day of the Dead is probably the least gory zombie movie I've seen. There is a little bit of blood and zombie guts in the beginning, but the majority of the first half is fairly tame. Even the end ? which consists of a bit of a showdown ? is tame compared to most films like it. The majority of this film doesn't even revolve directly around the zombies. We're shown quite a bit of characterization of the group of people and we watch the power struggle between them. This shows how crisis can result in the complete breakdown of society and democracy. This provides more intrigue than the creatures themselves.The acting in low budget zombie movies has never been the strongest. The case is the same here, though the actors hold their own much more than in 'Night' and 'Dawn.' Here we're given some very diverse characters, though, which makes for some good variety. However, my favorite character in Day of the Dead was probably Bub, the nonviolent, somewhat intelligent zombie. This is a great, important character in the film. It shows another side of the zombies ? maybe they're not all evil? Maybe they really can be conditioned to behave? Whatever the case may be, Bub has joined the ranks as one of my favorite horror characters.Zombie movies typically aren't for everyone. This may be an exception, though. Until the end, there's no real gross-out, exploitation of guts scenes. This is truly a film about the human self and how differently people react to crisis. The crisis here, of course, is zombie takeover. It is entertaining throughout, decently acted, and well executed. Day of the Dead is my favorite Romero film so far, and probably one of my favorite horror films of all time.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Better Zombie Flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that I'll have to agree with Romero and say that this is one of my favorite zombie films that I've seen. Unlike other zombie flicks like 28 Days, Return of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead, this movie effectively does a fantastic and almost perfect job of zombie character development. This was a great prelude to Land of the Dead, because it shows how the zombies started to learn and develop basic and primitive thinking skills. Essentially this movie is about a group of scientists and soldiers locked up in a missile silo trying to find a cure for the infection. What makes this zombie flick different from others before it was the excessive amount of gore that was used, pretty good acting and the set design for a post-apocalyptic world was amazing, with such a low budget. This movie also had a great undertone that was very similar to the recent movie The Mist. This movie also shows the progression of the zombies as well through clever makeup.The acting was very well done, though not the best, it still was a great performances on both ends. Though I think the credit for the best performance in this movie would be Sherman Howard, who played the "test" zombie Bub, who is captured by the scientist to study and to teach him to talk and listen to music. A great and almost misunderstood performance would be Richard Liberty, who plays Prof. Logan, the "father" figure and chief scientist working on Bub. His performance was outstanding next to Howard. There were also great performances by Joseph Pilatro (Rhodes), Lori Cardille (Sarah), Terry Alexander (John) and Jarlath Conroy (William). Their acing and fantastic performance gave this movie a more real and scary atmosphere; if not for their acting, then this movie would have nothing for it.The set design and make-up in this movie was amazing. Though, coming from Tom Savini, it's very expected to have great work. What I enjoyed about the make-up was that Romero and Savini showed how the zombies become more and more "rotting" as time passes on. What was once regular faces (Night), turned to gray dead faces (Dawn) are now green and peeling off. Though in the opening scene, this movie really tapped into the severity of the zombie outbreak by showing scenes and overhead shots of a city that is completely abandoned and dead, and just to see that, for it's time, was a wonder. It gave the illusion of "loneliness" and it delivered it well.The blood and gore was excessive, to say the least. There was a lot of blood in Dawn and Land, but when you look at this one, the blood comes out almost like a waterfall and squirts out like a fountain. Romero doesn't forgive when he shows how hungry or how vicious theses zombies are, he shows, near the end of the film, the zombies eating, chewing, clawing, fighting, tearing and slurping up body parts and blood. This movie does not forgive people when it comes to zombie chow downs; it truly shows the nature of these vicious creatures. When somebody gets slashed or amputated the blood that comes out is almost too excessive and too watery that it works! Though curiously enough, this movie does not tap into the notion that once your bit by a zombie, you turn into one. This one implies that if you cut off the effected area and cauterize it, you'll be fine.This movie is like the 80's version of The Mist when it comes to its central theme. When viewing this movie you become part of the isolated group of people, and you get to see how each one progressively changes throughout the course of the infection and you start to worry; the people inside and barricaded are more violent and "loose" than the zombies. This movie plays on the theme that humanity is a greater threat to itself than any other outside threat. This film, like Lord of the Flies, makes its character separate into three different sects; The Military, who wants to kill all the zombies, The Scientists who want to study the zombies for medical purposes and The Civilians that want to survive this whole thing. The different views of each sect cause the cliques to war against each other, ultimately showing how man can be easily thrown back into its primitive stage.I will highly recommend this movie to any hard-core horror fan or any beginning horror fan because it shows a lot about the horror genre, and is a prime example of great film-making and character development. To those who enjoy zombie flicks or Romero, if you haven't seen it yet, then you really must make this top priority. However, to the younger horror audience, you may want to hold out on this movie because of the gore and zombie attacks. But I enjoyed this film so much, its probably the best zombie flick that I've seen since Night of the Living Dead and really at the end of the day and of the movie, you have to shed a tear for Bud, after he lost the only father he really had.</fullReview>

That and the fact that people don't like that this movie was so different from Night and Dawn. Romero has even said that this is his favorite entry in the "Dead" series. This movie has taken the zombie invasion a step farther than Dawn and Night. Over all, I recommend this to fans of the first 2 "Dead" movies, its a change of pace but will not disappoint.

		<shortDescription>Often under-appreciated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's time to review an oldie but goodie. There is no denying that horror director George A. Romero is the king of all Zombie directors. Any zombie flick that has ever been made has directly stolen elements of Romero's films and implemented them into their own without even denying it. Romero is one of the few writer/directors who have put out Zombie flicks that people took seriously up until recently with "Resident Evil "(the movie) and "28 Days Later".While I can't say much about "28 Day Later" since I haven't seen it yet, I can definitely tell you that if you liked "Resident Evil" - even a little bit - you definitely need to check out Romero's zombie flicks. You will easily see the rip-offs directly from these movies in "Resident Evil"."Day of the Dead" is the 3rd in the trilogy that is "Night of the Living Dead", "Dawn of the Dead", and "Day of the Dead". Released in 1985, it has long since became a classic in the horror genre.In this third movie, the entire world is overrun by zombies. The cool thing about these flicks is that they take place in different settings. They aren't about the same characters or locations from their preceding films. Each movie visits different parts of the world to show that what is going on is really an epidemic.In "Day of the Dead", we are watching a group of military people and scientist locked inside an underground bunker trying to solve what exactly is causing the dead to walk and eat people. A loudmouth Army man thinks he is the one who should be in control. The pilot just wants to run off to an island and live it up. The leading lady tries to keep everything in order. The scientist believes the Zombies can be controlled. These characters feel that they may very well be the only people left on earth.This film has an ever-present claustrophobic feel to it. The people spend most of the movie down in the underground thing. Just knowing that the entire world above, as well as select parts of their base, is completely infested by the undead leaves the viewer with an uneasy feeling Overall, "Day of the Dead" is a great movie. I picked up the new two disc DVD and (thanks to Anchor Bay) it's stellar. The two discs are filled with features, such as Audio Commentary, Theatrical Trailers, TV Spots, featurettes, and the little booklet that comes with the DVD is designed like a notepad. It looks great.Like I said before Romero's "Dead" trilogy has been eaten alive by copycats, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The originals are most appreciated. I loved this movie and the rest of the series growing up, and I love it today. It's entertaining without resulting to being stupid. I still can't understand while Dawn of the Dead wasn't put out on DVD first. I would have rather checked it out first, but I will get it when it comes. This one is definitely worth checking out in the meantime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could such a great series of films end so badly??The strength of the two previous efforts was that as well as being creepy, they made some sort of comment on society. Night highlighted the way that humans tend to crack and fight between themselves when under pressure, and Dawn (one of my favourite films) had a nice line in anti-consumerism. Day, on the other hand, seems to be hitting on the same theme as Night but misses by a mile because most of the characters are portrayed as being pretty nasty/twisted/insane in the first place. There's no transition - we start with a bunch of losers, we end with a bunch of losers.Besides that, there's no atmosphere (mainly because of the drab shooting locations - just a bit of moody lighting would have helped immeasurably, even if it isn't very realistic). Oh, and the characters are mostly cliches (aggressive army commander who shouts a lot, trigger-happy redneck soldiers, scotch-drinking irishman, laid-back jamaican, and a mad professor who even has white frizzy hair!). The gore is fairly shocking but not nearly as much as in Dawn or even Night because the characters are almost uniformly unlikeable.What a pity. 3 out of 10 on a good day.</fullReview>

I considered it my least favorite of the lot (until Survival, maybe Diary too but I have a soft spot for that), but in retrospect I think I was a un-fair in some of the departments I criticized. The thing about Day of the Dead is that it tends to grow on the viewer looking to allow it to, especially as time goes on and the 1980's carry a different flavor than, say, in the late 90's. And I saw that the dialog came off weak (at least weak when compared to others), the characters didn't have the strength and need to really care about them like in 'Dawn' and 'Night', and the music just flat out stunk. Years later and many more repeat viewings around friends who loved the film, I grew to like it, and by now (this is many years later) I find that some sequences top even those in Dawn of the Dead. Marking it as still my least favorite of the 20th century 'Dead' films doesn't mean it's bad at all.Actually, there is a certain style and sense of humor that tends to somehow work better with more time given with the derangement and over-the-top methods amid the dark atmosphere- the "camp" of the series, or at least the cartoonish aspects, stay fresh as ever. And the zombies look magnificently, as Tom Savini creates a kind of masterpiece of make-up, alongside future notable make-up man Greg Nicotero. To say that the zombies are the real stars of the film (in particular the infant-like 'Bub', played in a very good performance by the actor) is almost an under-statement. When Romero brings it on, he does bring it on well, and does go for broke in topping his wild, outlandish, and shockingly funny climax in Dawn of the Dead. So, in other words, I do enjoy it more after seeing it a few more times over the years, and I definitely don't see it as a C- movie; far from it, it's actually, in its own camp-art way, a great achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misfire by Romero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin. With 'Night of the Living Dead' being my favorite horror film, I looked forward to seeing this film the second I heard about it. Oddly enough I saw it before I saw 'Dawn of the Dead'. The film looked like a 1970's television show. It came out the same year as 'Back to the Future' and 'Commando'. It should have been more visually apealling. Also, you would think Army soldiers would be more intelligent and not a bunch of foul-mouthed jerks who communicate by yelling. They should have used their intelligence a little bit more. Steele was quite annoying. But in my opinion the worst part of the film was Bub. He was everything the ghouls in Night and Dawn were not. Dr. Logan actually had some control over him, that is ridiculous. When Dr. Logan put his hand in Bub's mouth and Bub did not bite him I became quite disgusted with what George A. Romero was doing with this film. In 'Night' and 'Dawn' the ghouls could not be reasoned with or controlled. They felt no symphathy. They just wanted to kill and eat you. I found that scary and disturbing. Bub was no Bill Hienzman. I thought that Bub feeling sad for Dr. Logan and him (Bub) using a gun was a bit dumb. Also, those ghouls sure were strong, easily ripping people open and tearing them in half. But it was easily the goriest stuff I have ever seen in a movie. Some of the ghouls also looked a lot like lizards. I thought that was silly. Tom Savini is a real talent though, and was nice enough to send me and a friend his autograph. Overall though, It was not that bad a film. It is worth seeing. It just did not seem like It could be a sequel to 'Night of the Living Dead'. It did however seem like a sequel to 'Dawn of the Dead'. I feel it should have felt a little like 'Night'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an incredibly boring movie. The first hour is relentlessly talky. This would be OK if the characters were interesting, but they're not - they're a bunch of stereotypes. The acting is never very good, and the script is strangely bad considering the high-quality screenplay of Dawn. The story is boring, and the setting even more so. The Special FX deserve an award but I'm afraid that they're the only good thing about the film. Even the "comedy" character, Bub the Zombie, isn't funny. Utter rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Romero is the antichrist (warning, mild spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I'll ever understand the popularity Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead have enjoyed. They are awful, awful movies without a shred of entertainment value or intelligence of any kind. I've seen much better movies on MST3K. But for some reason everybody seems to think they're some kind of brilliant, genius horror movies with poignant insight into the human condition. I don't get it.Day of the Dead is better than Dawn, but only because it's shorter. Dawn is more than two unbearable hours, whereas Day is a much more tolerable ninety minutes. Thank God Romero didn't tack on another half hour with a random biker gang this time around. While it lasts, though, Day of the Dead is reprehensible--it's just terrible actors, some of them improvising Jamaican or Mexican or Irish accents, yelling nonsense at each other to the background accompaniment of awful techno thrown together at the last minute on a cheap keyboard. And then the zombies get in and the villain characters get ripped apart. End of movie.If anybody can explain the popularity of these movies to me, I'll be grateful. I consider it one of the most perplexing mysteries of the universe. Romero made what may be the best possible zombie film, Night of the Living Dead, but then apparently he got hit in the head or something and every subsequent movie he's made has been awful. Worse, he's got some kind of alien brainwashing ray to fool people into loving these unwatchable films. It's scarier than anything in his movies--isn't there anyone who can save the world from George Romero?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Characters &amp; Dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved this movie. I just want to get that out there right up front. This is the third in the George A. Romero zombie movie trilogy that began with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968), continued with DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978), and came to an end with DAY OF THE DEAD (1985). Each movie featured different characters in different situations, but all of them felt as though they told a continuing story within the same story world. NIGHT took place at the start of the zombie apocalypse. DAWN took place during and after the fall of civilization. DAY took place years after that. The progression worked and made perfect sense. Romero went on to make more zombie films, but they all seemed to be more contemporary, and, as such, felt like a different story world from his 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s zombie films. What I loved about DAY OF THE DEAD (1985) is the characters and the dialogue. "Sarah" (Lori Cardille) is the main character, a female lead in a time when that was fairly rare. The supporting characters of "John" (Terry Alexander) and "McDermott" (Jarlath Conroy) provide a lot of insight into the world. "John" has some very good lines regarding the zombie apocalypse. And, of course, "Captain Rhodes" (Joe Pilato) has many of the most entertaining lines of dialogue in the film, and as the antagonist, he really pushed the story forward with his actions and his dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies walk the earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the dead picks up years later where the world has been take over by the undead and the survivors are hiding out in a military bunk underneath the ground trying to find a cure.What set this apart from the other films is most of the scenes revolve around arguments on who is right or wrong when it comes to resources. The scientists are making progress with a zombie named Bubba and taming him like a pet to be more human like. The army led by Rhodes aren't seeing a lot if results and take risks to capture specimens.It seemed realistic how the atmosphere seemed tense, from and soon was looming on the horizon for either side at odds and ready to fight to the death if need be. The special effects have evolved to show decay and for instead of the silly blue faces. The sound track was amazing adding dread and fear in appropriate ques to the violence and mayhem unraveling.For a script that went through many rewrites involving classes, science experiments and bub's progress it turned out flowing well without any continuation errors.The ending was a great way to end an amazing series by finally having a relaxing happy ending on an island that will day become fielders green years before Romero would once again visit his fascinating world. It was simply the most gritty and best of the trilogy to cover a zombie apocalypse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this film and after multiple viewings, this is one of the best z movies ever created. I feel that this is an underrated Romero film and it deserves more recognition.The atmosphere in this flick is painful and dreadful; hopeless and horrendous. There was no element of hope. No matter what they do, there is cure as the remaining survivors were overrun. Creep factor is all right. I can't imagine myself in the survivors' position. I'd rather put a bullet in my head rather than living another day with the dead. I applaud the efforts of the production team for providing different types of zombies. The gore's fantastic and almost realistic. I praise George A Romero for giving us the Dead series. So far, this is the greatest among them all, IMO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great conclusion to the original series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forced into an underground bunker, a group of survivors fight off the tumultuous advances of their military controllers against their work with the ravenous zombies around them which soon grows chaotic when the creatures get loose in the facility.This one was a worthwhile and enjoyable effort to the series. What really helps this one is the continuation of the of the story lines here that are based on what was done elsewhere throughout the series and really follows up on a lot of those story lines. The extrapolation of the zombie curse into a worldwide plague that has forced the survivors below the surface into the bunkers where this one really gets a lot of mileage out of the cramped situation playing havoc with the teams down there and is such a logical scenario that it's wholly appropriate here. That carries into the actions here as there's the next step by studying and research the brings about the different experiments to determine and reverse the effects of zombisim, which runs for the majority of the time here dealing with the doctors' work and experiments which also comes with the biggest and most noteworthy aspects involving the domesticated zombie. Those are all quite enjoyable with the training as well as the reasoning behind the teachings is quite a logical move to keep the series going along nicely here while allowing for the film's best overall part in the unrelenting, full-on gore. This one truly delivers here on both zombies and humans where the zombies are dissected and carved up in order to obscure their experiments on while also being subjected to the usual bullet-splatter throughout their bodies while the humans are bitten into, dismembered, have their skin ripped off and are pulled to pieces and devoured in excruciatingly gruesome, graphic moments that are incredibly fun overall here. Combined with the usual over-the-top zombie make-up all featured in the thrilling action-packed final half of the zombies overrunning the facility in a spectacular series of action scenes that make-up the best features against the one lone detrimental and truly damaging flaw found here. The contentious relationships of everyone continually yelling and screaming at each other all throughout the first half is not only tough to watch trying to get into the story but also makes it nearly impossible to believe they were ever friendly and cordial to each other throughout their story, a crucial part of the storyline here. This here is what holds it back somewhat.Rated UR/NC-17: Extreme Graphic Violence and Extreme Graphic Language.</fullReview>

The 1990 remake of Night of the living dead is also better. The fourth living dead movie Land of the dead is also better. But still this is a great movie. It is very scary. It is one of the scariest movies from the 80's. This movie has a great story line, It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. This about people in a under ground army base they to survive a zombie outbreak. This is such a great horror film that 7.2 is underrating it. This movie is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weakest chapter of Romero's trilogy, but still a minor classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This final chapter in Romero's dead trilogy follows a logical progression and surmises that most of human society is now dead, a victim of the zombie plague. Only a few small pockets of survivors are alive - and the film concentrates on the actions of one of these groups. Once again the emphasis is on human confrontation, as well as the zombies, just like in the other two films. However this time the confrontation between the survivors makes up the brunt of the film, and indeed most of the running length consists of people shouting and arguing.Many people dislike this film and the general consensus is that it's the worst of Romero's zombie trilogy. This may be true, but it's still miles ahead of much modern fare and remains an engrossing, frightening and disturbing film. The SFX are again expertly crafted by Tom Savini, and are the best of the trilogy (apart from the zombie makeup, which looks slightly 'cartoonish' and is a disappointment after the silly yet effective blue-faced makeup in DAWN OF THE DEAD), with plenty of spraying blood. The gore content is liberal, with guts falling from stomachs to slop on the ground, arms being cut off, you name it. Most of the grue is saved for the finale where a bunch of hostile and moronic army types find themselves on the main course for the marauding hordes. We've got head burstings, eyeball rippings and for the piece de resistance, a man has his legs ripped off and screams "choke on 'em, choke on 'em!". It's all very horrible and bloody yet stays in the memory long after viewing - a mark of success for Savini and his crew.The characters in the film are pretty much one dimensional, and there is little characterisation. Out of the twelve survivors, only three are given any real depth - the heroine, the Irishman and the Jamaican - and the rest of the cast are either caricatures (in the case of Dr Logan) or merely being set up as zombie bait. Saying that, the acting is at least as professional as that in DAWN OF THE DEAD, and probably better. One character that stands out from the rest is Rhodes, played with manic relish by Joe Pilato. He's the one who delivers the best lines and comes across as a dedicated character - even if he's ruthless, arrogant and murderous with it.DAY OF THE DEAD is a savage film, full of nightmarish images (the hands coming out of the wall at the beginning is a classic moment), ruined only by the decision to have zombies dressed up - as clowns, etc. which totally destroys any element of horror - it merely looks stupid. Also, there is a total lack of comic relief, and the film is thoroughly downbeat and depressing. This invites the viewer to sometimes laugh instead of scream, always a bad sign. However there are still some moments of genius, such as having a zombie, Bub, who actually becomes a kind of hero. DAY OF THE DEAD may not be a perfect film, but at least give it one thing: it's never boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mad Scientist, A Military Captain From Hell, And A Zombie Named Bub= One Great Classic From 1985</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year is 1985 and a zombie apocalypse has happened. A group of scientists and military leaders are stuck in an underground bunker. This is a classic, that will be around for years. It has horror, comedy, and some drama. When it is found out that the good doctor, Dr. Frankenstein( Richard Liberty) is performing bizarre experiments on the dead, and some are military men; all S**T breaks loose. We have to other scientist, Sarah( Lori Cardille) and an assistant(John Ampas). They have to fight against military Captain that is not all there, Rhodes(Joseph Pilato) and his minions. This movie is actually really cool, the underground bunker is actually a limestone bunker in Pennsylvania. The other location were Sanibel Island, Fl, and the Nike Missile site. What I like about older zombie films is they can give you some scares and some laughs, unlike today's which are stupid. This is a great classic, and I am not going to go into detail on this film; because I would ruin it for you. If U like Night Of the Living Dead, and Dawn of The Dead, the originals U will enjoy this one. THX</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm dead, serious. Day of the Dead is one of the better Zombies movies out there. Choke on that!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not to be confused with Mexican holiday on November 2, aka Da de los Muertos. Day of the Dead is a 1985 horror film by director George A. Romero. It's the third of his Living Dead Series movies after 1968's Night of the Living Dead &amp; 1978's Dawn of the Dead. Romero has described the film as a "tragedy about how a lack of human communication causes chaos and collapse even in this small little pie slice of society". I think the movie, somewhat shows that. The movie has three types of human survivors, each of whom have been given a task to figure out, what cause the zombie apocalypse, and how to solve it, by the government. The scientists have been ordered to find a resolution to the epidemic, but are tempted to violate nature's boundaries guarding life and death. The soldiers who are assigned to protect the doctors appointed to study the zombies, but are tempted to enforce fascistic control and destroy the specimens in an act of rebellion. Last are the civilians who are assigned to serve both groups with basic though necessary services like transportation and communication, but are tempted to abandon the cause and, instead, live out their last days in peaceful abandon. Since there is hardly any government, oversight, the three groups quickly clash each other, creating an emergency within the underground compound, in which they live. Can they work together and save society or will society collapsed due to the pressure of the disaster? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found this film is one of the goriest film ever in the whole George A. Romero's Zombie series. There are plenty of scenes of people getting ripped to pieces. Very gruesome and very realistic. Actual pig intestines were used for filming. The crew, filming this movie, really had to have a strong stomach. And to make things worse, the refrigerator the intestines were put in broke over a weekend, causing the intestines to rot. One can only imagine the smell. The visual effects are pretty good for the most part. Tom Savini and his crew, really did a great job. Lot of creative new zombies. The make-up work is 100 times better than the previous films. Still, the budget was somewhat limited. The original script, for which George A. Romero couldn't get money for, involved the scientists living above ground in a fortress protected by electrified fences and the military living safely underground. It also involved a small army of trained zombies facing endless amounts of untrained zombies. Parts of this plan, would later became the basis of his later film, 2005's Land of the Dead. George Romero's less than flattering opinion on the US military is particularly obvious in this film; none of the soldiers have any redeeming qualities. They are racist, sexist and all around bad guys when it comes to dealing with both the dead and the living. It could be argued that they were going insane after all the isolation and the threat of zombies, or that all the decent soldiers have either died heroic deaths already, or deserted in hope of protecting their loved ones elsewhere. Still, I found, characters like Johnson (Gregory Nicotero) &amp; Steel (Gary Howard Klar), somewhat likable &amp; entertaining. While, Joe Pilato is over the top as Captain Rhodes. I found, his role, one of the better acted parts in the film. Although never confirmed, it has been rumored by fans that the character Pilato played in Dawn of the Dead is in fact Rhodes as a cop, before joining the army. Who knows! I love how the movie does somewhat reference, the previous films, but this series isn't really known for its continuity. After all, it has a Stephen King book from 1975 if the world start to go to sh*t in 1968. It's one of the suspension-of-disbelief conventions that viewers simply have to accept. The scientist subplot with Dr. Logan (Richard Liberty) &amp; Bub, the zombie (Howard Sherman), while emotional entertaining and both well-acted, felt like a different type of a movie. It truly does remind me of Frankenstein mixed with X-Men. Honestly, I really don't get, why the scenes, were in, there since the subplot really goes nowhere. It's still somewhat, jarring, seeing a zombie shot a gun. My taste of zombie movies, I would rather, not see that. In my opinion, the movie doesn't really have, much likable characters in this film. I really couldn't stand the heroes, as well. While, Lori Cardille &amp; Jarlath Conroy did a semi-good job with their roles. I really didn't like Terry Alexander. His over-the-top fake Caribbean accent was really, horrible. The movie does have some good scares. The infamous calendar on the wall is one of the best. Day of the Dead's electronic theme is very cold and clinical and very good at conveying the isolation and paranoia the main characters feel. While, the movie isn't as fun as 1978's Dawn of the Dead; time has gone by, enough that people have begun to view it in a more positive way for the movie's serious tones. It's far better than the 2008 remake by director Steve Miner. Then, there is an official sequel called Day of the Dead 2: Contagium which nobody from the original movie had any involvement with, so it's not worth, talking about, beyond that. Overall: I know the movie had a tough act to follow, but Day of the Dead is another zombie classic from Romero. Highly recommended! It's worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Dead Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this on TV a long time ago and thought it was okay. Then I saw the uncut stuff on one of the video reviews somewhere I was surprised and a little scared too. Of all the over the top gore that is as well as other stuff. Starts with our lady hero longing to be outside even thought shes in a room. She wakes up on a helicopter after touching a calender and the people in the helicopter land near the city to see if there's any survivors. There isn't but there's an alligator in the city that got turned, maybe? After that they go an land near this bunker that's underground which is supposed to be their home. One of the survivors think about escaping to some island to get away from all of it but they can't because of the soldiers. Most of this movie I heard is mostly talking and I think that's true after watching it now. Also it's kinda claustrophobic in this underground confined place most of the movie. The soldiers here are jerks and their commander is an even bigger jerk than all of them combine. There's also a professor they call Frankenstein that tries to study them and he looks like all those crazy doctors in movies. The professor also teaches this one zombie, Bub, about stuff as a was to control them a bit.The gore here is also over the top and pretty graphic even in HD. Also I swear one of the guys is Mr. Bean in this movie too. During getting another zombie for research a solider gets his arm bitten and they cut it off and burn where his arm got cut off, So he doesn't bleed out so much.After the commander goes crazy and kills some of the scientists as well as put some of the survivors in the zombie room. There we also see the shovel kill too where the zombie is still going. The remaining survivors take the back way out of the bunker to the helicopter. While the guy who got bitten lures the zombies into the bunker to kill the soldiers. These are some pretty graphic scenes of the soldiers getting ripped apart as well as the commander who gets shot a couple of times before that happens.I heard they used cow guts for all the gore they used and they ended up getting spoiled so even the actors are suffering in these scenes as well. There's also a light at the end of the tunnel I'll just say at the end of this movie. This movie is also considered to be the best of the Dead series with some people. To me it felt a little slow with all the talking scenes at times and no real action until the end. That's just what I think and you can give this a watch if you want to. I'll even give Land of the Dead a watch and review one day too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong final chapter to a good trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You rarely can please me with zombie movies. However I do make an exception for the original trilogy of Romero. I always thought this one would be the weakest of the 3 and that's why I waited many years to get this finally watched. I have now watched it twice and must say I like it more than Night of the Living Dead. I would now put it on the same level as my favorite Dawn of the Dead. Day of the Dead is a zombie movie and does contain some really graphic gory scenes which we didn't see in the previous ones especially to wards the end yet it offers more than hiding from the zombies and fighting for your life. Here we have a team of scientists that try to understand and train the zombies while a military team needs to secure the safety. As the military team loses some men conflicts arise between both camps which soon escalates. Of course that's the worst that can happen when your hide out is surrounded by a horde of flesh eating undead. The movie contains some great characters such as Dr Logan and zombie Bub. The scenes where Logan proudly presents the results of his research are wonderful and sometimes highly disturbing. Not to forget there is also Sarah, the only woman in the hide out, as the movie is shown for the majority from her point of view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Black Sheep" Of The Original Dead Trilogy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Day of the Dead", depending on your love of George A. Romero's previous Zombie movies is definitely the one that sticks out as a love it or hate it experience. The great aspects come from the fact that we still have a very strong cast, despite the fact that the mannerisms of a certain villain becomes hilariously absurd (But in no way less threatening), and that the style has very much remained the same. The bad decisions however come from how outlandish some of the events are either portrayed, or how far-fetched Romero's ambitions were towards this Horror icon he practically defined (In this excerpt taken from Wikipedia, Romero describes the film as a "tragedy about how a lack of human communication causes chaos and collapse even in this small little pie slice of society").Zombies have overrun the world, and the remaining survivors we follow are formed of government military and a few scientists held up in a underground base. Whilst certain aggression and angst among fellows survivors surely pose impending doom, experiments and discoveries about the Zombies are being made which lead to particularly interesting results.The effects are consistent and progressive with the previous movies, and Tom Savini returns with his special effects that really are of his own unique brand. The characters are consistently strong, some great set pieces are shown and the dialogue delivers and saves the day when the scenes get very outlandish. What do I mean by outlandish? "Bub" the zombie, both breaks and makes the movie for me. Of course I love him, but he easily remains a little too far-fetched from what I would expect from a Romero picture, especially when he represents something so vastly "out there" and ends up playing such an important part to Romero's theme of the movie (As stated in the excerpt above). It never really sat well with me, but I cannot imagine the movie without "Bub". It's the contradiction I have that consistently beats me into submission (I love you "Bub").I hate to feel like I'm rambling, but everything else to me is largely hit and miss. Joseph Pilato as Captain Henry Rhodes really was a one of a kind villain, and Romero had bigger plans for "Day of the Dead" but his $7 million budget was cut in half, thus having to re-draft the story countless times. I guess what I really need to say is that I enjoy this film, and there's plenty enough to make up for any shortcomings. Final Verdict: "Outlandish" is the word of the day (For a Zombie movie, who knew?). I don't love it as much as "Night" or "Dawn", but we will always ask ourselves what may have been. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sarah (no last name mentioned), is a lone female scientist now living in an underground bunker in Pennsylvania which used to store records of books, movies and newspapers. A zombie apocalypse has left much of the world unpopulated by nothing but flesh-eating ghouls, and the movie begins with Sarah, her boyfriend and her two friends flying over Florida to search for possible survivors. They turn up nothing and head back to the bunker, which is populated mainly by burly soldiers (they even grow marijuana bushes since it is no longer against the law; there is no law). Sarah is the only female so she has to endure sexist remarks every day, mainly from Steele, an overweight guy with a rude sense of humor and Rhodes, the military captain who is power-mad and ruthless. Her only friends are Fisher (a scientist) Logan (a docile but unbalanced scientist), McDermott (an electronics whiz and severe alcoholic), John (the helicopter pilot) and Miguel (her soldier boyfriend who is slowly losing his mind).As people begin dying off, tensions become higher. Rhodes constantly sneaks up on people to catch them doing things so he can punish them, he and Steele also make racist remarks at John. One day Miguel is bit by a zombie and Sarah goes to Logan for painkillers with McDermott, but the pair find out that Logan is totally insane, cutting up corpses for no real reason and recording himself talking to his imaginary friends. They also find Logan's pet zombie, Bub, chowing down on the body parts of some dead soldiers. Rhodes comes in and in a nervous rage shoots Logan to death with a machine gun, holds Fisher hostage and orders Sarah and McDermott to follow him. They arrive at John's secret trailer (he wanted a place that looked more like a home than a lab), and Rhodes' gun accidentally goes off, killing Fisher. Sarah starts screaming and she and McDermott are thrown out, left to run from the zombies and find an escape route. John (after being beat up by Steele), hurries to save his two friends, while a dying Miguel prays and lets in a hoard of zombies from above to kill the remaining soldiers.Day of the Dead is amazing! The soundtrack is really good, the plot is fantastic, it is great! Also it depicts how people often panic and quickly point fingers in an emergency, and how Cabin Fever (Rhodes) and Stockholm Syndrome (Logan) develop within closed quarters. The zombie makeup was really good, the acting was amazing, there was a lot of gore but still a decent story, it was a great zombie movie! Sadly it's been remade, hopefully it won't fade underneath its lousy remake. Like all of Romero's zombie films it had some funny moments, also some sad moments, and a great ending. In some ways it was like the knock-off version of Romero's movies, Hell of the Living Dead, but it was a lot less cheesy. There is a strong friendship between Sarah, McDermott and John but it doesn't get too preachy or cheery. Bub the zombie was there mainly for comic relief. As Rhodes has his intestines ripped out, Bub salutes him in a mocking military gesture. Another soldier has his head ripped off, the effects used for that were hilarious.Day of the Dead is great, but before you watch it make sure to see its companions, Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Darkest Day of Horror...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1985 theatrical trailers billed Day of the Dead as "The darkest Day of Horror the world has ever known." Day of the Dead is certainly darker in tone than its predecessor, lacking Dawn of the Dead's unique sense of satire. George Romero did attempt some comic relief with the inclusion of Bub, a zombie who had been domesticated as a scientific experiment.In this part of the trilogy, a military detachment and a group of scientists try to survive in an underground bunker and use corralled zombies as experiments into the cause of the undead plague.It's probably most peoples' least favorite of the original Dead trilogy, but the concept was still fresh in 1985, and there is a lot to like in this movie. It's classic George Romero with all the gore and zombie action you would expect. Joe Pilato ascends to horror flick greatness as the psychotic Captain Rhodes. He certainly earns his ultimate fate in this movie, and it's worth the wait to see this character get taken out by a zombie with a gun.The later Dead movies Romero directed seem like an afterthought compared to Day of the Dead which is definitely part of the original vision for the zombie apocalypse world Romero created. Enjoy it for what it is- the last of George Romero's classic zombie movies. Nobody does it better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best seen on Hulu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend recommended watching the director's cut of Day of the Dead (1985) on Hulu, which by the way is an excellent copy of the film, and I have to say that this movie has aged the best out of the whole Romero trilogy. The most artistic of Romero's zombie movies, Day of the Dead tells the story of a group of scientists and a team of military personnel who have holed up in a secure military bunker. The scientists work tirelessly on finding some way to deal with the ever growing zombie horde while the troops provide the manpower of catching undead test subjects and protecting the facility. As what happens whenever people are trapped in a confined space for a long period of time, the survivors start to crack. The first to do so is Rhodes (Joe Pilato), leader of the soldiers who starts to see the imbalance of power within the compound. He draws a gun on Sarah (Lori Cardille), a strong independent scientist bent on finding a solution, commanding her to sit down. This marks the first confrontation of brain vs. brawn as the tension rises when Rhodes commands one of his soldiers to shoot her. The situation finally dissipates when Sarah sits down, but from that point on the line becomes clearer and clearer between the soldiers and everyone else in the compound. Amidst the growing antagonism, Dr. Logan (Richard Liberty), an eccentric scientist obsessed with his work, gets a zombie aptly named Bub (Sherman Howard) to remember his past. This amazing breakthrough is cut short when Rhodes in his mad fury tears through Dr. Logan. The war begins between the heart of the troops and the brain of the scientists. While the scientists are reasonable, their actions are not practical and while the troops are very practical, they lack any sort of rationality in the realm of logic. My apologies, but I'm not going to let out who wins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sense of total hopelessness and claustrophobia is felt when watching Romero's 3rd installment of the living dead. The story follows a group of scientists and militarists who are bunked in an underground mine to find solutions against the dead. The tension between the characters highlights the beginning of the story with a great loony cast including a mad scientist, tyrannical leader and brain-dead soldiers. The movie really picks up when they start fighting each other instead of the zombies and I'll leave the plot at that. The gore and special effects is top notch in this movie and have some cringe inducing death scenes. It's another solid Romero zombie film that is a must watch for horror lovers, that is a great follow up from Dawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not simply a zombie film, but a study in human behavior and ethics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if it's my imagination, but it seems like it was the intent of both Romero and makeup artist Tom Savini to step up the gore a few notches with 'Day of the Dead.' This third entry in the franchise moves forward with a few more buckets of blood and body parts.Military and scientific personnel hole up together in an underground hideaway to keep away from zombies who walk the earth in search of their next meal of flesh. The military are looking for a way to exterminate the walking dead, while the scientists strive to re-civilize them through horrific experiments. The scientists and soldiers find themselves at odds with each other as the zombies close in on their subterranean bunker.I'll be honest in saying that the first hour of "Day of the Dead" was slow. Just as I was giving up on it, the pace picked up and the movie was saved in the last 30 minutes. Although it might seem like it moves at the speed of a snail and is talky, I give props to Romero for taking the time and energy to actually establish character development and a storyline that reaches beyond simply finding ways to kill zombies.Something else I noticed about "Day of the Dead" is that it feels timeless. Even though it was made in the mid-1980s, it isn't aged by the clothing, hairstyles, or even technology worn and used by the characters in the film. Romero found a way to remain neutral in these areas, giving it a longevity not found in many other movies in this genre."Day of the Dead" isn't simply a zombie film, but a study in human behavior and ethics. It doesn't only give viewers plenty of blood and guts to gawk at, it gives them something to think about as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pretty Good 80's Zombie Flick!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lori Cardille, Terry Alexander, Joe Pilato, Jarlath Conroy, Anthony Dileo, Richard Liberty and Sherman Howard star in George Romero's 1985 horror film. This film takes place in Fort Myers, Florida where we meet scientist, Dr. Sarah Bowman (Cardille) and her military soldier team members, John (Alexander), McDermott (Conroy) and Miguel (Dileo) who have just arrived during the mysterious zombie chaos happening around the world. They head to an underground military research station where Sarah's lead scientist, Dr. Matthew Logan Aka "Frankenstein" (Liberty) is conducting experiments on zombies trying to find out what motivates them and teaches them about communication and behavior. Howard plays Logan's main experiment, Bub who starts making progress and Pilato plays military Captain, Rhodes who begins taking over the operation and threatens the scientists to follow his orders. This is a pretty good 80's zombie flick with a decent cast, Tom Savini did terrific as usual with the make-up effects and his protg, Greg Nicotero (The Walking Dead) makes an appearance as Private soldier, Johnson. I recommend this for horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While admittedly not as good as its two predecessors, "Night of the Living Dead" and "Dawn of the Dead", this film is still good in its own right. In this particular movie, a handful of scientists and soldiers are gathered in a hastily supplied underground military facility conducting experiments. Zombies surround the perimeter fence. Headed by "Dr. Logan" (Richard Liberty), the scientists are trying to gather as much information as they can by performing live experiments on the zombies. However, obtaining the test subjects is a difficult and hazardous assignment and the military is not happy with the losses sustained for the very limited progress made. Stress and mental fatigue are taking its toll as well. At any rate, one thing that stands out is the introduction of the zombie "Bub" (Howard Sherman) who is blessed with memories and abilities that far surpass others of his kind. And while I thought the makers of the film went a bit too far in a couple of instances with him, I generally liked the scenario overall. I also liked the performances of "Sarah" (Lori Cardille) and "John" (Terry Alexander) and what seems to be a chemistry that slowly begins to develop between them. I further appreciate the fact that the violence and special effects serve to complement the plot rather than simply dominating it like other films of this nature. In short, this is a very good horror movie which fans of this genre should really enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing much new here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the first two George A. Romero zombie films, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD, both of which are responsible for establishing the living dead genre as we now know it today. Only recently did I have the chance to see the third film in Romero's trilogy, DAY OF THE DEAD, and while it certainly has some strong points and very rabid fans, it is simply not on par with its predecessors.In the ensuing quarter of a century since DAY OF THE DEAD's 1985 release we've seen more than a few zombie apocalypses, and after all this time, DAY's small budget and script shortcomings are all the more glaring. At first DAY seems like a natural progression from NIGHT and DAWN; the dead now outnumber the living by a ratio of 400,000 to 1 and a tiny group of survivors are hold up in an underground bunker in Florida. This group is made up of soldiers, scientists and a couple of helicopter pilots; the scientists are trying to study the zombies while the soldiers just want to wipe them all out. The two pilots just want to survive and enjoy what little life there may be left. Unfortunately none of these survivors are very sympathetic; Captain Rhodes, the ranking officer is a raging A-hole and his long in the tooth enlisted men are no better. The scientists are obsessed with their experiments that benefit nobody. This sets up a series of scenes in which characters shout, argue and overact without a hint of subtlety; Romero clearly loved directing his zombies better than his living characters, most of whom just grimace, roll their eyes and glare when reading their lines, We can't wait for these people to become zombie chow, which robs the story of it's central horror component because we don't really fear for these people because we don't like them in the first place.I remember reading interviews where Romero pointed out that the conflict between the survivors and their inability to rise above petty prejudices and selfishness was what truly empowered the zombies, that if they really started working together, the dead would cease to be reanimated and drop in their tracks. This was how he truly wanted to end his trilogy. Maybe, but I think Romero just plain loves putting actors in zombie makeup and letting the special effects guys run riot. Otherwise, DAY trots out such tropes from the first two movies such as having one the good guys be a black man (a rarity in 80's horror films). The one original plot point in DAY OF THE DEAD is the subplot where Dr. Logan attempts to domesticate Bub the Zombie; the scenes between Richard Liberty and Sherman Howard are terrific; I think a much better movie would have been one where these two characters took center stage. The one great saving grace for DAY of course is the gore, especially in the final slaughter when the living dead invade the underground bunker and rip into the few human survivors left; these scenes are the reason why Tom Savini is a legend. And Joseph Pilato's Captain Rhodes does get one of the great exit lines of all time when the ravenous dead rip his legs off. That alone makes DAY worth seeing.It's safe to say that if it wasn't for George A. Romero, there wouldn't have been any THE WALKING DEAD on AMC; but it is also safe to say that in many ways Romero is a one trick pony, but it is a great trick. Yet I can't help but wish he'd tried to extend his grasp a little further. On the original paperback copy of Stephen King's THE STAND, from back in 1980, it states that the novel is soon to be a motion pictured directed by George A. Romero; a project that never came to be, but leaves us wondering what might have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underrated Horror Classic. One of Romero's Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero's Day of the Dead is one of the best Horror/Zombie films ever made and one of Romero's best films. While it maybe the weakest in the trilogy in terms of story,it's the best in the trilogy in terms of the special effects.Taking place years after the events in Dawn of the Dead,Day of the Dead tells the story of a group of scientists and soldiers working in an underground cave among zombies. While the scientists want to work with the zombies to understand them and control them the soldiers want the zombies dead. There's tension between the groups,but they will have to deal with the zombies and the darkest day the world will ever know...the Day of the Dead.Day Of The Dead is an excellent underrated Horror classic and an amazing Zombie film. Some have said that the movie is too talky and boring but I disagree because one of great things about the film is the tension between the soldiers and scientists. The tension in film between the soldiers and scientists i think adds to the Horror and dread because there are characters in the film you will love or hate. The scientists and soldiers are on the verge of going insane whether it's dealing with the zombies or they're human selves and the tension between the main characters is one of the most interesting things about the film. If NIGHT was about why the zombies are attacking and killing and DAWN was about the zombies and consumer culture,then DAY my opinion is about trying to control,socialize and understand the zombies and trying to figure out why they eat and kill and that is where the conflict between the scientists and soldiers comes about the scientist want to study zombies and the soldiers want them dead. While the film is talky it is never boring. I guess because Night and Dawn had more action and a few more likable character people would find this film boring,I don't. The film shows that if human beings don't work together and cooperate with each other society will fall apart and be responsible for it's own darkness. That's pretty much what Romero's zombie films are about is a failure to communicate with each other. What i also love about this movie is you feel that the human characters in the film are the only people alive on earth and are the only ones left. The characters are isolated and we as the viewers feel as isolated as them. I love that the film has a different and darker tone than Dawn where as Dawn was more colorful in terms of the visuals whether it was the gore or humor,Day is somber,less cheerful and almost humorless and that's one of the things I love about the movie and why it's a great Horror film. A fine job by Romero by giving viewers a since of dread and loneliness. At the same time it's a shame what happened to Day of the Dead before it was filmed. Originally DOTD's screenplay was a going to be an epic or as Romero said was going to be a Gone With The wind of zombie films and who knows probably would've topped both Night and Dawn. The budget was originally 7 million dollars,but in order for Romero to get the 7 million he had make DOTD with an R rating,Romero refused and instead went with an unrated film and the budget was cut to 3 million dollars and some of the characters and other things in the script were cut out and it's a shame because Day could've been so much more. But that doesn't stop DOTD from being a great film. The blood and gore in the film is great,disgusting and once the blood and gore appears on screen it never stops until the very end. The Action that comes in the last half of the film is great and intense and gets more intense as the film goes on. The ending of the film or final 40 minutes is brilliant and probably some of best zombie carnage ever seen on film and it is something you will never forget. Lori Cardille does a great job as Sarah,one of the scientists. Cardille brings a toughness and sympathy to the only female character in the film. Terry Alexander does an amazing job as John the helicopter pilot. Joe Pilato is excellent and over the top as soldier Captain Rhodes the villain of the film. Jarlath Conroy does a great job McDermott John's friend and radio operator who loves to drink. Antone'Dileo is wonderful as Miguel Sarah's frightened soldier boyfriend Richard Liberty is great as scientist Dr.Logan the scientist who wants know how to control and know the zombies. Howard Sherman is brilliant as Bub,a Zombie that's Dr. Logan's personal project. G.Howard Klar and Ralph Marrero are a delight as Steel and Rickles two of Rhodes' lackeys who bring humor to the film. Also lookout for a cameo role from K.N.B FX artist Greg Nicotero as one of the soldiers.The direction from George A. Romero superb,bringing the same level of energy and camera angles he brought to Dawn of the Dead. The screenplay he wrote his great and the action scenes are well directed and well executed. The special effects by Tom Savini are some the best things he's ever done as an effects artist. The effects are bloody,messy,and realistic and some of the best zombie carnage you'll see on screen.John Harrison's score is great and adds to the tone of the film. While it's not as iconic as the score in Dawn of the Dead it is still a memorable score.If you love Horror films and Zombie films I suggestion to you is to see this is underrated Horror classic and add it to your collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead of course takes off sometime after 'Dawn'. At the point in time, there are no people to be found. In Dawn of the Dead, we had military, police, biker gangs and hillbillies roaming the US. In Day of the Dead you get a real sense that there aren't that many humans to be found. We meet our cast of scientists, soldiers, and others as they take refuge in an underground missile silo. A scientist dubbed "Frankenstein" is doing experiments with the zombies to see if there is a way to control them. However to do the experiments, the soldiers have to contain the zombies through a trap door which of course leads to a few gruesome bites/deaths.I love Day of the Dead for the fact that it's George Romero and it's Tom Savini and it continues the zombie attack storyline. But I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first two for a few reasons. One, I would have loved more scenes above ground. I wasn't feeling the whole underground based filming location. It made it very gloomy and not very interesting to watch at times. After the opening scene of the group looking on the outside streets for any people still alive, the majority of the film is in the underground. Another flaw is the characters. Outside of three-four of them, the characters are annoying and just plain nasty people. You don't connect with them in the same way that you do with the groups in Night and Dawn of the Dead.But, Day of the Dead should be seen by all horror fans. It's has great moments, including the introduction of "Bub" the zombie who gets trained by the scientist to do all sorts of normal things like answer a telephone and listen to music. It wasn't as good as 'Night' or 'Dawn' for me, but it's enjoyable enough.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bub's great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid fan of zombie movies, I had no expectations for the Day of the Dead. It turned out to be an intelligent and enjoyable film. Much of the film is about the tensions between a few survivors that reside in an underground base filled with all kinds of stuff. Many reviewers said that the film suffers from overacting, but I think it's not true. Only the leader of the soldiers is overacting, but on the other hand, it's okay considering his I-am-the-king character who found his small underground kingdom after most of the world's population is dead. Although the film is certainly worse than the other Romero's brilliant action-packed classics, I think the Day of the Dead still is a good 80s zombie horde film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Happy day (of the dead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead is Writer/ Director George A Romero's third and final (and third) film in his original (good) zombie trilogy. Released in 1985, almost 10 years after Dawn of the Dead and 20 after Night of the Living Dead (his first 'grown up' feature), this third installment was greeted with initially bad reviews and a poor financial return (of the dead)! This was mostly (probably) due to the bleak nature of the film and the fact that it veered far from the comic book antics of Dawn of the Dead, presenting a more realistic, harsh and in some ways depressing atmosphere.As with its predecessor, Day of the Dead is not a direct 'sequel' to Dawn and doesn't share any of the characters or locations from the previous film, instead telling a new story set during the same zombie apocalypse/outbreak?thingy! Again, the viewer is not told directly or obviously what's going on, and the actual cause of the outbreak is never revealed (they mention briefly in the original Night of the Living dead that it may have come down on a meteorite). The plot centers on a group of survivors, um?surviving in an old underground army base/ fallout shelter or something. We learn that this group was hastily put together before the outbreak completely took over the world and consists mainly of scientists and soldiers. The scientists are trying to figure out what is bringing the dead back to life while the soldiers are rapidly losing patience, causing tension (and a 'lot' of swearing) between each group! Major Cooper (whom we never actually see?alive anyway) dies while some of the main characters are checking along the coast for survivors, leaving the brash and angry Captain Rhodes in charge. He has lost all patience with the scientist's apparent slow progress and just wants to get 'the hell out of here' in the helicopter (which can only be piloted by one of the main characters named John). Meanwhile Dr 'Frankenstein' Logan is trying to domesticate and control the zombies rather than looking for a way to stop them. This frustrates Sarah (scientist and Ripley-ish female lead) as she is looking into more practical research and trying to discover how the dead are re-animating, hoping to discover a way to reverse it. It is at this point that we are introduced to Bub, the semi-docile zombie which Logan is training. Special mention must go to Bub (played by Sherman Howard) as it is probably the best zombie performance and one of the best zombie make-ups ever! We see that Bub has been 'tamed' as he doesn't display the same aggressive, single-minded behavior that the other undead?um?display (basically, he doesn't just want to eat everyone in sight). Things come to a (dead) head later, however, when it is revealed that Dr Logan's way of taming the zombies is to feed them tasty buckets of Captain Rhode's dead men as a reward for their good (or un-undead) behavior. Rhodes finds out, kills Logan and attempts to flee the base, but John won't fly him out and Sarah and Bill (another 'sweary' main character) have to fight their way through some zombies in an attempt to get to the helicopter as well. Through a series of squishy and violent events, the zombies are let into the underground bunker and over-run the base, killing all of the remaining soldiers, who are mostly 'baddies' anyway. John, Sarah and Bill escape in the helicopter to a tropical island to presumably live out their remaining days in paradise away from the zombie menace! The incredible zombie effects are once again created by the legendary Tom 'legend' Savini (who is a legend), with the help of Greg Nicotero (of KNB effects) who also plays a minor role in the film as one of the (not so baddie) soldiers. Unlike in Dawn of the Dead, this time Savini gets to design and make a lot of 'unique' zombie appliances, so that pretty much every zombie seen on screen is distinctive, rather than the simpler 'greyed up face' approach used in Dawn. Savini has said that Day of the Dead is his special effects masterpiece and I'd definitely agree. Did I mention that there's a lot of swearing in this film? Probably, but it's worth another mention?there is a 'lot' of swearing in this film!! All of the characters have 'potty' mouths but the award goes to the character Bill, who has three f**ks in a single shouted sentence! The acting is very good as well. It's funny how it's only generally noticeable in this type of film when the acting is dire (see Zombies the Beginning for proof of this), but in Day of the Dead, as in Night and Dawn (of the deads) the actors perform well and the situations and character interactions are believable. Overall then, this is a brilliant, well acted and written film. In a way I think of it as the first 'serious' or 'grown up' (or should that be 'groan' up) zombie movie. It's a brilliant and fitting end to Romero's original trilogy and still features the best zombie make up seen in any film ever?fact?well, uh?in my opinion?..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Finale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day takes off not immediately where 'Dawn of the Dead' left off but way further south of Pittsburgh in devastated Florida after the zombie epidemic has reached its plateau.As much of the back-story is only hinted, allowing the horror and drama to unfold freely, we are invited to observe what little remains of humanity and to see and hear how it finally gave up the ghost in the wake of this unstoppable titular event.In a US Army missile silo hastily recommissioned in the dying hopes of finding a vaccine against the zombie virus, scientists and soldiers have begrudgingly cooperated under the strain of heavy human losses, the resulting animosity between factions and the ultimate devastation of being left for dead in this post-apocalyptic world.The despicable and vile Captain Rhodes has assumed command over what remains of his army, what remains of the science team employed to find a solution are all but falling apart through traumatic stress and on the outskirts of both factions are John and Philip, the helicopter pilot and radio man.If anything threatens to pull the plug on all hope of survival it may be the living dead, it may even be the dwindling food, fuel and ammunition. But it seems more likely that what remains of society here is going to fall in upon itself.Romero makes a huge point of placing all of his unique characters at the threat of death, or worse, but then placing many key characters under the strain of a sort of extreme traumatic stress/end of the world syndrome that you would expect of survivors of a nuclear holocaust.It is this grim darkness that almost overwhelms as the mood and setting of the final instalment of the trilogy and so the humans are trying to escape more than just the zombie threat.The actors, considering most if not all of them are only known amongst fans of cult classics, do a brilliant job, and dare i say, a more complex and intense job of portraying these desperate characters.Joseph Pilato steals the show as Rhodes and Gary Klar as his thug Sergeant, Steele. Effects guru Greg Nicotero (The Walking Dead) acts and works under legend Tom Savini.On the scientists' side, the late Richard Liberty (The Crazies) performed his best ever role as Dr Logan, a man somehow managing his own insanity and the likelihood that he has suffered a nervous breakdown.Terry Alexander exudes cool as John/Flyboy and Jarlath Conroy (True Grit) injects some much needed Irish angry-drunk humour as his best friend.Thanks to Savini and co, the zombies were the best they'd ever been in the 80's and Romero employed great skill in both making parody and terror out of their conceptually advanced neanderthal nature. There have never been scarier zombies or zombie casualties in the history of the subgenre as there were in Day of the Dead and you can expect plenty of terror in the final half-hour.Considering that this low-budget finale was nothing like how Romero envisioned his trilogy ending (he couldn't get the funding), you can take it or leave it, and I've personally embraced it since I first saw it.Brilliant, horror at its best. Suck it Brooks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may not be the most fun of the original Romero Zombie trilogy, but it may actually be the best. Despite the "film studies" geeks wanting to read all sorts of political subtext into the films, there is none. It really is about icky scary zombies we need to blast. Not a diatribe on Amercan this or that or a diatribe on Cold War hysteria. Romero found cool places to shoot monster movies. There is nothing inherently wrong with people buying goods they want or protecting themselves from evildoers with firearms. This is the grittiest and most real of the zombie films. This is what makes any film great. Not blood, gore, and effects. Not even plot and storyline. Nope it's all about the characters. This is an intimate, character study, with the main players under the stress of a zombie apocalypse. If you don't have an emotional investment in the characters, then it does'nt really matter if the movie was even made. This is where Romero excels. I feel like I met, and got to know everyone in this movie. Even some of the zombies. It mattered if they died. I cared. That's what made this and the other Romero movies so memorable. And frankly why they stand above most all of the Italian/Euro horror movies. They tend to be boring as all freakin hell, and not only do you not know who just died, you could'nt care less as you don't even pause the boring DVD to go pee and grab another beer. The only subtext, if there is any, is the absurd childish typical lefty notion that there are no "real" evil monsters. Everything we think is bad is simply misunderstood. Even zombies. Can't kill'em indiscriminately. We need to understand and sympathize with them. Thus he seeks to humanize the zombies (Bubb). Make them sympathetic. This theme was carried to it's absurd apex in Land of the Dead, with the whole "people for the ethical treatment of zombies" ending. Just shoot the damn things you pansy commie bastard. Kill'em All Let God sort'em out! Zombies. Jihadi's. Whatever, shoot the bad guy and win a prize!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this long section of the film may seem slow and talky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this final entry of George Romero's "Living Dead" trilogy, the walking dead supposedly outnumber the humans by a ratio of 400,000 to 1. Twelve people who have devoted themselves to studying and wiping out the zombies hole up together in an underground missile silo, and for all we know, these could be the last twelve living humans on the face of the planet. Most of these people don't capture our sympathy like the foursome who holed up in the shopping mall in "Dawn". Half of them are gung-ho soldiers who seem to take great pleasure in threatening the scientific team, and Romero spends much of the first half focusing on the bickering and intense conflicts between these people. In fact, for over an hour, the hordes of living dead get very little screen time, as the story focuses on the tension between the characters, and the efforts of an off-the-wall scientist to train a captured zombie named Bub to act human. Compared to its predecessors, this long section of the film may seem slow and talky, but it is always interesting and, for the most part, effectively performed by its unknown cast. Besides, it all eventually leads up to a corker of finale when the zombies finally invade the compound, and most of the humans become showcases for the brilliance of Tom Savini, who outdoes even himself in the gore F/X department.While most of this material is very grim, "Day" ironically has the most hopeful, upbeat conclusion in the trilogy - which, alas, is its only major shortcoming. The quick transition to the final scene is so abrupt and unexpected that the audience feels cheated, leaving the impression that the production ran out of money before the whole climax could be filmed. Indeed, Romero has often expressed his unhappiness about being underfunded for this project, which prevented him from creating a truly definitive final chapter for the trilogy. But while "Day of the Dead" may not quite be the ultimate finish to one of the greatest trilogies of all time, it is still a very satisfying conclusion (at least until Romero gets funding for his long-rumoured "Twilight of the Dead"). It may not be popular among everyone, due to many unfair comparisons to its superior predecessors, but on its own, it is about as good as horror films get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Darkest Day Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD first came out in the 80s, it went virtually unnoticed in theaters. Many critics hated it, claiming it was "too bloody, too dark and depressing, too this or that, blah blah blah." Many viewers at the time probably thought the same thing. But looking back on it years later, many have begun to recognize it for the classic that it is. George Romero's films have always had an appeal for me: independently made, featuring local talent, and (until the last few years) made entirely in my home state of Pennsylvania! While some have questioned Romero's directing credibility in recent years, I say the man hasn't lost one iota of his touch! Anyway, back to DOTD. When I first saw DOTD, I admit even I was turned off by it. I found it to be "dark and bloody and depressing and..." Revisiting the movie several years ago, my view on the movie has changed considerably. Perhaps certain world events have helped me to see the movie in a better light. Yes, it is a dark movie. But what would you expect regarding the end of humanity? Surprisingly, Romero sets his film in Florida, though most of the action takes place in an underground missile silo and bunker. The opening scene in particular is brilliant and eerily sad. Four survivors land a helicopter in a sizable, but empty city. When Miguel yells on a loudspeaker "Hello." That simple, desperate word is answered by the wails and cries of thousands of zombies. That is a scene of utter despair that no other movie has been able to duplicate. And from there, the tone gets darker. Midway through, one of the characters (John the pilot) has a touching speech on explanations and "what once was" as a lonely, soulful soundtrack backs him up. One can't help but wonder if, in fact, these are the last dozen people in the world. Thinking about it, sends a shiver down your spine. If ever there was a moment of existential philosophy in a Romero flick, this would be it. And that's how Romero works on you, the audience member. The real horror comes from realizing that whether we're trying to save the world, or ourselves, we're our own worst enemies. Putting that aside, the movie presents us with the end of many things: the end of a relationship, end of sanity, the end of basic humanity and compassion, and so forth. And Romero is bold enough to show us the dark side of the characters. Even though the ending is a little weak, it does allow Romero to round out his original DEAD trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dig this film! You see i am one the kind of ilk that loves HEAVY doses of blood and guts in my horror movie diet. The bloodier and grosser the better, i always say! In this third installment of the George A. Romero trilogy we are treated to a virtual shmogasborg of gut busting, blood splattering, bone crunching mayhem. To be truthful it is the gore effects, done by the sultan of splats himself Tom Savini, that are the real star of this movie. Not that the story isn't interesting and the characters give insightful, albeit long winded, speeches. But once the Zombies go to town on the hapless humans and literally rip them a new one. You cant help but stand in awe of what you are witnessing. It doesn't surprise me when people are put off by the effects. It is definitely not for the squeamish. However I think that is nothing short of artwork when you see gore effects of this caliber. It takes real talent and Savini should be praised for his work in this film. I think he won a Saturn award for the effects and man did he ever earn it!</fullReview>

The story isn't half bad the acting is horrible I wont deny it the only skilled actor in this movie is Sherman Howard who alone made this movie acceptable. The sense of claustrophobia was lost by the awful acting and so were most of the strong scenes (I mean most all the strong scenes that didn't involve Bub).Savini as usual did an awesome job on the gore and zombies. So it was a good underfunded movie you have to watch it knowing it was funded like a b-series movie to enjoy it fully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but quite below its predecessors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero suffered from a lack of time and funding while making this movie, and unfortunately it kinda shows. When you compare the action scenes from this movie with the ones from "Dawn Of The Dead", they come of as rather tame, even if they do feature a guy being torn in half. The characters are also just not up to the earlier standards, they are a lot more stereotypical and generally blurt out rather weak dialogues. The conflict between the army guys and the scientists who are forced to live together is good enough at first, but it just drags on for such an insanely long time. As always the zombies eventually get in, but man they sure keep a guy waiting this time around. And even when they get in, the military bunker is certainly not an entertaining as the shopping mall from "Dawn". Furthermore, the movie doesn't end as much as it just stops, probably again because of funding issues. Romero's zombies are always a treat, but this is probably them at their least awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't your typical zombie flick, it isn't shooting and fun parts with scary zombie pop outs. This movie is more about the insanity that corrupts our minds when we are put in difficult situations and how no one thinks alike and it makes it harder for us to work together. Almost everything that the characters do in this film is believable and a lot of the decisions that are made I can see happening. I don't want to give any spoilers but the ending to me was sort of lame especially the main scientist because the thing he did was sort of stupid and unbelievable and seemed like a plot point that a three year old would come up with, watch the movie and you will see what I mean. Other than that the whole movie was spectacular and even though the thing with the scientist made me want to rate it a 7 i rated it a 8 instead. This is a must see zombie flick, and although it is about the insanity if you are a plain zombie gore fan this has a little bit of that too around the end which sorta made me smile a bit. Watch the movie and you will like it, it's worth the time i guarantee it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romero's finest 'Dead' offering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Day of the Dead" is an excellent film. George A. Romero ,who in essence created the modern day horror film, has never been finer than on this 'Day'. The political and sociological commentary we have come to love from Romero is at it's most poignant in 'Day'. It isn't necessarily evident on the first viewing but I've found that as I've re watched the film that I appreciate it even more. It is by far Romero's grimmest picture and viewing it after viewing "Dawn of the Dead" isn't really beneficial to appreciating "Day". "Dawn" is much lighter fare compared to "Day". What Romero dissects in "Day" is much deeper than the American consumer culture..."Day" has it's critics, and the critiques on "Day" aren't entirely unjustified. I, myself used to think it was the worst "Dead" film.The general consensus seems to not appreciate "Day"'s lack of "likeable" characters. I honestly think that these viewers come from a lens of having loved "Dawn",which had great well written characters who we root for. We are not supposed to like Rhodes and his team. They have been put in an entirely different scenario, and have been detached from the so called normalcy longer than the characters of "Dawn".Sarah and Captain Rhodes are battling over their destinies. This military base is divided between the scientists and the soldiers who both want to control their counterparts. Rhodes wants to jump in the helicopter and just fly away, Sarah wants to scientifically find the root of this pandemic to potentially end it. What Romero does so brilliantly is point out the great ironies. Rhodes' plan won't succeed because he simply doesn't have the supplies or means. Sarah's plan while noble is doomed for failure as well. She may find a cure or the cause but what power does she have with that information? What Romero does is try to hint that these people may in fact be the last on earth. The idea that humanity is left to these individuals who are making wrong decisions is ironic, and brilliant. The only person truly right in the midst is John the pilot, who observes that Rhodes and Sarah are Representatives of a society that failed in the face of Armageddon, a society that should be left to rot with the living dead.Much of the draw of "Day of the Dead" is Howard Sherman's brilliant portrayal of Bub the Zombie. The performance is absolutely above any expectations and is powerful. Sherman is delivering a Karloff caliber performance and ironically Bub is the most human character in the film. Intentional? You bet. Bub is capable of the simplest yet the most powerful of human emotions. When we see Bub and compare him to the rest of the cast who are wasting their lives away amidst constant bickering and melodrama, than we question who is really "alive" or "dead" Rhodes and his men are as barbaric as any of the flesh ripping zombies and yet they are human. Sherman is brilliant and really drives home Romero's intent. Credit must also be given to Tom Savini's fantastic make up which really highlights Sherman's brilliant pantomime.What I also love is that Romero blatantly attacks the military. Rhodes and his men all proudly wear their army duds and we ask "So what?" In this society where there is no government, constitution, or American way to defend, these titles and uniforms mean absolutely nothing. These men aren't soldiers, they're psychopaths. Bub's salute to Rhodes couldn't be anymore satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasons why I love you...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, Day of the Dead, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways: 1. You're the third entry in director George A. Romero's zombie saga and, until the stunningly mediocre Land of the Dead, the worst of the lot; yet I own thee, and have watched thee a dozen times at least. 2. Your concept (the zombies have essentially won, and a handful of scientists and tetchy soldiers are holed up in a makeshift lab complex in an old mine, wearily looking for some way to keep humanity alive) is compelling, and suffused with a mixture of horror, desperation, and melancholy. 3. Your soundtrack, by Modern Man, is easily the most evocative, and weirdly moving score I've ever heard in a horror movie. If it exists somewhere on CD, I would buy it (or someone could buy it for me and send it c/o Videoport 151 Middle St. Portland, Maine 04101) and listen to it whenever I'm feeling decidedly odd. Which is often. 4. Bub the zombie. (Although the trend towards humanizing the zombies is played out to a silly degree in Land of the Dead, Howard Sherman's Bub is actually kind of moving, and Sherman gives the best performance in the movie- fun fact: Sherman was the formerly-flabby 'triangle artist' in the Junior Mint episode of Seinfeld). 5. Your performances, while, um, let's just say, of variable quality, have some highlights. Terry Alexander's heroic John (though his Jamaican accent gets a little dodgy at times) is head and shoulders above the rest; dude's got charisma. Lori Cardille, as our main protagonist Sarah, is very odd-looking and nobody's professional actress, but she's all the more affecting because of it, I think; watch the scene down in the cavern when she has to amputate her former lover's arm and then face off against the soldiers- that's genuinely good acting. Jarlath Conroy's Irish radioman (while, of course, taking nips out of his flask every ten seconds), has some good moments, even though his accent comes and goes, too (and he may actually be Irish?). And then there's Joe Pilato who, as the villainous Captain Rhodes, gives what I maintain to be the single worst performance ever committed to film in the history of the world. Man-oh-man! Wow! I just..you just have to watch it for yourself. I've actually sought out movies he's appeared in since, just to see if he's as awesomely awful in them; weirdly, he's always relatively competent in them. But, here?just?wow? 6. Your awesome soundtrack, and your line, "Hello? Is there anyone there?" is sampled, to great effect, in the Gorillaz song "M1, A1". 7. Your death scene for Rhodes' is pretty damn epic, with his "Choke on them!" final line being hilariously awesome. (This scene, minus the line, is paid tribute in the near-perfect homage/spoof Shaun of the Dead).8. You're not the 2007 remake, which makes you look like Ikiru in contrast. 9. You have no 'fast zombies'. Which are stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makings of becoming a classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small group of military officers and scientists reach breaking point in the confines of a bunker as the world above is overrun by zombies.The first two scenes set precedence that the rest of the film can't equal. The jumpy dream sequence is followed by and eerie deserted city during the day that soon comes to 'life' with the walking dead. The city scene creates tension, the howling wind and echoing voices.Lori Cardille acting is excellent as Sarah, as too is Terry Alexander, as realist pilot, John. Jarlath Conroy is the alcoholic radioman William McDermott, however, after this strong introduction and the movie looses it lustre and wider audience as it goes into the underground bunker.From here on in, we're treated with a great performance from Sherman Howard as the 'thinking' zombie Bub and a fantastic monologue from Alexander, this is where the film finds it feet. There are fantastic special effects by Tom Savini, who fine-tunes what he did in Dawn' and adds some more gore into the mix. Over the years the score by John Harrison has really grown on me and given the film a memorable lost hope feel.There are other fine moments in Romero's script, Miguel Salazar's break down, Sarah's struggle and some memorable on liners mostly from Richard Liberty's Logan and Joseph Pilato's Rhodes. However, what lets this film down slightly is some uneven acting. That said, John Amplas underrated and overlooked subtle performance as Dr.Fisher is a hidden gem and Johns monologue at the 'Ritz' is Oscar worthy.Day of the dead is a tight zombie film, and debatably a classic but even if you disagree it's worthy enough to enjoy time and time again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"How can we expect them to behave if we act barbarically ourselves?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this third installment (and for twenty years, the last to be released), Romero has more satire and poignant food for thought for us. This is by far the most claustrophobic(...think about that for a second) of the three, and touches upon issues such as understanding our enemies. The idea of not fighting them is gone into again, but it was in "Dawn", as well. We are yet again forced to face our own flawed humanity and shortcomings. This time it all takes place in an underground military bunker, where a team of scientists race against time to discover the solution to the growing problem, and the tension is raised further by the army forces there to protect them, who do not want to be there. The plot is great, and develops nicely throughout. Pacing is good. The acting ranges, but Sherman Howard certainly delivers a spot-on performance. I won't divulge details, but those who have already watched it know exactly what I mean. This arguably holds more loathsome characters than, well, the other two combined. Atmosphere is built masterfully, and this is intense, scary and nerve-racking. The special effects are impeccable. Let it be known: This is the goriest and most gruesome thus far in the series, and the blood and guts keep on coming this time around. There is no doubt that this is disgusting, and the detail on the zombies... they went all out. Apart from that, this contains a moderate amount of strong language. The Trilogy of the Dead 4-Disc DVD box-set holds some extras for this: A 20 minute behind-the-scenes featurette, 16 stills in 2 categories and a trailer. I recommend this to any fan of George, the franchise and/or the concept. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was done pretty well, although I couldn't believe it was worldwide, as it failed miserably in generating the true "it's the end" feeling, but it has some nice splatter, an adequate amount of gore, and some good character development. The start shows all the easiest ways something like this could spread, and while it's completely messed up, I could almost see it all happening. Almost. But not on a global level.Personally, I consider this the second best in the line, with Dawn in the lead, but Night is classic and none of those following come close to the atmosphere of the original. All in all? This is worth watching if you're a genre fan. If not, none of these will do much for you, really. But you'll never know, if you don't check them out for yourself. This is well written and well enacted, but you won't understand what's happening or why without first viewing the classic horror, George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead. It rates a 6.2/10 on the movie scale. It rates an 8.8/10 on the Romero scale. It rates an 8.2/10 on the splatter scale from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most underrated zombie movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most underrated horror films ever made. Romero crafts a deep, dark, and thought-provoking film about mankind and survival. A small group of survivors, mostly scientists and soldiers, live in an underground base and are trying to figure out a way to control the zombies. They most fight the zombies and fight each other. The claustrophobic setting of the film adds a dreary and dismal feel to the film. The acting is excellent and the special effects are some of the best ever put on the screen. Savini really stepped up and is the true Godfather of Gore! The film is worth watching just for the gore and the special fx. This is a film that was way ahead of it's time. Many horror fans are expecting another Dawn of the Dead esquire film (characters you like, a comfortable/relatiable setting), but Romero takes us out of comfortability and out of the shopping mall and throws us in a confined place with people we really don't care for. The film's pace is a little slow but the payoff is worthwhile. This is a very fun and intelligent zombie gore-fest that deserves to be held as what it is...a classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid B-Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a horror movie with zombies that takes place exclusively in an underground bunker (film studio), look no further!The plot takes place in Florida, where a small group of military-men and scientists are living in an underground bunker, periodically leaving by helicopter to search for other survivors. The longer they stay in their underground base, the more intense their feuding becomes. And of course all of the scientific progress is threatening to the military types for some reason, who just want to go around blasting zombies (even if that is a self-destructive attitude). Great Scott! Is that some '80s social commentary?! Anyway, the military guys are threatened by, or don't understand, the scientific progress (some of which is downright disturbing) and some of the film becomes a suspense piece between the survivor factions in the bunker. It works, but the monotonous scenery becomes irritating by the end. I mean, "Dawn of the Dead" had the same kind of thing going on, with the protagonists stuck in a mall. I suppose when zombies are roaming the land, it's hard NOT to hunker down in a fortress full of weapons, right? The acting in this one can be way over-the-top, which does sometimes work to the film's advantage. The leader of the military faction resembles Christopher Macdonald and goes authentically berserk at the drop of a hat. The protagonist, a female scientist, is the only female among the whole group. The romance between her and the weepy military guy was (intentionally?) pathetic and hilarious.I did not find this third "Dead" movie as compelling as the previous two, nor the later follow-up, "Land of the Dead". However, it is very watchable and contains some disturbing death scenes towards the end of the movie. We're talking top-notch gore, here. Yeah, the make-up was pretty dang impressive, I gotta say! I was actually pretty surprised where they went with some of those scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The lesser of the three, but only just.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this film after a long wait. I was expecting it to be a great film, aesthetically, but overall, an inferior film to Dawn of the Dead. I think I was more or less right.I must say, I think it is visually the best of the trilogy. The claustrophobic underground setting works well and the effects are fantastic, but I just kept thinking "I wish they had done that on Dawn.." because there is just real substance and a tremendous mood to Dawn. It has a lot more scale. Usually, this makes me overlook the generally poor effects in the film but it does detract from it slightly, if the expertise from this film was used on Dawn then it would've been a bit more perfect.Dawn of the Dead has a much stronger social commentary, that I appreciate more from watching this film in which that is less apparent. Day of the Dead seems almost two dimensional in comparison.Dawn works on a larger scale but still manages to focus on the characters effectively, this is not lost in Day but since it is mostly in the underground setting maybe it should have been more strongly developed.That said, I thought the story and characters of Day of the Dead were good. All of the original Romero Zombie movies are really original films and I think day has a valid place, really developing the first two, fitting with the Night-Dawn-Day concept.The dialogue is cheesy, but effective, however the swift pace and abundance of originality (that I guess lead to Land of the Dead,as that was what Romero wanted to do with it)such as the female lead, other people being less reasonable than the zombies and the concept of zombies becoming "civilised" makes it a worthy sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the best of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering that this film is about as far from what it was originally intended to be as possible, George A Romero did a remarkable job in shaping this film into a near masterpiece. The script is one of the best presented on celluloid, delivering line after line of razor sharp dialogue. Characterisation is a massive improvement on the previous two films, a considerable achievement considering that the last two were also fantastic horror films. Lori Cardille, Terry Alexander and Jarlath Conroy are brilliant as the only three characters who still seem vaguely human. However, to find the best roles, you need look no further than Joseph Pilato and Richard Liberty as Rhodes and Logan. The two leaders of the opposing factions amongst the survivors are sensational on their own, and the best scenes in the movie are the ones where they are verbally sparring with each other.The make-up was incredible and realistic. It hasn't dated in the slightest, although there are a couple of dodgy moments. The closing scenes in particular are visually impressive, and at times I found it a little difficult to watch. Saw can't make me think that, and thats basically the point of the Saw films.Romero's difficult third album comes good in every sense. While it has been criticised for being dialogue heavy, when the script is as good as this, thats no bad thing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a decent film in it's own right &amp; stands up well against the other Romero films too. It's quite good start to the film with the fake scare before the opening credits have even rolled &amp; a group of civilians with 1 soldier looking for survivors in what seems to be a ghost town but is full of the living dead.With the return back to the compound you see the civilians are in the minority in an underground military bunker where research is being done on the undead by a crazed scientist called Logan. There is definitely a big divide between the military &amp; the civilians &amp; quite a lot of animosity and frayed nerves of those living on the edge.Despite it's age this film still looks good, the effects stand up to close scrutiny. The script &amp; acting aren't fantastic, the people playing the soldiers all over-act like crazy playing their characters to the extreme. The scares are still good but not much more.Captain Rhodes is insane with power &amp; his men (what's left of them) aren't all that much saner than he is. As much as they want to leave the lead scientists question is very valid. Where would they go? The actual location itself is great. It certainly does look like an underground bunker. It was a mine, and is a storage facility now. The location supports the feeling of living in too close quarters with people getting cabin fever &amp; just wanting out, no matter where.The attempts to civilise or domesticate the zombies by Logan is quite an interesting idea, as is the reaction of the military who would much sooner kill them all. Private Steel is pretty much pushed over the edge after seeing 1 of his men killed &amp; having to kill another who was infected (even though he was begged by the man to kill him rather than become a zombie).The stand-off after this &amp; the idea you can prevent someone becoming a zombie by cutting off the effected limb are quite cool scenes. Sarah (the lead female scientist) is pretty much on the edge of hysteria herself there at the thought of having to possibly kill someone she cares about (Private Salazar, the 1 soldier who seems sane but on the brink of exhaustion).After finding out Dr Logan had not only been experimenting on the bodies of his men but also feeding them to Bub (the tame zombie), Captain Rhodes goes totally crazy &amp; kills Dr Logan &amp; his assistant Ted Fisher. He takes everyone prisoner &amp; insists the civilian helicopter pilot John flies just the soldiers to safety.Even though I've seen this film several times I still can't work out how Bub manages to undo his chains so easily. Salazar takes the lift to the surface. The scares where Sarah and William find the rock-slide are possibly the best in the entire film.John manages to jump Rhodes &amp; escape. I assume Salazar opens the gates to let the zombies in as he feels he is almost certainly going to become one anyway.There's a great goof that the American Football Zombie comes down on the elevator (he's the one who falls off) but ALSO comes through the corral entrance in a completely different part of the compound. I guess the director didn't think we'd be looking at the zombies that carefully.Bubs emotional outburst at finding Dr Logan dead was a completely new idea back then, that a zombie could care for someone. The special effects for the deaths of the remaining soldiers are really gory &amp; still look pretty darn amazing to be honest. Steel is the only one not killed by the zombies (shooting himself in the head) and his death effect is very convincing too.The scare when Sarah gets in the helicopter is very good (I'll be honest, pretty much all the scares apart from the very 1st which I remembered wasn't real managed to make me jump) and the weakest thing about this movie is the lack of an ending, Sarah, John &amp; William on a sandy beach somewhere just isn't enough for me.It still stands the test of time &amp; is far superior to its modern "remake". Highly worth a watch if your a horror fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contains some of most memorable Gory Deaths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am very Peaceful person but I love Romero's work. His Living Dead Series is one of my favorite movies tough I am not a huge Zombie movie Fan but Romero Zombie movies are treat to watch They are under-rated because of the Genre stamp on them otherwise the Social Commentary and Survival instinct made them very Intelligent movies of lot Day of the dead is probably the weakest of Romero series but in term of looks, Zombies and Gore its the best movie. The Opening sequence with Town overrun by Zombies is most horrific cinematic experience, alas we don't make these types of movies now a days The movie is shadowed by endless boring dialogs by some very average actors but the story was cool, Idea was not bad and execution was on the top. I hated the dialog delivery of actors but never forwarded the movie in more than 100 screenings so far But fact is that this is the best movie in term of some unusual violence and extreme Gore. I have seen some very bad and gory movies even the whole Cannibal series but the gore in this movie, the way three soldiers died in the end, one head literally got taken away, others skull was open from Eye area and Caption Rhodes split apart than eaten away,... they were the most horrific gory scenes to meIn short, you love Romero, you will enjoy the movie, You want to see some gr8 Zombies, See this masterpiece... for Gore hounds its must but people with Shakespearian acting etc ... don't watch this movie....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I received the video tape (yes, as in a VHS cassette!) of 'Day of the Dead' as a Christmas present in 1988. When I say I watched it so many times the tape eventually broke, I am not exaggerating.This is an under-appreciated masterpiece that apparently didn't do well when it opened in the mid-80's. I guess people were expecting the final chapter in Romer's trilogy to be some kind of apocalyptic war between the dead and the undead, complete with buckets of gore from start to finish. How sad that audiences missed true greatness.One of the many terrific things about 'Day' is that non-horror fans can enjoy it, too. Why? Because the dialogue is compelling, the drama between the survivors is believable and there are characters you genuinely care about. Plus, who can resist the attraction of Bub, the educated zombie? He, his comrades and his enemies are a joy to behold.Now, don't worry, gore-hounds...I assure you there is enough blood and guts to satisfy, particularly during the climactic last 20 minutes.Do yourself a favor and get lost in this hopefully-not-forgotten work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George A. Romero's Day of the Dead is my least favorite of his living dead series. This is not to say it is a bad venture, but I thought it lacked the innovativeness of his other works. Still, one has to remember Day of the Dead followed Dawn of the Dead, which was the pinnacle. It was a hard project to top. Moreover, Day of the Dead was not bad. At the outset, I know Romero could not create his original vision because of budget restraints, which resulted in another script. That being said, Romero worked with what he had, and pulled it off pretty well. This one picks up during the bleakest time in a very claustrophobic setting. At this point, scientists estimate there are 100,000 zombies per live human being. Our remnant has fortified its position in an old military station. It is an underground bunker surrounded by chain link fence above ground. In this facility, scientists Sarah (Lori Cardille), Logan (Richard Liberty), and Dr. Fisher (John Amplass) are trying experiments to solve the living dead problem. They are trying under duress as the military leaders Rhodes (Joseph Pilato) and Steel (G. Howard Klar) are becoming more and more antagonistic. They have lost men trying to get more zombie specimens. Caught in the middle are John (Terry Alexander) and Jarleth (William McDermot). They are the only ones who know how to fly the helicopter to get them out. Moreover, there are not enough seats. One scientist, Dr. Logan, has been doing experiments in hopes to domesticate the zombies. One in particular is Bub who starts to remember his former life. He is rewarded, but this appeasement comes at too high a price. I will get two gripes out of the way. First, it seems Romero was running out of ideas for the zombies. What could they do? Was there anything new for them? Not really. Second, the setting was too static. Remaining at one location was a bit too much. I know with Dawn, the setting was mostly at the mall, but there was also the boonies, Philadelphia, a television station, an airport, and even other mall stores. Here, we stay at one place far too long. However, this is also a benefit. Romero does create a claustrophobic atmosphere that is far more serious than Dawn of the Dead. There is also a heavy sense of despair comparable to Night of the Living Dead. He also relies more on the scares to match the overarching dread. This can also be attributed to the actors involved. Tension is prevalent, along with conflict, distrust, and even paranoia. It works and works well. Another good aspect was the juxtaposition of the zombie, Bub, with the military personnel. Bub has far more character and soul than the heartless grunts. Also, it seems that Romero might have made a statement against science. I don't know, I might have misread the interpretation. Yet, when I was watching this movie, I wondered if under such bleak conditions could the remaining living appease the living dead and domesticate them? It seemed the task was too daunting and far-fetched under the situation. In any case, this was not a bad venture for Romero. It just could not compare to his Dawn of the Dead masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Dead is the day that the zombies will rule the world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the dead is my favourite of all of George's series of dead movies. Why you ask. simple the gruesome special effects and the way the zombies looked too. Nowadays zombies don't look as frightening as they did in this film. The whole world of Day was dark, creepy and Claustrophobic. I found this one to be more realistic than the others. The fact that the characters were at each others throats added to the tense atmosphere and the undertone of the whole movie. This is possibly the only zombie film to still scare me when i watch it today. George crafts a world which could become real someday. Humans arguing about power when if they worked together, the whole situation could have been calmed. Instead the Army hate the Scientists who are trying to find a cure for the zombie virus. The scientists are trying to find a cure and the Army just wanna blow them away. As Dr Logan says "they have overrun us" so there is no way that the Army is gonna win. I love the inclusion of a thinking, feeling and slightly talking zombie in this. Some people found it ridiculous but why? They were trying to domesticate a zombie into not thinking of humans as food but friends. It's a novel touch to this dark film as it provides some laughs and heartfelt moments in Day which lighten the load of the darkest day the world has ever known this being of course the climax. Tom savini does a brilliant job making you think people who really dying by these undead creatures. A few scenes i was wincing and still do to this day. How they did it and made it so believable, i don't know...but Tom does and thats the beauty of Day of the Dead. This is a flesh eating zombie movie, so you expect to see zombies feasting and you do. No-one does it like Romero. He gives the blood hungry audience what they want in buckets. Yes a lot of people say that the climax is fairly fast and short. My advice would be don't complain to George, complain to the ass hole studio that made it. This film would not have worked as an R. All the good stuff would have gone, thank god George never backed down and allowed that to happen. He wanted a full on 18 cert horror and thats exactly what he has given us."He wanted to show us, what hell was like"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**********Ten Out OF Ten Stars**********Romero plunges us into the desperate plight of a government research team fighting to stay alive in an effort to find a cure for the living dead epidemic. The team is comprised of military and medical personnel and was assembled in haste before zombies overran the entire country; now the team is unsure if there are any other survivors. Their weekly helicopter searches turn up mile after mile of living dead zombies and deserted cities and towns. Their radio frequency searches always turn out the same? "Dead Air". Running low on ammunition, and lacking updated medical equipment and radio gear, the team is faced with gut wrenching decisions, as they fight to stay alive and make one last attempt to find a cure for the dead epidemic. Similar to Romero's first two dead movies, I couldn't help but to feel compassion for his character's struggles. If only others in Hollywood could build sympathy for protagonists like Romero does. I don't recommend this film to people unless they truly enjoy horror, they can stomach the violence, and they respect Romero's work. The exposition shows us the utter desperation and terror that the protagonists are experiencing as they make their weekly helicopter rounds in Florida searching for survivors. No matter that they travel hundreds of miles up and down the coast, everyone is dead. Throughout the film Romero preys on the audience with his sympathetic narrative convention. We feel sorry for the medical staff and even Bub, the zombie torn apart when Logan cashes out. Of course, Romero's heavy use of sympathy laden music really lays it on thick.Point-of-view shots are used effectively. At one point we are given the perspective of a character looking up at the zombies tearing him apart Over all the narration of this film is favored toward the medical staff's perspective. We see more of them and understand more about them than the military staff. Romero wants us to side with the medical staff as the plot thickens, which makes sense if you can hack your way through to the end of this brilliant picture</fullReview>

I have to file TRUE CLASSICS like: "NIGHT of the LIVING DEAD", "WHITE ZOMBIE" and "I WALK with a ZOMBIE" back in some other "CLASSICS" folder. "DAY of the DEAD", however, is a classic to be. It will eventually join these black &amp; white classics in infamy. "DAWN" has its moments, and could have benefited from some serious editing (the remake is an improvement). "NIGHT" is legendary. "DAY", however, will ultimately prove to be the most satisfying "DEAD" film for all of you that haven't REALLY discovered it yet (watch it again).

		<shortDescription>Makeup, direction save the "Day"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could say that the concept of zombies rising from the dead was sufficiently covered in "Night of the Living Dead," and you'd be right. On the other hand, as far as sequels go, this one's mighty entertaining and absolutely worthwhile.As with the first two "Dead" films, the plot of "Day of the Dead" could be written on the back of a postcard, and you'd still have room left over to doodle. Zombies have taken over the United States, and only a handful of scientists and troops in Florida are left to save humanity from their grip.Of course, no one watches a zombie film for plot, and George Romero's vivid direction keeps the film on a fast track. Especially notable are Tom Savini's remarkable makeup and special effects, which offer extreme gore that you just can't ignore. The propulsive synth score is very '80s and very captivating. The acting is overwrought at times, but as with all "Dead" films, you're not looking for "Great Performances" here. While it's hard to get excited about another retelling of the zombie story, Romero and Savini do a decent job raising the dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the title say's it all. Romero had a nice idea when he was writing this film. Putting a small group into a bunker, while the world outside has been overrun by zombies. The movie could have been really shocking, intense, claustrophobic and psychological. But somehow, it isn't. Somehow i was neither scared, nor shocked from the way the people acted. Maybe because most of them were to stereotype. We've got the evil general, who's tyrannizing the scientists, because he doesn't understand their work. We've got the crazy scientist, who's doing terrifying experiments with those living dead. We've got the crazy lieutenant and the clinical doctor, who's only trying to do her work. So in the and all the characters are doing, what we expect from the to do and there won't be too much surprises within the movie. In the end, it's a nice movie for a rainy Sunday evening, but nothing worth watching again or that stays in mind any longer, so it's 6 of 10 Stars on my scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Horror Classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Romero's third instalment of his zombie series the dead now outnumber the living by 400,000 to one. A group of scientists and soldiers hide out in an underground missile silo. The scientists want to study the undead to find a way of controlling them, while the military just want to "blow the p*ss" out of them. Romero has said that he originally planned this to be the 'Gone With The Wind' of horror movies ? the zombie movie to end all zombie movies, and a true epic of the genre. Due to lack of funds, however, the script for 'Day Of The Dead' had to be re-penned and scaled-down dramatically. For me, though, 'Day Of The Dead' has always been the most impressive entry in Romero's living dead series. Although the previous two movies, 'Night Of The Living Dead' and 'Dawn Of The Dead', are undeniably landmark classics in their field, 'Day Of The Dead' far out-classes them both visually and technically. Bolder, bloodier and more unrelentingly grim in tone than its predecessors, the film is an apocalyptic vision of a doomed mankind, and it's telling that it was released at a time when the threat of nuclear war still loomed large. It's very talky for a horror movie, and has often gained criticism because of this. But the tensions that build between the two rivalling factions are an integral part of the story, creating a claustrophobic feel, and thus adding to the real horror of the situation they find themselves in. The performances in 'Day Of The Dead' are way above average for the genre; most notably those of Lori Cardille as the strong female lead, Sarah, Joe Pilato as the nasty Capt. Rhodes, the late Richard Liberty as the eccentric Dr. Logan, TV actor Terry Alexander as the sympathetic John (one of the few characters Sarah can relate to), and not forgetting Howard Sherman as 'Bub' ? the one zombie with some 'human' instincts (the true star of the picture!). Much of the film is shot inside (underlining the budget restrictions, perhaps), but there's also some nice cinematography on show, particularly during the opening scenes (Anchor Bay's Divimax Region 1 special edition DVD really does justice to this, showing off the rich colours as you'll never have seen on VHS). Another thing that puts 'Day Of The Dead' leagues ahead of other genre offerings is the exceptional special effects by Tom Savini, which really come into their own during the gory last half-hour of the movie. Generally underrated, 'Day Of The Dead' is easily as good as the preceding two movies, and far better than Romero's recent follow-up, 'Land Of The Dead'. In my opinion, this ranks not only as one of Romero's best movies, but one of the truly great horror movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day Of The Dead (1985) is awesome film it also scared me as a young boy in High School when I rented &amp; saw the Pan &amp; Scan Full Screen Version on VHS. This isn't like Dawn which was a comic book type with some campy aspects &amp; a sense of humor Day is the darkest of the dead films &amp; is very serious with no humor involved. I haven't see Land yet so maybe it is darker then Day I don't know. Day will always be my favorite though &amp; the darkest to me no matter what. Tom Savini's Zombie Make-Up &amp; Gore Effects are so groundbreaking in this film. It is his best work I'd say he won The Saturn Award for it also. The best Zombie Make-Up I'd say a lot of latex appliances used &amp; fake teeth. This time Savini had a crew of guys working behind him with the Zombie Make-Up &amp; Gore Effects. The Zombie Carnage in the film is the most intense ever done in a Zombie Movie. Bub is really cool &amp; is the best Zombie ever I'd say Howard Sherman did a brilliant job with Bub. He gave ideas to Romero &amp; they tried it. Romero is a very open minded Director the headphone music scene was Howard's idea he was walking home one day after a shoot. Thinking what would Bub do with a Walkman what would he make of that? So he told George he should be listening to Betehoven. They tried it &amp; the scene worked out great. The best parts are when the Zombies rip apart the Army Guys. Especially Rhodes he gets his. He was a mean son of a bitch. I also got the 2 Disc Special Edition in Oct. 2006 from Anchor Bay Entertainment who also released The Ultimate Edition Dawn Set that I have. Nice stuff on Day the movie is presented in it's original 1.85:1 Widescreen Aspect Ratio. That is on Disc 1 with 2 different Audio Commentaries. Disc 2 is full of extras. A 15 min. Audio Interview with Richard Liberty who played Dr. Logan in the film. Trailers, T.V. Spots Photo Galleries. Also has 2 Documentaries 1 about the making of the film. The other is behind the special effects Zombie Make-Up &amp; Gore. It focuses on Savini &amp; his Crew's stuff. At Monsterbash 2007 I am getting my 2 Disc Set autographed by him. This is the best Zombie movie ever 10 out of 10! best Zombie movie ever 10 out of 10 for this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>------Warning, possibly contains spoilers!------- I loved this movie. Simply spectacular, and a must-see for zombie film lovers, and people who just like to think. I did not like it quite as much as Dawn of the Dead, but it was still a simply amazing movie. How it got a 6.7 average is beyond me. I liked the ending, but thought it could have been better. I think the main reason I prefer Dawn was due to that little part of me that just loves the idea of holing up inside a mall with a bunch of guns, ammo, food, and just having fun. Nonetheless, though this does not happen in this movie, it was still a great watch nonetheless. I did not find the movie particularly frightening, so much as it was somewhat shocking, due to the huge amounts of gore. I have to say, I think this was one of the bloodier if not the bloodiest of the movies. The movie brings up some very interesting things that are certainly worth thinking about, and questions we should ask for the sake of bettering ourselves and society generally. Once again, I find myself looking for the huge differences between ourselves, and Romero"s zombies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it's one thing George Romero has down its character creation and reaction. Thus far in the zombie movies all we've seen are people who flee in terror of the zombies; in this installment however, we find most of the people to have pent claustrophobic aggression from hiding out. We find the group mourning the death of their recently deceased leader and now oppressed by an extremely aggressive new one who takes no prisoners and no b.s. The conflict of interests is so real you'll swear this wasn't happening. Acting is more than top notch, those who starred in this did an extremely good job at creating tension between parties. I don't think I can say this is better than Dawn of the Dead but it's a toe to toe match and a complete step forward. The zombie carnage is also gritty and disgusting but completely satisfying. If you've seen and enjoyed Night and Dawn then Day should be more than a satisfying entry for your tastes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoyed Night of the Living Dead then inevitably you must make it here to the final part of the Dead Trilogy. This film was too bleak for the audience it was released for in the 1980's (imagine that!), but to a modern audience Day of the Dead seethes with undead issues. With no spoilers, the location is perfect, the character development more elaborate than the previous films, and the zombie gore some of the most extreme. The final attacks I will always remember as some of the most gruesome deaths I have ever seen. The recent remake of Dawn of the Dead copied many things from this film as well. After finally completing the original Romero trilogy I can say that these are the three best zombie films in existence. For Romero it seems the zombies are just a neutral antagonist that predetermines so much of the film's narrative. The rest is human beings interacting in a state of survival which creates a better tension than any regular monster could. Human beings versus each other is the more frightening than any undead creature could appear to be.</fullReview>

None of the characters were memorable, or likable for that matter. The action and high tension of DAWN OF THE DEAD were all lost, and the interesting location gone. Instead we are treated to an underground mine-like cave. Most of the movie is spent watching scientists get yelled at by a brutal military group. The only zombie action comes in the last 10 or so minutes of the movie. The only good thing about this movie that I can think of is the gore, which was excellent, although there were not many gory moments. Unless you are a gore hound like me, I doubt you will find much to like in the last installment of Romero's DEAD trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this on opening day in 1985 and enjoyed it as a nifty addition to the series although it doesn't really wrap it up. Even shot on a low 3 million budget, the film looks great with some of Romero's tightest direction. The claustrophobia enhances the fear and dread in this underworld of the dead.I enjoyed the cast and characters, their crazed debates and sense of general madness, especially the lone woman dynamic. The film isn't as dark as it may seem and there's plenty of humor given the subject. You get the EC comic spirit of the film after a severed head's eyes dart around as a bat flies away in the bg.Of course, Tom Savini is one of the real stars as his outstanding graphic make-up is even better than Dawn. Special props to the great zombie Bub and Joe Pilato's out of control military man. It's a special kind of movie performance and he runs with it until his utterly perfect comeuppance. Hint: it involves flesh-eating zombies.Strange that this is considered a "flop" as a 3 million dollar film making 35 million worldwide in 1985 is hardly a flop. While lacking the consumer satire of Dawn, DOTD presents a fascinating look at a societal breakdown.Oh yeah, and cool zombies getting torn apart a dozen different ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Savini....'nuff said.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the third installment in George A. Romero's infamous 'Dead' trilogy. With all due respect to 'Night of the Living Dead' and the brilliant 'Dawn of the Dead', this is my favorite film in the series. It might even be the best film of the zombie genre. It would certainly rank as the most underrated.Released in 1985, this was the culmination of carnage. Most of the world had been ravaged by the dead, and the few survivors have gone underground to devise a survival strategy. It's never clear whether or not there are any other survivors left on the planet aside from the cast of this movie, which helps add an atmosphere of uncertainty. The mood is very grim and depressing, which is one of the factors that led to an abbreviated theatrical run. Most people chose to watch 'Return of the Living Dead' instead, because it was more of a dark comedy and didn't take itself seriously. But this aura of hopelessness was what Romero wanted. In 'Night', he wanted a movie that would shock audiences. In 'Dawn', he wanted to make some strong social commentary. I mean would you be ecstatic to have zombies as YOUR neighbors? The movie stars (among others) Linda Cardille, Joe Pilato and, in an unforgettable performance, Richard Liberty as Dr. 'Frankenstein'. It takes place inside of an underground facility in Florida, where a group of civilians, scientists, and soldiers try to find a solution to the zombie plague above. Most of the actors turn in very strong performances and really make the film seem real. The only quarrel that I have is that the military men seem a little mentally unstable, but perhaps this was intentional given their surroundings. Cardille's character Sarah seems to be the voice of reason among the group, but she has a difficult time convincing Captain Rhodes (Pilato) that their research is producing any quality results. Their words soon escalate to violence and a war brews, not between the surviving humans and the undead, but between the living themselves.In typical Romero fashion, this film contains some great dialogue, particularly the scene when Sarah is in 'The Ritz' with John and McDermott. There is gore galore, which should please any hardcore zombie movie fan. Trust me this film is not for the faint of heart. I'm giving this movie an 8/10. It's not perfect, but it's darn close. I kind of wish Romero could have made the film as he originally intended (buy the special edition DVD and you'll know what I'm talking about).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another George A. Romero Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of scientist and military are held up in an underground shelter after the Earth has been over-run by Zombies, who want to eat them. Some of are losing their sanity and one is collapsing from stress. They are running out of ammunition, liqueur (always a bad thing) and their equipment is hopelessly outdated. Think things can't get any worse? Wait until Capt. Rhodes takes over.This is one of my favorite movies of all time, not just horror movies but all genres. It has it all, drama, suspense, comedy, horror and something few horror movies have...heart. Excellent plot, great character development and Richard Liberty's performance as the kooky, awkward scientist Dr. Logan was Oscar worthy, in my opinion. I have also always been drawn to movies with a strong female leads and Lori Cardille does a brilliant job as Sarah.I Highly recommend this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow.. almost great zombie/gore flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just bought this movie, and it is the only Romero zombie flick I had not seen.It is very good. The gore is top notch, but only comes in spurts,lots near the end and some near the beginning.The story is good, the production values and sets very good.The acting ranges from good to completely immersing me into the story.Howard Sherman as Bub the trained zombie is amazing and adds a lot to this movie in a "human sense".I have to warn gore lovers,even tho this has a lot of amazing gore, there is much more character development in this one and Romero seems to concentrate on this aspect more then the blood stuff , we barely see the zombies in the first hour. Still I did not mind, it was a very good, almost great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heavy thinking: "You've given us a mouthful of Greek Salad." Great Caesar's Ghost. In the last chapter of George Romero's "Dead" trilogy, like the late comedian, Rodney Dangerfield, gets no respect. The critical establishment had no problem dropping a "one-star" bomb on this film's box office carcass. This is a shame. And unfair. But despite the plethora of negative reviews the movie generated on its initial release, back in 1985, and to this day, the film (I feel) is a rip-roaring good time for anyone in search of classic horror. Created by George Romero, the world-of-the-dead pictured here is a unique and a wacky vision of the sub-genre of walking cadavers. Another director may deliver a competently made zombie flick on a whim, but it would lack the flavor of a "Romero" job. Romero edits his movies like a kid diving into a pile of Christmas presents. His off-the-cuff technique achieves a seamless and spectacular result. All the Romero trademarks are present: strong female lead, noble black helicopter pilot, memorable opening shot, and a unique location, the Wampum Mines in Pennsylvania. The zombies have a little more spirit and lurch forward in a higher gear than in previous entries. The military men are portrayed as psychotic Neanderthals in need of shore leave. The scientists don't fair much better. They wouldn't receive an invitation to Bub's birthday bash. The cat who plays "Bub" deserves special praise for delivering a perfect-note performance. Joe Pilato (Rhodes) chews the underground scenery like a snarling rat. He blurts out some of the oddest rants ("I'm running this monkey farm") and flamboyant speeches that have ever been heard by a living moviegoer. Creative touch: Bub thumbs a copy of Stephen King's "Salem's Lot." Tom Savini's make-up is top notch and a feast for the eyes. His "Blue Zombies" resort to copious displays of bad behavior. The ending on the beach gives just the right piece of meat for the barbecue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Romero classic! Highly underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead is the third movie in George A Romero's classic tale of the world being overrun by zombies. I find that this a very underrated movie. The FX (done by legendary Tom Savini) are the greatest of any George A Romero film (in my opinion) and the characters are developed brilliantly. The sense of dread and claustrophobia throughout the film is really well done, despite the simple plot.Set after Dawn of the Dead, this takes place in a army bunker. The world is now overrun by zombies, they outnumber the human race. Some of the survivors lock themselves up in an old military silo. Half are scientists and the other half are military men. Tensions are rising as the scientists, head by the nutcase Dr. "Frankenstein" Logan, are capturing and running tests on zombies. Unfortunately, Dr. Logan's tests are a little on the nutty side. Soon, the scientists and army men are fighting each other amongst the horde of zombies.Romero has really accomplished a lot on such a low budget. The cast are all fine and the acting surprised me, since low budget horrors tend to have shoddy acting. The FX are outstanding and some of the effects are quite disgusting. The pacing is a bit slow, but not so slow that it doesn't hold your interest. The apocalyptic atmosphere is done to great effect. And for those who love their zombie carnage, you will not be disappointed, as the last 20 mins involve huge amounts of feastings and other disgusting bodily mutations.It's a shame that this Romero gem is so disliked. The reason I think this is not as popular is because it had to follow in the footsteps of the fantastic Dawn of the Dead, which had an entirely different feel. It was much more upbeat and comical then straight out horror, which this most certainly is. The slow set-up and dark feel probably put off a lot of people. But for the hard-core horror fans, don't be put off, this is an underrated gem.3?/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This in my opinion was george a. romero going out of his box. it was an extremely creative and original zombie movie next to the one that started it all, "Night of the Living Dead." This movie also showed the talent that the great tom savini has with special effects. when the zombie rolled off the table and his organs spilled everywhere, i literally jumped up screaming "that was so cool man." a lot of people didn't like this movie, but unfortunately, the movie didn't get sufficient funding, so that's why it's a little boring. however i did still like how it took on more of the scientific role for explaining why zombies act like they do. I was so impressed, that when i bought it i watched it almost everyday for 3 months. george a. romero proved in this movie once again that he is the god of zombie movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Zombie amongst the pigeons!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era when the overblown action thriller was king, 'Day of the Dead' slipped unassumingly under the radar. Aliens, Predator and the like proved that the 80's moviegoer wanted action and swashbuckling by the bucket load, with little or no room left for anything that tried to be atmospheric or dramatic in its tone. Neither did it help that the prequel to this film was a rip-roaring smash and grab of a movie that has become, not only a cult classic, but a watermark for how fun the movie making business can truly be with the wonderfully crude gore of Tom Savini and the zombie slapping antics that went on throughout. Anyone who loved 'Dawn of the Dead' was therefore disappointed by this movie. Despite the fact that it has become a cult classic amongst the hordes of zombie fans it is still the least recognised of all the Romero zombie flicks.But the film's newly founded cult status is one that is rightly deserved. It did not try to be a direct sequel to 'Dawn' but rather portray a more apocalyptic view of the zombie attack. It is a claustrophobic movie, showing the effects of isolation and Paranoia and closely resembles the Cold War tensions of years gone by; another example of George A Romero elevating the genre beyond a simple gore fest. The zombies are constantly referred to but have little impact until the movies climax and it is more an exercise in the effects of isolation and the subsequent conflict that irises from people compelled to live and work together in a confined space.In this movie the truly fearful characters are the humans that are trapped in the bunker. No more so than Dr Logan or 'Frankenstein' as he is affectionately dubbed. We are led to believe that he is conducting experiments on the zombies; even managing to tame one to not want to tear his guts out anymore, an accomplishment that is actually more endearing than it sounds. In fact Logan's creation 'Bub' steals the show in many respects. You actually end up rooting for him to survive over the living residents. He strikes a somewhat tragic image, and brings back into full light the fact that these dead guys are the true victims that should be given sympathy as well as feared. As things ultimately fall apart, it is the characters that destroy themselves with typical Romero style. For some this leaves a sour taste, as we do not feel a tangible degree of pathos for a group of people that were not all that likable in the first place. However, as the film states it is 'The darkest day of horror the world has ever seen' and rightly a fitting end to this trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1985 had three great zombie movies, and then there was Day of the Dead. Unlike Return of the Living Dead, Dead End, and especially Re-Animator, Day of the Dead just kind of sits there, with more screen time given to unlikable characters yelling at each other, than to rampaging zombies. The most sympathetic person in the movie is Bub the zombie, when he learns his friend the mad scientist has been killed. You really feel sorry for him, where as you don't feel anything for any of the humans. The only thing that makes some of the human characters remotely sympathetic is that they're not presented as complete creeps like all the others. Joe Polato is one of the worst bad guys you're likely to see on film, sneering and scowling and sticking out his jaw like a motorcycle thug in a bad '50's Roger Corman movie. It's worth seeing, but you might be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I haven't written a review for one of my all-time favourite movies yet! It's the perfect ending to one of the best trilogies ever, taking the strengths of the former movies and combining them for the climax.Where to begin ... ? The special effects are virtually flawless (and I've seen this film at least 25 times) Tom Savini absolutely out-does himself in this one. 20 years on and the gore fx are better than loads of films today. Even better than Land of the Dead. On first viewing I once thought some of the acting was a bit poor but of the main characters I've changed my mind. They're all actually pretty damned good.Romero was restricted by budget on this one, as with his original NOTLD. In contrast to Land of the Dead, Day of the Dead's setting is perhaps more realistic. Furthermore, due to it's limited scope for action (as far as we know, 12 people left in the world), Romero has had to try much harder with the script and rely less on dime-a-dozen action sequences.If you're planning to see this and are expecting a Hollywood 'roller-coaster' ride, then look elsewhere. This film is very dialogue driven and sticks to the general theme that runs through the trilogy: when the going gets tough, everything falls apart! Day of the Dead is dark, gloomy, very violent and has a 100% Hollywood-free feel to it. In this era of movie tripe, that reason alone is sufficient reason to go watch it.The cut in budget was the best thing Producer Richard Rubenstein could have done. Thanks to George Romero for making such a brilliant film on his own terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are they fighting Zombies or themselves?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say this movie, like all Romero's zombie flicks is outstanding. The characters all have depth and memorable lines. Like in all Romero's zombie movies, He depicts how a group of survivors can not only breakdown , but to the point of fighting each other. Take Night of the living Dead for example. Everybody is against each other by the end of the movie. In Dawn of the Dead, Tom Savini, along with his rogues also ambush Stephen and crew, resulting in a bloody shootout with them as well as the Zombies.Back to the movie. I don't want to ruin it, but it contains many original ideas never thought of in a Zombie movie. Of course this movie is from 1985. and now a days the ideas are all but burnt out. In this movie we actually see Dr. Logan trying to teach "Bub" the good Zombie how to talk on a telephone and shoot a gun, which later in the movie becomes essential to him(Bub) in a life &amp; death situation.There is plenty of action and gore(compliments of Tom Savini's special effects makeup) real character depth. as I earlier stated.There is even a hint of humor or irony as I better see it. Miguel Salazar, one the military soldiers seems to be having a sexual relationship with Susan(we never see anything supporting this, but it's obvious in the movie) My question is. If he is the only guy actually getting action why(those of you who have seen the movie have noticed?) does he seem to be gay(I don't mean happy cause he is getting some)I mean all his lines and movements depict him as being homosexual. Check out the tone of his voice. Also throughout the movie his nickname seems to be "Yellow Spik" Aside from that. The cast is great. Susan is the most responsible and ready to act in the spur of the moment type of person. Billy, always drunk, but humorous in every way possible. John(he is the "flyboy of this movie) is carefree and always willing to take of in his "Wirly Bird" and find some island and soak up some sun ,while there is still time left. My favorite is Captain Rhodes, played magnifically by Joseph Pilato. He is cruel ,mean, and ruthless up until his last scene. Steel is cool too. He delivers the funny lines, even when he is serious......and "Bub" the first Zombie ever with feelings. This is really a masterpiece of cinema. Recently released on DVD by ZIMA co. They specialize in all kinds of horror movies. It cost me $9.00 and included 3 other movies. A definite favorite of mine. If you're a fan of "good and intelligent" Zombie movies, then you will enjoy this one too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed, but brilliant diamond!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third chapter of George A. Romero's zombie saga, has always been considered as an example of how low budget can hurt a great script, as what Romero conceived as the ultimate zombie epic received a modest budget that forced major changes that resulted in a less ambitious, almost low profile movie.Despite the monetary problems, Romero's "Day" went to become a cult classic among fans, as he managed to put as much of his vision as the budget allowed him. With the aid of make-up master Tom Savini, Romero crafted some of the most haunting images of gore and violence of its time. "Day of the Dead" is not a perfect movie, and suffers the low budget as very few do; however, it is an enjoyable movie that every horror fan must see, specially in it's complete unrated version.The events of "Day of the Dead" happen after the zombie epidemic has become uncontrollable, and humans are forced to live underground. Inside of a military bunker, the remaining survivors of a military unit try to survive. Under the regime of psychotic Capt. Rhodes (Joseph Pilato), a group of scientists lead by Dr. Logan (Richard Liberty) try to find a cure for the epidemic. The conflicts between Rhodes's army and Logan's scientists are frequent, and the sexual tension between the men and the only female member of the team, Sarah (Lori Cardille), just complicate the situation. They will face their worst enemy: themselves.Romero's take on the army is a strong cometary about the use of military force; however, the scientists doesn't get any better as Dr. Logan seems to be more focused on his own purposes than in aiding humanity. In the middle of the chaos only Sarah seems to remain sane as she is the voice of reason most of the time. Apparently, for Romero, society is doomed to be destroyed by itself."Day of the Dead" is a powerful movie, the social cometary that Romero always puts in his movies doesn't feel forced or out of place; this time it is really the backbone of the movie and the center of the character's problems. As his other zombie movies, the stories are not about zombies, but about the people trapped in a claustrophobic scenario trying to work together but failing because of greed, selfishness or any other human trait.And there is the flaw of the movie; while everything is set for a horror epic, something just doesn't work completely. The movie feels too short and the production values are indeed lower than what we saw in "Dawn of the Dead". The movie had the potential of becoming the best movie of its type but the budget just could not allow that to happen. However, a lot of credit must go to Romero for making the most with very few resources.The acting is not outstanding, but certainly is a lot better as a whole than in "Night" or "Dawn". On the other hand, the make-up effects are extraordinary and a step forward in Savini's career. Here he took to the limit all he learned in the past and created memorable gory scenes.Although flawed, it still is miles ahead most movies of its kind. "Day of the Dead" truly deserves its cult status as it is a classic of the horror genre and an inspirational movie for many filmmakers. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The living have lost the war. As one scientist puts it, "we are in the minority now, something like 400,000 to one by my calculation." Day of the Dead, like [ http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001681/ ]Romero's other Dead movies, follows a pocket of survivors and their feeble attempts to, well, survive. These survivors, some scientists, some soldiers, have held up in an old World War II bunker. The head scientist, properly nicknamed "Dr. Frankenstein," is trying a new approach to the zombie problem. Instead of trying to eradicate them, which he says is impossible, he tries to domesticate them. The soldiers, of course, are ardently opposed to this, and they become the real antagonists. Many acclaim Day of the Dead to be the worst in the Dead series. They're right. Day of the Dead lacks part of what what makes the other movies good: new ideas. Day of the Dead barely keeps pace, and many times the over-the-top acting and boring duologue take over the movie. On the other hand, Day of the Dead goes into the scientific side of zombies, and acts as sort of a documentary of them. Everything you've ever wondered about zombies from the first two movies is cleared up here. (The) one new idea involves a zombie's mind. In Day of the Dead, it explains how zombies can develop mentally over time. Dr. Frankenstein's best student is a zombie named Bub. Bub has remembers how to hold a gun, how a phone works, and how a book works. This is a must-see for those interested in zombies, but for others it may be a bit boring. Good as a documentary, bad as a movie. 6/10 stars for most, but personally 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ultimate in Romero's Dead Quadrilogy and sadly much overlooked by many who cannot see the depth of the piece. Romero gives us the apocalyptic vision of the future (or lack of any real future) The characters find themselves to be the under dogs and the ones who have no future in this bleak vision of the zombie society. The zombies has now become the ultimate consumers and changed the very core of society, yet the few surviving humans still cannot live in peace together. Drawing from his earlier work Romero has surpassed himself with this film, to give the audience the ultimate in societal disintegration! The suicide of Miguel says it all, he sees no way out other than to join the stenches and allow them to destroy the enemy within.As usual Romero gives the audience, what is essentially a 1 act piece - the viewer is dropped into the chaos and then left wondering about the outcome. Why should all films have a resolved ending? Why don't we just leave the characters as we found them, unsure about the future! If most films give us a narrative state similar to the theory of Edward Brannigan, Equilibrium - disequilibrium - return to equilibrium then Romero jumps straight for the disequilibrium, and why not! A first rate film that every Zombie fan must have seen, if you have not then put it at the top of your wish list - you will not be disappointed</fullReview>

It's not something I would reminisce about but I wouldn't do that with Land of the Dead either. It is rather gory in fact excessively gory to the point of being repulsive.

		<fullReview>Day of the Dead is the third in Romero's classic "Of the Dead" Trilogy and certainly the most underrated of the bunch, it is the weakest of the 3 but by no means a bad way to end the trilogy.Comparing it to the other films in the trilogy, the gore is top-notch, over the top and frequent, the way I love it. The story itself isn't bad either, it follows the typical zombie movie formula, zombies take over the world, people find a place to defend themselves, zombies break in, people die. The difference in Day of the Dead, however, is that the people in question are scientists and soldiers working toward freeing the world from zombie domination living in an underground facility. Logan (creepily) played by Richard Liberty is trying to tame the undead - making them "remember" when they were alive. Enter Bub, a tame zombie, who can shoot a damn gun! (Wait until you see the salute scene at the end - classic) Like the films before it, a rift opens between the two groups(scientists and military) resulting in the undead gaining entrance to the facility and the untimely deaths of most of the people living inside.The acting isn't great but it isn't bad either, but hey, this is a zombie film, if you want Oscar worthy acting you've picked the wrong genre.My only minor quibble with this movie is the unbearably rubbish electronic score, which hasn't yet failed to annoy me completely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a timeless classic of a horror film. Not only are the characters slowly going insane from being locked down in an old World War 2 bunker,shut off from the rest of the world. Which,seems to be pretty much dead. They really don't get along as you have the scientists wanting to do experiments on the Zombie's to either figure out what caused the Zombie Holocaust in the first place or they want to learn to train them like a dog, to curb their impulse to eat the living.And,in this one the Zombies show they have a lot of past memories &amp; impulses within, as they salute fellow Military,shoot guns &amp; even try to speak. Namely the zombie character Bub, who at times when he is in scenes with Dr Frankenstein, wins you over as he becomes a "docile" Zombie.And, you have the a***hole marines or army guys who just want to live their lives destroying the Zombie hoard &amp; making threats to kick the asses of their room-mates the scientists unless they do everything, the new power-mad General says, which would've included the rape of the female character in the bunker,if he had his way in the film.So,needless to say they all hate each other,which causes severe dislike &amp; paranoia amongst the group. Then when the Dr Frankenstein character gets caught experimenting with the military's recently dead cadavers &amp; feeding his friend Bub, bloody pieces of recently dead corpses,the Military guys freak out &amp; start to kill the scientists. Meanwhile,one of the military guys wigs out after being bitten by a Zombie &amp; having his arm amputated, to prevent the spread of infection ( in truly one of the most Brutal Gore scenes in horror ever!!!!)goes &amp; opens the gates to let the Zombie mass in, &amp; so begins probably the goriest(except for Dead Alive) Zombie all-you-can eat Human Buffet in Horror History! I really liked the more decaying Zombies in this one, as in this &amp; in Land Of The DEAD they actually look terrifying as in Night &amp; in 1978's Dawn, they look dead,but not scary, as it's just blue/green pancake make-up.In this,they are straight up decaying &amp; bloody. And vicious,as since their are hardly any live humans left they are ravenously hungry, &amp; don't just bite their victims to get a few nibbles in &amp; spread the contagion. They rip these boys APART!!!! &amp; it is gory! One of my all time favorite cinematic scenes EVER!!!! I hear their re-making this film, to be a sequel of sorts, to the 2004 Dawn Of the dead remake. Please do it with lots of gore, if you want to show the re-make respect, that I thought the remade Dawn,did do.It'll be interesting to see how they fend them off, since these newer remake zombies are severely mean &amp; are runners,if their recently dead. Idon't think a worse death could happen, then having a bunch of massively stinky corpses pull or tear with their teeth, you apart (except for may-be a shark,picking you apart in the Ocean). The Zombie Clown rules as well. Very cool film! A must for all true Horror Movie Fans.***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It makes sense that creative writer/director George A. Romero would call his third zombie movie "Day of the Dead." After all, first there was "Night of the Living Dead" and then "Dawn of the Dead."This third installment focuses on a woman and a few friendly others taking shelter in an underground bunker in Florida with a bunch of vulgar, sexist Army men while the cannibalistic corpses roam the streets of the Sunshine State (as well as the rest of the world). The make-up effects are terrific, and the movie has a fast pace even though it's rather talky for over an hour. Still, it's really good.To add, the friendly zombie 'Bub' is a riot. Director George A. Romero is billed in the credits as playing the "zombie in the scarf."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Review includes some very minor spoilers, nothing that would hinder anyone from experiencing the wonder of this movie first-hand*I am one of those people who really likes horror movies but hardly ever has a chance to watch any. So, although I am a fan of the genre I can't be said to be very familiar with some of its most famous milestones. Every now and then, however, an opportunity offers itself, and I seize it as greedily as a starving zombie would grab a juicy piece of living flesh. This Halloween, I *finally* got to to see Day of the Dead. It was an all night horror movie marathon, so I had the chance to re-view Night, Dawn and then...Day of the Dead. To me, of the Dead trilogy this was by far the best. Night was extremely atmospheric and spooky, Dawn was somewhat gory and a bit slow, Day was simply perfect. The underground complex, as has been pointed out, is starkly dark and gritty, sunlight is unknown to these tomb of a place, where the last (is it the last? We cannot be sure but there is no evidence to believe otherwise) remnant of humanity is desperately grasping at straws and trying, against the odds, to survive. By the time the action starts, we meet a world that has been overrun by the dead. A small group of scientists, backed up by a dysfunctional military cell is studying the zombies, hoping to find an answer to their predicament.But, as usual, problems arise from within and the living prove to be as dangerous as the dead. All this creates a tension that is never fully experienced in any of the other Dead movies. Another thing that adds to this is the zombies themselves. A lot has already be said on the subject, but I must mention how staggering the zombies were, how life-like (no pun intended) they seemed and the degree of gruesome detail that went in their characterization was flawlessly perfect. And the gore is outstanding. And we are exposed to all sorts of violent deeds perpetrated on the living that are ripped apart, clawed apart, eaten alive, bitten, shot at, chased, all this delivered with the highest degree of realism, with splattering insides spread for our delight and gallons of blood.It is the details that make this the best Dead movie: the way Logan's lab coat is always blood stained, the autopsies he performs on the zombies, the trick of training and even teaching a zombie to somewhat respond to human emotions- all this might not be necessary for the narrative itself but it adds layers of significance and moments of priceless imagery that Dawn, for example, never manages to achieve. *Minor spoiler*My only pet peeve about this movie is the ending. I do not believe it lived up to the all encompassing hopelessness that pervades the whole movie. Romero has justified himself on this particular subject, and so I can grant Day of the Dead ten out of ten. *End spoiler*It is almost redundant to say it, but if you are into zombies and are not afraid of graphic violence on screen, by all accounts, watch this movie! You will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Commando or Day Of The Dead?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know how it goes, standing in your local video store, surrounded by wall to wall choice, just how do you make your mind up.Back in 1985, when 'Day Of The Dead' was first released onto video, laser discs where still hot and the DVD machine was but a twinkle in some manufacturer's eye, there was I, but a mere teenager at the age of fifteen year of age, standing there holding in one hand the latest Arnie blockbuster and in the other, a groovy looking horror movie.Needless to say, after thinking to myself, 'Comando' or 'Day Of The Dead' I quickly came to my senses and hired the latter. It is safe to say that two decades on, this film still rocks my world.Having watched countless rip offs and other assorted zombies movies purporting to pass themselves off as entertainment, none of them can hold a candle to this low budget masterpiece.Expertly written and directed, George A. Romero concocted for me the perfect exercise in tension complete with the exercise in character study. From every factor of working life, various persons and their respective professions are brought together to bring about some rhyme from the dreaded reason as to why the dead have taken over the earth.Pitch perfect casting, my personal favourites even to this day, have and will always will be, Captain Rhodes, Private's Steel and Pickles between these three, you wouldn't want to cross their paths on a moonlit night, in saying that, when it came to the crunch, they would be the perfect allies to have on your side.As for the rest of the cast, Richard Liberty as Doctor Logan, or as the team refer to him behind his back, Dr Frankenstein portrays his character with a wonderful wit mixed with an inner sadness, couple him with his pet project 'Bub' played by Howard Sherman, and the entertainment to be gleaned from this movie is a done deal.It must be said, that after two decades, If I can still remember half of the film's dialogue, and the various gory set pieces, major kudos must go to George A. Romero, for delivering unto the horror movie fan a movie that will truly stand the test of time.Without a doubt, this is a zombie movie for all time. Without hesitation, this movie get a rating of 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this movie is the one in the series that is most ripped apart (although favored by Romero himself), this movie does create some of the most interesting ideas in the series. Bub is an amazing character. While Romero nearly created the zombie film in the 1960s, he reinvented it in the 1980s with this movie.Giving Bub the ability to function is a great precursor to the lead zombie he would create in "Land of the Dead" decades later. You can't help but feel that if "Land of the Dead" had been made immediately after "Day of the Dead", the lead zombie would have been Bub himself!While this movie is not the best of Romero's series, it does hold a special place in the pantheon of horror movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite of the Trilogy, now the Quadrology, and I'll tell you why: this movie is bleak, man. They're ain't no song and dance routines or pie fights. The zombies are ahead 500,00 to one and the dipshits in the bunker can't get it together enough to quit squabbling amongst themselves. That's human nature, man. Dead on. It's all over and Romero portrays it unflinchingly. The colors in the movie are stark and depressing. The wails from the corral are eerie. You feel like it's all over. And it is. That's how I like my zombie movies. But feel free to make as many as you want, Mr Romero, I'll sure as hell buy them. Fragaments, I need to have ten lines. I can say more. I think the ending is a dream sequence because there's no way that stoner fueled up that helicopter. They're dead. Dead as hell and it's all over humanity. Anyone disagree?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Almost Last One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day was the last of the Romero zombie films I saw except for Land of the Dead. When this movie began I almost wanted to cry by how all the good people were dead. The only people left alive were the ones who were importent to the government. Scientists, military and I feared the worse for our friends from Dawn of the Dead. I really didn't like how crazy the people were. I know in a way by the time we came to the end of the world that's all that would remain. The people that are needed to survive. Not people like us. I loved the zombies but I lost my sense of the zombies. In Night the zombies have just shown up. At first they move OK then they begin to stiffen up. Dawn they're faces are blue. They didn't yell at you they just came at you. By Day the zombies had decomposed and Tom Savini was a genius but then we see these creature that yell and scream at you. Why? They should move worse now right? How come they're insides don't decompose? Now I know that the movie I saw was not even close to the original idea spawned by Romero but the zombies were always going to do that right? I liked Bub the zombie that could shoot and talk. This seems to be the Adam and Eve of the zombies. Bub is the first to do this but in Land of the Dead the zombies talk to each other and shoot. We're screwed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Dead a Great Zombie Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Romero's Day of the Dead a Great Zombie Film? Well, as of 2005, it's one of my favorites, up there with Dawn of the Dead 78 and Let Sleeping Corpses Lie/Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue. I could list a ton of others, some good, but plenty bad that I've seen, but in the end, Day of the Dead has had the biggest impact on me in terms of zombies, so I wouldn't be afraid to say it ties Dawn of the Dead in terms of enjoyment.Not only do the zombies look great, but I actually enjoyed the characters and acting in this film, along with the storyline. OK, the storyline could've been set outside above ground, but if you think about it, it's actually smarter they decided to stay underground, where it's "safer", if they only got rid of that zombie corral.Seriously, if you have any interest in zombies, this is the film to watch if you want to see some of the best zombie make up and gore effects ever put on film, by none other than the masters of zombie films, George A. Romero and Tom Savini, and Greg Nicotero if you want to get technical (Land of the Dead/Day of the Dead).I'm really looking forward to Land of the Dead, which I hope has the feel of Day of the Dead, but the scope and range of Dawn of the Dead.fsudolart</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Third and Most Underrated of the Living Dead Series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the third film of the Apocalyspe Horror Series from the Living Dead film is Written &amp; Directed by George A. Romero (Creepshow, Monkey Shines). This was the least successful of the series but it still packs a punch and also this was supposed to be last of the Living Dead films.When the Human Race is almost gone, a group of survivors (Lori Cardille, Terry Alexander, Jarlath Conroy, Anthony DiLeo Jr., Gary Howard Klar, Ralph Marrero, John Alplas, Gregory Nictero, Phillip G. Kellams and Taso N. Stavrakis) are living in a Underground Banker. When sereval scientist are trying to find to control the problem but it is too late to find a solution. But when a mad doctor known as Dr. Frankenstein (Richard Liberty) finds a way to control the living dead after his successful test with a bright zombie (Howard Sherman), which that Zombie has some humanity left. But time is running out, when the soldiers are getting relentless with a violent control freak Captain Rhodes (Joseph Pilato). The Soldiers will do anything to get out of the Underground Banker. Since the Underground Banker is a Mix of Civilians and Scientists will try to get out of there first before the Soldiers do. Before they get stuck in that cold, lifeless dark place.When the film was released in 1985, the film suffer, because Romero shot the film with an X-Rating. It might have worked with "Dawn of the Dead" but with the 1980's audiences didn't flocked to see it. It receive Mixed Criticism with Moviegoers and Film Critics. This film features one of Tom Savini's Best Make-Up Effects Work. This film has a dark sense of humor and Romero manages to have some clever touches. Howard Sherman as the Zombie-Bub steals the show.DVD has an digitally remastered Picture Quality and Superior Sound. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer. DVD has an strong DTS 6.1 Es Surround Sound (also in Dolby Digital 5.1 Ex Surround Sound). DVD has an running commentary track by writer/director:George A. Romero, Make-Up Efffects Artist:Tom Savini, Production Designer:Cletus Anderson and Actress-Lori Cardille. DVD also has Commentary Track by Oscar-Winner Filmmaker:Roger Avery (Pulp Fiction, Silent Hill). The Second Disc has two feautrettes, One with the Cast and Crew and the Other with the Make-Up Effects Team. DVD has also an Radio Interview with the late actor:Richard Liberty and more. This is Romero's favorite Zombie film. This film is Too Talky for Some, Too Slow for Some but Fans of the Living Dead Series will love it. Don't miss it. Followed by "Land of the Dead".

		<shortDescription>Actually pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Day of The Dead" was supposedly the last of the "Dead" series that was created by the legendary George Romero (That was before he did "Land Of The Dead"). In this version, society is pretty much gone. A group of scientists and soldiers are trying to survive in an underground bunker. The army guys are pretty much getting fed up (not literally, of course)of the lack of progress on the scientists in finding a solution to the problem. And considering that the army guys pretty much have all the guns, it's just a matter of time when they take over. Now the scientists have nutty army guys AND zombies to deal with! This was actually a pretty good entry in the series. Slight violent than the original, but not as violent as "Dawn Of The Dead." If you are waiting to catch "Land of The Dead," then you should catch up with the first 3 of the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 3rd in George A. Romero's Dead series, which sadly is the weakest of the first three.The film has a fairly interesting (yet kind of unrealistic premise) of The Zombies out numbering humans 1 to 40,000. Which leads us to an underground bunker where we have a common war between Scientists and the Army.The most interesting parts in the film would probably be a trademark gory sequence (even if it's nothing we haven't seen before in previous Dead films.) and the "Frankenstien" professor and Bub (which seems straight out of Bride of Frankenstien (1935), the Doctor even sounds like the Blind Man from BoF!) Sadly, the film at times is really way to talky, and drags. Some characters are under-written, and it's allegorical content seems a bit even more phoned in then it did with Dawn of the Dead, released years earlier.Regardless of these facts, this is still more memorable then the average horror film, but most viewers will probably be hoping more from Romero's signature series. If you love Zombie films, by all means check this out, but watch Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the dead first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding zombie flick devised by George A. Romero.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Smart and informative. Character driven. Good Narrative. Excellent special effects. Ultra gory. Most of the non-zombie characters are in the military, so they've been taught to take orders and we can reasonably assume they know how to skillfully kill a zombie. There's a character who is a mad scientist, known as Dr. Frankenstein, who has big ideas concerning zombie developments. This is the movie for those interested in the true nature of zombies. One of the zombies is used as a guinea pig showing "human" traits that make you almost feel sorry for it. At times, "Day of The Dead", made in 1985, shows its age since there are racially charged epithets. "Night of The Living Dead"(1968) was ahead of its time with a lead African American actor. NOTLD also had a large cult following while "Day" did horribly at ;the box office. This George A. Romero movie doesn't attempt to show any signs of humor like the materialist "Dawn of The Dead"(1978). By 1985 the director returned to his dark roots. You don't necessarily feel sympathetic for the characters who get the ultra gore because they are not particularly nice people. The first half of the movie is basically threatening dialogue while the second half is filled with more ultra gore. All in all, a pretty good zombieflick worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mental Battering, But My God, The Effects!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead, the third in Romero's 'Dead' series, is taglined 'The darkest day of horror the world has ever known'. If it were up to me they would have capitalised DARKEST. And then added some stars and exclamation marks for good measure! Each of the 'Dead' films has something unique about it. I could write about the aspects of social commentary each film has for the time it was made, and while that is absolutely worthy of mention, (it's one of the things that separates and elevates George A Romero's 'Dead' films above the numerous others in the genre) you can read about that elsewhere. The two things I can't review Day of the Dead without mentioning though, are its tone and the effects.THE TONE: Wow. This film is *dark*. You thought Se7en was dark, think again. You thought Bergman was bleak? Watch this. For a study in how to create and sustain an oppressive, claustrophobic atmosphere, Day of the Dead is hard to beat. I know all about (and have read and enjoyed) the original script. It is very good and had it been made it would have been a fantastic film. However, the film that did get made was the 'Day' that we have now - and that is no bad thing. Although Romero (and many 'Dead' fans) consider this to be the finest film in the series, for me it doesn't quite beat 'Dawn of the Dead'. And anyone not prepared for the downshift into the crumbling vision of humanity and blurred moral lines of 'Day' after the comic book fun of 'Dawn' might well feel the same way. Of the three, 'Day' continues to be the film that I find most interesting - not my favourite to watch, but certainly the most challenging.THE EFFECTS: Wow. The effects in 'Day' are brilliant - there is no other word. They are especially impressive given that they were so far ahead of their day. I'd stack them against any similar effects done today and for shock, entertainment and realism (in the confines of the gore/horror genre) they are, for my money, unbeatable. If anyone can name a film that has better gore effects, let me know! The 80's were the day for this kind of work with the Re-Animator, Evil Dead, Phantasm, Freddy and Jason series' running full tilt, wonders like John Carpenter's The Thing and directors like Cronnenberg putting out their best stuff. Day's effects top them all. Even similar stuff today. Dusk till Dawn (I know it's Savini), Kitamura, Miike, the Dawn of the Dead remake (sigh), 28 Days Later, what else? To be honest, the only thing that comes close (pretty darn close) is Peter Jackson's Braindead. Braindead's effects are superlative, but there you trade off the numbing effect of the rivers of gore (and lighter tone) against the jarring effect of 'Day of the Dead's darker tone, and horror setting.Lori Cardille is good as the tough female lead of the picture (think of a character in the same vein as Ripley). Richard Liberty brings some needed off-beat moments as Doc Logan, who is charged with behaviour experimentation on the undead and Howard Sherman is also a standout as Bub, Doc Logan's star pupil. It's interesting that in a film where one of the main themes dealt with is that of human nature in a crisis, what is arguably the most touching performance comes from one of the undead.Day of the Dead is a hard film to get through if you're not ready for it. There's a lot of anger in the characters (particularly a barely-contained Joe Pilato as Capt. Rhodes) and even the quieter scenes only serve to remind us about the claustrophobic atmosphere that humanity has been reduced to living in and the bleak outlook for mankind as the undead problem continues to worsen.Watch Day of the Dead. A decent into darkness for the human soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy, although underestimated, entry in Romero's zombie saga.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While standing alone as perhaps having the most depth of the three(so far) Romero zombie films, it also is a accurate successor to Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. Comparing the three movies reveals the thought put into the decay of civilization. In Night, regular people(average) come together in a simple farmhouse to fight what seems to be a minor epidemic. All of them die along with the zombies. In Dawn, two policemen and two reporters(above average) come together in a giant mall to escape what appears to be the end of the world. One policeman and one reporter die as do a lot of zombies, but only a fraction of the zombies we see. The two survivors escape temporarily, but to go where. In Day, military and scientific people(supposedly superior) come together in a vain attempt to find a way to survive in a world that is no longer their own. Three escape to an island paradise where they probably lived the rest of their days as happy as they could be. I find it fascinating that there were more individual survivors as civilization failed through each movie. Could it be that this is just one big comment on the importance of an individual in society? The most interesting aspect of this movie is Bub the zombie masterfully played by Sherman Howard. The amount of emotion and character that comes from Sherman Howard movements and grunts astounds me. This is a very difficult role which he pulls off. He is more likable than most of the humans. The scene where he cries over the doctor's body is almost touching. Lori Cardille, Joseph Pilato, Richard Liberty, and John Amples(Martin) are all good as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DAY OF THE DEAD is perhaps the best entry to ever grace GEORGE A. ROMERO'S OF THE DEAD series! but it also contains some of the most terrifying people you could ever find yourself paired up with, in a fight against the living dead! While the first two featured characters that tried to work through the situations, even when some of them didn't necessarily get along, DAY OF THE DEAD featured some innocents thrown in with ravening wolves, that could tear them apart at any second &amp; were only concerned about themselves &amp; I speak of the military figures that adorn DAY OF THE DEAD, who are anything but heroic, or friendly, but rather come off as even more threatening than the zombies, a bunch of psychotic, back stabbing, twitch &amp; I'll shoot you, modern day cavemen, with a mentality to match. In fact, when DAY OF THE DEAD was first released, this is one of the many things critics did not respond favourably too. In a year that saw RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD II &amp; G.I. JOE, the site of possibly psychotic &amp; unfriendly American soldiers having a complete meltdown &amp; that posed a threat to human life was not a welcome site. The best part of DAY OF THE DEAD just happens to be TOM SAVINI'S grisly, ghoulish splatter effects, if you want blood &amp; guts you'll get it, by the bucket loads! The zombie make-up itself is some of the best zombie make-up to ever adorn a zombie flick! Indeed DAY OF THE DEAD is arguably the ace in the series when it comes to disgusting make-up effects &amp; gore (Don't eat before, during or after watching it!). The characterization is relatively &amp; surprisingly strong here, each role is very well written. The characters are very interesting &amp; it helps that the actors chosen to fill the roles, are talented. Wherein the previous two OF THE DEAD efforts only had some marginally good actors, DAY far outclasses them both in this department. JOE PILATO returning from his brief appearance (albeit as a different character) from DAWN OF THE DEAD, is very effective in role as they psychotic Rhodes, easily one of the best villains in horror film history. In fact DAY wouldn't mark the end of his involvement with Romero's infamous series, as he would return many years later in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD: ORIGINS 3D. But he is not the only returnee to the OF THE DEAD universe, as DAWN OF THE DEAD stars GALEN ROSS (who helped work on the film) &amp; TASO STRAVAKIS (Who plays one of the soldiers) return. Look for LAND/DIARY/SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD effects artist GREG NICOTERO as a soldier. The character of the eccentric, madman scientist, Dr. Logan or Dr. Frankenstein as he is called by the soldiers, because of his obsession with experimenting in the recently risen dead, is easily one of the far more interesting characters this series has to offer &amp; really does mirror MARY SHELLY'S infamous character &amp; I feel this is the franchises strongest entry, it's reasonably well put together &amp; boasts a great score. There's plenty here that keeps DAY OF THE OF THE DEAD fresh in terms of story, since it's the first zombie film in history to feature the point of view of a zombie. In this case, the real hero of the piece (oddly &amp; arguably that is) the likable BUB, is played very well by HOWARD SHERMAN, whom we the audience wind up cheering for, since unlike the other zombies that populate the film, he's smart &amp; isn't into attacking people for food. Some of the exchanges between him &amp; Dr. Logan is oddly touching. Admittedly, while I had fun with the film, DAY OF THE DEAD is indeed a bleak movie, specifically because the films that proceeded it, always offered some form of hope at the end, DAY OF THE DEAD offers no hope at all, since the zombies have won the war even before the film truly begin &amp; the fact that the group in the underground cavern where the films story takes place, just might be the last of what is left of mankind. Despite this, DAY OF THE DEAD offers some interesting ideas on why the dead have really risen. As Terry Alexander (Another black actor given a major hero role in the earlier trilogy) the world could possibly be punished by it's creator, but that maybe they could re-start the world all over again, a world without depravity, violence, chaos &amp; weapons of war &amp; that the dead rising might indeed be a blessing in disguise. SARAH CARDILLE is also worth mentioning as being in the cast, since her dad BILL "CHILLY WILLY" CARDILLE played a zombie in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968). She plays a scientist, who runs the risk everyday of possibly being raped by the psychotic soldiers, since she is the only woman living in the underground bunker.All in all, I highly recommend DAY OF THE DEAD to fans of the other OF THE DEAD films who haven't seen it yet, due to it's somewhat negative reception by critics &amp; some fans. But don't listen to the naysayers, this is a highly underrated zombie film in the series! But question, couldn't we have at least gotten a scene where Bub &amp; a recently risen Dr. Logan walked off together at the climax?Despite billing itself as a sequel, DAY OF THE DEAD 2: CONTAGIUM is NOT a sequel, but an in-name only film, that uses the title for recognition, stay away from it, it's terrible! Even the supposed 2008 "Remake" has very little connection to this movie, aside from a few character names being the same &amp; the title. Followed by the true sequel - LAND OF THE DEAD **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!The weakest of the series, so far, and by a long way the most gore filled, but by no means is this a bad film. If Romero had had better funding, certain improvements could have been made to the script, but he still provides an excellent and grim film. Like the previous films, we are given a sense of claustrophobia, of being sealed inside by what's outside as the film is set mainly in one place. While NOTLD was set in a farmhouse, and the characters may have been able to run somewhere else, and Dawn was set in a shopping mall where all your hearts desires could be found for low low prices, this is set in an underground shelter with miles of caverns leading to nowhere: it's as if the human race has already sealed itself in Hell. The zombies hold the earth.The few survivors are not plain civilians as before, they work for a government which does not exist anymore, with the soldiers supposedly facilitating the scientists. Both groups are torn amongst themselves, with the soldiers under the command of Rhodes-one of the most psychotic characters ever, yet completely understandable (played with the utmost power and realism by Pilato and surely deserving of some awards), and the scientists all pulling in different directions. This is primarily a film of characterisation as we see how each person reacts to the realisation that the zombies have won. It may be true that none of the characters are likable, but this only adds to the realism as if we were in this situation, it is likely those around us would p*ss us off most of the time. Even at the end, contrary to what others say, the future holds no hope. The only escape is to hide and wait for your own inevitable death.But the film is very funny, perhaps sometimes unintentionally, as seen in Frankenstein's antics and death-F- "no! no, you must listen to me!" Rhodes &lt;with machine gun&gt; "listen to this"! &lt;pulls trigger&gt;. The effects, again done by Tom Savini are simply amazing, with face being torn apart, heads flying off, and intestines spilling everywhere-every single death scene is a masterpiece of gore. Although many horror fans do not like this, it portrays a horrifying situation like no other movie. Perhaps not even the most hardened fan can bear the grimness of what is happening, subconscious fears making them hate it??? 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. If this was the one and only zombie film Romero had ever made, people would have thought it was brilliant. As it stands, however, it was the sequel to what is arguably the best-loved zombie film of all time, and therefore people had high expectations.As the liner notes for the recent Anchor Bay DVD discuss, the film, which is highly critical of government and authority (particularly the military and scientific establishments) and presents a pessimistic outlook on humanity's ability to solve difficult social problems, was released at a time when American society was also experiencing a similar malaise. In other words, a lot of people just found the movie's message depressing, and therefore didn't like it.Personally, Day has always been my favorite of the Dead trilogy, and I've always liked the fact that Romero takes this potentially funny subject matter very seriously and deals with the philosophical, social and ethical issues it raises. Also, in my opinion, Tom Savini's makeup work is fantastic. The guts and blood and brains are absolutely realistic-looking and disgusting, especially to those who don't know how these effects are achieved.I can't wait for the next installment in the series. I hope Romero hasn't lost his edge, but something tells me it's going to be great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George A.Romero's last film in the "Dead" trilogy sees a group of survivors living in a subterranean bunker whilst the world above is ruled by the much better looking (thanks to a bigger budget) zombies. The zombies, with their ever increasing hunger for the human flesh, are quicker, smarter and stronger.The plot is flimsy. However, those who like to see vino tinto are in luck: the film is all about gore. Anybody who's familiar with the phrase "CHOKE ON 'EM!!!" will agree. Sadly, though, this is the film's only strength. The acting is generic, the dialogue is cheesy... the only thing worth seeing this film for is to be disgusted by the sight of the living being torn apart and eaten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not bad third entry in the series has a small army living in an underground bunker conducting experiments on the zombies while also trying to find humans. Night of the Living Dead was groundbreaking, original horror. Dawn of the Dead was a comical and political film masquerading as a horror film and was perhaps even more original than the first. Day of the Dead is just a low-budget tack on. Needlessly talky script is even more bogged down by bad acting making for many lulls in between the gory stuff. Offers some scares along the way, but towards the end there's hardly any suspense. All we're left with is numerous grisly dismembering sequences of the bad guys. Best reason to watch is for Tom Savini's makeup and gore effects which are really put to use in the last half hour.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third in the series, and we have the darkest in the series, both in terms of lighting and mood. This film is regarded as the worst of the three, but I put this down to the tone of the film, which is as I mentioned, dark. Not many people are equipped to deal with utter despair. The dialogue is strained with frustration and fear, on both sides of the divide the film presents. We have the scientists on one side and military personnel on the other, the majority of time is spent on this dynamic and its clear that this bunch of people are in REAL trouble and that's before any zombies crop up, this is what puts most people off.And it shouldn't because when they do attack, it's all the more shocking for it. Solid end to the trilogy. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that many Romero fans are not fans of his third movie in the Dead series, but it is one of my favorites. Many dislike the constant darkness, in appearance, as well as in mood. However, I find this sets the story up perfectly, giving it the apocalyptic feel that was not entirely there in the earlier two, even in "Dawn Of The Dead". I don't want to say that this movie is better than "Night Of The Living Dead", or "Dawn Of The Dead", because that is obviously an opinion, but I do find the writing and direction to be superior. As I write this, the filming for "Land Of The Dead" is taking place, hopefully it will be more widely accepted by the Romero fans than Day was. I only hope this movies reputation is not dragged down by fans of the new "Dawn Of The Dead", because Day is an acquired taste, which with multiple viewings, will grow on you. Now back to the movie itself: The film takes place in an underground military bunker in Florida, where scientists and soldiers are together. Though the scientists want to find a logical and economical solution to the zombies, all the soldiers want to do is "Blow the piss outta them". The movie takes place over the course of just about one week/ one and a half weeks, and is very endearing. Like the other Dead movies, this one is more about the human threat than the zombie threat. It is definitely worth a watch to any Roemro/ zombie fan, but zombie fans be warned: though this film does have some truly awesome zombie scenes, the majority is the Romero style discussions and looming threats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like it more every time I watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw DAY OF THE DEAD upon its original theatrical release in 1985. I was fifteen. While I was blown away by the effects, I felt the movie to be long, talky and boring. I felt the same way upon subsequent viewings when the movie came out on video. I had to face the fact that I simply didn't care for the movie, which was a little sad, since I was already a rabid Romero fan, and had anticipated this movie for five years.What struck me as odd, was that DAWN OF THE DEAD was longer, talkier and much more deliberately paced than DAY. Yet, even when I was twelve, I found DAWN to be an intense, fascinating and horrifying movie, with touches of satire and slapstick humor thrown in. It was (and is) one of the most unique horror movies I'd ever seen.As I got older, I found myself in the mood to watch DAY more and more often, until it became one of those movies that I would stick in if I couldn't find anything else to watch. I started finding the dialog more interesting, the characters more compelling and the story more horrific. And now, while I don't think it's quite as good as NIGHT or DAWN, I think it's one of the best horror movies of the 80s, and one of the most intelligent, socially significant and disturbing apocalyptic horror movies ever.If NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD hinted that humanity will be its own worst enemy because people are unwilling to work together to save their lives, then DAWN OF THE DEAD actively portrayed the human race as materialistic, cruel and opportunistic in the face of disaster, as the zombies become little more than a nuisance, and fellow humans become the force of which to really be wary.DAY OF THE DEAD takes those themes to the most dreadful extreme. The military is but a shadow of the force it once was, with only the most psychotic and headstrong members surviving the devastation. The scientists slowly lose their grip on logic, as their experiments prove to be useless against an undefinable (and unbeatable) foe. And the civilian workers find themselves unable to talk sense into either group, as their existential, live-for-today philosophy does not translate into military or scientific language.DAY OF THE DEAD does not really malign the military. These last few soldiers have remained alive only because they lack any degree of compassion or self-control. Nor is the movie anti-science, as the scientists are trying to save humanity, not control it. Even the insane mad scientist (referred to as "Frankenstein" by most of the characters) is obsessively trying to find a non-destructive way to stop the undead.The movie delivers everything it promises: thrills, suspense, intelligence, satire and, of course, gore, gore and more gore. It doesn't work the same way as the countless other zombie movies that came before it, which is why so many people didn't like it, and why, now, I admire it so much. The thrills on the movie are the pay-off, the reward for sitting through Romero's points about society and community. Whereas NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is an expressionistic chiller, and DAWN OF THE DEAD is a satirical comic book come to life, DAY OF THE DEAD is a metaphorically rich character study that portrays understanding, devotion and teamwork as the tools to conquer any adversary. In the midst of the rampant nihilism, death and disaster, there's a ray of hope that is indestructible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So it grew on me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you talked to me about 30 minutes into this film, I'd of told you I hated the film. I hated the characters (note: not a criticism on the acting). They really irritated me. I didn't want to be stuck in a bunker with these annoying people for an entire film; were I a part of the scenario, I'd of killed most of them in their sleep. Frankenstein aka Logan was the only guy on the screen that I remotely liked.Sure, I smiled at each of Savini's effects, which were allowed to play out in all their gory glory thanks the film's lack of a rating, and I very much looked forward to some dark and overly-bloody fate befalling just about everyone. Other than that, I had little reason to keep watching.Then as the film progressed, I did come to like Day of the Dead and developed a new respect for George Romero. Zombies have infiltrated two of Romero's films and influenced other directors (most notably Fulci) around the world, and one wonders how stumbling, bumbling, moaning killing machines can keep an audience's interest. Thus, the stroke of genius in Day of the Dead; Romero with Howard Sherman pulled off an unprecedented feat (which to my knowledge really hasn't been tried since) ? meet Bub, the zombie who became more human and earned more sympathy than the doomed survivors.Never would I have dreamed that anyone would even try, much less succeed, in creating sincere and almost heartwarming exchanges between reanimated dead and the living. I loved how Romero explored the fact that zombies were (and in a way still are) human. And the final inevitable battle for the bunker, I smiled with a great satisfaction as Romero transposed the roles of zombies and a humans.As with Dawn of the Dead, I'm not terribly thrilled with Romero's visual style. That's not really a complaint though. His visual narrative does indeed work, and it works well. He has a rock solid method of telling his tale, which is far more than typical Hollywood directors can claim . . . I just prefer a little more artistic flair. Like Dawn of the Dead, though, Romero's concepts are as colorful as Argento's visuals so the film keeps interest.I salute Romero and Day of the Dead for challenging the boundaries of what a zombie flick encompasses, and with that thought, I look forward to Dead Reckoning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best of the trilogy, but the best gore-fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the three (Night of/Dawn of/Day of) I say Dawn was the best. If you want some serious gore, however, this one wins, in full color. Like the first film, the following two followed small groups of greatly outnumbered survivors lurched upon by relentless, slow-moving zombies hungering for flesh. The group dynamic as it plays out while walled in by hostile forces is one of the primary themes of this classic horror series.This segment took on the dynamic of Lord of the Flies underground. Thuggish military jarheads brandish guns and go more crazy as researchers and civilians try to find a way to stop the zombie tide, or simply scheme to live through the next day. While the film transcends the staples of horror, shock, and tense suspense, it reaches past what it can effectively deliver. Having three times as many lead characters than Dawn, it explores all of them, but as a result becomes unwieldy, unfocused, and ultimately unsatisfying. The over-the-top performance of Joe Polato as the megalomaniac military Captain was particularly distracting, especially since a soft emotional crumble rather than an avalanche of mania would have added much more texture to the film as a whole. But kudos go to several performers, especially Richard Liberty, who added substance to mostly shallow characterizations among all the excellent makeup, special effects, and pigs' guts. Night Of is in many ways groundbreaking and a classic in its own unique way. But not my favorite. This one is not, either.Dawn is my favorite of the three- it has grittiness, suspense, gore, wonderful cunning irony and wit, and most of all, soul. And isn't that every zombie needs? No wonder they keep coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes. 1985 was pretty grim...And so was the Romero's movie Day Of The Dead. Trilogy had many directions. First was groundbreaking classic. Second brought comedy elements and direct social commentary. Third was about abandoning all hopes! It was grim. Dark. Loaded with despair, hopelesness. In fact - that was the main theme - How To Rid Off The Stupid Hopes?! They all know they are doomed. Left alone. Forgotten! And still they try to live and survive...But why? They live day by day. They fight. They could live like that...years! And they would still be abandoned. This movie is the best in series. Its - grim conclusion. I hope that Romero wont spoil it all with Diamond Dead or Dead Reckoning! Not for depressed people.Also - Not for survivalists!</fullReview>

The effects in this movie are actually good, even though it is kinda crude, but it was thankfully made with out that computer crap. The plot is excellent, the effects very good, and the acting is also excellent. And (spoilers) the way Bub "evolves" from a mindless creature to an avenging sharp shooter shows how it fits into the new Romero film. Many people don't appreciate this film due to it's the greatness that is Dawn of the Dead, but I guess some people just can't recognize great directing and screen-writing.

		<shortDescription>Best of the Trilogy Spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead is the best of the trilogy in my opinion. More low key than Dawn its a much more sober and apocalyptic tale than the previous films. Set around 3 years after the events of Dawn of the Dead the undead have now taken over most of the world, outnumbering humans 300,000 to 1 at one characters estimate. The story concentrates on a small group of survivors who are living in an huge underground bunker and missile silo somewhere in southern Florida. The characters are made up of military and scientific personal and much of the story concentrates on the increasing amounts of tension between these two groups. There is relatively no gore in most of the film, apart from the odd scene, until the finale when the zombies overrun the complex. This is an absolute gorefest and remains possibly the most realistic and gory scene you will ever see, even today. The effects in this final scene put those in the previous film to shame, though Day did have a bigger budget and was made 8 years later. Performances from the characters Dr Logan, Sarah and colonel Rhodes particularly stand out. Go watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"CHOKE ON ?EM!!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~Spoiler~Day of the Dead, often lamented as George A. Romero's worst, is a helluva lot better than most people's best. I will say that it's my least favorite of the "Dead" trilogy, but it's still a masterpiece of modern horror nonetheless. Regardless of what Romero originally envisioned, this film is still an epic zombie tale. Scientists and Military men (who may be all there is left) are holed up in an underground bunker and are quickly losing their minds while the undead have overrun the world. The characters (and the actors who portray them perfectly) are downright hopeless, cynical, and many without merits. Joe Pilato is freakin' magnificent as Captain Rhodes. He either really has his character down or he's someone I wouldn't enjoy hanging out with. I'm amazed he didn't have more of a career in the industry after this. Richard Liberty (also seen in Romero's The Crazies) has that perfect mad scientist quality to play Dr. Logan and Lori Cardille ("Chilly Billy" Cardille's daughter) is very enjoyable as our strong female lead. And the always cool-headed Terry Alexander has shades of both Duane Jones and Ken Foree from the past zombie films. Let's not forget Howard Sherman's Bub, the first sympathetic and completely cool zombie. Many more elements combine to make Day of the Dead an essential horror experience. The best make-up and special effects you could ever find in a film are right here. Look no further. Tom Savini and his crew (including a young Greg Nicotero who even has a role in the film) prove that they are the best beyond a shadow of a doubt. John Harrison's score is also one of these essential elements. The music is quite compelling, and even uplifting at points. It kind of counteracts what's happening on the screen and creates a subtle and much needed balance. Once our characters have been introduced and the lines have been drawn and sides have been taken, the movie truly gets going. There are many surprises and twists during the course of the film and everything about it takes me back to a time when near-perfect horror films were made. The only problem with the film in my eyes was the weak ending. I think it could have been pulled off in slightly better fashion. Romero's final installment of zombie mayhem is claustrophobic, shocking, and downright scary. It truly is "the darkest day of horror the world has ever known."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb mark: 8The last film in Romero's Dead trilogy, 'Day of the Dead' finishes what 'Night of the Living Dead' started, in the same style, of course. The whole plot development, throughout the 3 films, might not be to everyone's liking, especially the ending(s), but they certainly are to my liking.-Gore: This is Tom Savini, handling the special effects here. One couldn't ask for anything more. 30/30-Suspense: 'Day of the Dead' is a suspenseful movie, definitely. It's got very nice twists here and there, and some good scares. 13/15-Ending: It's really cool, even though it's not exactly what I would have done. Of course, taste varies. 14/15-Death Scenes: Just when I thought I saw the best death scene ever, this movie showed me another one, a better one. Watch Rhodes! 11/11-Atmosphere: I really like the atmosphere in this film. It's dark, serious, and the time goes by extremely fast; yeah, it's that good. Also, probably every person who watches this movie will find someone he or she can identify with. 10/10-Nudity: There is no nudity in this film. 0/10-Cast: The cast is unknown. Apparently, Howard Sherman, who plays Bub, was on 'General Hospital', and Terry Alexander was somewhat famous before starring in 'Day of the Dead', but I still am not familiar with any of their other movies. 1/5-Genre: This is a horror film. 4/4--&gt;Overall: 83/100If you want to see an excellent, gory film from the '80s, that is not funny or Italian, and you have already seen 'The Evil Dead', go for 'Day of the Dead'. It's great! From Swordlord, 3 swords up!</fullReview>

I would recommend that anyone who loves blood and guts and a good survival story to rent this one. Be advised some scenes involve disembowelment and decapitation from the zombies.Tom Savini returns from Dawn of The Dead to provide a heavy dose of special gore effects. Horror films these days don't have the same stigma that the Dead Movies do. Fortunately, George Romero gives us a gory and entertaining masterpiece to enjoy for generations to come...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So whats the problem?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am simply beyond disappointed with the vast majority of reviews written here. Day of the Dead is an excellent film, in fact it is my favorite of the trilogy. It has it's faults of course, but I enjoy it's rich take on the darker side of humanity. I am a five year veteran of the United States Marine Corps and served in the Gulf War. Take it from me when you are trapped with a group people you don't like and no one is in charge, you have major problems. This reality and the deep tension behind it are beautifully illustrated in this motion picture. As far as complaints about the cast go I couldn't disagree with most of you more. I enjoy seeing people I am not familiar with upon the silver screen, it automatically helps in the suspension of disbelief. I think all of the actors performances were very believable considering the situation their characters found themselves in. This film is more of a thinking persons horror film than a MTV 20 million edits per-second/Vin Diesel action packed dipstick film. So for those of you who can get past what the critics/your friends have said about the film and for those of you who like to truly think about what your watching and enjoy trying to figure out what the underlying theme/statement actually is. I highly recommend Day of the Dead as must see viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior to DOTD in every way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I did not grow up watching the Romero trilogy like many other reviewers here, as NOTLD was the only film of the 3 that I had seen (and many times at that). So my comments are coming from someone with a fresh set ofeyes watching today, and not from the jaded eyes of those with nostalgia ontheir minds.I have watched all 3 films now, and I still maintain that NOTLD is the best of the 3 films. After reading so many positive reviews of Dawn, I picked it up on DVD and was sufficiently unimpressed. You'd think that after a decade between the two films Romero would have learned some professionalism! Dawn is marredby bad acting, bad makeup, and not much of a script. Other than the cool factor of having an empty mall to run around in, the film is extremely overrated.Which brings us to Day of the Dead. Despite the continuing claustrophicenvironment of an underground bunker (which is one of the main reasons whyNOTLD is so effective), the acting, zombie makeup, and plot are much muchimproved over Dawn. Here, we have the slightly disturbed Dr. Logan who istrying to communicate with the zombies to learn about them and, hopefully,control their propensity for eating us, while bull-headed military men do all they can to thwart that plan (once they learn of it). This film presents new concepts in the zombie theme that keep it interesting and even plausible. we see morepersonality in the zombies and even gain further realization that they are not just mindless flesh eaters, but thinking individuals (lest we forget that they were human at one time). So the scientists plan is a perfectly logical option tocontrolling the zombies, until you realize just how demented he has become in his plight to learn more about them. Even Capt. Rhodes, despite beingdespicable and evil megalomania, has moments of reasoning, as who doesn'tagree that perhaps the real solution is just to blow all of the mofos away.Overall, a much more satisfying sequel to original.</fullReview>

With that said I saw it again recently and it is pretty basist horror. Stripped down cast, all the money in the gore, etc. I watch movies like this to be scared or get the thrill of the gore/effects...unlike newer crap like the TCM remake which shows nothing and does not scare.I also agree with people that the original script idea sounded awesome and it's a shame that it was never made.Also, if this movie was supposed to represent the last of humanity, how is it that they have electricity (ok, maybe generators, although we do see them scowering for gas when they are outside so that doesn't quite hold up) and how is it they have running water? Water fountains? Some silly stuff really but then again it was at least entertaining.I'm up for a 4th one...I could even go for him rehashing his original Day script and revising it.</fullReview>

It doesn't have as much social commentry as the other two in the trilogy, but this one does make some comments on sexism, the millitary etc.The story begins with only a few humans still alive. Some are doctors and the rest are the millitary (never a good team). The millitary basically want to blow the zombies to pieces, whereas the scientists want to train and try to understand the zombies. The film is almost a drama until the gorefest of the last 20 minutes or so.All in all, a brilliant and underrated film from the master of horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When zombie numbers began to grow, a team of military and science personal were sent to an old underground bunker in Florida to conduct research. But as time goes on, nerves are frayed and the military men become agitated and dangerous , there is also the danger of zombies lurking outside of course.....I was really excited before seeing 'Day of the Dead'. I was hoping to find out about what exactly made the people made the zombies, why they want to eat humans and whether other countries and continents outside the U.S.A. had been overrun. I found none of it. This addition to the 'night of the living dead' series is described as a very talkative addition but they talk about nothing important and we find out VERY little about the zombie condition and the state of the world. Although the army characters are supposed to be dangerous and annoying, they annoyed me as a viewer and this detracted from the film. I liked Sarah (Lori Cardille), she was a very likable character and attractive too which can't harm a film. The whole Bub plotline was ridiculous but it is believable a scientist would conduct such research. Most of the characters were extremely unlikeable which didn't help me enjoy the film as much as I could have.The zombie action was quite good, thought the director did go for a couple of cheap scares on occasions. The complex was an intriguing idea but with a bigger budget (like originally planned) could have been done much better. Overall I give this 6/10. It was disappointing as an end to the 'Night of the living Dead' Trilogy but a good zombie film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Romero calls this his favorite of his trillogy. I can see why since it attempts to comment on society and human nature and not just to scare as the new Dawn of the Dead (2004) does. However, most people will say that this was too slow paced and even the gore which was it's cornerstone back in 1985 is not really a great selling point anymore. The character development and the Zombie named Bub are really the strong points and if you loved the Zombie movies for more than just violence and gore you'll enjoy this one as I did. To me about the only drawback were the soldiers who, other than the CO, were so stupid that they seemed unbelievalbe - akin to the mall security guards at the beginning of Dawn of the Dead (2004). Romero has talked about doing a 4th movie which he joked would be called Twilight of the Dead. I'd love to see that - in case you're reading Mr. Romero ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Theres something unusual about how underrated this movie is-People praise NOTLD for being a metaphor for how humans need to learn to cooperate, yet COMPLAIN that the characters in Day spend too much time arguing. Pay attention to NOTLD and youll see the characters spend much more time NAILING BOARDS than they do being eaten. People praise NOTLD for being disturbing and shocking yet take a look and youll see very little gore, and the only truly "creepy" part is the ending, which feels like a different flick. Meanhwile the pre-digital FX in Day are UNDENIABLY convincing and memorable.Theres the sense that people reviewing this movie (Day) arent really WATCHING it, but being swayed by the popular conception that Day is a disappointnent ( something perpetuated by the geek fanboy notion that the original scipt was supposed to some big glorious epic) , and also by the desire to join the ranks of snoberry by proclaiming NOTLD as a classic.I love all three of the Dead films for different reasons, but DAY is the true realization of what Romero was trying to do- it is genuinely shocking in terms of gore, and even more so than NOTLD, shows how humans are too blind to their own political agendas to solve the problem at hand.SPOILER/ENDING EXPLANATION-------------------------------And as for the ending, the chick didnt DREAM THE WHOLE MOVIE, it just shows that they made it to the island and she occasionally has nightmares about what happened and dreams that they didnt.

BUB was a stroke of genious for Romero and Savini. The character was believable and his actions were well explained with the help of dr. logan played extremely well by Richard Liberty. A tear came down my eye when bub said the words "hello aunt alicia" and lets not forget when bub kills Rhodes but doesnt eat him. Now that was a great moment in movie history. Now to Rhodes. Rhodes may have been the villain but he did a great damn good job of being one. He wasnt just an annoyance he was a bonefied top notch villain that went around imposing his will on people but wasnt completely lost to reason and still and a smart yet cruel intelligence about him. The action/violence in this movie was good and although it is somewhat lacking it does have its moments. Dr Tongue was another stroke of genious for Savini. Now to the negative or neutral The heroine of the story, Lori Cardille, wasnt easy to side with and at times was sorta a hinderance to the story but I was able to side with her for the most part and thought her character was decent, but not as good as barbara from notld or fran from dotd. John was somewhat of a letdown also because lets face it NOBODY CAN EVER BE AS KOOL AS KEN FOREE AS PETER in dotd. John was also somewhat annoyin and really didnt bring about any emotion as to whether i was pulling for him or i wanted him to die. I just didnt care either way what happened to him. The zombie action was good but was limited and eventhough there were good zombie moments like the beginning and the end and bub, the other zombie action was somewhat lacking. In this m ovies defense it was more centered on that we know the zombies have taken over and now we are watching what the last remnants of life are doing to counter the zombies becoming the majority. Now the biggest problem i had with the movie was the army being the antagonist and the scientist being the good guys in a way, but thats just a person issue.With all things said and done i think that this does surpass the original dotd in scares and lack of stupidity, but it has a more science fiction feel to it, which is not a bad thing, but it messes with the senses because the first two were definite horror. Overall it is a fitting completion to the trilogy and an enjoyment to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day Of The Dead has to be one of the most goriest movies ever made but it's more than just the gore that makes this movie extremely fantastic. It has an awesome dark atmosphere from start to finish. The beginning is really memorable seeing all the empty streets then a close up of the newspaper (which says 'The Dead Walk') then BLAM we see a super realistic mashed up zombie walk in to frame! This movie is as dark as hell which will have the people who found the Scream movies scary changing their pants every five minutes! This is a real horror movie folks which will leave the wimps covering their eyes every five minutes but it is a very chilling movie. Just think about it, handful of people left in an underground research centre not knowing if there is any other people left alive amongst the millions of zombies which have infested nearly every place on earth. I think it's so scary because it's so very realistic and i can imagine being one of the few survivors looking towards the metal fence everyday and seeing the hundreds of zombies at it just waiting to get in and rip me apart. It has an effect on the sub-conscious too and will leave you thinking about this movie for days if not weeks after watching it. Dark, dank and gritty with excellent FX makes this 'Dead' chapter a classic. I first watched it when i was 14 back in 1990 (late for school coz of it lol) and instantly loved this beast of a horror movie and as it was the first Romero 'Dead' movie i had seen i wanted to watch the two before it which i did and loved but Dawn Of The Dead, Night Of The Living Dead and even its 1990 remake compared to Day Of The Dead are lacking in realism, depth and gore! Hey i still love them, don't get me wrong but Day Of The Dead is the most scariest, goriest and realistic zombie movie you will probably ever see. Please watch this if you havn't already. Oh yeah, you gotta love Bub, respect is due ;) 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best In The DEAD Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero has brought us the last(sort of speak) film in the DEAD trilogy.With a whole new setting different from NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and new people to care about different from DAWN OF THE DEAD.And a whole new film better than both of them combine together. The world has fully been taking over by Zombies and the last known living people on earth are at a underground camp site.Sarah(Lori Cardille),John(Terry Alexander),and William(Jarlath Conroy),maybe the only sane persons left.Her boyfriend,Miguel(Antone DiLeo) is slowly starting to lose his sanity he has left.Capt.Rhodes(Joe Pilato) is the leader and villian out the last survivors.All of them have one thing in common,they all think Dr.Logan(Richard Liberty),which they name him Frankenstein is totally crazy.But his new experiment will lead them otherwise.Because he has found a Zombie named Bud(Sherman Howard) who actually has human feelings left in him. This film's main bases where not on the man star,but on Dr.Logan and Bud.A relationship that resembles Dr.Frankenstein and the monster.It is without all means better than the last two.Putting more drama and better acting into this.And this is without a doubt the goriest movie ever made.Out beating DAWN OF THE DEAD by a mile shot.I hope George gets his money to make the DEAD RECONKING for the very last and final DEAD film.Or at least this gets made into a excellent remade like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD.The best Zombie film ever made...to me at least!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge horror genre fan. For Christmas my parents got the the Dead Trilogy. I watched them all, loved them but when I watched Day of the Dead, I was left with mixed reactions. At first I didn't like it at all. It didn't meet up to the expectations that I had after seeing Dawn of the Dead. But the more and more I watched it, the less I compared it to Dawn and enjoyed it for being itself. While it would have been nice to have this huge, mega budget living dead movie, it was also nice to have a movie that was different from the first two. It brought up some new ideas about zombies but at the same time still left the eerie sense that this was unfixable problem. The directing was superb and was paced really well. The acting was alright but Dr Logan and Bub really stand out. The effects were really good. A much better horror movie then the crap we get these days. ** 1/2 out of four</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLOTZombies are taking over the world. A bunch of people barricade themselves in a sort of a basement of the military base. A helicopter pilot , a few scientists and military soldiers are the only survivors. This is the last part of The Romero's `Dead' trilogy. The difference is that in this movie the accent is made more on the relations between the scientists and soldiers , which are at the boiling point. Can they try to work together somehow , not to fall into the hands of flesh eating zombies ? COMMENTSThis movie is not exactly about the zombies , gore e.t.c . Romero shows that soldiers are trying to show their superiority over the scientists , and will kill them if something goes wrong. Captain Rhodes (Joe Pilato) looks terrific as a strict ,mad leader of the soldiers. He doesn't care about others , but being in this type of situation he has to deal with others. Scientists meanwhile , are trying to find out what causes people to turn into zombies. Dr. Logan is even trying to teach a zombie (Bud) , to behave like human and obey him. The plot looks pretty simple but while watching, it becomes clear that the main problem is not zombies , it's the relations between scientists and soldiers. So `Day of the Dead' becomes something more than just another `no-budget' zombie flick. Of course there is plenty of gore for gore fans , and the zombie make-up is as good as always by Tom Savini. Acting is very solid as well. Characters are believable and don't bore the viewer. A great movie to end the `Dead' trilogy in my opinion.OVERALL Recommended for G. Romero's fans. No doubt , a must for every horror fan. This movie has it all : action , zombies, plot , solid acting , good gore effects. Not to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as it first appears...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When 'Day of the Dead' was initially released during the 1980s it was met with almost universal derision and critique. Most people thought it was offal actually.It is only in the present day that the film can be viwed once again, as a cynical comment on the nature of commercialism, the consumer and the politics of the era.George A. Romero clearly felt that everybody was forgetting what was really important and merely thinking about there own skin and what they could gain. I don't think he liked the 80s much. Or its politics.Apart from the film ageing well its got probably the best special makeup effects in any horror movie. THey are cringeworthy and sickening - like such events would really be. Its only the sociopathic or those who have seen the film many times that will be able to watch fully open-eyed first time round: not that its scary, just repulsive.Watch out for the performance of Joe Pilato - that man is an utter legend. He sucessfully turns the lead villain into a bumbling juan-ker, incapable of remebering his basic military training (check out the scen when he tries to load a rifle). He's got some of the best lines in cinema history and his body language and movements are second to none.Everyone else is pretty forgettable but look out for Bill Paxton's cameo* as a zombie, as he appears behind the bald, high pitched bloke that gets his eyelids ripped off.See it a few times and you'll grow to love it. The most uncut version is on Region 1 DVD.*This is quite probably wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>meditations on our zombie friends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The recent explosion of enthusiasm for zombie films and video games is...puzzling. Aren't zombies just the most disgusting things ever? How on earth did tales of cannibal corpses penetrate into the mainstream? Well, they're not quite mainstream yet - I do think the average viewer would find "Day of the Dead" merely gross, and nothing more.I'm also puzzled by people who find horror films "funny." "Day of the Dead" was disgusting enough to make me close my eyes time and again - in fact, I missed seeing most of the end, but I did hear lots of "arrgh! aargh!" Funny it ain't - not to me, anyway. It's harsh and effective, even if it's not my idea of entertainment.As usual, Romero tries to inject a bit of social commentary into the movie, but in this case it doesn't work. He condemns a bunch of gun-toting military types (we're okay so far) while at the same time trying to evoke sympathy for the zombies (now we're on shaky ground!). Sorry, I don't care what the zombies are supposed to symbolize - the disenfranchised, homeless people, whatever - they're just too gross to warm my heart. I wanted to see Bub go. Is this good horror? Depends on your definition of horror. Once these movies get too gory, I tend to think that the social commentary takes a back seat to the dubious pleasure of seeing people ripped to shreds. Maybe zombies are so popular because they allow us to vicariously experience the pleasure of going on a rampage...but that's not exactly appealing to the noblest part of ourselves, is it? So, in the end, while I recognize some elements of good filmmaking here, I gotta say that it feels pretty much meritless. Choke on it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror's answer to 'On the Beach'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's actually a very long time since I've seen 'Day of the Dead'. It's difficult to find here because the Romero trilogy are the most frequently stolen videos from Australian libraries (truly).Day of the Dead doesn't achieve the satirical hilarity of its predecessor, 'Dawn of the Dead'. This time out Romero goes for absolute oppressiveness, and the result is hauntingly bleak: the mood of utter bleakness has stayed with me for almost two decades now. The only thing I can think of in horror which comes close is 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', and even that doesn't come _very_ close.The zombies who, in the previous movie, were taking over the country at a prodigious rate, have now taken over the whole planet. The few humans, scientists and civilians, holed up in an underground complex, may well be the only 'real' humans left on Earth. Perhaps pockets are holding out elsewhere, but there is no evidence of it. Meanwhile the zombie army roam the countryside, and it's only a matter of time before they close in on this final bastion of humanity. There is a remarkable parallel with Nevil Shute's 'On the Beach', where humanity's last outpost, Australia, waits as nuclear radiation closed in.Scientists work desperately, and one suspects, futilely, to find a cure, while military hotheads get on their back. Disturbingly, they have partially 'domesticated' one zombie. Romero's effects and make-up have taken a big leap since the previous movie, and this time around the zombie are genuinely hideous, as is the air of filth and decay which permeates many scenes. Some scenes are nearly as oppressive as the Richard Burton/John Hurt version of 1984, which is saying something. Most of all though, it is the sense of futility and doom which hangs over this movie from the start - arguably even from the end of its predecessor - which make 'Day of the Dead' memorable.I generally don't like horror movies. This one really stuck with me, though. Most people prefer 'Dawn of the Dead', and I agree it's cleverer, but for an atmosphere of sheer isolation, futility and bleakness, this one gets the gong. 'Dawn' gets around the problem of 'how do you make a zombie movie without being unintentionally funny', by being satirical on purpose. This one truly is nasty. Quite an achievement. Just ask the actor who had to lie under days-old decomposing offal in one scene!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As zombies roam around Florida, scientists and military personnel hide in an underground bunker. The scientists are only interested in studying and controlling the undead, but the military wants to destroy them. And the zombies are hungry and eventually find their way inside to feast on the living.George Romero's third and final chapter in his "Dead" trilogy is surprisingly disappointing, due to third rate performances, weak plot and slow pacing. (And the zombies move faster than this film.) The only saving grace is Tom Savini's above average special effects. My evaluation: ** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of the best horror trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an intensely difficult task to come up with a reference point from which to review this film. Does one approach the review with the intent of comparing Day of the Dead to the first two installments of the legendary `Dead Trilogy'? Or does one ignore the fact that this is the ending of a three part epic and review the film based solely on its own merits? Initially, one may be inclined to completely ignore George Romero's first two masterpieces (Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead) when tackling this job. However in doing so, this approach would ignore the significance of Day's characters and their plight in the grand scheme of the Dead universe and the plethora of social commentary therein.Day of the Dead is an excellent film no matter how you look at it. What makes the film so successful (and so unsuccessful upon initial release) is that it explores the logical conclusion of the series. Night of the Living took viewers by surprise, introduced us too a group of strangers, some of whom we learned to love and others we learned to hate. Behind the thin veil of horror, Romero made a statement with his violent zombie film, but one that was not so bold as the one he would make in the wham-bam follow-up, Dawn of the Dead. A summary of the basic themes of Dawn come in a scene where a zombie dives into a fountain and grabs coins from the bottom. This scene is terrifying in its implications and it at once shows the zombie-like actions of consumers and the actual worthlessness of money in its physical form. If Romero had explored the cause of the rise of the zombies and explored their relationship to the primal activities and tendencies inherent in us all, where was he to go next?Day of the Dead, in the most pure and simple of analysis, is reduced to a morality tale involving the idea that man is his own worst enemy. At the center of this story is Sarah (Lori Cardille), one of several civilian scientists, and a group of soldiers holed up in an underground bunker in Florida. The scientists take a blow early on in the film when they learn of the death of Major Cooper whom had apparently been more of sympathizer of the scientists than the other military personnel. The resentment on the part of the soldiers towards the scientist can now take full effect. This resentment is fueled by Cooper's successor, Captain Rhodes (Joseph Pilato), who insists that the scientists' studies are a waste of time and the zombies should be dealt with by force. However, Dr. Logan (Richard Liberty) has been making progress with Bub the Zombie and has taught the chained and bound zombie to remember some of his tendencies from his life. Dr. Logan's continued (apparent) decline into insanity, the restlessness of the soldiers and the steadfastness of Sarah leads to a series of human mistakes that threaten to destroy what could be the last safe-house for humanity.Where Dawn of the Dead expressed claustrophobia by showing us a familiar (and big) structure reduced to a prison-like stronghold where the safe areas become smaller and smaller, Day of the Dead includes real claustrophobia. These clashing personalities are stuck in an underground salt-mine and must balance their desire to live and survive the zombies, with the need to survive with each other. Because this movie (like the others in the series) is as much a human story as a zombie film, the performances of the actors are key. All involved here do an excellent job, from Lori Cardille as Sarah to Richard Liberty as Dr. Logan. The gore effects here are a vast improvement over Dawn of the Dead and are terrifically realistic. The zombies have much better makeup this time around and instead of hundreds of identical zombies with gray powdered faces, Tom Savini (a master of makeup and gore) gives the zombies personality by giving many of them very unique and elaborate makeup applications. One of the most disappointing aspects of this film is the weak score. While it does serve its purpose in some spots, overall it falls short of the memorable Goblin soundtrack of Dawn.Mainly faulted for its need to veer vastly from its original script due to lack of funding, Day of the Dead never forgets its roots. Again, this film is nothing more than the natural, logical conclusion of Romero's three part study of the human condition. While this film is much more `talky' than the others, it is up to the audience to really listen to what these characters are saying. Because it is arguably the most relevant of the films, really, it has to be commended. As a follow up to Dawn of the Dead, a non-stop violent shoot-em-up zombie action romp, though, Day of the Dead may have suffered from the Aliens 3 syndrome many years before Aliens 3 was released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Day of the Zombies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the zombie movies I've seen, Zombie(Fulci) Night and Dawn ( Romero) or Redneck Zombies ( Trauma) I was very impressed with DAY OF THE DEAD. George Romero had a lesser than expected budget to make this movie, but it was great! Suspense, horror, gore, and even comedy at times made this one of the best zombie movies of all time. The eating looks real ( Thanks to Savini) and the plot is genius. On a zombie movie standard i rate this 8/10 Dawn being the highest with 10/10,on a scale of all movies ever released, I rate this movie a 7. Not because its a great zombie movie, not because its a great horror movie, but because it is highly enjoyable...especially if you're a zombie horror fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine that Armageddon has arrived, and you have somehow survived the carnage. Will you be safe, at home, with all your loved ones around you, familiar neighbors and trusted friends, all pulling in the same direction to recover from the devastation? Or, is it possible that you will be miles from anything resembling your comfort zone, and surrounded by people with whom you would ordinarily not associate under more normal circumstances, indeed, people whom you would avoid at all costs, would never agree with, might actually even despise? You find that you cannot even agree on what has happened, much less figure out how to pull in the same direction to survive. You find that, rather than the best in human nature coming to the fore, the absolute basest of primordial instincts take over -- and you must play politics once again just to survive, while the danger of a social order gone mad closes in from all sides. How would YOU behave?Here, the dead walk in the light of day, while the living are survive, in an underground tomb, turning everything we know and expect neatly upside down.Romero has combined all of the insightful social and political commentary of his previous two "Dead" films, subtracted most of the humor, pumped up the gore, and in the process created an absolutely claustrophobic masterpiece that becomes more remarkable with repeated viewings. Wonderful lines ("Be grateful you live in the suburbs, Johnson. You ought to see how crowded the city is getting to be."), underrated acting, tight direction and editing. Totally convincing makeup effects that outrank anything CGI has accomplished. A terrific score. Completely brilliant movie, happily now getting a second look by those who initially dissed it.It clearly isn't a movie for everyone. But, if you can appreciate where Romero is coming from, this movie is an endless treasure for the horror fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A PERFECT "DAY"!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you asked this die hard horror film junkie to quickly sum up George Romero's seminal Dead Trilogy, I would say that Night of the Living Dead is the most innovative and influential one. Dawn of the Dead is the most ingeniously layered and popular one. But Day of the Dead is the BEST ONE! Without a sliver of a doubt. And contrary to belief, there are a lot of people who proudly share my assessment. Never has Romero expertly crafted a more incisive, more compelling and more searing masterwork than Day of the Dead -- this is George Romero's direction at it's absolute finest. The final(so far) entry in the Dead Trilogy is a cerebral and brutal portrait of man's inhumanity to his fellow man, his unwillingness to unify for the greater good, and his insatiable lust for tyranny. Tensions run dangerously high and resentments are rooted painfully deep within the frayed souls of the last vestiges of humanity made up of civilians and military personnel who take refuge in a glum, claustrophobic underground government storage facility. Life inside the subterranean settings is terribly dysfunctional, the inhabitants constantly engage in abrasive, futile arguments about how to put an end to the zombie global infestation or petty quarrels brought on by cabin fever. Pretty soon, the incessant bickering among the group escalates into severe violent conflict, as one of the soldiers decides to declare dominion over storage complex and it's dwellers. The dialogue is as profound as it is incendiary, channeled through prime performers. Josef Pilato's turn as a loud mouth, wannabe despot, Capt.Rhodes and Howard Sherman's turn as the childlike, sympathetic zombie guinea pig, Bub, are the most memorable. Nearly two decades have passed since Tom Savini's phenomenal, red and meaty FX first nauseated critics and audience members alike and still those ultra-graphic visuals have managed to retain all their horrifying realism and repugnant potency to this day. Outshining some of the current crop of CGI creations of the present. Dawn of the Dead's Screwdriver-in-the-ear Zombie actor, John Harrison, composed a truly amazing score. One of the best ever orchestrated.Now, I know some of you might find this review to be a bit on the overpraising side, but...THIS MOVIE DESERVES IT!!! AND THEN SOME!!! Mr. Romero, the entire cast and crew of "Day", I thank you all so very much for producing THE GREATEST HORROR MOVIE EVER MADE!!!! This is one "Day" which will be remembered for all eternity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2003 DVD of Dead - formidable degree of intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something very special about 'Day of the Dead', it could be the effects - still spectacular to this day, it could be the terror behind the story or the way the humans turn on each other. Then again it could the ever waiting presence of the dead (400,000 to 1 was it?) above ground. Whatever the reason, 'Day' is an almost no holes barred rotten flesh-fest... but with a degree of intelligence sadly lacking in many of it's contemporaries. It proves that talking about the dead is just as scary as seeing them shuffle en-masse towards you. Regarding this new 'Double' dvd of 'Day, I can only add praise to praise. Yes I am a fan of the movie (I have been to Fort Meyers and stood outside the Edison Theatre on a deathly quiet sunday morning... and listened for the footfall of the dead). Truth is, Day is a great movie to have in any collection, but that does not always guarentee a good dvd package (which are an entity unto themselves these days). I don't mean one should get hung up on extra features and ignore the movie, but if both can go hand in hand then you are onto a winner. On saying that therefore, this double dvd has a re-mastered 'Day' on one disk, and a blood splattered plethera of features on the second disk including an all-new 37 minute documentary with interviews with George, the ever beautiful Lori Cardille, who has not changed a jot, Joseph Pilato (the menacing Rhodes), and Howard Sherman (Bub, the almost human zombie). Other features include background stills, Bio's, TV spots and trailers and lots lots more. This is a highly polished dvd and worthy of both 'Day of the Dead', and the awesome AnchorBay who also delivered a well crafted and finely tuned double dvd with similar interview and extras for 'Near Dark' some months ago. If you are a fan of zombie movies, you have to get this dvd as it is a must for any serious collection. The blood is redder, the screams are louder and the moaning of the dead seems all the more closer. Lastly, the cover (with BUB) is cool as is Dr Logan's notepad, but I'll let you discover those for yourself. 'Well worth the wait'.Keth.</fullReview>

It feels like it isn't finished but through the years it has become cool to watch it and try to see what Romero intended. This actually should have been the best one, until the next one-I hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is in my opinion the most intelligent of Romero's Dead films, and the social commentaries and deeper meanings are laid on thick here. But it's also technically well made with some of the best gore I have ever seen. At first, I was turned off by all of the hating, irate characters, but after dwelling on this movie for some time, I feel the unlikeable characters actually gave this movie an interesting twist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very underrated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Next to Night of the living dead this is probably the best Zombie-movie ever made. I think it's definitely better than Dawn of the Dead, especially because it is filmed in a much more professional style and the makeup FX from Tom Savini are the best the Zombie-genre has ever seen. Nevertheless it never reaches the tension of the classic Night of the living dead. My biggest complaint about Dawn was, that it was too long, and the FX didn't work all too well. This movie is pure entertainment on the technical status of a Big-Budget Horror movie of recent time. I also think that the computergame Resident Evil was inspired by this Film more than just a bit. It's a shame that the movie Resident Evil wasn't directed by George Romero. He would have made the movie a lot better. But that's the fault of the producers of Resident Evil. Definitely one of the Horror highlights of the 80s and in Horror history itself. Forget about the modern Kindergarten-crap. If you're looking for a real cool Zombie movie and you haven't seen this one yet, get it. And besides, the new Anchor Bay DVD is absolutely worth it's price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an awesome zombie flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead is certainly one of the best horror movies of all time. In general, this film is a little more slow paced than Dawn of the Dead because it focuses more on the character development. But there's enough zombie kicking action in the last thirty minutes to satisfy our "voracious" appetite. The zombies, especially "Bub," were cool, and look ultra realistic. Tom Savini, as usual,did an awesome job on these decaying flesh eaters and the gore scenes. I strongly recommend this flick. The only reason why I saw this movie so late was that the special edition DVD took too long to come out.:/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BEST ZOMBIE MAKE-UP EFFECTS EVER!!! CHOKE ON 'EM!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living Dead started it all. It was a creepy atmospheric classic about the dead coming back to life and attacking people in a rural farmhouse.Dawn of the Dead continued the story. An action-packed Zombie-thon that followed a group of humans to an abandoned shopping mall where they set up residence to escape the outside zombie nightmare - where the world is about 50% zombies now - until the amazing heroes vs. zombies vs. bikers climax. This remains my (and a majority of fans') favorite Romero zombie film ( and Romero film period).Day of the Dead picks up after the natural progression of zombie terror that began with Night and escalated with Dawn. Now the zombies outnumber the humans about 400,000 to 1. The film follows 12 survivors -soldiers, scientists, a helicopter pilot and a radio operator - who live in an underground military shelter. The soldiers only want to kill the zombies and are at odds with the scientists who want to study, perform tests on, and even train the zombies. The soldiers are led by the psychotic Rhodes, who at one point threatens to have a scientist shot if she leaves the meeting he is holding. The head scientist, dubbed Dr. Frankenstein is also somewhat crazy, but in a much less threatening way. He wants to train the zombies to behave. And is having much success with his "star pupil"... Bub. Bub is zombie who is "rewarded" when he behaves. He doesn't try to attack the humans... nor does he see them as lunch. Lori Cardille stars as Sarah, a scientist who comes across as kind of a Sigourney Weaver Lite and is our main heroine in the film.Enough with the story... lemme tell ya why this movie rocks... the Tom Savini zombie make-up effects are simply the best ever put on film!!! Not to mention the excellent performances by Howard Sherman as Bub, Richard Liberty as Frankenstein and especially Joe Pilato as Rhodes (who delivers my favorite lines in the film "CHOKE ON 'EM.... CHOKE ON 'EM!!!"... hilarious).This may not be the balls to the wall action/horror extravaganza that Dawn of the Dead was, but it's a great follow-up and has better make-up effects. And, I feel that it is even more enjoyable than the original Night of the Living Dead. For those of you who have seen this only once and didn't enjoy it (I was among you)... see it again. It might just surprise you how entertaining it is. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*Rotten in parts but the general claustrophobic atmosphere and at times almost unbearable tension make this a minor masterpiece.In an unspecified era, at least a year from Night of the Living Dead, a hastily chosen and rapidly crumbling unit of scientists and soldiers stationed in an underground silo are carrying out the now pointless task of capturing and studying zombies. Pointless because they have had no radio contact with the outside world for months and even if they find a "cure" there is noone to report to.The soldiers have the most dangerous task, capturing, coralling and later removing live specimens for dissection and when Miguel loses control of a ghoul due to exhaustion this begins a chain of events that culminate in the living dead overruning the mines.First the bad: The shouting and bickering amongst the characters tends to get on your tits after a bit. We are meant to perceive that their claustrophobic environment and the futility of their task is making them a bit miffed but simply yelling out lines like "I SAID SHUT UP!" for a great chunk of the movie does nothing but irritate.The continuity is quite often perplexing coupled with some gaping maws in the logic. For example as soon as the elevator thuds to a halt at the movie's climax there are zombies everywhere. It is only on repeat viewings that you realise this is because the corral was also left open, yet we only see the most fleeting glimpse of this. Secondly, Rhodes managed to make it to safety in a golf cart trundling along at 5 miles per hour to a door about 100 metres away yet his soldiers seem content to run about in every direction as an excuse for getting killed. And finally, what the hell happened to Miguel once the elevator descended? No sign of him once he pushes the button and this is one thing that really annoyed me.Some of the plot smacks of Thomas Harris-syndrome. In an effort to wrap things up on time we have at least 3 characters act out of character. While Rhodes was a b**tard it is never apparent that he would commit cold-blooded murder (he chooses not to on 2 occasions), let alone the terrifying and prolonged demise he had planned for Sarah and Bill. Similarly his constant ranting about his "men" coupled with his obviously horrified reaction at the contents of Logan's freezer (Pilato's best scene in the movie) does not tally with his detached abandonment of the same "men" at the movie'e climax. And finally, are we meant to assume that Miguel was so crazy that he chose to die in a protracted and agonising fashion that was precisely what he spent most of the movie gibbering in fear of.However, Howard Sherman is perfect as trained zombie Bub and even evokes sympathy from the audience. Phillip Kellams gives his all in his final scene ("don't let this happen to me") and Gary Klar is convincing as the brutal thug Steel.Despite the sometime lousy acting (exceptions going to Lori, Richard and Howard) the atmosphere present in the caves is wonderfully played, claustrophobic and sweaty with the constant threat of death hanging in the shadows.The final scenes of the soldiers fleeing in terror through zombie infested caves, with nowhere to go grabs you by the throat and the payoff is some of the goriest and cruelest deaths ever suffered by Romero's victims.As has been documented many times before, this was NOT the movie Romero wanted to make. His obvious passion for the undead is underlined by this fact however as he appears to have let this movie slide as if to say "See what you made me do".Like 28 Days Later this movie has enough scenes of genius to make you forget that some of it is lacking.Hopefully the Anchor Bay DVD out August 19th will set the record straight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie with my parents back in 1985 at the theater (poor taste in judgement)and thought it was better now than then. I had to see it again because too many people have compared it to "28 Days Later". I liked "28 Days" but that is another review. Day of the Dead was pretty gloomy and had some potentially great plots which didn't go anywhere. The thing that really bothered me was why the unstable character wasn't just hogtied and left in isolation. Other questions are: Why didn't they all plan an orderly escape, since there was a helicopter outside? Didn't the commander in charge realize that there was no government, and that he could do whatever he wanted without anyone's approval? How could there even be an underground facility in Florida, since it is all swamp land? These are things the director maybe had in mind, but wasn't able to make it happen, probably due to money. It was more frightening than Dawn of the Dead because it didn't have dopey music and it was not in a shopping mall. The best thing about this movie is the musical score. Second best was the makeup and last was more a more serious tone out of a silly subject. It must be difficult to make a zombie film because of the topic and general overkill of the subject. Best suggestion is for each person to think of what he would do in a world populated by zombies and then have nightmares about it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the DEAD films - so far.....WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Debate has raged over the years as to which Romero DEAD film is the superior work. Some think NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968), some think ZOMBIES - DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978), but in my view, DAY OF THE DEAD (1985) is the best of the three. I never rated NIGHT as highly, simply because it seems a bit disjointed before it's admittedly shocking climactic twist. DAWN always needs a little bit of trimming in the midsection simply because the character development holds back the actual raison d'etre for the film, which is the zombie sequences, which work very well at the start and finish.By the time of DAY OF THE DEAD, the formula has been defined, but the film is perfect for the structure to work and without question, in my view, it is the most effective of the three films made so far. Rumours abound that Romero has a fourth on the way, but for the moment, let's take a look at DAY OF THE DEAD.The film opens with the last remaining survivors surveying a deserted city and they have now taken up residence inside a nuclear bunker with hundreds of zombies trying to crash the perimeter fence. A wacko colonel is at loggerheads with a doctor, who is determined to create more human responses in one of the captured zombies. The colonel is determined to take everybody out of the compound away from the zombies, but the doctor is against this, asking him 'Where will you go, Colonel?' Naturally things are beginning to get tense for all. The lead female (Lori Cardille) is also concerned about the way things are going and tries to create an air of peace....Romero's eye for characterisation (actually the best out of all the horror directors in recent times) works well and Tom Savini delivers the gory goods in spectacular fashion, notably in one of the climactic death scenes. For me, DAY OF THE DEAD is the quintessential zombie film and one that is far better than the previous films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>personally this movie is a great end to what i consider an accidental trilogy, also including Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. It is slower than the other two and not as big when it came out, but Romero still has his taste and talent there. Clearly political like the first two, the idea mixed with the music score, which is well done and fits the tone of the solitude and isolation of being overrun, is great. I have recently seen a comment on this movie about how 28 Days Later is similar, I couldnt agree more...Boyle stole the idea from Romero, whether he realized it or not, not that its a bad thing. The acting wasnt too bad either, Lori Cardille, whos father played the original Night of the Living Dead does a good job of keeping it going.. i rate this an 8 out of 10..enjoy if you can!</fullReview>

This one is good enough so it's hard to make fun of it really, but it's certainly not good enough to be worth watching. Therefore, it is a complete waste of time.

		<shortDescription>An f/x bonanza</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night of the Living dead is a classic film. It paved the way for horror films like no other. Dawn of the Dead is one of my faves, although the f/x are somewhat dated now. Although it is quite possible that the undead (if they were to come on back) would be all blue and smurfy. Now Day of the Dead. If you're looking for realistic gore, and lots of it, Day of the Dead is your film. The f/x are super, kudos to Savini for this. As realistic makeup f/x as I've ever seen in a film, and they're all throughout the movie. For this alone it's worth the view. George Romero has cast unknowns in his zombie films for whatever reason, (me thinks he can't afford anyone else) and that's just fine. Unknowns need to start somewhere and you could snag, or even make, a budding star. But how about they not suck? The Dawn of the Dead cast does a decent job. There are some nice moments there. NOTLD...well, he had like 12 dollars to make the movie so whatever. But the people in Day of the Dead are hideously bad. And all they do throughout the film is yell at each other. Badly. And when they're not yelling, you get to hear the pilot with the bad reggae accent get all deep and unconvincing and all that bad stuff. The guy in charge, the captain, spends every single moment doing the angry thing. It's jut not good. Sorry bud. The atmosphere in this film is very depressing, it's quite gloomy, and there is never an uplifting moment. That's fine...hell, the world is overrun with zombies. See, if I was making this movie, and I knew how much my actors sucked, I would have made it silent. Oh yeah. Keep all of that atmosphere jazz, and have no one talk. They still would have sucked, due to their stiff corpse like bodies (these are the live people I'm talking about) but at least we wouldn't have to listen to painfully bad actors yell at each other for however long this flick is. The special effects are fantastic, and it's great to see actors who suck get torn apart by zombies. See this film for gore galore.

		<shortDescription>The darkest day of horror the world has ever known! 4/4 stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Contains minor plot spoilers) The final installment in George A. Romero's "dead trilogy" is, for reasons unbeknownst to me, the least popular. In my opinion, Day of the Dead is not only the best film of the series, but the best flesh-eating zombie film ever, and my personal favorite horror movie. In a cavernous underground bunker, the remains of a paramilitary unit, a helicopter crew, and a few scientists have been researching ways to control the living-dead in the hopes that they will eventually be able to restore order above ground. Things go from bad to worse as cliques within the group begin to turn on one another, each secretly plotting to leave the bunker with a small helicopter, the group's only means of escape.Day of the Dead not only captures the dark, claustrophobic atmosphere of Night of the Living Dead, it manages to convey the social commentary present in both Dawn of the Dead and NOTLD. Day of the Dead may not be the grand finale Romero had originally planned, but it's worth noting that it's his favorite of the series, and for good reason. Strong acting, excellent characterization, unbearable tension, an overwhelming sense of isolation and dread, and the convincingly graphic makeup and special effects sequences make Day of the Dead one of the most timeless horror movies ever made. Although many have complained that the ambiguous ending is disappointing, I feel that it was appropriate end such a consistently dark series on a hopeful note.</fullReview>

I mean I really felt how terrifying it must have been being a normal person underground afraid of the sick flesh eating zombies above AND the scary paramilitary types below you are with. its like being trapped between a rock and a hard place. the zombies never looked as scary or as sick. there was nothign campy about them.they were just plain scary. and the dark underground emviroment really added to the tension as if there was no hope above or below. there were some great innovative ideas.......bub the zombie who remembered some of his past undead life, the scene where the bad guy was pulled apart and eaten alive while yelling at the zombies to choke on it. its been too long, I cant wait for the new one when romero finally gets it done! I hope he doesnt shoot for a mass audience and make a low gore version!</fullReview>

But it had potential in the beginning with the city, but it blew it with the ending.

The caves, however, gave the proper atmosphere for a film that seemed rushed out. I really hate to give negative words on Romero, but the plot in "Day" was really off the mark and lame.

		<shortDescription>Not All That it Could Have Been...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero's final 'zombie trilogy' installment is a fitting end to the series although marred by the ghosts of what could have been. The nihilism of the first film returns in the final version although mitigated by a 'happy ending' for those who cannot handle the characters' situation at the end, they could not havepossibly escaped from the camp yet...gasp! It was all a dream! Romero should have stuck to his guns and retained the fatalistic ending alluded to throughout the film (chopper is out of gas, the mob of zombies waiting for them outside). The plot is firm, the acting is fine in the context of the film as nearly every military officer gives an over-the-top performance that perfectly matches the hypocritical view of 'dumb soldiers' common at the time. The ending is neither here northere as the final movie caps off all that Romero's trilogy is, three good horror movies with a dash of social and political criticism that bites just as deeply as a zombie's maw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If u liked NIGHT and DAWN you'll like DAY. Even though i think that DAWN was the best in the series you will still appriciate DAY. It starts off with a girl sitting in a room then she approaches a wall then when she goes in to touch it hands come out of the wall and grab her. Then it goes out and shows a helicopter flying over quiet miami,florida. People r searching 4 surviviors. A women steps out of the helicopter and calls 4 survivors over a megaphone, nobody responds then we see a newspaper flip over it reads "THE DEAD WALK"(something that resident evil-the movie stole.).Then we see a ticket booth we see a man that looks normal but then turns his face and we c a disfigured side. Then we see more and more zombies come out, and then the camera pans out and we see blocks full of zombies,no one normal person.Then we see a a zombie walking then we see its face of a disfigured zombie drooling and the title appears "DAY OF THE DEAD"(the best opening ever!) This movie may have some problems like a'lot of talking,parts with no action, the constant use of racist remarks. The good things about the movie is the creepy atmosphere(the dark empty underground military base,the screams and moans of zombies that can be heard,the second exit were zombies roam in the darkness.) The death scenes are the best of the series and dont look fake like italian zombie movies. This movie is a must see for zombie movie fans and GEORGE A. ROMERO fans alike. some say it is the worst of the series, it is not it is the weakest film but that doesnt stop it from being better than zombie 3&amp;4. Put it this way dont mistake weakness 4 a bad movie its a MUST SEE.</fullReview>

The plotline is slow, and I found myself getting bored. There are a couple of nice splatter/zombie-scenes in this movie, but they are too scarse, and come too late in the movie.I wouldn't Not recommend it, but unless you're a die-hard Romera-fan, find another zombie-movie instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Romero's haunting final masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt the best of the living dead series. It puts closure to the story. The ending caps off the greatest, GREATEST, trilogy in the history of modern film. George Romero says that this is his favorite living dead movie for a reason...it is the best. This movie can only be challenged by the later day classic Return of the Living Dead Part 2. But if you are a fan of the living dead series, have news for you. George Romero has turned the keys to the kingdom over to the best young film maker today. Shooting begins this christmas for...Dusk of the Dead. Let us all hope and pray that it is as good as this engenius piece of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first two were excellent. This one wasn't all that great. Most of the movie the people are fighting among themselves. The monster gore is really really gross. The music was all right for 80's music. The acting was good. But over all the movie was only OK. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the Night of the Living dead movies.

		<fullReview>This is the third and last part of the trilogy of Romero's Living Dead movies. The living dead have spread all over the world, and the last survivors are trying to find some other remnants of civilization. Meanwhile, tensions are rising between a group of scientists and a military group. A doctor, called "Dr. Frankenstein" tries to domesticate the zombies, so they will stop eating the living. For gorehounds only the last 15 - 20 minutes are really interesting: Tom Savini has outdone himself, and the perfection of his efx are breathtaking, but nothing more. His violence seems to be so clean, so well set up that it losses a part of its effect: while in Fulci's movies the violence was so cheap and filthy that the whole atmosphere was breathing a scent of rotting flesh and death, Romero's zombies are state-of-the art corpses, perfectly made and directed. Nevertheless, what makes the movie watchable is the lack of misogyny Fulci's films were full of. The film is violent, yes, but the violence is alleviated by not specifically making women the victims of the zombies' attacks. All in all watchable, but some people will need a strong stomach and a sense of humor. Additional information: this movie has been strongly cut in Germany, but was banned instead. Now, it has been re-ratified 16 by the FSK (German board of censors), but keep your fingers away from this torso. It's a shame!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this horror hit, george a romero takes us out of the night. Beyond the dawn, and into the darkest day of horror the world has ever known! The third film in george a romeros dead trilogy, follows a group of army generals, privates, and civilian helicopter experts, into a situation where zombies have pretty much taken over the world. The human survivors, suddenly find no living beings after searching a hundred miles up the coast of florida in a helicopter. When they find a big group of zombies in what seams to be a deserted town, they are forced to sweat it out underground in a florida missle silo, while the living dead regroup above. The movie stars Joseph Pilato as Capt. Rhodes, a mad general with a short temper, Terry Alexander as a John, a jamaican helicopter pilot, and Lori Cardille as Sarah, who is mocked about the relationship with one of the soldiers, Miguel, who begins to collapse from stress. In the underground complex, a group of professors, and doctors study the zombies, that they find in nearby mine shafts. While underground the army generals refuse to follow along with the experiments, and constantly yell and argue with each other. The army men, slowly turn bad, and begin killing the proffesors after they find out the professors feed their specimens the body parts of the deceaseed soldiers. to the ending. It's a rather odd, but suspenseful ending, with surprises that follow it. the acting isn't exactly great, but the special efx and make-up of Tom Savini are really great! In all, it's a suspenseful flick, with a few parts that are just plain dumb, but it's still a must see title for horror lovers.</fullReview>

Great score, tense atmosphere (very blue), and great hammy acting especially in the scenes where the sergeant confronts nutty scientist Frankenstein. The splatter effects are great and any gorehound will be well satisfied after viewing this. Romero triumphs again in this superb claustrophobic thriller. He throws the military, scientists and a couple of chilled out lay-abouts into an aircraft bunker surrounded by certain death in the shape of millions of flesh hungry zombies - great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been a long time now since I last saw this film, but it made a much deeper impression on me than the two earlier films in the series (and, for that matter, any of the rip-offs, remakes or homages out there). This film is a slow-paced melodrama much of the time, but it is intelligent and witty and unlike most horror films it actually has something worthwhile to say. The most frightening characters in this film are not the zombies, who actually function quite effectively outside the walls of the compound where they are virtually unseen. Rather, this macrocosm of societal leadership in a state of breakdown puts a glass up to the truly horrific creatures that we have the ability to become. In this sense, the zombies are not exactly evil, they are just doing what they do, running on instinct or like machines, but the real struggle of good and evil (sanity and madness) plays out quite clearly among the human element.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST of the series. Here's why.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time to set the record straight:Night Of The Living Dead is surely worthwhile to watch as an exercise in film theory and history, but its almost non-existent makeup fx and 50's B-movie feel do nothing to terrify (except for the last scene, which is admittedly, an all time classic). A good film overall, but mostly what you'll get from this one is the ability to join the ranks of film geeks who enjoy pontificating on it's social and political subtext- it won't exactly give you nightmares.Dawn Of The Dead is another one more worth talking about than actually watching- its goofy blue-faced zombies and slapstick action are supposed to heighten it's status as "satire", but I think Romero was mostly trying to scare you, and this film, well, doesn't. It's also given way too much credit for thematic depth- sorry , but placing a movie in a mall does not a "statement on consumerism" make.Day Of The Dead is the only one of these films to accomplish what a horror film is meant to do- HORRIFY. Here Romero's theme of mankind "eating itself alive" (in more ways than one) is fully realized. The film's cold setting, unsympathetic characterization and raw, no-holds-barred action all combine in a grim, nightmarish vision. Reviewers who have complained about "flat" characters have clearly missed the point- the real stars of this film are Savini's mind- numbing gore effects, which remained etched your brain long after the film is over. Definitely not MEANT for regular viewer consumption (Not Rated for a reason), Day Of The Dead ranks as one of the greatest achievements of the genre.------PS Im sorry but this needs to be said- who was the idiot who recommended an NR horror film to a bunch of kids who enjoyed the (horror-themed) ACTION flick Resident Evil...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>poor film with great splatter effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comments posted here by the reviewer from Bristol, UK, are discerning and right on the mark. Other reviews here have debated whether the "likeability" of the characters is an issue, but this squabble misses the point entirely. The problem is that the characters are dramatically unbelievable, not unlikeable. The mad Dr. Logan brings an enjoyable moment to the scenario, and the subplot of trying to train and tame the one zombie (Bub) is momentarily diverting. Likewise, the gore effects are great, and constitute this film's principal redeeming quality. Apart from this, we are given a cast that, in terms of acting talent, might have soundly flunked auditions for an afternoon network-TV soap opera. Likewise, the script these unfortunate actors are given is a train wreck of trendy, empty cliches, as though cut from cheap cardboard with blunt kindergarten scissors. The characters are just disengaging, with but the shallowest pretense of personality or subtext, as thin as a crummy lace curtain. One's a jerk, so I guess we're supposed to dislike him. Another is put-upon, so I guess we're supposed to identify or relate, or sympathize, or something? What a terrible bore. Is the problem the acting or the script? Stop, its both, working together in a synergistic, downward spiral. This movie's fatal flaw is its central deficit of well-motivated, credible or even interesting main characters. It is hard for me to fathom how we've gotten this from the same man behind the 1968 classic masterpiece that started this series off. "Night of the Living Dead." That film was a taut orchestration of suspense and terror with a grim, grittily convincing and very original perspective that, given the fantastic scenario, the real threat is not a bunch of slow-moving, mindless gut-munchers but humanity's self-alienation and inability to overcome its own flaws. Such timeless masterpieces are never "dated"--a point seemingly lost on shallow contemporary audiences that rate films according to how recently they were made, and thus help ensure a continuing erosion of quality as they rush to embrace the latest lame offerings.</fullReview>

Day Of The Dead represents hopelessness , armageddon , the end. There are only a small group of people banded together underground..and they seem to be battling themselves more than the living dead..tsk tsk. What I like best about Day is Bub..the coolest zombie ever..that zombie needs his own damn fanclub ..and also the gore..the gore is awesome here..and superior blood is used..Dawn of the Dead had cheap looking blood that gave off an orange color..Day has fantastic blood..plus an awesome ripping a body in half scene.

		<fullReview>The third in George A. Romero's zombie trilogy (although some may say forth counting the crazies as part of the series). All three are great films and this is the second best behind Dawn of the Dead. The gore is high and of very good standard thanks to Tom Savini. We get heads ripped off, people riped in half, head shots and bites galore. My favorite parts of the movie are those with Bub the zombie in. I am a massive zombie fan and Bub is my greatest zombie ever. The film sets the mood that the main charictors are trapped very well and is depressing throughout. This is thanks to how dark most of the film is and the superb direction of Romero.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well done to the reviewers here who champion the DOTD cause. It seems universally "hip" to rate the first 2 instalments as masterpieces, and to ridicule and dish DOTD. I for one think the trilogy grew in stature and excitement with each episode. NOTLD is frankly, dated, as is Psycho and all the other 60s black and white shockers. DAWNOTD is a great movie, but at the end of the day DAYOTD is a fantastic attempt to put a full stop to the story. One reviewer here hit the nail on the head perfectly, the characters in the movie are not there to be "liked" or "cheered on". The situation has become hopeless and the small collection of humans who are left are obviously sliding into mental breakdown and desperation. That is the beauty of the film, there is no HOPE left. Who wants a happy ending? That's not what Romero or this trilogy is about. Leave the happy endings to Schwarzeneggar. It holds onto it's themes, mainly in that a woman is the central charachter, and arguably the strongest. Rhodes is a fantastic "villain", Bub steals the show and Logan (Frankenstein) is so psychologically damaged it makes you wonder if it would be better to hang out with the zombies rather than him! Overall this movie attacks your brain rather than your stomach, the feeling of claustrophobia and hopelessness is at times unbearable, and theirs enough gore to keep the splatter crowd happy. Quite simply a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest film I've ever seen in my life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't watch horror films to be horrified. I've sat through enough monster and slasher flicks to realize that fake gore and makeup combined with bad acting doesn't even get me to flinch. Dawn of the Dead was a film that made me think and care, but it never actually scared me. Still, the film was so much fun to watch that I had to try the third part of the series.Day of the Dead is nowhere near as much fun, though very much worth seeing. As a previous reviewer commented, you don't really root for the humans. You don't like them. In fact, they scare you. And that's what really becomes the point. In the third film, this last group of human survivors in an underground bunker prove to be far more horrifying than the clumsy, thoroughly predictable living dead. Romero gives a terrifying glimpse into an apocalyptic future in which people can no longer cope with their situation, and so break down and become monsters to one another. This is the only film I've ever watched in which I had to pause and take breaks because the film was getting too intense. If you like to be scared....really really scared in a way that doesn't easily go away as soon as the film is over, I strongly recommend this film. Just don't watch it alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me say that I'm not going to go too much into the plot summary as others have already done this. Second, I'm not going to follow the usual idea that third sequels tend to be rubbish. Thirdly, I feel I should add my views on a film I've seen way over a hundred times since I discovered it four years ago.The film has a lot to live up to. 'Night Of The Living Dead' is geniunely creepy, especially the very first zombie who still scares the hell out of me. 'Dawn Of The Dead' was a great film let down by a few budgetary constraints (such as the lack of finance for it's original ending to look convincing, and the 'accidental' use of a certain piece of music from 'Monty Python And The Holy Grail' in an apparently thrilling scene). 'Day Of The Dead' had to be as good as, if not better than these two films.The first problem was that the movie we see is not the movie intended. The original script can be found on the internet, and paints a very different picture which could, with a few modifications and updates, be made today and garner much appraisal. But finance problems reared their ugly head again, and the big plans for this sequel (which thrill me even on the page in script form) went down the proverbial swannie.Some key characters remained, others dissappeared, but the script was always going to be a struggle to complete convincingly. And there are moments when you'll be cursing the dialogue and the acting - but hey, it wouldn't be a low budget horror movie any other way!Personally I feel that there is much to commend this film, as long as you can get past the appalling Cassio-Synth style soundtrack. Terry Alexander is fantastic, a performance full of energy, humour and above all pure greatness. Together with Jarlath Conroy (the Rowan Atkinson lookalike) he gives the film some light relief from it's bleak vision of mankind's future. Also capable of bringing a smile is the late Richard Liberty as Dr. Logan - aka Dr. Frankenstein. And best of all, Sherman Howard excells as Bub, the kind zombie.The effects are gory to this day, there are plenty of jumps and above all else, the same humour that fills 'Dawn Of The Dead'. It's a shame that a vintage film suffers from cuts and trims to this day, yet 'Day...' does, and really it deserves to be viewed uncut and often. Like the rest of the trilogy, this film ranks alongside the best horror movies of all time, and no big budget made Romero all the more creative...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day of the Dead has been looked upon by alot of horror fans as being inferior to Romero's earlier works--Night of the Living Dead and his epic masterpiece..Dawn of the Dead. DayOTD is definately the darkest and most bleak out of the trilogy. A very closterphobic feel and an overall feeling of helpessness looms in the atmosphere as the zombie masses outweigh the humans by the odds of 400,000 to 1. While being stationed in an underground missle Silo, a team of Scientists and a Military squadron try and come up with a solution to eradicate the problem. Tensions flare and the difference in opinions on how the situation should be handled is finally the boiling point. Each person goes in different directions--pulling themselves apart from everyone else--defying ideas others offer to try and help. This film is not a very far cry to how the world has spun itself out of control. This was a sign of the times back in the mid 80's as the Reagan/Bush administration influenced Military power and the dreaded doom of chemical warfare was on the verge of destroying the world. This just proves to show that when people pull apart and spin in different directions, Problems are inevitable and solutions are halted. The gore in this film is almost theraputic to a certain degree--constructed by Tom Savini and his even MORE experienced F/X team. While this film is talky throughout, this is crucial to the plot. Romero's original vision for DayOTD was drastically shortened by budget constraints, but nonetheless he delivers a satisfying theraputic film that will always remain timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointed to see so many naysayers reviewing this film, which I consider to be a classic, and potentially the best of the Romero "Dead" trilogy.The Romero films are typified by disturbingly realistic treatments of a fantastical, and now cliched, concept - the undead. There is an almost neo-realist feel to Romero films, with their commonplace settings, even pace, and extremely sophisticated scripts."Day of the Dead" throws the viewer straight into a world where the undead cover the earth. From the opening shot where survivors land a helicopter in a metropolitan area to find it completely swamped, to the undergound military installation with its personal abattoir of the undead - the atmosphere throughout is relentless and bleak.The characters are ruined people, who suffer from the extreme psychological conditions of their oppressive environment.Romero puts the story first, and so the film is dialogue heavy. But this is a good thing - and more like a Scorcese film than a Hammer horror.If you're an intelligent, well-versed cinema fan who happens to enjoy disturbing films, then SEE THIS MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Day of the Dead" has provided me with one of my earliest horror-related memories. When I was six years old, my local videostore had a poster on display for the video release. There was Bub the Zombie in all his rotting glory. "The Darkest Day of Horror the World Has Ever Known!" screamed the tagline. Needless to say, this striking image captivated my innocent little mind. However, I knew there was no way my parents would let me watch it. So the issue was pretty much dead for awhile. Still, even when the poster came down, I still would remember it whenever I went there. (The store has long since closed shop, thanks to the rise of superchains like Blockbuster.)It has been a good sixteen years later, and I finally rented the damn thing. I was aware of the negative reviews it recieved, even among some horror fans. However, it's actually a pretty decent film with some good moments, although it does have some serious flaws. Romero did what he could under the circumstances. A troubled production, the film went through hasty rewrites after investors slashed the budget when he refused to promise delivery of an R-rated movie.The final result is certainly worth at least one viewing. I was intrigued by the idea of a zombie who has not yet lost all semblance of humanity. "Bub the zombie" actually generates sympathy for his plight. It is a grim reminder that zombies are victims too. They were once human like us, but have been reduced to mockeries of life.Lori Cardille delivers a solid performance, in the mold of the Alien series' Ellen Ripley. She shines as a rock of sanity in a sea of madness. However, Joseph Pilato overacts terribly as an unstable military leader, although I suspect he enjoyed himself in the role.I admit the midsection is a bit of a drag. It's more than compensated for by the gleefully gruesome finale, as people are torn apart by the walling undead. Makeup artist Tom Savini displays some of his best work here. His zombies are the most convincing in the series thus far. Some of the zombies in previous "Dead" films looked a bit fake, but here they actually look like real walking corpses. Pure, 24-karat gold.Bring on "Twilight of the Dead," I say.**1/2 (out of ****)Released by United Film Distribution</fullReview>

It still offers plenty of Graphic Gore that " Dawn" wouldn't offer, this one is not for the Squeamish.Similar movies i would recommend: Dawn of the Dead, Re-Animator, The Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, The Thing ( 1982), Total Recall, The Toxic Avenger, From Dusk Till Dawn, Lifeforce, Lucio Fulci's Zombie, C.H.U.D, Return of the Living Dead, The Stuff, House by The Cemetery, The Beyond, Rats, Scanners, Resident Evil, Dead Alive, and Stephen King's The Stand.9/10 ( half perfect but very good stuff.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I recieved this particular film in the mail, I had watched both versions of Night of the Living Dead (preferring the Tom Savini/Tony Todd remake) and for the last week or so prior had been watching Dawn of the Dead quite feverently. Also, I have seen the C Minus offshoots Return of the Living Dead 2 and 3. I must say this is my favorite of the 'Dead' series. I was in the mood for good campy zombie fun, that means to me: gore, and zombies, and zombies making gore, and gory zombies. The middle of this movie doesn't have very much zombie gore, or gory zombies, but is rather concerned with Dr.Frankenstien and Bub, a trained zombie. I, personally, found the ridiculous campiness of the entire thread to be hillarious. It would have gotten on my nerves, except I couldn't stop laughing with some brand of giddy anticipation. Speaking of, the ending to this film is absolute bliss, reduced to 20 minutes or so of human slaughtering and 'cannibalism' and a climactic "Show-Your-Respects-To-Bub" gun shot in the spine that had me cheering. In short, George A Romero's Day of the Dead is one of the best zombie films you can see.</fullReview>

I agree that Dawn of the Dead is a much better film, although you have to remember that Day of the Dead has a completely different scenario and plot. Zombies have taken over the world, it's gone past the point of rednecks and the army trying to clear up. The world is in ruins, there are few survivors, if not any.A group of scientists posted by the government are working underground clear of the zombies, trying to find a method of 'containing' the zombie epidemic. Also there's a group of soldiers down there who are supposedly there to cater for the scientists needs, eg collection of zombies for the scientists to test on. Although, there are immediate personality clashes with both the soldiers and the scientists. This makes interesting viewing, as the story is not like an ordinary plot where a group of people are trying to escape from zombies. There are some great scenes where the soldiers and scientists are fighting.There are some excellent death scenes too, some a lot more technically realistic looking than that in Dawn of the Dead. Especially when Pilato is pulled in half moaning 'choke on em!'. If you take a good look at some of the zombies in this and compare them to Dawn of the Dead they also are a lot more realistic, they seem to be less 'alive' looking and tend to look a lot more rotten. Also, a lot of the zombies seem to have their own personalities, everytime I watch I can see different zombies in there, such as a wedding zombie, a clown zombie, a football zombie, a balarina zombie etc. I think those are some especially good touches.If you read the Day of the Dead script which is floating around on the internet, you can perhaps see a little bit better on how Romero intended the film to be. If you're a true fan of zombie films you'll be able to appreciate Day of the Dead for what it is, don't be blinded by the fact that it's a sequel to an amazing film which was a lot better. It has it's good points, and it's definitely entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfair comparisons to Alien 3...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm fairly sick of hearing how "Day of the Dead" is just as poor as "Alien 3" ("Alien 3" REALLY sucked). Yes, it isn't a movie that would appeal to everyone, but it has enough brilliant moments to qualify as a good horror movie. The acting is certainly hit-and-miss, with Lori Cardille and Joe Pilato making understandable and believable adversaries and the rest of the cast basically chewing scenery (except for Dr. Logan). The first scene is post-apocalyptically cool, and the mood is continued pretty effectively. Realistic zombie effects and modern automatic weapons make for a slightly grittier, far less surreal rendering of the world of the dead. The story is probably the film's greatest weak point; it lacks the epicness of "Dawn of the Dead" and the tension of "Night of the Living Dead," and what remains is somewhat overblown conflict between humans. In spite of all these problems, "Day" is still worth a rental for horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good ideas buried under layers of cack. (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a noticeable similarity between George Romero's Dead trilogy and the later Alien franchise. Both series start with tense, claustrophobic films that quietly scare the audience with a degree of subtlety; both expand on their ideas for their first sequels, placing the same principles in a warlike setting and upping the action considerably; and, sadly, the pattern continues into the third instalments, because, like Alien 3, Day of the Dead is a hefty anti-climax. As the movie opens, the living dead are still munching their way through a thinning crop of humans, and this instalment is the most desolate, with its small group of characters speculating as to whether or not they are the last survivors on earth. It's a promising start that raises hopes that Dawn of the Dead's apocalyptic atmosphere will be continued, and further hope is found in the basic plot that sees scientists in an underground bunker attempting to find a solution to the zombie problem. It's a shame that these fresh ideas and fresh perspectives, which could have made a classic movie and a classic trilogy, are wasted on a film that lacks the intelligence, class and logic of its predecessors. It's a real disappointment. I'm not often impressed by horror, and I'm put off by the genre's tendency to churn out needless and endless sequels, so it was great to discover the intelligence and invention of the first two movies in the series. But Day of the Dead falls into the horror pitfalls that its predecessors had wisely avoided. Where there was invention there is now clich, where there were solid characters there are now cardboard cut-outs, and where there was tension there is now boredom and twiddling of thumbs.While the acting in the first two movies was nothing to write to the Academy about, here it nosedives past the quality found in TV movies, plummets beneath am-dram, and lands a few hundred miles below amateur porn. Joseph Pilato's performance in particular is so hammy that, if he followed the De Niro school of method acting, he must have spent months being salted, smoked and cured in preparation for the part. At best, Pilato's co-stars manage to make their underwritten and over-clichd characters look two dimensional. From the gung-ho military men to the crazy scientist, from the drunk Irishman to the platitude-spouting West-Indian who wants nothing from life but to lie on a beach, they have none of the complexities you would expect from having seen their predecessors. To add insult to these critical injuries, the dialogue they're saddled with is repetitive and banal. A great strength of the first two films was their moral ambiguity, but here it's ignored in favour of outright stupidity. When I watched this instalment, it was introduced by critic Mark Kermode, who discussed its ambiguity at length, insisting it allowed the audience to choose whether to be disgusted by the scientists or the military or the living dead, seeing that each was evil in their own way. Unless he's travelled to a mirrored universe where reality is inverted and this movie has a goatee, I'll have to say he's talking out rubbish. There is no doubt as to who we should be cheering for. The bad guys are ridiculously bad, managing to be sexist, racist and murderous, and the worst suffers by far the most grisly death.Strangely, it's the gore of the death scenes that comes out as the highlight of the movie. Night of the Living Dead had scared us without showing much, and it was to its credit, but here Romero takes the opposite approach without betraying his earlier work. Sadly, it's the only part of the film for which that can be said, but the effects are remarkable and worthy of the highest praise. Unfortunately, these scenes also show up a flaw that the first two movies had mostly managed to escape; the inconsistent strength of the zombies, that sees them struggling to push through a chain-link fence one minute, and happily ripping a body apart the next.Day of the Dead is a huge anti-climax, and in every sense a wasted opportunity. There are great ideas here, and great potential for an old idea to take off in a new direction, but they are lost in a film that has too little in the way of imagination and too much in the way of running time. If Night of the Living Dead was the fine starter, and Dawn of the Dead the filling main course, Day of the Dead is the turd Romero squeezed out the morning after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day of the dead is a very rare gem in the sense that it is actually a fantastic movie considering it is a sequel, low budget, and over 20 years old. With a cast of only 12 people the movie is able to hold you to the story and keep you wondering, what is going to happen? When will it happen? And who do you cheer for. The actual death scenes are by far way ahead of its times. The make-up job is on each and every zombie is unbelievable. The movie is good, actors are great, and the graphics are amazing. **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, this is an excellent horror film. The chemestry between the crew is fantastic. The tension will have you gripping the side of your chair. Joseph Palito (as the gung-ho military sargent Rhodes) and Richard Liberty (the scientist Logan, nick-named "Frankenstein") stand out, Palito as the military man silently looking as if he is about to crack from the pressure and Liberty as the confused scientist who is more interested in studying the zombies than finding a way to defeat them.Yes, I said zombies.For those of you who don't know, this is a zombie movie. It is the third in a trilogy which saw the fall of man to the 'living dead'. The zombies feature primarily in the first and last twenty minutes and the film seems to be going easy on the gore until the last twenty minutes.The blood bath may limit the film's appeal, but the tension, drama and conflict are the factors which makes this such a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To see the way the more pretentious type of commentator discusses 'Day of the Dead' is to realize just how much craziness roams abroad in the critical asylum: though it's paced so badly as to be virtually dead on its feet (excuse the pun), is scripted in a way that would disgrace a first-year writing student, and is acted with desperate incompetence by an F-list cast not one of whom deserves to work again, this almost unwatchable piece of cinematic ordure is routinely discussed as if it contained some kind of artistic substance - a drama of ideas, no less. Add to its other failings a slapdash approach to characterization, utterly basic and unimaginative cinematography, and a numbingly tension-less, supermarket-music score, and no-one except the dyed-in-the-wool gore fanatic and the dead-in-the-head post-modernist will have the remotest idea why anyone ever thought it would be worth making.Disagree with me if you wish.

		<fullReview>I feel that Day of the Dead is the best of the Romero trilogy! Many, if not all of you who read this will disagree with me. Why do I feel it is the best? For a few reasons....first- the zombie action and gore effects are top notch. Tom Savini's makeup is simply fantastic, being technically superior to the first and second films. Secondly- the acting is very good. We have a wide display of characters, from the obsessed Dr.Logan, the evil Captain Rhodes, to the mild mannered pilot John. Everyone does a great job in the role that they have been given. Third- the atmosphere of this film is also the best of the series. Bleak, dark, with not much hope. It compliments the dark underground mine scenario. Now I loved "Night of the Living Dead" and "Dawn of the Dead". They are true classics, indeed. But Day is the most realistic and for me it simply is the best. I do not feel that it is too talky, because the dialogue serves a purpose. This movie does not get the due that it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Day That Will Live In Infamy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to have to say that after the phenomenal one-two punch of "Night of the Living Dead" and "Dawn of the Dead", George A. Romero's "Day of the Dead" is a disappointing finale to the trilogy. What's really frustrating is that there's little tastes of how awesome this movie could've been- like the opening scene, where four members of a government team land in a deserted city looking for survivors of the apocalyptic zombie invasion, but instead find only an army of the walking dead (including the excellent "Dr. Tongue" puppet). But then the film heads underground, where it focuses on the endless conflict between the scientists and military personnel. These scenes soon grow tedious- the tension is well established early on, but then it's repeatedly displayed in endless scenes of characters yelling and pointing guns at each other. All the soldiers are hateful and cruel and the scientists are bland (expect the mad Dr. Logan, who's bizarre experiments are a high-light of the movie). The best characters are the helicopter pilot and the alcoholic communications guy, who remain neutral for most of the film. Overall, the most likable and sympathetic character in the film is Bub, a zombie being "trained" by Logan. Howard Sherman's great performance is enhanced by Savini's excellent, expressive make-up. In fact, "Day" does feature the coolest-looking zombies of the three films, and the gore is fantastic, especially the finale of zombie mayhem. The actors are fine, especially Joe Pilato (from "Dawn"), who makes a great (if one-dimensional) villain, and Greg Nictero (the "N" of KNB effects) and Taso Stavrakis (a biker in "Dawn") appear as pot-smoking soldiers. The script's dialog is snappy, but the film's score is pretty terrible. So anyhoo, I guess this movie is better than no zombie movie, but makes me long for the masterpiece that is "Dawn of the Dead". Perhaps one day Romero will get the budget he deserves to make his ultimate view of a society decimated by the walking dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"DAY OF THE DEAD," ahh, the final horrifying chapter in famed horror master's trilogy of deadly Anubus inspired terror. Critically, Romero had to know he wouldn't top himself with "NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD," but he did. He surpassed even his own expectations and the critics by making a sort of B+ film classic with DAWN OF THE DEAD now immortalized as a cult favorite that we all enjoy because it's such a poignant, satirical view of how 'zombified' society really is! Is also had the true horror and situational distress that its predecessor carried - people, pitted against each other to survive. And this is the situation for "DAY OF THE DEAD" Everyone knows the plot so I won't bother telling it, but think about the film rationally (from a writer's viewpoint). The world has been literally turned upside down. The dead control the world, and the living live like worms beneath the earth in what one character referred to as a 'great big 14-mile tombstone'. And that couldn't have been put more perfectly. As far as tension, hey, this film EXCELS in pitted situational stress and psychological mayhem. These people are in a Pandora's box. They're rats in a cage who're running out of supplies and who's world is becoming more and more claustrophobic as time continues. Now look at the characters; you've got Capt. Rhodes (Pilato) who's no more than a dog who's been told to 'sit!' but is getting antsy since that's it and that's all. He has to play leader, father and ruler to these people so they don't screw up the world he's living in anymore than it already is. My personal favorite character is Dr. 'Frankenstein' Logan (Liberty) always covered in blood-soaked scrubs and as jittery as the fly. Here's a man who's so lonely he's become best friends with a dead man. And so deranged because he's searching for a solution to an equation for which he has no control over. He might as well be trying to round off Pi. Critics who think this film is an inflammatory romp or overacted waste have their petty reasons since (yes) some dialogue is unreasonably profane and silly - but I doubt they realize that was written as part of the ridicule of the situation, which is why Sarah (Cardyle) is the focal character. These people are at war with a nation of zombies - it's a 'hopeless situation strategically' as Logan explains in a long-faced eulogy to the last members of the human race. 'Do you really think you can shoot them all?' he asks them, answering his own question, but also ignoring it. Bottom line... this is a fine horror film. For gore, for zombies, yes. I give this film an 8.5 for psychological terror, whereas (for example) a film like DEAD CALM would be a 10.0. Romero did a fine job on this, and he proved that three is not a crowd, it's a trilogy of terror. Until next time... Off the rock, on the ball, and strictly low-key...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last day of some, the continuing agony of others..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead (1985) is the latest in my collection, and, I watched Zombie (1979, Lucio Fulci) after buying it a few days ago, and now, after getting Day in the mail and actually watching it, I have to say, Day is everything Zombie was not.. from a decent cast, even with over the top performances, a good pace throughout, and an interesting screenplay.. It doesn't quite live up to Dawn of the Dead, but its a fine addition to George A. Romero's saga. The gore effects are right up there, and look pretty real.. the tension and breaking of the characters creates a sufficient atmosphere.. The only thing is that the ending is rather abrupt.. Some say its due to Romero not getting enough funding, and that may partly be true, but it brings up another question to mind.. She keeps having these dreams throughout, maybe she didn't survive at all? the end could be an expressed fantasy going over and over again in the mind of a zombie walking around somewhere.. Maybe this is all the last moments of her life flashing before her eyes before her change into the undead, and then the fantasy at the end going over and over again while her dead body wanders a new meaningless existence? In that sense, it could be like something right out of the Twilight Zone or Outer Limits.. and might be a final answer to the legacy, a final message about the world we live in and the zombies that now roam it, about the lost humanity that still exists, somewhere, buried deep within these 'undead' representations of ourselves.. This would also go right in with the story, and therefor, the abrupt ending might be more fitting than if it showed they escaped and got away.. Think about it, all of a sudden, we're treated as if they got away? Its pointed out in the film that the helicopter wasn't fueled up, and the zombies were there, so how did they escape? I don't think they did.. and in a way, if you can find this answer, if it really is what was meant, then the ending makes a lot more sense, atleast to me, as more a statement, the ultimate overrunning of oneself, the hero not surviving at all, but trapped, with one last fantasy, a small hope that didn't occur. I think, regardless of budget, Romero may have purposely decided it best to make the ending like this, without physically telling the watcher what it meant, therefor allowing a kind of interpretation, while also leaving certain clues inside the film itself as to what very well could have happened, and what did happen.The movie overall decided to go with a slower pacing, more built as an experiment in isolation, in the tradition of 'John Carpenter's The Thing', being ordered to continue something that may be futile.. in a sense, it reminds me a little of Re-Animator, but done to the style of George Romero.. To wrap it up, it may not be the best film, but its got it where it counts.. I liked it... and remembering Zombie, which should have stuck to the water, Romero proved once again he's on top of things, regardless of the limited minds not letting him do what he wanted to because of their lack of funding.. Maybe Romero will get to do the original script he had in mind in the new millenia, someone believing in his vision caughing up the money needed? I can hope..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is actually my favorite film in the Romero's Dead trilogy. I mean, granted, most parts of it are slow and borring, but to me, this movie accurately represents what life would be like if there was a zombie attack in america- it would be full of choppy dialogues, vulgar language, inane fights between the strong but stupid that have survived and the smart but crazy, just the certain feeling that this was the end, and everybody left were just a bunch of stupid, ugly supporting characters. I appreciate the fact that the leading woman in the story is not at all very attractive, even more supporting this film's realisticness. And, what's more, after you get through the boring midsection of this film, you get treated to one of the most gory, violent endings in all of film history; truly some great eye candy. Romero shows us everything, he doesn't wuss out and cut away when one of the men commits suicide, he shows it in full force. A very good movie, even if I can agree with everyone that it is pretty boring at some points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb last installment in the "Living Dead" Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Run of the mill fans of the horror genre seem not to like this last movie in the "Living Dead" trilogy. Thoughtful viewers, especially, those that look beyond the blood and gore of this series, perhaps those who enjoy foreign films with subtitles, are more likely to appreciate this film.Unconventional as usual, the courageous, intelligent protagonist, is a female, towering above the other people. White males are, as in the rest of the series, not main heroic figures. This is a rarity in mainstream cinema and is a refreshing change.Day of the Dead brings new insight to the viewer about the Living Dead. We begin to see things a bit more from their point of view--that they are victims too, especially with the one experimental subject, who elicits sympathy, as he succeeds in remembering some aspects of his life before death. Much like the empathy we could feel for Frankenstein's monster when he delights in looking at and smelling a flower, we get a different viewpoint of a "monster".At this military base, the thoughtful viewer sees that the dumb bureaucratic military have become the villains as they stubbornly insist on carrying out the bizarre research, which no longer has any relevance to the future.There is much wise commentary on our society, if one is willing to see it. This is a movie that can be viewed more than once, and each time, it is possible to get something more out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this film is deeper than many people give it credit for. The talky bit that everyone dismisses as boring and badly acted contains a lot of interesting musings on civilisation and power; there's the irony of the humans trying to teach the zombies to be civilised by 'rewarding good behaviour, 'We can trick them into behaving, just like we were tricked into being being good little girls and boys' as Dr Logan says, while their own behaviour is increasingly deteriorating as the rewards for civilised behaviour are removed. I don't know if most people think this is trite or they just don't notice it but I never see it mentioned, anyway I thought it was rather Lord-of-the-Flies-esque. Besides that it's interesting to see Romero's female protagonists getting stronger with each movie (In 'Night', they hid in the basement or just whimpered pathetically; this one chops off her boyfriend's arm with a machete). If you look at the ratings this movie has received on this site you'll see that the group that favoured it most was young women, I wonder if that could be the reason. Tom Savini's special effects are generally agreed on to be excellent, but something else I don't see mentioned much is the soundtrack, which is very cool in an eighties sort of way, and much more involving than the ironic jingle in 'Dawn'. This all adds up to make it an enjoyable and intellectually interesting movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Day of the Dead" is one of the most emotional and philosophical horror movies ever made. Many people were disappointed about it, because they had expected a giant horror epic, another improvement towards the cult classic "Night of the living Dead" and the sensational "Dawn of the Dead". Unfortunately director George A. Romero only had a very little budget, so he had to produce a claustrophobic drama instead of a bombastic epic. As "Dawn of the Dead" took place in a big shopping center, "Day of the Dead" happened in a little bunker complex. The only shortcoming is that Romero hadnt used more of those atmospheric scenes from the city as he did it in the beginning. Nevertheless the third part is the best of the serial: the characters are well developed and remarkable, the unknown actors do a great job, whats not typical for the splatter genre. Especially Howard Sherman as trained zombie Bub, Richard Liberty as Dr. "Frankenstein" Logan or Josef Pilato as choleric Captain Rhodes are fantastic! The story is more elaborated and far-reaching than in the first two parts: as the predecessor was pretty action-packed, this movie is more melancholy and dramatic (the relationship beneath the persons, the hopelessness...) on the one side; on the other its much more macabre and grotesque (Frankensteins experiments with the zombies, sacrificing his own people in the state of emergency "in the name of science..."). Also the F/X are excellent: in "Dawn of the Dead" the faces of the actors were painted with grey make-up, in this movie the living dead are bleeding, wounded, rotten... At the box-offices this film was not very successful. Perhaps the people were sick from the most of those cheap and nasty zombie flicks, which were stragglers to the immense successful "Dawn...". But it doesnt change the fact that "Day..." is another masterpiece by George A. Romero and an undisputed milestone of the horror genre! (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as NIGHT or DAWN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitly not the best in the trilogy, but still not all that bad. The story was good, creating a Lord of the Flies type situation. (spoiler) I thought that 'Bub' was a great addition, trying to attempt to domesticate the zombies made for an interesting final chapter. The scenes of gore towards the end were excellent. All in all, 7/10, not too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had some of the best gore scenes I have ever scene in an American movie. But basically the movie consisted of two things, gore and people sitting around yelling at each other. Which was good cause some of the things that were said made it more interesting to watch. But yes this movie has very good make-up effects and plot. I give this movie a 10 all the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie, but not really a conclusion..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got the chance to rent this excellent horror movie and was not disappointed. I must say this is an thoroughly an excellent movie and perhaps the best zombie movie after Braindead. I can't really say if Day of the Dead is better than the rest of the movies in this trilogy. But at least the zombies cause some sort of fear instead of laughter as the two earlier movies. I must admit I missed the humorous side that Dawn of the Dead had, but overall Day is better than Dawn and perhaps even Night of the Living Dead. This movie doesn't really offer a conclusion to the trilogy, which was a shame.I really like the part where the doctor conducts the behavioral testing on 'Bub', since it forced some kind of sympathy for the walking dead.The opening scene of the devastated city was brilliant and I really hoped we'd get to see more of it, but then the movie escaped underground. The underground complex was rather eery and by far much more effective than the shopping mall in Dawn of the Dead. Characters are, while a bit the same as in the previous movie, mildly interesting. But the audience doesn't feel much for them. The doctor was definitely my favorite character along with Bub. Overall a recommended movie for those who like zombies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Romero's Swansong to The Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering George Romero wasnt given the full resources promised to make Day of the Dead and had to drastically re-write the scipt he did an amazing job. In the claustrophobic atmosphere of a goverment military research bunker, tempers are frayed and something has to give. While the scientists are looking for ways to try and control the dead, the soldiers are looking to destroy them and escape. Tom Savini is as reliable as ever with the make up effects, with strong performances from among others Richard Liberty as Logan, Lori Cardille as Sarah and Howard Sherman as Bub - the zombie that Logan tries to domesticate. The electronic soundtrack fizzes away beautifully coupled with Romero's tight script and direction - all combine to make this a truly memorable film. This film is a must for all movie goers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really pretty awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I'll expand on my last review a bit. I just watched this again, and I can honestly say this was not as good as I had let on in my previous review. First off (mild spoiler), the whole thing about taming the zombie, no. Just plain no. Obviously no one remembered the fact that it's just the bodies themselves that devour the living, the zombies have no soul, they live only for eating the warm blooded. Second, the whole tone of the film, it was so ugly. I understand being trapped inside a bunker with flesh eating zombies scratching to get in is no walk in the park, but the overall dreariness doesn't scare you, just makes you want to turn the VCR off. Third, the characters. Now, as for the fact there is no likable characters, that's not completely true. Sarah was okay, as were the radio-man and the pilot. But that's it. Dr. Logan was a plain out Lunatic, the commanding officer was sadistic, and the rest of the army officers were annoying. Miguel did almost nothing for the film except (mild spoiler again) let the zombies into the bunker. The assistant scientist also didn't do anything for the film except add another character. In fact, the best thing about this film is the ending. It's the most hopeful thing in the entire film, but it isn't worth watching unless you fast-forward to it on you VCR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what was Romero thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He created two of the best horror movies of all time, didn't he notice some of the few details that made them so good? 1) Identifiable, sympathyzing characters ("Ben" and "Barbara" from NIGHT, "Peter" and "Roger" from DAWN). Every character in DAY had some sort of flaw/s. The Jamaican guy was nice but talked too much, the mad scientist was a bad actor, the military leader was loud and dumb, the Mexican soldier was overacting, the other soldiers were mean and idiotic, the girl had so many "bad dreams" that you got confused on what was really happening in the story, and the whole Bub thing was silly and moronic. 2) Zombies. The zombies are supposed to be slow, quiet, moaning creatures that only attack when they're a few inches from you. The zombies in DAY shoot guns, growl loudly, swing their arms, drive cars, salute people, and just keep coming outta nowhere. Also, people like to see the zombies marching through out the towns, chasing after citizens, banging on locked doors, eating intestines and brains, and they like to see that throughout the whole movie. A parade of zombies appear in the very beginning, but quickly dissapear for a long time. A few more pop up here and there in the middle, but those are the loud, annoying ones that you keep wondering why they won't just kill. Then at the end they're everywhere, and it gets annoying to see the same hundred zombies chasing after one person. But overall, the zombies in this movie are AWOL. 3) Location. NIGHT took place in a quiet, woods town where spooky stuff happens all the time, and in a place familiar to where many Americans live. Same with DAWN, in an average suburban mall where you would least expect a horde of killer monsters to flock and kill. At least portions of those locations were bright and satirical. This whole underground thing that they're in, whether it's a salt mine, a records storage facility, or a missile silo, it's dark, lonely, claustrophobic, confined, and depressing. It's also no fun to watch millions of zombies attack people in.Romero should have stopped after DAWN, and then the series would be just fine. Or perhaps it was the production value, or the script. Perhaps the movie is a good concept with a bad delivery, which it is. Perhaps DAWN and DAY should follow NIGHT and be remade into more modern and manic productions. Then again, I heard the remake of NIGHT wasn't as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool zombie movie, but not up to the first 2 films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first two films in the series were excellent, mixing gory zombie scenes with tension. In "Dawn of the Dead"'s case, it also added some truly great action scenes. But despite the greatness of the original 2 movies, this 3rd attempt doesn't achieve the same amount of genuine excitement and scares. Perhaps one of the biggest reasons for this is that it is a little too talky. In the previous films there was plenty of zombie scenes, but also keeping good dialog between the survivors. In this, the talking goes on too long. At least it's not boring talk, it's actually pretty interesting. But despite some of this film's faults, it remains an excellent closing chapter too George Romero's awesome zombie trilogy. Not the awesome film the previous movies were, but intriguing entertainment anyways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fitting end to Romero's Zombie Trilogy. A Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day Of The Dead is George Romero's concluding episode in his classic Zombie trilogy which began with Night Of The Living Dead and Dawn Of The Dead. To be honest Day Of The Dead is not quite as good but it is still one of the best horror films of the eighties and is a must see for anyone who enjoyed the previous chapters. The film is more dialogue driven than the previous films and seems more intent on showing the power struggles between soldiers and scientists in an underground bunker as a zombie holocaust rages up above. This is a very intense film lacking the dark humour of its predecessors and benefiting greatly from the superb performances given by the hole cast. The film is also the goriest of the trilogy, expect blood and intestines all over the place. The final scenes in particular are stomach churningly grisly. Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The character hostility surpasses that of the undead eating-machines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a horror film fan since my Dad used to rent them for me when I was ten. I have seen countless movies, obviously, but DAY OF THE DEAD stands out as being one of the most memorable and coldly effective. It is outstanding and unique in that the main characters, while different on many levels, attempt to coexist while surrounded by an unfathomable threat. The undead disease has spread, and humans are outnumbered by nearly half a million-to-one. The feeling of claustrophobia and desperate survival infect the film, taking it over as the rot of both the zombies and the minds of the military survivors become threats. This film makes me ill, and it's supposed to. It is one of only a handful of movies that generate true unease and hostility. This film wants to hurt you. Take my advice and let it. You will not be sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of Dawn (it's my favourite movie of all time in fact), I had been anxious to see this movie, the final part of G A Romero's zombie trilogy, for some time and when I did I was not dissapointed in any way, mainly because I knew what to expect beforehand. The film itself is a very competant picture with above average performances from all the main characters and though many people say it is too slow and talky in the middle, I think it is a great character study in how different people react to unbearable claustrophobia and hopelesness. It has better special fx than Dawn, but overall for me is not as good, but never-the-less still a good movie which I would recommend for everyone to give a try. I know think Romero should make a 4th movie with a definitive ending, because thats what this generation needs a really good zombie movie to end all zombie movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day follows Night and leaves Dawn for Dead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm probably in the minority here but I felt Day was streets ahead of Dawn in nearly every department, but was still way short on the first and best, Night.We all know Romero wanted to make a slightly better Day film than what finally materialised - but that wasn't his fault but down to a rather weak minded money conscious studio. However, what we do get is a very intelligent &amp; thought-provoking film where the zombies have finally won the battle and all that is left is to run (what the soldiers want to do) or stay &amp; understand (scientists viewpoint), with the gore being incidental to the story.The film is very "talky" which I quite liked; for once Romero decides not to spoon feed the audience with simplistic signposting for the next gore/action scene; the story of scientists &amp; soldiers living together while "Rome burns" is a good one, even more so if you want to see implacably opossed groups react with each other in impossible conditions.We have the conflicts, the plausible views, the experiments, the guinea pigs, the reasoning, the death threats and an overall sense of hopelessness. The temptation to give up on all this doom is so easy, with a helicopter readily available to take the scientists off to a remote island and spend what time they have left in some kind of normality.It's this kind of human psychology that was partially touched on in "Dawn" with the scientists discussing options &amp; reasons during the numerous &amp; chaotic TV interviews, but were never allowed to challenge the main story of escape &amp; consummerism.Day of the Dead hits many good notes. Romero restrains the guts until the very end, although some of the experiments are quite gruesome too. The acting also is generally quite good, especially from the lead female, Sara (Lori Cardille), who not only has to keep the scientists on track, pull the helicopter pilots into line against mutiny, but also has to watch out from any surprise attack from the sex starved soldiers she is supposedly working with.A lot of criticism was pointed at Pilato's dictatorial &amp; over-the-top Captain Rhodes. but I loved his performance as a soldier in conflict with the orders he is given(to protect &amp; assist a bunch of scientists) while also realising that the battle is already lost and that by staying where they are is a complete waste of time. He really does play the ugly part very well - and his comeuppance at the end seems rather justified.My favourite character though, is Richard Liberty's Dr. Logan (or Frankenstein). He looks a trifle eccentric but offers the film some sombre reasoning to a story that threatens to implode. The only downfalls are the claustrophobic surroundings and the rather "pleasing" ending. But for all that, Day of the Dead deserves to be held with distinction in the trilogy. Hopefully Romero will do a fourth, and bring the story to a proper close. ***/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compulsive viewing for intelligent horror fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The well known budgetary limitations of the film perhaps prevented it from being an absolute classic and the ending seems rushed and could have been even more exciting than it is. But despite its limitations, it is a grim but fascinating experience and in some respects a unique film. It is obvious that some of the people that deride it are the sad characters that you see shuffling around (rather like Romero's zombies) at horror events, quietly asking dealers selling obscure gore videos "is it really nasty?" However, if you're an intelligent open-minded fantasy film fan, you'll probably appreciate "Day of the Dead" - but if your sole interest is hard-core gore, avoid it, or perhaps run the last 20 minutes five times instead of watching the whole film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shame about the budget...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not much could live up to "Dawn of the Dead" as a classic zombie movie, and while with this one, Romero does his best with the resources he had at the time.This sequel has been much derided for its slow, talkative beginning. But I think it serves well as an idea of how people would interact in such a situation. We have a group of scientists and soldiers, who at the best of times would disagree on most things. In this situation however, they are isolated in the middle of a global crisis with no idea whether there really is anyone else out there who can help them.I can forgive this film for being ever so slightly boring during its first half, because there are some interesting conflicts going on between the characters. There is the military stance, where their only purpose is to carry out orders, and the scientific stance with the clearly mad "Dr Frankenstein" carrying out gruesome experiments trying to find a logic behind the phenomenon that has almost consumed the Earth.What really saves this film from being a mediocre schlock gore fest is the introduction of the "domesticated" zombie, Bub. Who would have thought that we could have any sympathy for a zombie? (Well, I did at least). It's a thought-provoking idea - could mankind really have overcome this horror through training them to behave (as the scientists believe) or through extermination (the military ethos)?Unfortunately, we never find out - as the zombie horde inevitably find their way into the compound, thanks to some typically human stupidity. And then Tom Savini's fantastic effects take hold and completely out-gross anything seen before. This is the main attraction in this movie without a doubt, and I think it's worth your patience during the first half.The film never really satisfies your need for some kind of closure, being the final part of a trilogy. I just wonder what Romero could have done with the budget required for the film he originally intended.Not brilliant, however it introduces some interesting ideas to the premise but unfortunately cannot deliver what we all wanted. Still worth a look if you like zombie movies.</fullReview>

Anyway, this is arguably the best of the DEAD series due to it's great performances, great plot, great effects, and a cool music score. It also feels much more apocalyptic than it's decent, but not great predecessors, DAWN OF THE DEAD, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING...well you get the idea.

		<fullReview>*COULD CONTAIN SPOILERS*After watching DOTD I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed. A extreme large part of the film mostly centers around the bickering between a troop of hard nut soldiers and a group of scientists. This is probably an attempt to build up tension but fails miserably and leaves us all bored and crying out to see some flesh eating zombies. In fact, the zombies play a fairly low key part in the movie.But the real reason that disappointed me was that the last 15 minutes of the film weren't the main part of the film. When the zombies eventually break in (which in my opinion should have happened a hell of alot sooner), the film really takes off and i found myself to be really enjoying it.I would prefer if all the talking and arguing was restricted to about 15 minutes and the rest spent on escaping from the army base and not the other way round. The other living dead films suffer from this problem although not to the same extent as this film.It seems sad that such a famous trilogy had to end with such a disappointing film.</fullReview>

I AM DEFINATLY GLAD TO OWN IT NOW!!i think this one ranks right up there with "Dawn". although the story is a little slow, the amazing effects make up for it. it takes some time to get into the gore, but once it starts, it's WELL WORTH IT. however, i did find the zombies somewhat discouraging. maybe it was because i was expected the zombies to look like the ones in "Dawn". i found them much more "believable" (if i can use that term) in "Dawn". conversly, i was somewhat disappointed when i 1st saw the zombies of "Dawn" because i was expecting them to look like the zombies of this film. isn't it ironic...don't ya think.I DID TAKE NOTE OF A INTERESTING PHENOMENON WHICH OCCURS IN THE TRILOGY:did anyone notice how the zombies seem to age in each film?? 1) in "Night" the zombies look pretty much like normal people (little makeup is used) 2) in "Dawn" the zombies are still pretty much human looking, but are painted so there skin appears to be rotting off or have a few bodily injuries 3) in "Day" the zombies are grotesque and disfigured with much decay having occurred.i just thought this was an interesting side note. this probably has only to do with the change in special effects technology. but, i like to think this is a result of the zombies "ROAMING THE EARTH" for 2-3 years between when each film take place. and since the initial plague, have AGED/ROTTED just like normal people would. WHAT DOES ANYONE ELSE THINK ABOUT THIS??overall i would rate this as equal with "Dawn of the dead". with both films being slightly better than "Night"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3RD TIME IS A CHARM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm assuming that most who read this have already seen this great film. When it all comes down to it, Day of the Dead delivers on many levels. Lets face it, people watch or go see a zombie film mainly for one reason- the gory effects action. Tom Savini's make-up effects are utterly awesome! They look ultra-real, and that is where this film succeeds. Director George Romero blends action, gore, wit, and seriousness very smoothly. Many have slapped "Day" for being too talkative, but the dialogue is intelligent and has a very strict purpose. People in conflict under almost uncontrollable situations. The characters are a great blend of good and evil. Soldiers versus scientists. These two groups specifically create some very intense dialogue. It never becomes boring because everyone has something to say about the situation they are in. Vulgar, but often hilarious comments by the soldiers break up the everyday talk syndrome. Plus, the soldiers are so unsympathetic and arrogant that most viewers can't wait to see how they meet their bloody demise. And Romero sets this up with gusto, building to a RIP-roaring climax. The film's last half hour shows Savini's inventive genius with fx make-up. Romero had to slow the pace and let this movie breathe. If you truly enjoy zombie films and respect Romero, then re- evaluate this film. It is clearly the best of the dead series. I will surely take heat on this, but I'll explain."Night of the living dead" IS a true classic. And "Dawn of the dead" is also a classic. But I think the aspect that puts "Day" on top is its realistic make-up effects. And realism hits that crucial nerve of the audience. They are technically superior to the other two films. Now I realize that the effects in the first two films were as good as they could possibly get for that time.....but "Day" stands alone as a great, underrated, gory, witty, well acted and all around technically proficient film. Let's realize that we are not judging Oscars here. There simply is no better zombie film than "Day of the Dead". Its job is to entertain and disgust,....and it succeeds with flying colors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is in many ways reprehensible film making but Romero's zombie films are the only ones ever to give me nightmares, so I give him some credit in tapping into some sort of unfathomable primal fear. Curiously I have Dawn of the dead nightmares and Day of the dead ones distinguishable by colour, the latter being overwhelmingly green. Many have felt this film disappoints, but it's entirely logical that the film should return to the claustrophobic beginnings of the first film. Perhaps it arrived at a time when familiarity had bred contempt. It's questionable philosophical insights may have bored many, but intrigued me. There is a great speech by the pilot John about god's judgement and a generally unnerving existential atmosphere about the ending of everything. Performances are uneven but there is a truly sad and touching one from the actor who played Bub. Direction is gripping and nerve shredding, Romero's earthy blue collar sensibilities not allowing for sentimentality and if it's necessary for a character to die then he or she will, regardless of audience sensibilities. If the film has a structural weakness then it is due to the fact that the zombies chase a bunch of bad guys we dislike, removing suspense to a certain extent.There is a power to his films in that the characters who behave unselfishly in risking themselves to help others are the ones who survive which suggests that man is not beyond hope. I think I'd have problems with the film if I saw it now, but I think he's an amazing man in many ways. The black irony he produces is great.

		<shortDescription>Much slower paced than the others in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>_Day_ is a lot more slowly paced than _Dawn_ or _Night of the Living Dead_; for a good third to a half of the movie, the only zombies around are securely chained to the wall, tied to hospital gurneys, or otherwise indisposed. The lion's share of the narrative goes towards exploring the tensions within a mismatched alliance - a group of eggheads alternately protected and bullied by a small detachment of soldiers. I'm not sure if it was just the copy I rented, but the editing appeared incredibly jerky. The sound was never affected, so the effect was perhaps intended, but to me it was the death of a thousand jump-cuts. All in all, rather dull and disappointing, although there is some serious mayhem in the last 20-25 minutes or so.</fullReview>

The unrelenting seriousness of the film is it's greatest strength, with a ever escalating conflict between scientists and military men that erupts into intense violence. A powerful film with few concessions to those seeking the atmosphere of fun that occasionally lightened the previous Living Dead film "Dawn Of The Dead," "DAY" is a shining example of serious independent horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that had a lot of thought put into character development. In Night of the Living Dead, the people were scared &amp; bewildered as this new menace of the walking dead struck, In Dawn of the Dead, the characters were making the best of a bad situation. In Day of the Dead, it has been a long time, people have been cooped up for too long, desparation is hitting hard, there are a few who cling to their belief's in a answer but the overall situation has reduced the survivors to primal thought processes. I read the original script for Day, &amp; it went a lot farther, but would have gone into the 3-4 hr mark. Still, the outcome of Day of the Dead was great, it was overshadowed by Return of the Living Dead which itself is a great movie, but Day is one of the best movies that got underated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's long overdue for a review of Day of the Dead (1985) by the excellent George A. Romero. Many people feel that "Day" is the best of Romero's "Dead Series" because of its ease to watch. We can't agree that it is the best (we'll leave that honor for the original, Night of the Living Dead) but we can say that the characters are some of the most memorable of the entire series. Our review source was the original formatted Media release, while in excellent quality, we wished it was widescreen (It has just been released this way for VHS). This cult-classic contains a great storyline with an admirable cast. Sherman Howard plays "Bub the Zombie" and does a most-excellent job at doing so. This 102 minute film, perhaps, is the only one of the series that actually makes you feel sorry for the zombies. A complete classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers: Whenever you are having a bad day, you should watch this splattergut classic. No bad day of yours can equal the terribleness of these peoples' bad day. Have you ever had to fight off hords of zombies and psycho military men? Didn't think so. In this Living Dead film, there is a lot of talk. About 60% of the film is people arguing and complaining about how bad they've got it. But Day of the Dead also has chopped-off limbs, ripped-out guts, and blown-off heads to even out the talkiness of the movie. This is worth getting on DVD, for the great Savini gore EFX and the spooky scares served up by Romero. 4/5  Also, this movie contains the definitive George A. Romero scene: Rhodes getting his guts ripped out and eaten by zombies, while at the time screaming in true E.C. fashion: "Choke on 'em! Choke on em...". And I've heard rumors about a proposed fourth Living Dead film entitled "Twilight of the Living Dead". This needs to be made. Let's bring the story full circle, but at the same time, leave the future uncertain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The gloomiest of the three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last &amp; most philosophic of George A.Romero's zombie trilogy is usually considered the weakest. It surely is the gloomiest, slowest paced of the three &amp; too dialogued. It lacks the chills of horror classic "Night of the Living Dead" &amp; the rhythm and humor of its Dario Argento produced sequel. But in the end it's not the film Romero intended to do: budget limitations forced the writer/director to fill with words what he couldn't show. And even if there are too many words, they are Romero's best. The characters are real, the message clear: ghouls are the first step of an evolution. Man blasted himself. Violence brings violence. There is a lot of well-done gore, too. Quite as much as in "Dawn of the Dead". Praise go to Tom Savini, Master of Horror Effects. This movie came out the same year as Dan O'Bannon "Return of the Living Dead"(an unofficial sequel to Romero's masterpiece debut). The end of a trilogy and the beginning of a new one. A step in evolution for Living Dead related cinema.</fullReview>

A decent story-line, characters and effects, it is slightly marred by the low budget and acting quality at times but that is easily forgiven in view of the enjoyability of the film overall.

		<shortDescription>Substandard effort from George Romero still has some ingenious strengths.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film when I was a high school frosh a couple of years ago (back in good old 1996). To this day, the images of rotting, undead cadavers mutilating their human cattle still torment my mind...DAY OF THE DEAD probably has to be the most repulsive, nauseating, and just plain disgusting graphic horror film I have ever seen! Even if this holds true, George A. Romero's really, really gruesome masterpiece, DAY OF THE DEAD is, at best, mediocre.The story is in a post apocalypse, where some of the "last" surviving members of the human race rush to find other lonesome survivors. For some reason, the zombies rule the Earth, and for some reason, these zombies forgot to set themselves up a hierarchy! The beleaguered human remnants consist of Sarah (Lori Cardille), a strong and intelligent scientist, and John (Terry Alexander), a pilot who just wants to get the hell out of the `shelters' that they have stuck themselves in. These people are the sane ones! Now...meet the insane survivors! There is Dr. Logan (Richard Liberty), a mentally insane scientist, and Captain Rhodes (Joe Pilato) as the even loonier and more belligerent marine.The scientists and military men quarrel for over one hour of this film, (as confirmed by Mr. Leonard Maltin himself) trying to fix their predicament. On one hand, the scientists hope to find a cure to "heal" the living dead. On the other hand, the marines want to make mincemeat out of these primitive zombies...DAY OF THE DEAD is absolutely slow moving, lacking the energy of DAWN OF THE DEAD and the suspense of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Sure, there is a plethora of gross out moments, such as surgery, cannibalism, and lots of disembowelments, but DAY OF THE DEAD is unremittingly boring and it even produces ennui within the audiences. You cannot blame George A. Romero; he did his best with both a constrained budget and an abridged script. I am sure that even he had higher expectations of this film.Still, despite the fact that DAY OF THE DEAD is a weak follow up to DAWN OF THE DEAD, DAY OF THE DEAD has plenty of fine moments which earn this movie its few merits. The premise about the last (and lost) survivors being victimized by their own fears and paranoia is of interest. It produces a hypnotic effect as well. The claustrophobic atmosphere in DAY OF THE DEAD works remarkably well also. In this sequel, Romero wanted to illustrate a chilling, fearful vision of an apocalyptic world ruled by zombies. As shown in DAY OF THE DEAD, this perspective is a disturbing description of what the future may look like where zombies rule the surface and the surviving humans themselves may begin retrogressing into a barbaric-like state...Another attribute in DAY OF THE DEAD is the acting. The performances in this movie are for the most part, very good. Although the actors do have a ridiculous tendency to overact at times, the majority of the cast does a great job delineating honest characters. For once, it is a revelation how the peremptory Rhodes tries to take control of the situation...with the threat of violence. Sometimes, he holds his own cohorts at gunpoint...just so he can make message clear. Talk about the use of brute force! Also, the relationship between Dr. Logan and his "prized" zombie "Bub" (magnificently portrayed by Howard Sherman) is particularly interesting and even humorous. Out of the over thirty specimens Dr. Logan keeps as `scientific experiments,' he thinks of Bub as his most promising test subject. It is also quite compelling to watch Bub remember some of his human characteristics. Bub unusually shows signs of human memory.Furthermore, DAY OF THE DEAD shows the consequences of what would happen if people would rather fight and argue with each other than work together. As implausible as it may seem, mankind may someday succumb to his own fallacies. If people refuse to cooperate with each other, then they might as well sign their own individual death warrants!By the end of DAY OF THE DEAD is a particularly gut-wrenching, stomach churning, skin-ripping moment. The finale is needlessly disgusting. (POTENTIAL SPOILER!) Thanks to Tom Savini's gory special FX, the viewers are treated to an indelible moment where zombies literally rip a marine apart...limb by limb. Yes, these scenes of human dismemberment are quite sickening.DAY OF THE DEAD has shown a lot of promise but unfortunately, it has not lived up to many of the fans' expectations. In addition to being a very talkative film with plot holes galore, this movie contains an ending that lacks coherence...and sense. The cop-out ending especially defied all comprehension, though Romero probably wanted it to be ambiguous. I was left scratching my head as to wonder when did this event take place and why. (I will not tell you the ending, see it for yourself.)Unfortunately, the flaws in this film outweigh the assets. DAY OF THE DEAD is a daring movie with more than a nuance of nobility, but a rather slack pace and irrelevant plot elements happen to maul a wonderful concept. The idea is great; on the other hand, the story-line needs to add a hint of logic. DAY OF THE DEAD earns an `A' for effort. The product though will not be rated as leniently. Let's just say that DAWN OF THE DEAD is much better...RATING: ** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George A. Romero's "Dead" series seems to get better with every installment. After seeing "Dawn of the Dead", I didn't think that this one would hold up (especially after reading most reviews on this site), but I was in for a pleasant surprise. Hopefully "Twilight of the Dead" will keep the trend and be better than Day.The plot of the movie is as follows: The zombie crisis is in full swing, with very few human survivors left. "Day of the Dead" focuses on a group in an underground bunker. This group seems to be falling apart, with everybody pulling in different directions. The group is led by a sadistic guy with a power need who isn't hesitant to kill the others. Without giving away anything else, I can say the movie's real theme is that we are our own worst enemies.This is a wonderful movie, with great acting, fantastic special effects, and a wonderfully written script. I cannot find any faults with this movie.I don't give out tens very often, but I feel the need to here. My rating: 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bloodiest of them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one will argue that "Day..." is the weakest movie in George Romero's impressive Living Dead trilogy, but the mood and atmosphere of the first two is not totally lost here. "Day of the Dead" finds a group of military survivalists marooned on an island military bunker, with all the world around them going to hell. The "good guys" are the only woman, her few friends, and a doctor who decides that the only way to survive this zombie crisis is to find ways to control them. He has his subject, "Bub", the one zombie you really feel sorry for. Complicating this is that rest of the men on the base, who are obnoxious, sexist, and totally unwilling to get along with the others. It is an internal war, with their lives hanging in the balance. If you thought "Dawn of the Dead" was violent, this movie has enough blood to make a surgeon toss his cookies. Tom Savini has obviously spares no expense at making this one of the most realisticly bloody and gory movies of his career. While the blood in "Dawn..." looked more like melted crayons, there is plenty of guts and gristle here. In one scene, the plant a shovel in a zombie's mouth and pop the top of his head off. The camera zooms on his eyes, which are still blinking. Most impressive of all is the makeup, with thousands of zombies made to look actually dead. Repulsive stuff, but a delight for fans of the series. The acting, as usual, is very bottom of the barrel, but it doesn't really matter. Entertainment all around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romero Doesn't Wrap It Up. Thank God.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry to break a few hearts here, but 'Day...' is by far my favourite of Uncle George's Apocalypse trilogy. 'Night', while solid and scary still, suffers from over-exposure and familiarity through the hordes of slack rip-offs- and 'Dawn' I've never liked; overlong, washed-out cinematography and an allusion to the inhumanity of Man that is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is.With 'Day of the Dead', Romero- forced to cut swathes from his rambling screenplay by budgetry constraints forced upon him- accidentally finds the elements that together will make one of the most intelligent, convincing and above all frightening movies of the 'eighties.To ignore the gore for a second; it's the characters that really impress. No one lets the side down, and the ensemble cast totally convince as the Last Survivors of Mankind. Trapped in their bunker, surrounded by the useless toys of warfare, finally beaten by their own dead; Lori Cardille, Joe Pilato and Terry Alexander should be applauded for the performances here- 'Day' is quite the most exceptionally acted film I've seen in a long while. There is an immense amount of tension- and most of it comes from the relationships between the characters... it's almost as if the living dead are secondary. Trust humanity to spend it's last days arguing.Romero's script- with all it's enforced lean structure, and claustrophobic dialogue really impresses. He originally wrote it big; almost epic. God alone knows how that would have turned out; but I get the feeling that Romero needed the strict editing the budget refusals gave him. As it stands, 'Day' has no pretensions above its station; and while it makes some very pertinent points about Man and his stupidity- it never once tries to provide answers. In the original screenplay, the zombie-plague was more-or-less over, and the dead were the new underclass... in their place, a part of society, categorized. We didn't need to see that in 1985, and we don't now. This neatly ends the trilogy, and leaves the audience as horrified, and questioning as they were when it began. And why should it be otherwise? To ask for an 'ending', a neat 'wrapping up' would undermine everything Romero strove to put on screen through three decades of the dead. Please George, we need no 'Twilight...'Those wanting bloody mayhem will find it here too- and it's rarely been done with more panache. 'Day of the Dead' is almost the perfect horror film; and horribly under-rated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One would think that there was only so much you could do with a story about undead zombies prowling around on the Earth and eradicating mankind; however, director George Romero manages to keep the plots different enough for them each to be distinct and effective. In Night of the Living Dead, a masterpiece and the definitive zombie film, the dead were just beginning to rise and seven people tried to survive the night boarded up in a farmhouse. In Dawn of the Dead, the dead's population has grown and had populated the whole planet, and four people lock themselves up in a shopping mall in an attempt to keep the zombies at bay. Now we have Day of the Dead. In it, the zombies have almost completely wiped out mankind (it's a ratio of 400,000 zombies to one human) and a group of military men and scientists are in an underground facility.It is here where different ideas lie to finish the zombies off. The military wants to blow them all away. The scientists want to figure out how to reverse the process, and another doctor thinks it is possible to domesticate the zombies. All of the humans are on the brink of nervous breakdown, and they're always at each others throats, especially Rhodes, the near-insane military officer. Things get interesting, zombies break loose, and it eventually ends up with the obligitary gore-fest....Dawn of the Dead was a tough act to follow, but Day manages to do pretty well. The storyline is different enough to really work well. Sure, it's not as good as the other two, but you've gotta expect that....not all sequels can be good. But I do think that it serves its purpose, in introducing new elements. The cast is exceptional (especially Bub, the "domesticated" zombie with the semi-automatic) and the horror is pulled off well...there's more gore in it than the previous two. I gripped my armchair with surprise and terror several times. While its talky first hour (in which the premise and the theories are explained...necessary stuff, but still, we want more zombies!) prevents it from being as good as the other two films, all that stuff is still interesting, and it builds up to an explosive ending that nicely caps the Zombie trilogy. Nice job, Mr. Romero!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Day Of The Dead" is a very interesting close to Romero's trilogy. Most people, including myself, seem to hate this film the first time they see it, especially if they'd seen "Dawn Of The Dead" before. I saw it in 1986, and didn't rent it again until 1995. The first time I saw it in 86, I was sorely disappointed. I saw it again before returning it, and, only marginally enjoyed it more. The constraints appear to make this film just an excuse to introduce the tour de force gore finale.But, do yourself a favor, and see this film a few times before judging it. When I got it again in 1995, I enjoyed it much more so than before. Granted, the film is not as good as "Dawn" and in general not as good as "Night 68," and the film's constraints of budget did limit the script to mostly talking heads and saving the special effects for the end. But, there are still some nice elements about human control, who controls whom, why, and how.</fullReview>

It is NOT just a movie about scientists and army personnel holed up in a bunker with zombies outside, it is an end-of-humanity scenario and most people who criticise the movie have not obviously looked deep enough. The atmosphere this movie creates chills me, the world is dead, power is off in the mainland, the town is deserted and noone living can be contacted. Then the scientist frankenstein does experiments with bub which you kinda breeze over. Watch it another 10 times and listen to the dialogue, you think hes talking stupidness and bringing up stupid ideas but once you get on his wavelength you understand. They are NOT another species, they are NOT zombies... they are humans but their brain has been attacked by the disease erasing all knowledge of society and living right back to the caveman era, until only the locomotion part of the brain is still active. Its how WE were before the very first act of social behaviour happened. Bub is taught this, he gets rewarded for doing certain things and frankenstein comments "It is the bare beginnings of social behaviour"... Is this maybe how we started? until we were conditioned into who we are and as frankenstein put it "they can be tricked into being good little boys and girls, just like we were tricked into it on the promise of some reward...." all can be summed up in one line of dialogue Frankenstein "We have to do this its our only hope, civility MUST be rewarded... and if its not rewarded...theres no use for it, theres just no use for it at all" It is such an oppurtunity to reflect on what our world would be like without society and order and civil behaviour.... I cant believe noone else saw this.. When I watch this movie now I just get tingles all the time when a line like that is said. And on a final digression, whoever wrote the music to this film is a genius... when theyre in the city at the beginning, and escaping up the missile silo at the end, my whole body gets goosebumps from how the music makes you feel. &gt;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third in Romero's series of zombie movies. In this one a small group of scientists and soliders have taken refuge in an underground missle silo. Many claim that this movie is not as good as the other Romero zombie movies but in my opinon it matches up just fine. I feel that Romero did a good job considering all the last minute re-writing and re-arranging he was forced to do by the studio and investors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Third Entry in the Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero's third entry in the "Dead" series was definitely a disappointment. The acting was fair, with the best performance given by Lori Cardille hands down. The gore is full swing with Tom Savini's masterful handiwork throughout the film. But overall, the movie is way too talky and many of the actors shout their lines throughout the film. Plus, having shot nearly 3/4 of the film underground didn't help much either. Also, the ending is too abrupt to do the film justice. Let's just hope that if George Romero ever decides to do another "Dead" sequel, he looks back to "Dawn" for a great screenplay to follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Romero's third installment in the Dead series, though much different from the others, is still a very enjoyable piece of film. The action is great and Savini really out does himself. Unlike with the previous two movies the characters are not well developed, you don't really like any of the because they don't seem terribly real, but then again, with zombies over running, what is real? The action, however, is much more intense and the zombies much more real. There are some interesting experiments and explanations for things which are intriguing to say the least. Anyone who enjoys a good horror movie, especially those done by Romero, should enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe Romero Captured what he was looking for in this movie. You are faced with characters almost straight out of comic books. They are to the edge and about to fall over. The characters at first glance seem to be over-acting. Only let's take a look at them. Sarah; she hides the strain she is under, to her it is the only way to keep going. McDermontt; he drinks his worries away, sitting day in and day out on the radio trying to reach a world you know is overrun. Miguel; Possibly the most honest character, he is well aware he is cracking and he has no way to stop it. John; he realizes the state the world is in and somehow believes that it is the fault of man that caused this state, he takes it in stride but he is feeling the strain. Rhodes; many call him the most over-acted character in the production. He strives to regain the order that is falling around him, he is military and believes there should be a military answer to anything. Dr. Logan; he is off his rocker, suffering from delusions of grandure, he deals with the strain by experiments and engulfing himself in his work. All in all the characters are very real. How would any of you act in that situation? Rushed to put a team together as the world slowly dies, shipped underground in a tomb while the dead are allowed to roam free, and losing contact with everyone else. We are really witnessing the collapse of a minnie society collapsing. I hope next time any of you view the fine movie you think about these points. The true horror lies in the situation they are in, not in the zombies.</fullReview>

I liked Day of the Dead, not only because of Tom Savini's wonderful effects, but also because of the zombies. The zombies did not immediately scare me, but just putting yourself (mentally) in that situation was killer. The zombies were great, and believe it or not, the movie wasn't really that cheesy.

		<fullReview>This could have been an exciting, tension-building stomach churner. However, the film was let down by some appalling acting that just made the film ludicrous and allowed no sympathy for any of the characters (except for Bob the domestic Zombie). The army guys slowly shouted their lines, with a lot of swearing and laughing to try and make themselves sound hard. The rest of the cast put on stupid accents of various sorts: the "Jamaican" guy was almost incomprehensible.After an hour of "plot" I started to get quite worried that nothing was ever going to happen. Happily, the gore started and the film finally got going. The gore effects were, for the most part, very impressive and they began to justify the long period of tedium prior to Tom Savini's bloody carnage. Tension and scares were put aside for humour - many of the deaths were laugh-out-loud gags and Bob's humanisms produced the odd chuckle.A more downbeat ending would have been far more satisfying and would have brought about a greater sense of nihilism to the whole affair. The film is definitely worth seeing, but I would seriously recommend fast-forwarding most of the first 70 minutes.</fullReview>

The grand scheme of everything is enough to be really cool. This movie has a good mixture of plot and gore, but not enough of either to make it a really accesible film to those who are unimpressed by the scope of the dead coming to life. IT is directed by THE MAN George Romero, who lost a 40 mil budget so he could make the movie the way he wanted to. Check this out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Romero started out his great series of zombie movies with Night of the Living Dead, which not only sparked the series, but sparked the entire zombie genre. Night of the Living Dead was extremely shocking for its time, and remains as a cult classic of the modern era. 10 years after Night of the Living Dead, George Romero directed Dawn of the Dead, which turned out to be a lot more amusing than its predecessor. Dawn of the Dead was filled with black humor, which made it or broke it for viewers. I personally didn't like the black humor in Dawn of the Dead, but it didn't ruin the film for me. Either way, Dawn of the Dead was very successful, and became an amazing sequel. The next sequel would be Day of the Dead. The "Dead" series in general is about zombies taking over the world, and the titles of the movies have to do with what stage the zombies are compared to the humans. In "Night" of the Living Dead the zombies are only terrorizing a small number of counties in rural Pensilvanya. In "Dawn" of the Dead, the zombies begin gaining the upper hand. Now, in "Day" of the Dead, the zombies have taken over the world entirely, forcing people to harbor up in underground army bases.I'm going to be honest with you, I wasn't expecting much out of Day of the Dead. It is usually looked at as the worst in the "Dead" series. Now that I have viewed Day of the Dead, I am not sure why no one likes it as much. Perhaps it is due to the fact that it wasn't made on a big budget like Dawn of the Dead, but didn't feel like a low budget film, just as Night of the Living Dead had. Perhaps it is due to the music score. Whatever the case may be, Day of the Dead is my personal favorite entry in Romero's series of zombie flicks. Day of the Dead is a superb film in my opinion. The cast is great. Joseph Pilato in particular. Pilato sets the mood for the movie really well; making the movie claustrophobic, intense, and rough. I didn't feel like a single cast member did a below average job. I liked the role of just about every member of the cast. I also thought that the script given to the characters was really well written and that the character development was amazing, although not as good as it was in Dawn of the Dead. Another great point of the movie is the pacing. Believe it or not, the movie actually takes a turn from the zombies for about 40 minutes. This is a positive in this movie, simply because it lets the viewer know the characters. Romero does this better than just about any director to date. He makes some of his movies purposely slow paced, so that he can allow superior character development. Also, when the movie finally allows the zombies into the picture again, it hits you like a brick wall. The movie takes a VERY hard left turn.One of the things that makes the left turn so easy to remember is the special effects done by Tom Savini. Tom Saivni had started out his gore FX career with Tom Savini when he had done Martin. He then preceded to work in Dawn of the Dead. Soon afterward, Savini began to take his own path into early 80s splatter films. His special effects just kept on getting better and better until we finally get to 1985. Day of the Dead has Tom Savini's best FX. Day of the Dead may very well have some of the best special effects I have ever seen in my entire life.Day of the Dead is a must see for any horror/zombie fan. If you are one of the select few horror fans who haven't dabbed into Romero's zombie movies, then you should. Day of the Dead is my personal favorite out of the series, and remains as my favorite zombie movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This and Diary are my favorite dead movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead would make a great stage play.There is no Hollywood gloss on this movie. It is very much a discussion between characters each dealing with their situation. Day even takes it one step further by developing the zombie to have human elements. The monster in this movie is not just something to be shot on mass, but something to think about. The movie is almost entirely character developing dialog in the small setting. It really could be performed as a wonderful stage play. The art direction in this movie is another high point. Though this movie was made in the 80's, the art direction still stands up today. Zombie makeup is applied to the smallest detail, and various other props, largely human bodies being ripped apart, and intestines are all very realistic. The movie is at many times, clever and insightful. Though for example, I very much enjoyed the 2nd dead movie, it was largely intelligent action with the odd conversation spot. This, the 3rd installment is almost all character dialog.So, if you like your movies full of gunplay, action, and flatline characters with no personality, you will not enjoy Day of the Dead. If you like your movies more intellectual, and appreciate that element in the horror setting, you will love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It just keeps getting better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 80s was a big decade for zombie movies. It gave us such classics as Lucio Fulci's 'The Beyond' and 'The Gates of Hell' and Dan O'Bannon's 'The Return of the Living Dead.' But as we all know these movies would likely not exist had it not been for George A. Romero's 1968 and 1978 zombie film hits. Like 'Night of the Living Dead,' 'Dawn of the Dead' didn't end with the zombie outbreak coming to an end. In fact it got worse as the film progressed, so it seemed only right that another installment be made and made it was 7 years later. Unfortunately, the third film suffered the same fate that befell 'Alien 3.' The previous film was such a crowd-pleaser while 'Day of the Dead' is a much more downbeat and a bit slower in pace. But over the last 20+ years it's gained a huge following, one that I am proud to be a member of.Pros: A terrifying opening dream sequence. Spectacular special, make-up, and gore effects. A powerful and sometimes haunting score. Excellent performances all around. Has a real feeling of dread thanks to the dark and dirty setting and the lack of civility between the scientists and soldiers. Though not as good as in the previous film, this film's cinematography is still quite good. Buckets of blood and gore. The first two films had smarts in the writing and this one is no exception. Romero does a good job of keeping the viewers in suspense. Moves at a good pace, especially for a film that doesn't have a lot action scenes. A finale that'll stay with you.Cons: The yelling and bickering does get old after a while.Final thoughts: I can't stress enough about how much I love this film. Unlike a lot of horror films in recent years, which are mindless and totally lacking in real suspense or likable characters, this one actually feels satisfying after it's over. It's dark, scary, gruesome, makes you think, has a few characters to root for, and more. Now how many horror films today can we say that about? My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

He shocked everyone with his creation in "Night Of The Living Dead" (1968) and took to another level 10 years later with 1978's "Dawn Of The Dead". With "Day Of The Dead" (1985), he created a great motion picture! I adore Day Of The Dead,it just proves that George A. Romero knows how to do a zombie film. It's got a very good score, zombies, very believable characters, suspense and gore! An excellent horror film to watch, it's better than the stupid rip-offs that are terribly done and the remakes which just make them more advanced and modern-day set. Watch all three of the dead films and you'll just see how brilliant they are compared to very dumb remakes of classic films. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attentive to the other films in terms of morals and beliefs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Preliminary to my review, I have to get some minor key point past me first, so if you will bare with me I'll explain them in as much detail as I can, without missing the point, although these unorthodox views may be a change to your ordinary review of this film, trust me, after you see this remarkable movie, you will agree.George A Romero's vision and production of this film is often misunderstood for mindless violence and bad provision of what a horror film is. This is not only everything a horror film or thriller film is, but it slides the series further with duplicated violence and gore and action but supplements of additional morals and reasons. Explanations are often strong but reasonable and realistic. As graphic as a film could be, believe it or not. Sorry to jump on such a audacious topic of the movie, but I must increase the likeliness of this movie by rationalizing what people think realistic violence really is. The gore in this movie is as realistic as you can get it, nearly exact in fact. I'm surprised such a vicious film can be produced for production. Trust me, before you jump all over me and scatter me with filthy responses, believe me on this, I know a lot about this medical "mumbo jumbo". Anyways, I'm done nonsensically babbling about this, so on with the review."Day of the dead", is easily a throwback to the other premature films, but in a way more evolved. I don't mean this by the characters or the violence, little subjects like that surely don't generate any heavy effect on the film. I mean that it has revolutionized the previous in a way that will possibly become adored by fans or hated by fans, love it or you hate it, this film is as radical as all the others, but some people just can't outlast such changes, meaning they must have enjoyed the previous films for different reasons. Non-justified reasons to me.To carry on with this review, the film launches around a futuristic world overrun by the brutal flesh eating zombies. A group of scientists and military men use an exceedingly old missile silo for refuge. The Military men's personality's begin to sprout as they soon go mad with fear and demand results. They take the scientists as hostages and threaten to go as far as even murder them if they don't achieve the difficult and unconditional goals they desire. Eventually it becomes not so much a war between zombies and humans, but a survival of the fittest. Of course, the old saying "Nice Guy's Finish Last" appeals in the film. You won't have to worry by this sweetened description I have transfered into your head. There is plenty of time for the brain munching stomach crunching zombie carnage later, all in good time. The characters are hard to adjust to at first, I don't mean their attitudes, I mean their sleaze ball style quotes. They quickly become satisfactory characters eventually near about 40 minutes in the film. These character traits are easily enjoyable, as corny as they are, and fit the mood of the film perfectly. The atmosphere in this film is rather effective. Dark, moody, post-futuristic, these are all good words to describe it, but you have to see the film in order to witness the strong competence this film unleashes. For a 80's film, this is a memorable one. The first time you see this movie you may be disoriented by the direction the film is taking, but I guarantee you will appreciate it if you give it a chance. What is with the negative reviews and remarks I have heard all over this site contradicting how great this film is. They have to really settle in and give it a good study, to really endure the greatness. Overall, too sum up this review, although this film is nothing absolutely revolutionary to the other films, it still tried something new and succeeded in the best ways imaginable. Creative and unpredictable, a work of art. Glad I took the time.2.5 of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George A Romero continues the classic series of Zombie films with Day of the Dead. After a sucker punch of an opening we find the world has been overrun by the living dead, the cities are decaying and life appears to have been exterminated...completely.The only survivors we know of are holed up in a nuclear silo; a massive complex of dark caves that whilst sheltering them also imprisons them and these people are not happy campers. Strains between the factions in the group are coming to a head and order is breaking down with violent incidents and threats becoming the order of the day. The 'Darkest Day of Horror' is about to begin.George A Romero's 3rd part in the 'Dead Trilogy' is a surprisingly underrated addition to the series. It is less comic and significantly darker and more threatening than the classic and most loved zombie film Dawn of the Dead and this is possibly a big part of why it is was less well received. However just because it lacks the humour of its predecessor doesn't mean it's a bad film. Quite the contrary in fact, this is an excellent film.The acting is often criticised as being poor, I disagree. The characters, particularly the army goons, are brilliantly over the top, they are red blooded, under educated, meat eating thugs who are holed up in a cave with no outlets other than beating the everlasting (you know what) out of each other. I think they would be somewhat wired don't you? Lori Cardille's character Sarah is well played, Rhodes (Joe Pilato) the psycho captain is quite a comic relief at some points and leeringly threatening at others, and a outstanding performances come in the form of Dr Logan, AKA Frankenstein, (Richard Liberty as the mad scientist) and Bub (Howard Sherman as the living dead prodigy).The history of this film is well documented, Romero was woefully under-funded and had to savagely cut his original script down to the bone, this fact has seemingly aggravated many fans more than it did Romero himself (who incidentally rates 'Day' as his favourite of the trilogy) and consequentially gets panned as being the worst of the series. Bloody, violent and sharp as a morticians blade this film is in my opinion a worthy follow up to Dawn of the Dead though it is significantly different in tone.</fullReview>

Where do you get hallogen Christmas lights after the apocalypse? But, they do have piles of money laying on the ground, and they're all hundred dollar bills, but it won't do them any good now. Oh, so the zombie's were mallwalkers in "Dawn of the Dead." Now, they're just temps, wandering through the streets. They all look like Art Cloakey's first studies of Gumby, and they all walk like they have to use the bathroom. And, the zombies are shaving- continuity. How can they shave, since they're constantly confused? "Oh, me like so much, me buy company! First blade remove, second blade cut clean." I've got an idea, zombie, why don't you feather it? The end- it's just mutilation, what is the matter with these guys? Doesn't anybody care- the only one concerned is the music. It must be a faculty meeting, what with the linoleum posts, and the neon lights. Rating: 6.5 trillion/10 ( Someone should give these guys a lift to Keith Richards' house)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has already been pointed out about the merits and negative aspects of Romero's third dead film. There is not much sense in beating a dead horse(unless it was a zombie horse of course). The Day of the Dead film is a good film in its own right. Most reviewers automatically make comparisons with it to Dawn of the Dead and Night of the Living Dead. It is a different kind of film than both of those. Night is a pure shocker and its whole goal is to shock with the unknown in a unrelenting manner. Dawn was a shocker but at a different level..you knew you were going to see blood and guts but maybe not at such a hyperbolic level. Dawn is also a thinking picture about the materialism of our society, but because of the great amounts of never-before seen gore it was laced with a great deal of black humour and sheer slapstick. Day, however, is what Dawn is without all the hyperbolic gore or the humour. It is a thinking picture about what a group of people, 12 I guess divided into scientists and military people, do while basically stuck in a fenced underground military installation. Easily the most humane of the three pictures, Day focusses on the way people react in a crisis with differing ways of looking at things, and shows the stress of having lived days, weeks, and months in the new order. At one point, there is a wonderful speech given by John about why man should stop with his petty bureaucracies, why man has brought the plague of the undead dead with his search for the "Truth" and answers of the universe. Day of the Dead is really a wonderful essay on human nature both good and bad...and showing that each has a different way at looking at things and a different breaking point. The cast of unknowns is pretty good. Lori Cardille does a fine job as the only female in the camp, and two shining performances come from Richard Liberty as "Frankenstein," a doctor known for his creative bloody experiments on the dead, and Howard Sherman as "Bub" the thinking ghoul. All in all a very good film when taken as an entity by itself. It doesn't pack the scares like NOTLD. It has some extremely gory moments(one body literally torn in half), but does not come close to reaching the hyperbolic heights of Dawn. Yet, it is a fine conclusion? to the Dead series by a very capable thought-provoking director named George Romero.</fullReview>

When Romero didn't have a budget he made a classic in Night of the Living Dead, but when he was allowed to spend some money he really didn't seem to are as much for the scares.

		<shortDescription>"Well, that's the trouble with the world, Sarah darling - people got different ideas concerning what they want out o' life"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead is an acceptable addition to Romero's zombie trilogy, if not an acceptable conclusion.I honestly believe that if this had been the middle film, bridging the gap between Night's low-key claustrophobia and Dawn's extreme violence and scale then it would have worked better. Not a bad film on it's own merits, it feels flat as the final part of a greater whole, where Dawn had one of the most magnificent ends I've ever seen. Who could forget Ken Foree in the 1978 edition ending a film with the nonchalant "Alright...", leaving the viewer confronted with the spectacle of consumer zombies marching to muzak? Satirical and undeniably brilliant. Day by comparison grounds to a halt and seems to run out of steam rather than end with Romero's trademark abruptness.The film is also guilty of the gore that the second had alluded to; here a zombie's eyes look left and right after his head has been severed from the mouth up, while a soldier is still conscious after having his legs torn from his body and his entrails ripped out. (Yelling "Choke on 'em!", no less) Similarly, when another soldier commits suicide by placing a handgun in his mouth we are shown his brains blowing out behind him. It is this late-80s commercial aspect that daunts, as this is the only film in the series that concludes with "soundtrack album available", a reminder that the film is chock-full with over loud dated incidentals and an end-titles song.The first film in the series, Night of the Living Dead, didn't work at first for me as it's somewhat stilted technique and ? Duane Jones and Karl Hardiman excepted ? amateurish acting led me to believe it was an exercise in high camp. Watched a second time I realised it was played straight, just not played very well. Looked at as a template, it shows the degeneration of the zombies and sheds light on the myth that Day is a humourless instalment. Night has the nasty zombies (though they're never referred to by that word in any of the films); the ones who use weapons, the zombies who stab through the heart with a trowel. Dawn, by far the greatest of the series, has the consumer zombies who stagger like ten pins, waiting to be knocked down. Day, conversely, has "Bub". Bub is a docile zombie who listens to Beethoven and salutes soldiers, a friend to the amusing Dr. Logan. Logan begins to give an actual psychological profile of the creatures, and medical study of their nature. He also sites the monsters as outnumbering humans by roughly "400,000 to one". Perhaps what the film lacks most of all is a cinematic vision. There's a nice wide shot in the opening moments on an island inhabited entirely by the zombies. This at least captures some of the aspect of Dawn, which really did convince on a minimal budget and with adroit editing that the entire world was under zombie regime. But after the island prologue we enter the claustrophobic, squat laboratory and it all becomes closed in. Claustrophobia is fine when you're under siege, but the threat is almost wholly absent here. In fact, the only time the cast are really in any danger from the undead (apart from the gross-out finale) is in Sarah's (Lori Cardille's) dream sequences. A film lacks tension if the only danger your characters are in is falling asleep and dreaming about it. Unless of course that film is Nightmare on Elm St., of which this one has connections with it's excess of blood.Though perhaps the real dangers come from within. We are "treated" to one-dimensional soldiers who govern the underground research centre, most notably Joseph Pilato, absolutely lousy as Captain Rose. Better is G. Howard Klar as Steele, who shows some humanity under the macho rhetoric. The picture also sees the latest, and least successful, in a line of black leads, with Terry Alexander as the West Indian John. This is commendable, though can also smack of tokenism, especially when John joins an Irish lead to form the two lazy characters that never want to work. The Irish character (Catchphrase: "Jesus, Mary and Joseph") is also a heavy drinker, while John wants to "soak up some sun on a beach"; though in fairness they are the two most likeable characters.An interesting theory is the notion that all three films could run concurrently. In Dawn we see a roadblock of rednecks like those in the first, and here there's a reference to all the shopping malls being closed. I often wondered what a fourth film in the series would be called, as the good titles seemed to be used up. Tea Time of the Dead, maybe? Between Half Past One and Five O'clock of the Dead? Yet it transpires that George A. Romero has mentioned in interviews that he'd consider a fourth, especially as "Day" wasn't quite the ending he'd envisaged due to budget cuts. Fan rumours currently suggest "Dusk" or "Twilight" as the likely options. Let's hope it materialises, a Dead saga for the new millennium.Finally, I noticed one or two of the zombies in this film were green. Maybe that's what inspired the people behind the 1990 colorised version of "Night of the Living Dead" ? rather stupidly making the zombies green with bright yellow hair!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day of the Dead seems to get a bad rap, While I didn't find the idea of the movie (finding a way to control the zombies, or send them back to the grave) as well executed or conceived as Dawn of the Dead (where they try to build a mall into their fortress of solitude). I prefer Day. I've read that people prefer the original script (which you can find and read elsewhere online), but to me it seemed worse! Even more talking, less fighting with zombies, more human to human gunfights, and an even happier ending! When the zombies attack, it's the best special effects in any of the Dead movies. It reminds me of the special edition Robocop, the violence is so over the top it's almost cartoon like! I guess if I gave more details it could be considered a spoiler, so I'll just say they have to be seen to be believed. Also there are some great lines in this movie, most notably Rhodes 'I'm running this Monkey Farm...' expletive. A fun scary disturbing ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is the best and least understood of Romero's zombie films. The film is quite a bit darker than Dawn but not so grim as Night 68. I have never really considered either Day or Dawn to be direct sequels of Night 68, because they only deal with the same general idea. None of the same characters are involved and each situation is unique. Romero took the cold war as his theme in this movie - it is the fear of annihilation. In Dawn, Romero was pointing out a society so in a rush to consume material goods that it was devouring itself. Day picks up on that general idea and takes it to its conclusion - mankind has been driven from the world above. Day focuses quite a bit on the relationships of each of the characters to one another. It focuses on the factionalization that occurs in groups under great stress. Some people have not seen Day as the commentary on human group behavior that it is. Anyone who has read Maltin's so-called review knows that he probably hasn't even seen the movie! Another facet of Day is that the acting for a horror movie is excellent. There is a real focus on characterization in Day that is lacking from many horror films. Michael Gornick's cinematography is excellent. His close in, up front, intense style of filming is the way a horror movie should be shot. Thank goodness they decided to spend some cash on the zombie makeup this time around. The slapping of grey and blue makeup on tons of people just didn't cut it and was a real slight on Dawn technically. In Day each of the zombies has been crafted as an original and it shows. So this is a great, great horror flick that I highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Romero's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero's "Dead" movies, Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, are perhaps best known for their graphic gore, but that the success of those films was due to more than just Romero's willingness to show blood-and-guts is confirmed by this movie, the third installment in his trilogy. Day of the Dead more than outdoes its predecessors when it comes to grossing out the audience, yet I nonetheless found it disappointing. As surprising as this might be for a low-budget horror flick, Day's fatal flaw is in the area of plot and characters. Romero may not have gotten Oscar-caliber performances in Dawn, but the performers were likable, and the story of their travails, though not exactly complex, was an involving adventure story. In the final Dead movie (as of this writing) on the other hand, the story never takes off. The characters spend almost the whole movie locked in an underground complex protected from the hordes of the undead. They are divided between scientists studying the zombies and soldiers assigned to protect them, plus two helicopter pilots. Of course, there is much conflict between the two groups as there is with the zombies. So far, this sounds like a good setup for a horror movie, but Romero botches the execution, probably due to an over ambitious desire to make a serious statement, which should not be a horror filmmaker's first priority. Romero should have gradually increased the tension between the characters, as in The Thing. Instead, they're screaming and pointing guns at each other almost from the very first scene. This dissipates all of the tension, and clearly prefigures the ending. There's very little real conflict, since the soldiers are depicted as complete bumbling fools. Romero lets the actors playing the soldiers overact shamelessly, and the dialog he writes for them is simply terrible. These guys are so annoying that I couldn't for them to get eaten. What's the point that Romero is trying to make here- that soldiers are bad? When, inevitably, the military turns on the scientists, it's for reasons that the scientist could have at least tried to explain. Another problem with the story of Day is the pacing.Dawn of the Dead may have had a relaxed pace, for which it has sometimes been criticized, but it worked because Romero began with the zombies overtaking civilization, relaxed the pace after the heroes barricaded themselves, and then finished off with a spectacular final attack by the zombies. Here, on the other hand, there's barely any action until the very end. That's means that dialog has to carry the weight up until the end, and neither Romero nor his actors are up to snuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Dreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romero's 3rd installment of his flesh eating zombie series centers around a small group of soldiers and scientists holed up in an enormous underground facility. Apparently this facility was a holding area for all types of government records and miscellaneous storage. I do want to stress that the place really is enormous. The characters even have to take a slow moving elevator to get to the surface.This small band is left, assumingly via government orders, to figure out a way to stop the zombies. The soldiers in this group are impatient and none too happy with the arrangement. The lead scientist is enthusiastic and delighted with the opportunity and even manages to semi-domesticate one of the zombies.There is an unbelievable amount of tension in this cast of characters. And I really do mean unbelievable. The tension strains the viewers "willing suspension of disbelief." Yeah, and I realize what I'm saying in context of a movie centered around the dead coming back to life in search of a meal. From the first scenes to the final one, Romero's characters seem only to be able to communicate with each other through shouts and gun pointing. Every scene is a confrontation. As the film progresses, this "style of communication" gets very wearing and irritating to watch. There is no natural build up of tension towards the climax. Our heroes in Day of the Dead are three characters named Sarah, John and William. John, who speaks with Jamaican accent, flies the helicopter the group has, as for the other two, it is unclear what there function is at the bunker. Maybe civil servants? Sarah, who is essentially the lead, is a fairly typical heroine who consistently tries to make the moral/rational choice in amongst the chaos. William is an Irishman with a propensity for drinking, in fact he is constantly sipping booze throughout the film. It is unclear to me what his role in the group is other then to help out. A whiskey swilling Irishman and sassy Jamaican helicopter pilot don't really add much to the story. One gets the impression that Romero put them in the story to make it more interesting, but I don't think the characters add much other then to seem just out of place.As expected Tom Savini, the FX guy, really delivers. His work is one of the highlights. The gruesome scenes are just that and the gore is, well, gory. Some of scenes where the soldiers are being ripped apart look a tad fakey. Clearly, there is the actors head coming up from the floor, but it, generally, works. Savini seems to get better with each film he does.As the story climaxes in a predictable fashion, we get to see the psychotic captain's come-uppance. Well before this point, I found myself completely uninterested in any resolution the film was going to offer. I just wanted the shouting to stop.Night of the Living Dead is truly a brilliant film and holds its own not just among horror movies but among films in general. Dawn of the Dead is also quite a good movie although feels a little dated in places. It was a natural progression from Night of the Living Dead and presents a grim world overrun by zombies logically and realistically. With Day of the Dead, one wonders only one thing.What happened?</fullReview>

The soldiers are not happy with the scientists and that's before they discover their dead comrades being used.The characters especially the military are drawn too broadly. They are overacting to drum up the drama. A zombie apocalypse is dramatic enough. The overacting from these novice actors is really grating. The arguing over the experiments seems very wrong-headed. The back and forth lacks any nuance. The repetitive arguments hurt my head. The movie can be interpreted to have a low view of military personnel.

The violence is occasional, but when it comes, it comes, not making me forget how nasty some of those scenes were. But there's a tedium about this film, more time underground in the bunker lazing around, then out on the zombie ground, and because of this, it ultimately fails, although the crackpot scientist adds some humor to the whole affair which I liked, as well as the headstrong female, who joins forces with a Jamaican colleague of all people to continue the fight. A rather disappointment here, when stacked up against Dawn Of The Dead, let me just warn ya.</fullReview>

Well, nope, apparently not. Full of over-baked dialogue, monotonous squabbling, laughable macho insults and clichd military antagonism, this one swaps the visually interesting shopping mall for a disused missile silo and makes the characters as dull as the setting. There's little sense of the scale of the zombie problem and tension is completely absent. In complete contrast to all this, the gore effects are absolutely terrific: the animated corpse with the front of his face missing is probably the highlight, although the zombie who sits up only for his guts to spill out all over the floor runs it a close second.

		<fullReview>The yelling in this picture is so extreme and extended that my ears blister when I try to get through it all. Roger Ebert, who gave high ratings to the previous 2 films in the trilogy, mentioned it in his 1.5 star review. I absolutely agree with him. I have never watched a picture that was pitched at such a loud extreme for its entire length. Surely other viewers agree. I'm a fan of film critic Dave Kehr, but I truly believe that his top rating for this film has to be one of his worst. One of the 5 best films of 1985?! Did we even see the same movie? I have to say that zombie pictures are my absolute favorite type of horror film, and I would recommend titles such as Night of the Living Dead(1968),Dawn of the Dead(1975&amp;2004)and Return of the Living Dead(1985) to anyone with my head held high. Count me out of the fan club for this one, however. Be prepared to get a splitting headache after watching it. In fact, having not seen Day of the Dead since it originally came out in 1985, I excitedly purchased the DVD release in the hopes that my original feelings were misguided. After about a half-hour, I realized that I was absolutely right the first time-the yelling was so intense I had to turn the movie off. Gene Siskel gave this picture Zero Stars and called it awful, and while I wouldn't go that far, I do think that Roger Ebert's 1.5 stars are more on the mark. In fact, go to rogerebert.com to read his original review and you'll get a better idea of what I'm trying to get across in this review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romero Apocalypse Part III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the flawless masterpieces "Night of the Living Dead" (1968) and "Dawn of the Dead" (1978), with which George A. Romero de facto created the modern Zombie film, "Day of the Dead" of 1985 is the final part to a trilogy that comes pretty damn close to perfection. (In the meanwhile, three further films have been made, but I still find it safe to call "Night", "Dawn" and this film a trilogy.) While "Day of the Dead" may not quite be as important and essential for motion picture history as two foregoing masterpieces, it is the perfect continuation of Romero's Living Dead saga, yet another great, dark and truly terrifying classic that must not be missed by anyone interested in Horror, and, as the predecessors, a clever social commentary about human behavior in isolated and extreme situations.The living dead have long outnumbered the living, who have to hide in order to survive; presumably 400,000 by one. A small group of scientists and military members struggle to survive, dwelling in an underground army bunker. The scientists, among them Sarah (Lori Cardille), the only (living) female resident of the complex, are trying to find solutions to the mysterious Zombie disease. Apart from the obvious threat by the menacing Zombie masses, there is rising tension between the scientists lead by the somewhat weird Dr. Logan (Richard Liberty), who is aptly nicknamed Frankenstein, and the military members under the command of the fascistic Capt. Rhodes (Joseph Pilato)? Mad science is one of my favorite Horror-topics, and I have therefore always liked this aspect about this film, in which the 'Frankenstein' character conducts some seriously demented experiments. As in "Night" and "Dawn", the Zombies are not the only menacing force in this film ? the tension between the survivors is in equal measures. As its predecessors, "Day of the Dead" is not merely a film about Zombies, but mainly one that explores the social behavior (and growing madness) of people surviving in isolated groups. Lori Cardille makes a very likable protagonist as Sarah, whereas Joe Pilato makes an utterly villainous and unlikable antagonist. As does "Dawn of the Dead", this (once again tremendously gory) film profits from the incredible make up and gore effects by master Tom Savini. The film is brilliantly shot in general, and the masses of grisly looking zombies and incredibly well-made gory outbursts are particularly impressive. The film has a great score, which intensifies the apocalyptic atmosphere. Overall, "Day of the Dead" isn't quite as essential a masterpiece as "Night of the Living Dead" and "Dawn of the Dead", but it's a perfect sequel to these two films, and surpasses almost any other film in the field. This is creepy, morbid, incredibly suspenseful and spectacularly gory entertainment that no lover of Horror should miss. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk about an underrated film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talk about a film that never gets the credit it deserves. When originally released, many Romero fans panned "Day of the Dead" because it featured none of the social commentary found in his earlier works. However, I strongly disagree, and in my mind this is better than "Dawn of the Dead" (its a close second to "Night" as my favorite of the trilogy). Personally, I always felt the supposed social commentary was a bit overstated in "Dawn of the Dead". I thought the fact it was set in a mall was more of a clever joke as opposed to an actual subtext. One also has to remember that Romero insists the casting of Duane Jones in "Night of the Living Dead" was simply because he was the best actor who auditioned, not to add a racial subtext. "Day of the Dead" does away with political allegory and focuses on sheer apocalyptic terror. Romero also explores the human condition, as this features possibly the strongest characters hes devised.The film is very well directed by Romero, who keeps everything at a quick pace. No other filmmaker can makes sequences in the daytime so frightening. It was also a good decision to keep it short ("Dawn of the Dead" is a classic, buts its overlong by at least a half hour). The acting is a bit over-the-top, but the characters are so well-developed the film manages to overcome this flaw. Also, this was one of the first 80s science fiction films to feature a tough heroine as the central protagonist. "Day of the Dead" is a film thats been underrated for far too long.

		<fullReview>Oh, Day of the Dead. It's like a sad love story in my life; a romance that could have been. But as it sometimes turns out, we were just too different.It went wrong from the beginning. As a quirky 13 year old movie geek who'd just realized that movies are the single reason to live, and that horror opened new worlds that tingled sensations in his soul and psyche. I saw DAY before knowing anything about what the purist call "authentic" horror, and certainly unaware of who this Romero guy and how the movie was part of a legendary trilogy. You can pretty much guess the reaction. My shocked eyes popped out upon seeing the (to me) insane amounts of gore, the action towards the end was thrilling for sure and the gloomy atmosphere really made me feel that there was a whole genre out there that I didn't understand, yet couldn't look away from. But of course, the main part of the movie barely kept me awake.Years and years later. As far as I'm concerned, I am a professional and qualified horror movie-buff. George A. Romero's importance to the genre is obvious to me. And surely, DAY can't be all that bad. Bad reviews tend to come out of misunderstandings, I figured, and my early experience of the film clearly must have been a result of my inexperienced age. So I finally see DAY again, happy about the fact that I watch it with my new eyes and with tons of knowledge in my backbone. But you know. The verdict basically stays the same.A few years and years later. I get my hands on a nice little DVD box-set of NIGHT, DAWN and DAY, entitled "Trilogy of the Dead" (suitable, since I couldn't really feel LAND as part of the series, even though I wanted to badly) and I feel... Day of the Dead. It's IMPOSSIBLE that you were all that bad.So I watch it again, digitally cleaned up and in 5.1 surround sound. And I must say........ the verdict stays the same. But I'm not dumb enough to miss the point of the film, and you can't blame Romero for not trying. I like most aspects of DAY. It's just that it doesn't work.Firstly, the idea is great. Following NIGHT and DAWN the planet's apocalyptic situation is grimmer than ever. I like how the misery of DAWN comes off as kindergarten in comparison to the wasteland of DAY; the story is also quite good, with a group of people roughly summing up the nature of humanity - but living underground, in the dark, suffering of decay. And finally, Romero's ideas about the zombie evolution, the ritual points of social criticism, the themes of life/death and madness/sanity, the philosophical undertones and the visual symbolism are all great. What's the problem? Execution. The film is roundabout 70 minutes of talking and whining. I'm sorry, you may call me too dumb to be patient, but I dig french new wave as much as I dig eurohorror - but to me, I can't say that the film is all that jazz. I don't know, if the dialogs would have been more intellectual or if the pace would have been evened out with some excitement and if the characters had been more involving; The actors are all doing a good job, but the characters are extremities and don't get any chance to properly interact. They just whine. Upon all of this, you might say that the film is pretentious with Pilato's demonized villain and the different martyrisms of the heroes - but I can by that.The finale comes on big like a wake-up call and it's no big surprise. George could have filled the first two thirds of the film with something else than just explanations of his points. He could have written a book, if that was his wish. Film requires a visual eye, combined with the dialogs. DAY is unbalanced and tragically flawed. Even so, I do love Romero's every intention with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very brave film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I'm becoming a bit shallow with regards to the films I watch but I found myself wanting the good guys to survive in this one. Much as I'd like to believe that I am on a higher intellectual plain or am just plain cynical, I think I am just as susceptible to a good ride as the next person. So, I think I like this one the most out of all of George Romero's zombie movies. Towards the end, where the three main characters were trying to get out of the underground facility, I found myself thinking, "I hope they get out. I hope they don't die!" It could have been the morbid nature or the hopelessness of the whole film that made me think that but it was, nevertheless, very out of character. Maybe it was the storytelling. Maybe the character's weren't as one-dimensional as I thought they were (I mean, even if they were, I didn't mind that). Well, I didn't like the depiction of the soldiers representing the military presence, that just seemed to have no dimension at all. However, I say this is a brave film because, of course, there is very little violence for much of the movie. A lot of it is focused on experimentation, discovery and discussion. Romero seems to be just making his own movie and not caring what the fans think. He's having the patience to introduce the characters and develop them instead of rushing into murder everyone and that must surely be a sign of a great director. If the so-called "gore-hounds" (as Empire rag-mag calls them) want blood then maybe they should experience violence first hand instead of on a flat screen. I say, let it be a cult movie, it makes it all the better for that and leaves it almost untouched. Almost, of course, because as I write this, a remake is imminent. What is it with the film community at the moment? Oh, another George Romero remake? Terrific! Here's a lot of money! Who needs originality? What a waste of the tax payer's money. Another impressive facet of the film is the sub-plot of Bub the zombie. In 'Land of the Dead', the whole zombies evolving plot line seemed rushed and quite stupid. In 'Day of the Dead', however, the evolutionary steps that Bub takes are small and feasible (in a sense! Not forgetting of course that we are talking about zombies; fictional characters). It doesn't feel like Bub is suddenly understanding everything that is put in front of him (the razor, the book, the personal stereo) but he is remembering and that's much more interesting. Now, I'm going to be a hypocrite and talk about the violent bits. Don't get me wrong, I like the violent bits as much as anybody but there is a cut-off point, I feel (except for in 'Braindead', obviously). I liked the first zombie who stood in front of the Sun and we see that his lower jaw is missing. The zombie who got up from the operating table and let his insides fall on the floor was pretty cool as well. I liked the action bits and I can only commend Romero for not backing down to studio pressure because, by the sounds of things, had he done so it would have been their vision and not his and that's as big a nightmare as any you will get from this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overlooked Piece Of 80s Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead was the first George A. Romero movie I ever saw. I was 13 years old. I think its fair to say it left a pretty big impression on me, and its a film I'll never forget.Day Of The Dead is the third and final film in George A. Romero's original Dead Trilogy, which began with Night Of The Living Dead (1968) and continued with Dawn Of The Dead (1978).Firstly, Day Of The Dead is a REALLY DARK movie. It takes Romero's gritty vision (a world populated by zombies) to an apocalyptic new level. While in Dawn, the characters stood a chance, in Day, things really do look hopeless. Mankind is outnumbered 400,000 to 1, and a group of soldiers and scientists are holed up in an old WWII bunker near Ft. Myers, Florida. One thing that surprises me about this movie is that George A. Romero continues to rate it as his favourite of the trilogy. I personally think Dawn is the better film, but Day should not be overlooked. Many people dismiss this effort because they feel its a poor ending to the trilogy. It was slammed by the majority of critics on its release in 1985, but now, 20 years on, people are giving it a second chance, possibly because of Romero's recent film, Land Of The Dead, and the number of zombie movies released over the past few years.Day is a claustrophobic movie, with almost the entire film set underground. The scenery is made up of dark, creepy caves, laboratories, and a maze of corridors. I found this a little disappointing at first, especially when the opening scene features a captivating and desolate image of Ft. Myers, the streets inhabited only by the dead. Romero uses this monotonous scenery to build the tension.In Day, the audience witnesses the breakdown of a miniaturised society. Most of the soldiers are aggressive, macho, testosterone-fuelled types, ignorant to the point of disbelief. The military viewpoint in this film is epitomised by Captain Rhodes, who is played by Joe Pilato. He is a power-crazed megalomaniac who has absolutely no consideration for the scientists, and it seems his only concern is leaving the bunker as soon as possible and saving himself. Pilato over-acts at times, and plays a very angry character, whose aggression occasionally gets the better of him, but he is the guy you love to hate, and when he meets his grisly demise, your left feeling no pity whatsoever. He also has some fantastic lines such as 'I'm running this monkey farm now, Frankenstein!! and 'You want me to salute that walking pile of puss? Salute my ass!'. His thoughts and ideas are devoid of logic and reason. This blindingly obvious, black and white, good and evil contrast between the scientists and soldiers is evident throughout the film, and does get a little tiresome.With this movie, Romero continues to avoid tired Hollywood clichs by casting a varied set of characters. Day features both a Jamaican and Irishman in prominent roles, and the lead character is a woman named Sarah, played by Lori Cardille (an idea perhaps inspired by Linda Hamilton's character in The Terminator (1984), who, coincidently, was also called Sarah). The head scientist Dr Frankenstien, as he is known, played brilliantly by the late Richard Liberty, is one of the films most memorable characters. He spends everyday alone in the lab, dissecting zombie 'specimens' and trying to find a cure for the epidemic, whilst shielding himself from the conflicts beneath the surface. It soon becomes apparent he is losing grip on his sanity.Later in the film, Dr. Frankenstein introduces 'Bub', one of his zombie subjects, who he has, to a certain extent, domesticated. He shows little or no desire to eat the scientists and shows some faint traces of 'civil' behaviour. When Captain Rhodes enters the room, Bub salutes him immediately. He harmlessly stares at books, listens to music and uses a telephone, eyes wide with fascination throughout. The audience is meant to feel somewhat sympathetic towards 'Bub', and these scenes could almost be classed as 'moving'.Ultimately, it is the characters' inability to co-operate on a basic level which leads to their downfall. As the zombies become less significant, the film begins to focus more on the human struggles. Once the tensions reach boiling point all hell breaks loose, as the dead enter the bunker. Cue the blood soaked finale, courtesy of Tom Savini.The effects in this movie are truly outstanding. Inspired by his days as a photographer in 'Nam, Savini unleashes some of the most gruesome and at times, utterly convincing scenes of carnage ever put to film. Towards the end, this film just gets too extreme, and is definitely not for the faint hearted. Remember, this was made long before CGI was even a glimmer in Hollywood's eye. Most of this stuff would still be considered shocking now, 2 decades on, and Savini sets standards that only he is probably capable of breaking. His attention to detail pays off too, with most of the zombies looking visibly decayed.What I like about this movie is that while the acting varies drastically from the mediocre to the outstanding, Romero's sense of atmosphere remains throughout. From an era when nuclear Armageddon may well have been just around the corner, no movie does 'apocalypse' quite like Day of The Dead. The image of mankind falling apart under this unimaginable pressure, is brought vividly to life. It maybe dated, but it stands out. This film deserves to be seen by hardcore horror fans and any fans of the zombie genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST zombie film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, "Night of the Living Dead" is philosophically more advanced. And yes, "Dawn of the Dead" is the crowd favorite. But I believe that "Day of the Dead" is Romero's masterpiece. It is my favorite movie of all time. Let the gushing begin! Let's start with the obvious. The gore effects are without parallel. This film is not for the squeamish. Tom Savini earned his spot in the horror-geek pantheon with his jaw-dropping make-up and splatter effects. In this film, Romero the writer really shines. Romero is unafraid to tackle social issues. He refuses to resolve and package them with a pretty bow for the audience. Just because this is a zombie movie doesn't mean it can't be an important meditation on several themes. Even as a huge fan, I recognize the acting can sometimes be silly but Howard Sherman's portrayal as Bub is among the finest of the decade. Romero has since called "Day of the Dead" his favorite of his zombie films. And he's right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In my opinion, the greatest zombie film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the dead, the "final" in the "trilogy" of George A. Romero's living-dead series. Okay, I don't know if it's the GREATEST zombie film of all time (Dawn of the dead is VERY hard to beat, as is Night of the living dead) but its' pretty close. It is not only a gore-fest but it is also very dramatic and sad too, but you'll only notice that if you pay attention to the film. This is film is VERY graphic, more gory then Dawn of the dead, the reason is that George A. Romero was shooting for an X-rating. Although he surpassed it the film was too horrific and was never viewed by the MPAA, but that's kind of why we love the film so much and watch it over and over again. Yet you should not remember this film for the gore (in my opinion at least because many people do) but for its' intelligent voice to. The film is surreal and sort of a black comedy. It gets as gory as you can imagine; a highly recommend this film, three skulls (I rate with skulls instead of stars) definitely. Watch it if you dare, NOT for the squeamish...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Day of the dead" maybe the poorest of the 4 movies Romero has devoted to his beloved zombies. The surprise and the shock from "The night of the living dead" are already lost , and though the action is been set in some underground military premise "Day of the dead" ain't as claustrophobic and disturbing as Romero's "Dawn of the dead". It could be said that this is the most hysteric sequel of "The night...", all the characters are on the verge of a nervous breakdown (which is quite logical, by the way). It is also the most "gore" of all them by far.So, "The day of the dead" is advisable for George Romero's fans and for those who love zombies movies.*My rate: 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite of the "Dead" Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968, George A. Romero shocked moviegoers with a brutal, dark masterpiece known as "Night of the Living Dead". It's unheard of use of gore caused its name to be burned into the hearts of horror fans forever.Ten years later, Romero followed up his breakthrough smash with a film that would become even more well-known, "Dawn of the Dead". It's less-than-subtle social commentary and shockingly strong use of gore caused it to inflict fear just with the very mention of its name.In 1985, Romero delivered his third installment of the "Living Dead" series. Unlike the previous installments, it was met with very mixed reactions, most of them being quite harsh. But there were those who loved it, those who understood it, those GOT it. This controversial film was "Day of the Dead"."Day" returned to the dark, gritty formula used in "Night" that "Dawn" traded for an amusing mix of humor and candy-colored blood. "Day" is full of extreme gore and violence, loads of language, and sharp, cynical social commentary.The story follows a group of people living in an underground bunker, some of them optimistic scientists, some of them borderline-psychotic soldiers, and some of them happy-go-lucky civilians along for the ride. This leads to some serious clashes as the zombie epidemic engulfs the world above them. One scientist searches for a way to cure the "virus", one scientist yearns to discover what drives the zombies, the soldiers debate whether or not to let the scientists continue the experiments, and the civilians just want to find an island somewhere and live in peace.Romero's script, which underwent severe cutting due to budget problems, is actually quite well-written and thought out. While a lot of characters maybe a little flat and one-dimensional, the dialogue is sharp and the commentary is relentless.And now, my favorite part of the film: the gore. This is a gore-hound's wet dream, in all of its face-ripping, eye-gouging, finger-crunching, blood-squirting glory. It just has never been surpassed, not even by 1992's "Dead Alive", which delivered more than its fair share of gore, but was approached in much more comic, unrealistic fashion.In 2005, Romero delivered what will most likely be the final chapter of "Living Dead" series, "Land of the Dead". After seeing all of the installments, which I all adore for different reasons, I must say that "Day of the Dead" has endured as my favorite of the series and become, in my opinion, one of the greatest horror movies ever made.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it first arrived on the scene, "Day of the Dead" was sadly underrated by critics. Those of us who enjoy Romero's 'Dead' trilogy know this is a masterpiece.Not only do you have moaning, shuffling zombies, terrific make-up and effects, and buckets of gore, but you also have smart dialogue, great performances and realistic drama. Isn't that an ideal horror film? As soon as you meet the main characters, you're interested in their story; you generally care about them and even want (a few of) them to survive.Confession: I got this movie on VHS as a Christmas present in the late 80s; I watched it so many times the tape actually broke. My friend and I still quote from it.That means it's GOOD. Trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, let me just say two things: 1) I highly respect this series of revolutionary films 2) The portrayal of the Living Dead in this series is the most accurate I've seen anywhere.That said...There are a few errors concerning the behavior of the dead in this movie. For one, zombies have been proved to have no semblance of memory whatsoever, so right there is a glaring discrepancy. Secondly, necrotic fine motor skills are sub-par at best. That's all I'll say here. But other than that, a great film, with some pretty fUntastic effects. Like the other films in the series, it has quite a bit to say about our culture, while still being pretty scary. (Oh, and that's "classic or good" scary, not "Nouveau Scary")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is better than Dawn of the dead. But yet it has the lowest rating of all of them. Day of the dead has them both beat with it's special effects and good actors. Those evil soldiers were great especially when they get ripped apart by the zombies. There is more swearing than ever in this film which makes it funny. One scene a soldier tales this drunk dude to stop drinking. He says, Lay of the f#cking booze once in a while and get one of those f*ucking hornes. The old drunk says, Well if we stay down here long enough I'll have to lay off the f*cking booze because there won't f*cking be any of it left. That's just of the great lines on this movie. This film has got some great scenery at the beginning of the film. Though it's a little slow it just adds to the impact of the end. I rate this movie a 10/10 this film was flawless.

		<shortDescription>Lots of gore, but some annoying aspects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead delivered what Romero has always been great at - great apocalyptic zombie action. Lots of gore and some really creepy scenes of zombies feasting upon their prey. As well, Romero has done pretty well at creating the sense of hopelessness felt by a tiny group of survivors amidst a sea of the living dead.I guess what really ruined the movie for me was the characterizations. In particular, the military characters. I don't know what military these guys were patterned after, but it wasn't the US military. They were slovenly and disorganized. They lacked any semblance of morale and discipline. At least one looked to be terribly out of shape. And they weren't even that tough. Furthermore, the central part of the movie seemed to concentrate on the "good" scientists being in conflict with the "evil" military. It was more like an anti-war movie than a zombie flick.That was, in my mind, enough to ruin an otherwise decent zombie masher. I recommend seeing Romero's other efforts first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last film in a trilogy is often the best! No wait, what the hell am I writing here? It's not the best, it's almost never the best. Just look at the Godfather trilogy, the Rambo trilogy, the Die Hard trilogy. It should, however, be the best. Why? It's the last of three movies, dah! You don't really want to see three movies were the ending of the saga manages to make you both annoyed and mad, do you?Well "Day of the Dead" is unfortunately another bad movie that ends an otherwise great trilogy. "Night of the living dead" was genre defying, "Dawn of the dead" is one of very few sequels which actually are better then their predecessors, "Day of the Dead" is, well, just a bit crap actually.Acting in "Day of the dead" might not be worse than in any other movie of the "Dead"-trilogy, unfortunately, this movie relies more on acting than the previous and it therefor becomes more apparent than ever that none of these actors will ever win any prize whatsoever for their "skills" in acting.The pace is also annoyingly slow. Often people just walk around to different locations, says something which sometimes makes sense and sometimes it doesn't. This is what happens most of the time and it is not entertaining in anyway.The gore is the only department were this movie is really effective. Tom Savini has made some of the most stomach-churning gore ever. And I do really mean it. This is so well made that it's almost bordering on snuff, gorehounds will without any doubt whatsoever be satisfied.Overall I felt this movie was uninteresting and mostly dull, but it's worth seeing both for being he end of the "Dead"-trilogy and for the remarkable make-up effects.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst of the Romero Trilogy But not Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that i am avid zombie movie collector, and some of that low budget trash they put out could never touch this movie. Day of the dead is the concluding addition to the romero trilogy. It could be the darkest of them all to. WARNING SPOILERS: The reason many people are turned off from this movie is the lack of graphic violence until the end which is only about 5 to 10 minutes. It is in fact more gory then Dawn of the Dead but only because of that last scene. This movie deals with a group of people in a underground military base coping with the thought that the world as they know it is no longer inhabited by humans but zombies are now the know. People emotionally break in this movie including many of the main cast. But on the positive, a scientist is figuring out more and more about the zombies. And even teaching one named Bub to talk, and do everyday normal things like answer the phone, read, and listen to music. A lot of people will be turned down by the slow pace in the movie, where it doesn't get going till almost the end. But Romero knew that, and he wasn't out to make a gory disgusting film, he also wanted to have a story attached to it. Which makes up for the slow pace. Other then that enjoy it. PS. don't watch the one on TV it totally ruins the movie making it look very choppy and dull</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romero's Third Zombie Film Is Easily The Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day Of The Dead is Director George A. Romero's last zombie film to date, and it is easily his worst of the bunch. The military vs. scientist angle along with the Frankenstein sub-plot really are formulaic in execution. Despite, the much larger budget for this film, it looks like a very cheaply made film. It's poorly made from a technical standpoint also, especially with the abrupt, choppy editing. The screenplay is pretty much static, and the claustrophobic setting, minus the surprises and thrills from the first two films, makes things even worse. The emphasis in this film is on graphic gore, bad actors overall, and excessively mean villains. The conflicts, and their resolution, between the scientists and the military group offer us nothing new. This prevents us from identifying with anyone or anything. The killing of the zombies is often played for laughs, and doesn't play well with the more serious plot tone. Gone is most of the social commentary seen in earlier films, and any intended messages lack originality, coming across as heavy-handed. The film does have some creepy good gore scenes however, which are the reasons most viewers watch this stuff anyway. * of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for the first time, as the baaaad reviews from critics and friends alike kept me away all these years. It wasn't as poor as I'd been led to believe, but it was, indeed, poor. Unlike "Dawn," all it has going for it is gory mayhem, TONS of it (far more than in previous 2 movies), so if that's all you're looking for, you'll like this movie.What it's missing for me is the social satire of "Dawn" and the humor/camp of "Dawn." Not that there's no humor, but... pretty close. And these monsters, this world, this plot, and all the physics/physiology involved are far too silly to be taken this seriously.Furthermore, too many elements from "Dawn" are repeated in this movie, making me think that Romero's creative tank is decidedly shallow. Still, he made 2 good movies, and that's more than most of us will ever do.</fullReview>

I hunted high and low for "Day of the Dead" and I was bitterly dissapointed whan I finally watched it. Theres too much shouting and arguing. Bud, a learning zombie? please, thats not scary or even clever and he had too much of a good aim for an undead. This did not compare to "Dawn of the Dead" or even Michael Jacksons "Thriller" music video. The only plus side is that the effects were very good and ahead of their time. Many thanks to Mr Savini, especially impressed with the very first zombie seen in the movie. Love ya in From Dusk Til Dawn, now that's a good movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was bored like a zombie watching Dawn of the Dead, the second of the three Living Dead movies. It was such god awful crap that I was reluctant to watch the third one. But, I was actually impressed.First off, it was dated 1985. So, with the slasher films of the decade that it had to compete with, I expected major special effects improvement since the second one, especially considering special effects are like 80 percent of a horror movie. And they were excellent.The story wasn't all that ridiculous. A third round of a bunch of folks living in an underground army complex trying to get away from more brain lusting zombies. The irrational super-pumped testorone army guys versus the more rational scientists get in each other's faces while combatting zombies. It was at least a lot more interesting to watch compared to part 2's gang of four being trapped in a shopping mall. There was a lot more going on here, especially the interesting part of the doctor experimenting with zombies and seeing how they operate. And this is where much of the excellent sfx can be seen.And for me, that makes it like it...especially after seeing Dawn of the Dead...which is one of the worst horror movies (actually just a really bad and boring movie) I have ever seen (and there's a lot of Canadian horror in that list). I write this however, not as a fan of the cult classic trilogy nor of Romero. Just as someone who felt like watching a Zombie flick. And everyone recommended the Dawn of the Dead/Day of the Dead movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* Semi-Spoiler type stuff in here *I think this film had a lot of potential and as someone who enjoyed the previous two, I couldn't help but record this one on TIVO when I saw it on TNN recently. However, I was let down.There were some good concepts here -- the mad scientist experimenting on the corpses (er.. 'dead', that is..), the typical fight for survival of this series, etc.However, I found myself bored. It wasn't interesting to watch a zombie attempt to use no short of a half dozen items (ranging from a phone, headphones, to a gun, which has some outcome and bearing later in the flick), and the constant bickering of the scientists and 'army men' got old. There was just as much time spent watching the two groups of humans bicker as there was actual fighting/bickering with the zombies. While I'm sure we wouldn't get along great if faced with the dead taking over the earth, you can watch the conflict that humans have with each other from every TV/Movie from "COPS" to "QUEER EYE FOR THE STRAIGHT GUY", so why did the human/human battle consume such a large part of a film depicting a fight against malevolent undead forces?I guess I wanted to see a horror film with some intelligence, and ended up getting to see human conflict. I wanted zombie conflict.A bit of a letdown, for a movie I was really looking forward to. I fast forwarded 45 minutes of the two hours and really didn't miss much.</fullReview>

There's not even enough action to keep you interested. Even zombie movie fans won't like this one. Stick with Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. Trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Night and Dawn, but Day was a real disappointment. The main problem with the film is that it's too slow and talky. This wouldn't be a problem if the script was good, but it isn't. I didn't like any of the characters, who spend more time fighting with each other than they do the zombies (why can people in zombie films never ever get along? Adversity is supposed to bring people closer!) To be honest I couldn't care less who ended up as zombie chow. On the other hand the special effects were good, but I'd rather just watch Dawn again to be honest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has much more gore than Dawn of the dead. While Dawn had the better story line. The first half of this movie is rather boring, not much happens except arguing between the military people and the scientists. But the last half hour is filled with gore and blood and intestines. People are torn apart and skin peeled back. And considering how mean the people are who get these horrible deaths, you don't feel sorry for them one bit. There is some amusing scenes between the tame zombie and the scientist when he gives the zombie headphones and another time a gun.FINAL VERDICT: Great for all gore fans. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There ISN'T an Alien 3 syndrome...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alien 3 is a critically reviled film because, unlike its two predecessors, one relying on dramatic tension while the other relies on action set pieces, there are frequent flat, boring, slow spots. A much better script had been known to exist for some time, and why it was jettisoned in favour of one that kills off half the cast in a perfunctory manner happens to be one of the greatest mysteries of the Hollywood system.How is this relevant to Day Of The Dead, I hear you ask? Well, like Alien 3, it follows on from an original that was very atmospheric, tense, and intelligent. Not having seen Dawn Of The Dead, I won't comment about whether that sequel was an improvement or not, but compared to the gritty darkness of Night Of The Living Dead, Day Of The Dead is just uneventful. The film starts with a group of scientists in a helicopter, flying into a deserted city to search for anyone who happens to still be alive. Upon beating a hasty retreat from the zombies, we soon learn that these scientists are locked in a bunker with a mob of angry soldiers who are getting more than just a little stir-crazy. This is where the film, unfortunately, starts to fall apart.Basically, we just don't give a damn about either the scientists or the soldiers - the former are a group of sad weaklings who let the soldiers walk all over them, and the latter are a bunch of complete b**tards whom we'd all be happy to take out and feed to the zombies ourselves. There is noone we feel any sympathy for in this chapter (perhaps this was intentional). Another problem with the film is that, up until the last twenty or so minutes, there is little to no action. The first film wasn't exactly an action blockbuster, but the film moved along at a pace that allowed the viewer to keep interested. Unfortunately, Day Of The Dead moves slightly faster than a concussed slug. During my viewing of the Region 4 DVD, I found myself activating the Time Remaining display quite a number of times, only to groan at there being way too much viewing time left. This is not a "slow, more deliberate pace", it is basically boring your audience, something that should never be done in the world of horror or action films.Anyway, if you want to see how the Dead series peters out (the ending was obviously cut in because the makers were running out of cash), then this is an excellent place to look. Let's hope that the long-rumoured Twilight Of The Dead project is a lot better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very decent horror film. It's not up to the level of Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead but so what? Those were both touchstone horror movies and I think it's ok that Day isn't the same level of flick. On the plus side, it has exceptional effects by Tom Savini and (no surprise) top notch direction from George Romero. Also, a number of the actors turn in fine work. Among them, Lori Cardille in the lead (she's pretty in an intelligent way and quite good for someone without a ton of acting experience, much like the 4 leads in Dawn of the Dead), John Amplas (the fine lead from Romero's Martin), Terry Alexander and Jarlath Conroy as the civilian, helicopter driving members of the underground team and Sherman Howard and Richard Liberty as the main zombie and the team's nutty professor, respectively. The supporting soldiers do a good job but some of the central ones are frankly pretty hard to watch. Gary Klar chews some scenery as Steele but not too much and he can be tolerated. Joe Pilato goes over the top as Captain Rhodes several times and he really does take away from the movie at times in a character as important as the one that he plays but then Romero should have known better IMHO. Ralph Marrero as Rickles is *horribly* over the top and his performance is probably the single most regretable part of Day. In a film with so many dialogue heavy scenes, an unbalanced performance can throw off some important moments and it does in Day. All in all though, I recommend Day of the Dead and have it in my DVD collection.</fullReview>

It's in a very different tone than the other two "dead" movies. Whereas "dawn" was largely played for laughs (except for the end) this one's dead (forgive the pun) serious! No laughs. A very nihilistic movie that's claustrophobic and towards the end VERY gory (that's why it's banned in some countries). However, none of this is played for laughs (as in most contemporary horror movies) and therefore very disturbing. It doesn't paint a very bright picture about humankind.

		<fullReview>While the original Dawn of the Dead is, undoubtedly, the zenith of Zombie movies, I must admit 'Day' is my favourite so far. It would be hard to follow-up Dawn with a superior film and Day met with much apathy on its release. Which really isn't fair. Shorter (Dawn was extremely long) and easier to swallow in one viewing, Day is brighter and clearer than Dawn (naturally).Now the Zombies have total world control. There are very few survivors of the apocalypse. Once such group (half Army, half government scientists) have made a base in an abandoned Florida missile silo. The Army are a thoroughly unpleasant lot and there's no way to root for them. The scientists and nicer though and have better intentions. But the show is stolen by Bub, the tamed zombie. He's totally brilliant! Wouldn't he make a great pet? I even got a bit teary when he got his big scene at the end.Tom Savini (sadly missing from the cast this time around) does incredible work on the make-up and gore effects. The zombies look better than they did in Dawn and the bodies being ripped apart are about as graphic and realistic as you can get without doing it for real. For a low-budget film made 20 years ago it's astonishing how good Savini's work is.Dawn had a bleak ending tinged with the slightest bit of hope (unlike the remake) but Day has a calmer, more relaxed fade out. Stay alert for a few references to Dawn including a return of the 'Zombie March' theme.This new 2-Disc DVD from Anchor Bay marks the 2,345,205th release of this film on DVD. But you couldn't ask for a better, more definitive version. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture has been put through Anchor Bay's Divimax process and it looks absolutely stunning and crystal clear. The sound has also been remastered into strong Dolby 6.1, DTS ES sound. There are zillions of extras and actually worth your time too. The DVDs also come in an extremely cool digipack featuring the highly lovable Bub on the front.Bub rules!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misfire, but a creative misfire...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American system as we know and love it has never been kind to independent, extreme material, and Day Of The Dead is an excellent example of this. George Romero didn't seem to believe in the MPAA ratings system, and preferred to shoot all the gore on half the budget. The problem here is that for what the film is trying to do, a bigger budget was really a good thing to have. However, the film's problems are not entirely limited to the budget. There is also a certain element lacking that no amount of money can cover up.Unlike the previous Dead films, Day Of The Dead has a serious problem building characters that the viewer can care about or sympathies with. The scientists seem incredibly dense, and the soldiers display rare combinations of stupidity with ignorance that some doctors in today's world can't seem to understand to not fit in with today's consumerist world. It's a pretty telling sign that the most memorable character in the film is a domesticated zombie that one of the scientists calls Bub.Another difference compared to previous Dead films is the ending, which is so abrupt and resolute that the audience should feel cheated. By contrast, Night's ending is set up by the rest of the film, where the massive efforts of the living are defeated by their paranoiac inability to cooperate. By comparison, you could divide Day Of The Dead into the last five minutes and everything else that happened beforehand, with a particularly uneducated film-goer never noticing that these pieces of footage are from the same project.I can't say I understand why Romero would consider this his best work. It is slow, poorly edited, and generally unpleasant. Nonetheless, it beats the hell out of many other zombie flicks, especially those supported by the Hollywood system, such as Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Or Resident Evil: We're Too Scared To Aim Above The Lowest Common Denominator, as it should have been called. The recent trend of fast-moving zombies is thankfully not started here. We're shown the right way to realize zombies, overwhelming the living by sheer numbers than any strength on their part. It's a social commentary - think of all the mindless sheep who support an inferior product and give the makers of that product leverage to overwhelm those who don't want it. In Romero's films in particular, it becomes something intellectual, as opposed to the sheer mindlessness of the MPAA's typical product.I gave Day Of The Dead seven out of ten. By the standards of other Dead films, it only deserves a five, but compared to the mainstream product, it is a masterpiece. It is enough to make me hope that the Twilight Of The Dead project everyone has been talking about for some time will eventually go ahead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie Romero seems to be ripping off the very movies that ripped off his earlier, excellent efforts. Gone is any aspect of subtlety, or nuance, or commentary on society that the first two movies held. Instead there's a typical "science vs. military" conflict, undercut by the fact that nobody on either side is in the least likeable or believable. In lieu of dialogue we get screaming and yelling, with the occasional bloodletting thrown in to sate the audience-types who expect that kind of thing. Romero obviously wanted to wrap up the trilogy here, but he doesn't seem to have anything else in his mind so this comes across as a "finish it and get it out of the way" sort of approach, rather than anything that any deep thought went into.</fullReview>

The acting is uniformly terrible, and the dialog is not particularly good and, at times, laughably bad. The basic premise and story are decent, but the interesting themes and ideas (the power struggles that occur at the breaking point of civilization) behind the movie are dealt with rather clumsily. The gore, which I hear was quite shocking for its time, is not that affecting today but is nonetheless well done. Overall, Day of the Dead's concept had potential but was badly executed (I recommend Ghosts of Mars instead of this movie since it has similar themes and is at least half-decent in terms of acting and direction). This movie is a disappointment since Night of the Living Dead was such a delight. I would normally give this movie about 4/10, but since it is a Zombie Movie, it earns a bonus point. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horrible end to an already crappy trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the huge disappointment of DAWN OF THE DEAD, DAY OF THE DEAD is just the icing on the cake.First of all, the plot makes no ****ing sense whatsoever. There are several people locked in a military camp (or something), some of which are members of the army, and a couple of which are scientists. Now, these scientists are attempting to get inside the zombies' brains in order to control their actions... and I'll get to that in a minute. Aside from that, the Captain of the army is a total ass, and he constantly bullies everyone around him, including the poor delicate flower of the camp, a woman named Sarah (played by a pretty good Lori Cardille) who serves virtually no purpose in the movie. The zombies come. That's about it.At the sight of the opening shot of Sarah sitting in the cell and having the zombie arms burst through the wall, I thought, "Cool! Maybe this will actually be good." Sadly, that turned out to be just one of Sarah's many dreams. Her dreams, actually, all put together, would make a pretty good movie. They were creepy, at least.However, no cigar. The zombies in this movie are still weak and slow, as in the last two, but maybe less so. They creeped me out a little more than they did in the previous movies. They were still far from menacing or scary, though.I think the real problem I had with this movie was the plot itself. The idea of trying to control the zombies' brains is just ridiculous. You could easily just shoot them, seeing as how they're so slow and easy to kill, and save a lot of time. Why would you want to take zombies and domesticate them? They're not dogs. They serve no purpose except to provide terror and eventually create more zombies--and, in this case, they don't even do that.The acting is somewhat decent, and the characters are bland and uninteresting. The character of Sarah, as I said, is completely useless to the movie, but I guess the filmmakers just wanted a woman in there to "diversify" the cast. However, Joseph Pilato is good as Captain Rhodes--he really is an ass. And, as I said, Lori Cardille is pretty good, even if her character was useless. The other actors are just as bland and uninteresting as their characters.I do have one good thing to say about this movie, though--what happens to Rhodes at the end. That was actually scary on the zombies' behalf and--dare I say it--clever. It made me say, "Cool!" again... for only the third time during the whole movie.I liked NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. I disliked DAWN OF THE DEAD. But I despised DAY OF THE DEAD. What a way to end this "classic" trilogy. 2/10.</fullReview>

If the answer is "Coooooool, uh hu, Bub the zombie, coooool", then I know it's time for me to make my escape.But don't give up hope, there is a cure. I too watched this awful film when I was about eleven, and thought that it was the best thing ever. I mean, it had people swearing, and it had zombies, and it had effects.

I mean, as a bona fide adult now, I find myself actually cheering on the zombies.The biggest sin though is the abrupt jump to a crowbarred ending. They ran out of money, you say? Boo hoo. Deal with it. There have been many better films made for much less money. That's not an excuse. There's at least half an hour of pointless drivel that could be cut from this film at it stands. If it had been done before it had been filmed, then the ending could have been realised. This didn't happen. The film is a failure. Romero screwed up.

		<shortDescription>A sad end to the great zombie trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero's last entry is a slow, dull, boring piece of cinema that pits a trio of scientists in a military bunker against a mostly jerk off group of soldiers and their sadistic commander AND the zombies outside. The head doctor, however, has chalked up a plan that makes the others a bit uneasy when not fascinating them: he is domesticating zombies as a way of controlling them! This does not sit well with the head sadist soldier.The usual doses of gore and "who's the bigger monster here?" abound, but it lacks the chilling atmosphere of "Night of the Living Dead" and the go-for-broke flamboyancy of "Dawn of the Dead". Only a few shocks and the intriguing idea of domesticating those pesky zombies as opposed to trying to kill all of them highlight this otherwise neutered, unengaging zombie entry.It's only a matter of time now before "Day of the Dead" is remade, and somehow a remake might actually improve it. But then again, maybe it won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very long fall from lofty heights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night of the Living Dead" and "Dawn of the Dead" are, very rightly, legends in the annals of horror cinema. They are both extremely well made, at turns horrifying and humorous, and very clever in their use of the undead as social statement. That may be where "Day of the Dead" ultimately falls apart.I hadn't seen the trilogy in years, and the impending remake of "Dawn" spurred me to rewatch the three. The experience deepened my appreciation of the first two, confirming for me that they deserved their classic status. I think, though, that I was being far too kind to the third entry. This is a film with very little to say, and can't even find an interesting way to say it. There is no statement here, no social satire. Romero seems to be taking the concept very literally; rather than finding something new to say about the antagonists, he literally dissects them.The undead (nowhere in any of the films are they referred to as zombies, by the way) are being medically studied by an unethical and twitchy scientist in an attempt to "domesticate" them. The experiments take place in an underground shelter, supervised by a small band of soldiers, all of whom are portrayed as either wild-eyed psychos or shrieking hyenas; so much for complex character development. The lead researcher is also clearly missing a few aces from his deck, which leaves us with a pointless research assistant, an electronics engineer with a drinking habit, a Jamaican chopper pilot, and "the woman". She is apparently also engaged in some kind of research, but since we're never told what it is, she's simply "the woman", and her role in the screenplay seems to be to disagree with everyone. The characters cling to the single note they've been given, and never reveal additional facets. The one hint of humanity is found in "Bub", a ghoul on whom the scientist has been performing intelligence and memory tests in an attempt to make him more docile. It says something that the only moments of pathos in the film come from a dead guy.With no character development and little plot, we're left only to marvel at the effects, and they are indeed marvel-worthy. Tom Savini has really gone out on a severed limb here, and designed some of the most fiendishly ingenious prosthetics ever seen on film (although I wonder whether creatures who are already dead would really bleed that much). Not enough praise can be heaped on this work; it really is phenomenal.On the other end of the scale is the music score, which flat-out sucks. It's a tuneless, monotonous, synthesized drone that would be more at home in a bad high school romance flick than in a horror film. It's simply awful.Romero's recent announcement that there would be a fourth "Dead" film has fans abuzz with excitement, probably because they're engaging their selective memory and focusing on the first two excellent movies in the series. Maybe another viewing of this one would temper their enthusiasm a bit. This is the "Battle For the Planet of the Apes" of the Dead series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's just occurred to me that while I think of myself as a fan of zombie films, that there are only three genre films that I actually enjoy: Night of the Living Dead (the original and remake), and Return of the Living Dead.These films all have something in common; they're taut. They pick a theme, stick to it, and pile it on to an inexorable conclusion. All other zombie films dawdle and meander annoyingly, and Day of the Dead is no exception.That's not to say that Day doesn't have a sense of inevitability about it. The whole plot progression is boringly predictable, and it's the boring part that sticks in the mind. I know what's going to happen, but I don't particularly care. Annoying people yell at each other, and I don't care. Ludicrous stereotypes over-act, and I don't care. Bub the Zombie moves his jaw from side to side, and I care a little. Then the live people take the screen again, and I go back to not giving a damn.We know what's going to happen, but it takes so long to get there that it's actually a relief when the live cast start meeting their sticky ends. I for one was cheering for the zombies, which up to a point is what I'm supposed to do. What I'm not supposed to want is for all of the living cast, including the ostensible sympathetic heroes, to be shredded. The rapidly tacked on brutally optimistic ending is a huge disappointment; I'd far rather find out what happened to Bub than the insipid nobodies whose fate I'm supposed to care about.This is a film that would have been far better left in the can, or better yet, as a script waiting for enough budget to afford actual actors and editing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh my god what a terrible movie!! {contains spoilers}</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have one question...WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?????"Dawn of the Dead" was by far one of the best horror movies I have ever seen in history and then the follow up is possibly (with the exception of the "Return of The Living Dead" trash that flooded the silver screen for a while) one of the worst movies ever in history!I realize that the world is all but dead and a few people are the only ones to survive, but they took the "post apocalyptic" look too far.Oh and I love how the zombies can actually hide in this one and come out when people, live people that is, come sniffing around. They no longer just amble around aimlessly, they actually lie in wait for prey. Good thing in this movie they don't have to wait long and too bad they didn't get the intended prey in the opening sequence.God what a waste! The underground science lab was ok, but the underground, underground was even better, ha ha. How did the zombies get there in the first place? Oh and how did the people get the corral/wall thing built to separate themselves from the zombies and their science station without becoming zombies themselves, being as they usually travel in large numbers and love the smell of live flesh.There was just so much in this movie that was terrible that I can hardly begin to remember it all, as I have tried very hard to forget it! I watched it one time many years ago and then started reading positive reviews about it, so I gave it another chance. MY MISTAKE! I should have just gone with my first memory because it was even worse the second time!!The ONLY and I do mean *only* redeeming quality to this movie is "Bud" played with real heart and emotion (for a zombie) by Howard Sherman. He was great! Other than that, this movie was just awful!The way the soldiers fought amongst themselves, reminded me of Junior High School and the scientists...what was wrong with them?? Lori Cardille as Sarah was just awful. Rarely can I remember a worse acting job and totally unconvincing except that she likes to have her men threaten her and hit her. Very lame. Don't even get me started on her "boyfriend" who was also a scientist who lost his marbles (why I have no clue, I never figured it out) and likes to be insulting and a pain in the butt.Avoid this movie like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day of the Dead takes everything that was wrong with Dawn of the Dead and amplifies it. The bad acting, the cheap feel, the predictable plot and the bad effects.The plot revolves around yet another group of survivors of a zombie epidemic: half of the group are military personnel (although I use the term loosely) and the other half are scientists and other miscellaneous people. The actors who played the soldiers either seem to have been told by the director to overplay their roles or are simply bad actors; regardless of which, every soldier is a racist, a bully, trigger-happy, stupid and contemptuous and suspicious of all of the scientists. Of the other members of the group there is a scientist (to whom the soldiers refer as "Frankenstein" again and again in a predictable reference to his working with zombies and corpses), some Irishman with a very dodgy accent who seems to have a limitless supply of alcohol despite references from him and other members that supplies are running low, a Jamaican who, despite being a pilot, refers to his helicopter as a "whirly-bird", another scientist whose role was lost on me and a woman who is the main protagonist. I found none of the characters likable whatsoever.The film starts off interestingly enough: the pilot lands his "whirly bird" in some town and the woman asks loudly if anyone's around in some city. I knew what would happen, loads of zombies started to descend upon the group and they took off quickly. While watching this, I thought how stupid the characters must be to think that would work as survivors are unlikely to be in such a location. Upon returning home, we have the familiar scene in all of Romero's films: the fortress with hordes of zombies trying to get in. Underground, we find out that the leader of the soldiers, Captain Rhodes, and his sidekicks cannot act. They are angry at being stuck in the bunker. After another thirty minutes of very little action and arguing and pointing guns at each other, they all decide to carry on as normal.Eventually, we learn that the scientist has been trying to domesticate the zombies and has discovered that they need not eat to live and that they can survive with no internal organs. I have to say, trying to explain zombies scientifically was a big mistake by the scriptwriters. The fact that dead people can walk around and inexplicably want to eat living people as opposed to themselves (living dead are fussy eaters apparently) needs a fair bit of suspension of logic from the viewer but having a scene with a zombie with no internal organs moving around and (in another scene) showing a severed head still moving is taking it too far I think.Anyway, the scientist gets the soldiers to bring him "specimens" (zombies) from some underground store (how they got them there in the first place is never explained, we're just told that they're running out of them and they'd have to get more from the surface eventually) and of course something goes wrong and some of the group get bitten by zombies. I have to say that even decaying zombie teeth seem to be able to bite off human flesh with remarkable ease, it's almost as if the group's bodies are made from silly putty.After more dilly-dallying, we learn that the scientist has made progress with a zombie he called "Bub" who is learning to use razors again. Captain Rhodes is angered that his men have died trying to help domesticate zombies when they should be killing them and then another boring argument ensues about how there isn't enough ammunition to kill them all. After Captain Rhodes refuses to salute "Bub" back, "Bub" (given an unloaded gun by the scientist) pulls the trigger on the Captain (because not saluting a zombie back is deserving of death you see) but as the gun is unloaded, nothing happens.We later learn that the scientist domesticated "Bub" by feeding it body parts from fallen soldiers. I really fail to see how such a stupid creature could distinguish between fellow zombie flesh and flesh from corpses already days old. The Captain (quite rightly) shoots the scientist for this unethical practice of feeding zombies fallen soldiers and then "Bub" inexplicably breaks his chains, sees the scientist dead, somehow knows that the Captain did it, gets hold of a gun, shoots the Captain, salutes him and then the Captain gets killed in one of the most unnecessarily grotesque scenes I have ever witnessed. The scenes of gore really add nothing to the film's plot - I know that zombies eat people and the earlier scenes of biting arms and throats were enough. I advise anyone watching this to skip these unnecessary scenes of gore.I forgot to mention that, yes, as in all Romero zombie films, the fortress is somehow penetrated by the zombies and they start invading in mass numbers. In this film it was done by a group member trying to kill himself who'd had his arm amputated earlier in the film.The soldiers all die and the woman, the pilot and the Irishman escape to some island. Before they get on the helicopter, we're treated to a fake unhappy ending which turns out to be a dream.The intelligent zombie premise was redone by Romero in a more ludicrous way in the almost equally bad Land of the Dead.The acting is appalling, the script terrible, most of the film was just pointless arguing and like Dawn of the Dead, the film has a nasty cheap feel to it. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schlock, but occasionally effective schlock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing you notice about "Day of the Dead" is its extremely low budget. Although that does help Romero to create a unique, depressing, claustrophobic atmosphere, it also tends to move this film towards the "schlock" category. Everything is poorly lit, which may be appropriate for this environment, but often makes it hard for us to clearly see all those celebrated gore scenes. And the effects are generally uneven; some of them are outstanding, but others (some disembowelings) look distractingly fake. I have to warn the gore-hounds that this movie isn't quite as gruesome as they might have heard; "Braindead" or "Hellraiser II" were INCOMPARABLY more sickening."Day of the Dead" is consistently unpredictable, and there are quite a few surprises. But the characters are unlikable and hard to identify with (that "Jamaican" guy was supposedly the most likable one, but I could hardly understand many of his lines) and the ending is disappointing and leaves you feeling cheated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and morbid climax to the Dead Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third part of George Romero's masterpiece; The Dead Trilogy, is the darkest and most compact of the bunch, and while it never reaches the awesome highs of the previous two, it still stands on it's own as a more than passable zombie gorefest. Speaking of gore; this film has oodles! Because the film is darker and more unpleasant than the other two, the gore hits home more. Whether it be the nasty experiments of a man nicknamed "Dr Frankenstein" or the now legendary splatter soaked finale, you can always be sure that this film will have something up it's sleeve to shock and/or disgust you! The way that the trilogy has panned out is rather good, and George Romero has obviously put some thought into what would be the consequences of the events of Night of the Living Dead. This film takes into account the idea of humans not being able to co-operate with one another, which makes the people in the movie just as big a threat as the zombies. We follow 12 humans that are holed up in an old World War 2 bunker, and we see the threat that the humans cause themselves with the conflict between the scientific and military interests.Romero has shown his inventiveness with the make-up effects throughout this series. In Night of the Living Dead, the zombies were hardly decayed at all. By Dawn of the Dead, they were more bloody and more decayed, and by the time of this film; it would seem that effects guru Tom Savini has been given free licence to create some of the most disgusting effects ever to be seen in a zombie movie! The often green and white skinned living dead walk around with dried blood caked to their carcasses, limbs and jaws missing; you name it, these zombies have it! Naturally, it's the make-up and gore that are the stars of this movie, and the human stars take a back seat. It's a good job that's the case as well; as the actors here aren't up to much. This is almost a benefit to the movie; however, as it gives it that low budget feel that many movies fans, such as myself, love. There are some elements of the movie that don't work - seeing the talking zombie always makes me cringe - but on the whole, this is an invigorating and inventive zombie flick and while it isn't as great as the previous two; it's still pretty damn good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day of the Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven years since the first sequel comes the second from director George A. Romero, in colour and much more elaborate than the second film, probably one of the goriest films in history. Basically some survivors: Sarah (Lori Cardille), black character (always one) John (Terry Alexander), William McDermott (Jarlath Conroy) and Pvt. Miguel Salazar (Anthony Dileo Jr.) are exploring all towns within a 100 mile radius to see if there are any other survivors, but all they find are the zombies slowly swarming towards them. They then return to their military base, and more zombies are appearing at the fences trying get in and feed on their flesh. In this military base, run by the arsehole Capt. Rhodes (Joseph Pilato) they are basically hiding from the terror underground, and now and then collecting dead people living with them to take to the man who thinks he can help the situation, Dr. "Frankenstein" Logan (Richard Liberty). He believes that he can solve the situation by not finding the reason for the dead rising and abolishing it, but by trying to control them to behave the way they want, i.e. trying to stop them eating people. The other people are obviously the ones collecting the undead to bring them to him, and the Captain obviously doesn't see what good it is doing. For a while, Logan has made some progress with one of the creatures, that he has named Bub (Sherman Howard), who has learnt not to be excited when a human comes into the room, and learnt to use many items again, e.g. phone, cassette player. Logan is killed by the Captain though when he discovers that Bub is still eating human flesh, taken from the dead soldiers taken by zombie attacks or shots. Eventually, everyone will be bait for the zombies when the mad Miguel goes up to the surface, and lets the thousands of creatures in and lets them down below. In the end, only the worthy people survive and get back to the helicopter to their tropical island and peaceful ending, all the other are eaten alive and turned into part of the large bloodbath left. Also starring Gary Howard Klar as Pvt. Steel and John Amplas as Dr. Ted Fisher. If you have seen The Evil Dead two years before this, then you'd know the scale of blood and guts used in this film, almost as much as, if not more! Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not My Favorite in the Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the south of Florida, a group of scientists and military men are surrounded by the undead while they try to find a way to reverse the zombification process. But as the group faces the zombies on the outside, they also must face each other on the inside (not unlike the situation Romero returns to in "Land of the Dead"). Can a small group of humans survive when grossly outnumbered? Many consider this the best in the series. I don't. For me, that honor goes to "Dawn of the Dead" (the original). But I will say this is far better than "Land of the Dead", which relies on a very similar plot and comes across as weak in most categories. Frankly, Romero is out of ideas (which is evident if you look at his upcoming projects).I liked the zombies, and I must give credit to Greg Nicotero and Tom Savini for making some great gory monsters. The intestines getting ripped out, decapitations, and more -- everything that makes a zombie film worth watching. The lab scene where Dr. Logan (Richard Liberty) shows his experiments on mutilated corpses... oh, that's some great special effects.Lori Cardille played a good lead as Sarah. Yet another "final girl" archetype for the film students to study. Unlike much of horror, she was more strong-willed than sexy, but if anything this gives Romero a special kind of credibility, not having to rely on flashy or sexy actors to sell his ideas. Sherman Howard was also great as "Bub", the talking zombie. We see this type of zombie explored again in "Land of the Dead" (but not as well), and I think this is clearly the inspiration behind "Bud the Chud" (from one of my favorite films, "Chud II"), though I can find no blatant evidence for this.If you love zombie films, this is a must-see. From the opening scene that made me jump all the way to the gory conclusion, this is now a modern classic. Zombies today (2006-2007) are coming back into fashion, but let us never forget that the groundwork for them in their modern incarnation was really laid out by Romero. Pay some respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another day in George's crazy zombie world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, right when I think that I'm a fan of the Dead trilogy from Romero, I had the silliest notion the other day, I've never seen Day of the Dead. Romero revolutionized zombies and made them the monsters that they are today and the thing that makes him so excellent and these movies classic is that he knows how to write characters so well and plays into our survival instincts. However it's weird, I never heard many things about Day of the Dead, so I thought it wasn't that good maybe. But I should know better to look on the internet with users and reviewers who describe the film and show how famous it is in our treasure box world of cult classics. I bought Day of the Dead without seeing it and actually found myself loving this movie and seeing a possible inspiration for 28 Days Later. It's always interesting to see who did it first and George was way ahead of his time when he wrote and made this great film.Sara and three survivors, John, Bill and Miguel, land a chopper in deserted streets of Fort Myers to search for other possible survivors. They try to call people with a megaphone, but only attract hordes of undead. The group returns to their base, an underground army missile bunker near the Everglades. The group is revealed to be part of a military-supported scientific team assigned by the remnants of the government to study the zombie phenomenon in the hopes of finding a way of stopping or reversing the zombification process. But of course there are certain soldiers who are taking their jobs a little above and beyond their line of duty.Day of the Dead was a great conclusion before Romero continued his story with Land of the Dead, which is another movie I highly recommend. Like I said, Romero knew how to write his characters very well and even adds that cheesy moment in his films where they're unbelievable but such an awesome scene that you just fall in love with it, like where the zombies attack one of the soldiers and he's being ripped apart as he's still screaming "Choke on it!!!". The whole setting of this movie was extremely creepy, I can't imagine if this was real how scary it would be to see people who are acting like total savages and instead of trying to help the situation with the zombie attack are acting like total power freaks. The sad part is, this would happen in real life if this situation was true and again makes for great writing.Another thing that I loved was I saw an inspiration for a movie I saw a few years ago called Fido where we got to see what a zombie who was made to fit back into society and we see in Day of the Dead a zombie that actually starts to remember his life before he died named Bubba. I loved that the scientist was like a father to him and that he was so quick to avenge whatever wrong was done. If this movie was made today, I would say Bubba deserves his own movie. The dead series are classics and way ahead of their time, not to mention that they molded the zombie genre. Day of the Dead is a great movie not to be missed and I think I may throw a Zombie party one night for a marathon, nothing says friendship than flesh eaters.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a short of shame that the only classic regarded George A. Romero is "Dawn of the Dead", while this movie is just at least as good and classic in my opinion.Compared to its predecessors, this movie is more gruesome and gore filled, yet the zombies themselves play a less prominent role. This movie is also a great reflection of human nature. The real monsters of this movie are not really the zombies but the military and scientist of this movie. This is perhaps why this movie isn't as 'loved' by the mainstream audience, as much as its predecessor "Dawn of the Dead". It's too serious and at the same too unlikely. I'm not complaining though, I like this approach and it reminded me very much of, the one year after this movie released movie, "Aliens", which showed similarities with its story, characters and settings. I'm sure it's a coincidence all but interesting to notice nevertheless.But don't worry, there also is plenty to enjoy here for the fans of horror and gore. The zombies look better than ever. They actually look like decaying bodies now, more than was the case in the previous 'Dead' movies. The make-up and effects are fantastic. There are some gruesome gory sequences in the movie, such as character getting torn apart, while they are still alive in screaming. Limbs, fingers and even heads get torn- and bitten off in this movie like it's nothing. Their flesh is getting peeled off while they're screaming, they're heads are torn off while their are still moving and their body is still moving, their stomachs opened, their legs ripped off. Anyway, you get the picture of how this movie is like. The movie has countless like those and other sequences in it. It's about as gory and gruesome as you'll ever see, in a genre movie like this one. You thought "Dawn of the Dead" was gross? You've ain't seen nothing yet!The zombies look better than ever and they also behave better than ever. You really get the feel of danger, which is also thanks to the claustrophobic environment. They act like more dangerous beings and seem to be more effective in their actions and movements, with of course Bub the zombie as the best and most entertaining zombie of the movie, that becomes an actual- and essential character in the story as well.The story is simple but it should get kudos for trying to explain things and create multiple layers with its characters and story. Toward the ending of the movie all the gloves are off and the movie turns into a typical Romero gore-fest, while the characters are trying to escape.The movie uses some good looking and claustrophobic settings. For most part the movie is set underground. This works definitely more scary and more dangerous as a backdrop than a shopping mall, although it of course doesn't make it as entertaining.Of course once more the acting isn't top-class and it doesn't use any well known actors. Yet the characters themselves are fun and well written. This compensates a lot for the simple acting in the movie. The characters are all quite stereotypical and over-the-top but very entertaining at the same time, because of that very same reason.A brilliantly made, gore filled, zombie-movie classic, from George A. Romero, that is criminally underrated and deserves just as much recognition and praise as the other Romero masterpiece "Dawn of the Dead".10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uptated: NOT the worst of the Romero zombie films anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this, the third film in the Living Dead saga, the small amount of survivors left find themselves holed up in an underground bunker where scientist's are conducting experiments on the undead. I strongly doubt that George Romero's intentions when making this was to have anyone empathize with the military personale, but thanks to all character's being unlikable, I couldn't help but to root for the least despicable ones in the bunch. Most think that this is the worst in the no longer aptly name trilogy and a select few deem this to be the best. Thanks to poorly developed characters and it trying to be more grandiose than the meager budget would allow, as well as the John Harrison score not being nearly as good as the Goblin one in Dawn, I find myself siding with the former more then the latter. In hindsight and having seen the new "Land of the Dead" the title of worst Romero zombie film doesn't apply to this film anymore. My Grade: C- DVD Extras: Commentary with George Romero, Tom Savani, Cletus Anderson, and Lori Cardille; Second commentary with Roger Avery (which I enjoyed more) Disc 2) "Many days of day of the Dead" (39 minute documentary); Behind the scenes featurette; Gateway Commerce Center Promo; Richard Liberty audio interview; 3 Theartrical Trailers; 3 TV Spots; Still Galleries; and Romero bio DVD-Rom: complete first draft script and production memos is .pdf format Random Notes: For some unknown reason some dialog seems to be looped on this DVD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to make the perfect Trilogy ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How to make the perfect Trilogy ?...Well, ask Mr. Romero. Because he did it with his trilogy of the dead. And although many people say this third installment is a disgrace to Night and Dawn...they couldn't be more wrong. Although Day of the Dead is a known and famous movie, it might as well be the most underrated horror movie ever made. It deserves a lot more credit than it receives. Night of the Living Dead was a milestone in horror. Original, dared and one of the most influential movies ever made. Dawn of the Dead is pure perfection. Claustrophobic to the max and it gave a whole new definition to the word "gore". True, Day of the Dead doesn't do anything new but it gives a lot extra to the complete series. Romero manages to create a whole new sort of tension. In Night and Dawn the enemy were without a doubt the zombies. But in Day...you fear the survivors a lot more. The story : A small group of survivors (a few scientists and a couple of military men) are the last humans in a very wide area. When they fly the helicopter out to find others, their search never give any results. They are hidden in an underground base, well protected against the zombies who are dwelling around the area. While they all fear to become eaten, a doctor (who they call Frankenstein...) tries to train a few zombies. Although he has results ; the zombies begin to obey him; the others become impatient and want to get out of there before it's too late. The tension between the two groups becomes unbearable and pretty soon the zombies aren't the greatest danger anymore...The insanity of the survivors now is!!Day of the Dead was brought out in 1985. During this period a lot of zombie movies came out and that's probably a reason why this movie wasn't the big success that its predecessors were. Wrongly if you ask me. Day of the Dead has a good story, lots of action and gore and good acting performances by unknown actors. Especially the cruel Rhodes, commander of the military men, gives away a flawless performance. The insanity due to the unbearable pressure really comes out in his role. I regret to say it but, this is in fact Romero's last fantastic movie. After 1985, he made inferior films like the Monkey Shines and the Dark Half but these titles never lived up to his earlier work. It is rumored that there might come a fourth film about the dead but nothing is confirmed yet. Let's keep our fingers crossed, because there's no discussion about it...Romero is at his best when he's surrounded by the living dead...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great slice of juicy zombie mayhem from Romero.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some who say that Romero lost his way with his third 'dead' movie, Day of the Dead; I disagree. Whilst it is true that the first hour may be a little heavy on the talking and rather light on the old blood and guts for some fans, the director sure delivers the goods in a rip-roaring final act in which he ramps up the action and allows top FX man Tom Savini to paint the screen red with some astoundingly gruesome gore.Personally, I love the slow burn approach Romero takes with this with chapter in his long-running tale of world domination by zombies; it gives you a chance to get to know the characters before they have their legs ripped off, and that's a good thing, methinks. This time around, the action takes place in an underground complex where a bunch of scientists and some nasty soldiers attempt to figure out what to do about the whole 'walking dead' situation.Crazy Dr. Logan (Richard Liberty) reckons he can domesticate the shambling corpses: teach them how to perform simple tasks and not to crave human flesh. However, Captain Rhodes (Joe Pilato) isn't too impressed by this idea and, when he discovers that the mad doctor has been rewarding his star pupil, Bub, (Howard Sherman) with tasty tit-bits cut from recently deceased soldiers, he decides it is time for he and his men to leave.With no further use for the civilians (with the exception of a helicopter pilot), the soldiers act ruthlessly, killing some and leaving others to be eaten by the scientific 'specimens' kept in the complex's cave system. But their plans are scuppered when a delirious soldier, the still-living victim of a zombie bite, opens the gates to the hordes of the undead? Featuring one of the greatest zombies of all time in the form of Bub, and showcasing some of Savini's career highlights, Day of the Dead is unmissable entertainment for those who like their movie monsters to smell bad, walk slow and have really bad teeth. The film starts brilliantly with a search party landing in a town, searching for survivors, but finding maggoty flesh-eaters are the only inhabitants. The next hour is spent introducing the characters and building the tension (with the occasional mutilated corpse or graphic gut-spill thrown in to remind you that this is still a Romero film).The final half-an-hour or so is packed with full-on over-the-top carnage, culminating in a couple of the nastiest death scenes it has been my pleasure to witness.It is a real shame that twenty years after this excellent film's release, Romero gave us a fourth 'dead' film which genuinely saw him losing his way: Land of the Dead was a real disappointment for many fans of the series. Let's hope that the fifth film (Diary of the Dead, due out soon) sees him back on form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior to the others and quite silly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand George Romero and Tom Savini enjoy this the most out of their "Dead" trilogy (now a so-called "quadrilogy" with the upcoming "Land of the Dead"), however I think it's the worst. First of all it's too over-the-top, explicit and cartoon-ish to be taken realistically. Second of all the Dead trilogy is, strictly speaking, supposed to take place all in one timezone (despite the two decades' difference between filming). But in the original "Night of the Living Dead" there was only a handful of foul language -- in "Dawn" there were a couple uses of the "F-word." Here, there are about 100 -- practically every other line in the movie contains profane language.Not a problem. I own and love "Reservoir Dogs," "GoodFellas," "Pulp Fiction," "Raging Bull," etc. -- these all have very strong language (more so than "Day"). But the difference is those films are realistic and the language, in context, isn't offensive -- to cram it into a very immature, silly, childish zombie picture seems deliberately stupid, especially considering the fact that there was barely ANY bad language in the first two films and they are both far superior!The acting is quite awful, the dialogue is very weak (it always was in every installment), the zombie gore is the best here and if that's all you're interested in, then this is your piece of cake.However for me I prefer the suspense and ingenuity of the original and the social satire of the second, even if "Dawn" is a bit overrated. "Day of the Dead" is just a huge disappointment, a crudely drawn, over-the-top and silly, stupid zombie flick that's no better than all the rip-offs that were made during the '70s and '80s.2.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Least of the Four Deads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead is entertaining and gory and violent, but it's more of a sit-down drama involving the study of these monsters that we've seen living humans blindly and instinctively fighting against in the Night and Dawn films. Instead of continuing the same basic non-stop action gorefest, Romero is original enough to take us through an analysis of the situation, unlike the Terminator films, any other slasher series, even the Lord of the Rings trilogy. All of the most interesting unexplained details are drawn out in this one. The problem is, the acting is very very bad, and there is not enough action like in Night and Dawn to deflect it. These clumsy, apprehensive actors are given the first 50 minutes of exposition time, where they have to barely make it through extensive scenes of dialogue.The film is not completely devoid of action or gore, like I disclaimed in my first sentence, but that only comes in the very climax. With this third installment in the beloved living dead trilogy, Romero is much more interested in psychological connections between humans and zombies, analyzing the inner psyche of a walking corpse, etc.I like how this series of films is spread out into one per decade, and fulfilling every characteristic of cinema in that particular decade. Night of the Living Dead was purely iconic new wave 1960s film-making, Dawn of the Dead was a celebration of every trait you can think of in glossy, tinsel 1970s cinema, and this one, Day of the Dead, plays up the soundtrack, the hairstyles, the speech, the special effects, and the cinematography of the 1980s. It's certainly the worst of the four living dead films, Land of the Dead being a nice improvement, but it's enjoyable enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, unneeded 2nd sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somebody must have been badly in need of money when they made DAY OF THE DEAD, the 2nd sequel to the 1968 classic, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Nothing much happens in this 1985 outing, and everyone sits around mostly just talking and arguing in an underground bunker. The reason to watch this unscary third and final film in George Romero's zombie trilogy (I will not count the recent LAND OF THE DEAD, an abomination if ever there was one) is to follow the antics of Bub, a zombie who is being trained by a mad scientist to act, well, human. Bub is terrific, aping human actions in his own unique way, although I personally prefer his more fearsome, metal-framed knockoff in RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3. Anyhow, my copy of DAY is a double-disc DiviMax version, so the picture and sound are great and there are lots of extra features to sift through. But it doesn't make the film any better, and it is no wonder that DAY failed miserably at the box office. Stick with NIGHT and DAWN -- the originals and not their remakes, by the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third and final installment in George Romero's Living Dead trilogy is surprising in that it comes so close to being a dismal, depressing close to one of the most famous horror film series' ever made. True, the movie sucks pretty badly and pretty consistently except for the last 20 minutes or so, but that last 20 minutes come on pretty strong to save the rest of the movie. Strife among characters has been a major element in the series since the beginning, but in Day of the Dead the characters are so antagonistic toward each other that the movie almost becomes unwatchable. We have gone from an uncomfortable group fighting a small but quickly growing hoard of zombies in Night of the Living Dead to a group of people who mostly get along except for a herd of bikers with an inexplicable urge to kill them in Dawn of the Dead to this, a bunch of military guys and some scientists in an underground bunker, so suspicious and angry at each other that there are fingers on triggers pointed at other living people throughout the majority of the movie. And here I was thinking that something that threatens the entire human race might tend to bring the remaining survivors together, regardless of their differences. If Independence Day taught me a single thing, I thought that was it. I could see, for example, Michael Moore and Dick Cheney desperately fighting for each other's survival if they were, like the people in Day of the Dead, outnumbered by walking cannibalistic zombies 400,000 to 1. Not this movie.Interestingly, the movie starts out really well and ends really well, kind of like a really good song often does. The opening of the movie is a brief but fascinating tour of the streets of a city taken over by the dead. Here was something a little strange that happened while I was watching it ? during this opening sequence, I was reminded of the description of the deserted Jerusalem's Lot in the beginning of Stephen King's novel ?Salem's Lot, which I am currently re-reading because it was mentioned at the end of Wolves of the Calla, the fifth installment in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. The ghost town of ?Salem's Lot is described as though it were suddenly deserted, even with a transaction rung up in a local store and $50 cash in the register, untouched. The town in Day of the Dead is overrun with garbage and rotting carcasses of cars, alligators for some reason roam free, and cash blows down the street like leaves. Later in the movie, a copy of ?Salem's Lot actually makes a cameo appearance. Weird!Anyway, the new things that happen in Day of the Dead (these things take their sweet time in emerging from the endless human bickering, by the way) deal mostly with the psychology of the zombies. For that reason, the vast majority of the movie is clinical and dull. The setting is an underground bunker, and we are forced to sit through scene after scene of a scientist conducting numerous tests on a captive zombie, which could be a pretty interesting character study (how often do you actually get this close to a gory horror movie villain?), except that the military guys are just down the hallway sulking and threatening to kill the hard-working doctor if he doesn't come up with some results and fast. I could see the captain getting mad at the scientist for suggesting an evolutionary link between humans and reptiles, but what else did he want the guy to do, sit around and mope with him and his buddies? The smartest thing this captain Rhodes ever does in the movie is call the doctor `Frankenstein,' although Rhodes probably doesn't even know he's right that Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is the doctor, not the monster.We find out eventually that the scientists big plan is to find some way to control the zombies, although the obvious obstacle is that this plan would require close and fairly extensive contact and treatment of millions of zombies to put them all under control. Not exactly a plan that lies within their power, but the doctor correctly concludes that the only way to win against the zombies is to make them behave. There are also some clever scenes that ponder about the role of God in this whole spectacle. One character speculates that God has risen the undead as a way to punish the human race for our sins, hinting to the audience that we better straighten out and live holy lives. What a message to get from a horror movie! But then, a couple minutes later, the assertion is made that the only way to make the zombies behave is to trick them into thinking there's some reward coming to them for good behavior, the way the rest of humanity has been tricked. So much for the God message?They exercise control over the zombies (one zombie, anyway) mostly through the use of classical conditioning, positive reinforcement, and attempts at model behavior (`How are we going to set an example for them if we behave barbarically ourselves?'), which results in a clever role for one of the zombies and the unexpected result that one of them becomes a protagonist. The caves at the end mark the beginning of the best portion of the movie. They're very effective atmospherically, despite the goofy, bright red haunted-house-ride lighting. The gore is largely absent from most of the middle of the movie, since this is the portion that's so preoccupied with the humans arguing with each other, but the gore at the beginning and at the end has improved massively from the last two movies. Some scenes were a little too realistic. Given recent events in the Middle East, I seem to have lost what little appetite I may ever have had for beheading scenes, and one such scene in the movie takes place while a man is screaming, his scream becoming more and more high-pitched as his vocal cords are stretched and severed. I'm only 25 and I think I'm too old for this.There is an interesting scene in which one of the characters is bitten on the arm by a zombie and they try to save him by cutting his arm off, supposedly before the zombie poison can get to the rest of his body and take him over. That was clever, I hadn't seen that in any of the other movies. This character, incidentally, is the one who ultimately goes on to make an `escape attempt,' which probably was the single event that saved the movie from the Oblivion of the Ridiculous, a realm populated by countless thousands of horror films. I won't go into details, but his attempt to escape is the moment that the movie starts getting good. Sadly, since there are only about 15 minutes left in the movie by this point, it doesn't have time to move in the right direction for very long. Ah well?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointing end to a great trilogy. The living dead have completely token over the earth and a few survivors seeks refuge in an underground military base, but find themselves falling apart. Some stylish set pieces (the opening sequence for example) and a great finale that delivers the goods, can not fully compensate for a slow moving, dull film. Attempts at characterization fall short, because the characters are just cliched. Attempts to also do what Dawn of the Dead did by making zombies scary, funny, and forgotten, but the magic just isn't there. Only other saving grace is an interesting, but underdevloped sub-plot about experiments on zombies.Unrated; Profanity and Extreme Graphic Violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite films, absolutely brilliant from start to finish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead starts as things look bleak for the few remaining human survivors hold up in a fourteen mile long underground silo, the Earth has now all but been taken over by flesh eating zombies as they outnumber the living 400,000 to 1. A team of civilian scientists look for answers, they look for cures, they look for a way to eradicate the zombie problem while the Military soldiers assigned to assist them grow ever more impatient. Tensions rise, the two groups have differing ideas &amp; the mission starts to fall apart as ammunition, food &amp; people start to run out. They are trapped, with millions of zombies outside waiting to eat them they must find a solution &amp; send them back to the grave for good...Written &amp; directed by George A. Romero &amp; following on from Night of the Living Dead (1968) &amp; Dawn of the Dead (1978) how would Romero approach Day of the Dead in order to equal or even better two of the greatest horror films of all time? Romero's original script was quite different, it's available on-line &amp; I have read it &amp; while it's not bad I am glad that it was this Day of the Dead that got made. Because the budget was slashed in half at the last minute when Romero refused to make an 'R' rated film he had to scale his vision &amp; script down although ultimately we will never know how that original script would have turned out if it had been made. I will just get on with it &amp; say it now, I love Day of the Dead &amp; I consider it one of the best horror films ever made. Period. Dawn of the Dead is also one of the best films ever made &amp; while that went for over-the-top comic book style action &amp; splatter (nothing wrong with that at all) Day of the Dead is a largely character driven film &amp; Romero's script is brilliant in that respect. Each character has a real edge, the dangerously near the edge Military soldiers including the hilariously foul mouthed Steele to their intense leader Captain Rhodes who just seems to explode with a terrifying rage to the sympathetic civilian scientists caught in the middle doing their best to the simply crazy Dr. Logan nicknamed Frankenstein who has just plain lost it. There are some instantly quotable lines of dialogue here, some of it's actually quite funny &amp; for me it was totally believable. Of course if your looking for splatter then Romero &amp; special make-up effects man Tom Savini don't disappoint with one gruesome blood soaked flesh ripping set-piece after another. Back in the late 80's when I was a young teen &amp; when Day of the Dead was released here in the UK on a horrible cut, murky 'so dark you can't see what's happening', pan &amp; scan VHS tape I got my mum to rent it for me &amp; I loved it back then for the extreme gore, top quality special effects &amp; filthy language, now I'm older &amp; hopefully wiser I can appreciate the superb script, the character's, the message about living for the moment &amp; the wonderful speech about keeping useless records &amp; statistics &amp; I can both admire &amp; enjoy the film on even more levels than just a simple blood bath. One of my favourite films of all time &amp; a film which I love even more every time I watch it.Director Romero does a good job here, personally I think Day of the Dead is his most accomplished film, I would probably say that the original Dawn of the Dead is the slightly better film but you really can't improve upon perfection can you? I love the opening sequence set in the deserted city (filmed at Fort Myers &amp; Sanibel Island in Florida) which soon fills up with hordes of the living dead, a wonderfully evocative start which sets the scene brilliantly in no time at all. Apparently Day of the Dead didn't do too well at the box-office, according to the IMDb it had a budget of $3,500,000 making $1,700,000 during it's first weekend &amp; ending up with $5,800,000 when it's theatrical run finished which surely means it made a profit? The gore scenes &amp; effects are superb, I would rate Day of the Dead as one of the goriest films ever made &amp; I have seen a lot of gory films. I once met Tom Savini at some convention &amp; asked him what was the make-up effect he was most proud of &amp; he said the Major Cooper corpse on the table in Logan's laboratory where it's a body with the face cut off &amp; the brain is just there twitching. I didn't argue with him, the effects are top notch.Technically the film is good, although the opening sequence was shot in Florida the majority of the rest of the film was shot in Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. Another aspect of Day of the Dead which I think is outstanding is the score by John Harrison, it's maybe my all time favourite horror film score. The acting is superb from a great cast, I am genuinely surprised more of the cast in this haven't gone to do more things.Day of the Dead is one of my all time favourite films &amp; it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that. Zombies, some serious gore, a fantastic script that's sometimes as bleak as the subject &amp; a cool soundtrack, what else can I say? Followed by the vastly inferior Land of the Dead (2005) &amp; Diary of the Dead (2007) while the recent Day of the Dead (2008) claims to be a remake but isn't except in name only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might Have Worked With A Better Script And Actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when 28 DAYS LATER came out a lot of die hard horror fans decried Danny Boyle's movie as a rip off from DAY OF THE DEAD . I did have some reservations about the second half of 28 DAYS LATER , namely some quite illogical plot holes but since I'd never seen George A Romero's movie I couldn't compare and contrast . I eventually saw it last night and could see where the critics are coming from . They are both very similar movies but my criticisms are slightly different DAY comes with the set up of a scientific team who are trying to analyse the zombies being stuck in an underground bunker alongside a military unit . There's no plot holes in this scenario unlike the ones 28 DAYS LATER suffered from since the characters have all known each other a considerable length of time . There's also no unlikely " rainbow coalition " of the military unit either , the soldiers led by Captain Rhodes are , with one notable exception , entirely white something that Boyle blundered with by casting several actors from different ethnic backgrounds in his movie which strained credibility somewhat since no British Army unit is that cosmopolitan . There is also a problem with Romero's casting and that is none of Rhodes men resemble soldiers , they all look too old and too fat . It's not helped by the fact that none of them could act their way out of a paper bag either I'm afraid that the more I think about it the more I realise that if you're watching a Romero movie you have to suffer the bad with the good and nearly always one of the worst aspects with a Romero movie is the totally poor acting . THE CRAZIES suffered with this and after seeing DAWN OF THE DEAD again I noticed how bad much of the cast were . DAY keeps up the tradition . The military unit were bad but we're also treated to an Irishman whose accent is anything but Irish and a Jamican who I'm certain has never been outside of New England . Oh and if you're casting a Latino it might be a good idea to cast someone who looks like he might be Latino . Just having characters calling him racist names perhaps isn't enough . The actor playing Salazar might have a Spanish sounding name but that's not enough in my view . Did anyone else think Eric Roberts should have been cast as Rhodes ? The story itself did have intriguing possibilities but the script doesn't make the most of them . In this sort of scenario we're reminded of Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS something 28 DAYS LATER utilised to much greater effect but here as many people have mentioned Romero seems far too interested in gore rather than intelligent story telling , and boy is this a gory film . I actually felt quite sick when the guts fell out of the zombie on the table and where Captain Rhodes met his end . I suppose Romero shouldn't be judged too harshly because in the mid 1980s gore was the primary selling point of a horror film but it is very frustrating watching DAY OF THE DEAD 20 years later , noticing so much potential in the story and noticing much of the potential has been wasted for the sake of stomach churning visual effects , and it's not like Romero isn't capable of better since DAWN OF THE DEAD featured incisive social commentary alongside splatter effects Before anyone asks I haven't seen LAND OF THE DEAD but there's no doubt in my mind that this is the weakest of the DEAD series . If you enjoyed any other of the movies in the franchise then I'm afraid you might be somewhat disappointed with this . I know I was</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third in the Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Dead (1985) ** (out of 4) Romero's third film in his (then) trilogy has a group of scientist and military personal held up in an underground bunker where they try and figure out the widespread zombie outbreak above them. Even after Land and Diary this remains my least favorite in Romero's zombie films but I must admit that I enjoyed it somewhat more on this viewing, which must have been my fourth or fifth. Thare are many, many flaws with this film but there's no denying that the special effects by Tom Savini are downright breathtaking. The biggest flaw with the film is the screenplay but I guess you can't blame Romero too much since this was a watered down version of his original idea. In case you haven't heard, the film was originally going to be a three-hour zombie film about the end of the world but the budget was cut and what we ended up with was only a fraction of what the director wanted. That's easy to see because when you watch the film you can't help but think there should be a lot more than what you're actually seeing. What I do blame Romero for are the characters here who I found rather weak. I didn't have that much of a problem with the scientists but I didn't care for any of the military men. I found them all to be rather childish, annoying and I just couldn't care for any of them. I'm sure Romero didn't want us liking them but making them so annoying was a major mistake in my opinion. The performances are a mixed bag but I thought Lori Cardille was good in the main and only female role. I also enjoyed Sherman Howard (Howard Sherman in the film) as Bub, the zombie who is being educated. Bub doesn't have any dialogue in the film but you can't help but feel he's the most all around character just with the facial gestures given to him by the actor. Joseph Pilato on the other hand gave a very weak performance. I have never been able to accept him in the role and to me he comes off as giving a weak Nicholson-like performance. The final twenty-minutes of the movie are downright brutal and rather breathtaking because of the masterful gore effects by Savini. I must say the zombies here do look better than in the previous two films and they certainly cause as much havoc. There are countless memorable scenes dealing with the gore but one of my favorites is when the zombie sits up from the table only to have his guts fall out. In the end this film is really a mixed bag but I still think there are more flaws than anything else.</fullReview>

Drunk, rude, very unprofessional army, and un logical doctor, and a 2 dimentional Jamacian character that is written not well. I could not relate with any of the character unlike dawn 78 or 04. What is with the 80's Miami vice feel to it. Maybe if they had Mike Thomas and D Johnson I would have like it more. Just some gross out effect it the end that did not look believable. Even more unbelievable is how the Zombies got in the bunker. I hate this film. When their is no room in hell the dead will be forced to watch this movie. Rent Isthar it's a better film. At least Isthar is scary even if that was not it's intention. 1/10.</fullReview>
