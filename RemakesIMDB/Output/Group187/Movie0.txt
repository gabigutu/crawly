		<shortDescription>Subtle chills....what's that???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, my goodness, am I disappointed. When I first heard news of a remake of Robert Wise's 1963 film, "The Haunting", I had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summer-movie sized visual effects. But, deep down, I had faith. Surely, with such a talented cast intact...De Bont and company will not ruin a film, who's original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the delicate art of subtlety. Well, subtlety, where are you now!!?? My fears have manifested...a promising movie has gone wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is jaw-dropping; the movie is wonderfully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never EVER do wrong. But, the script puts it's fine actors to the test..asking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies. In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity...and that's just barely. But, the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our imaginations, feel that horrible dread of fear of the unknown. No, we get some visual effects to SHOW US what we're supposed to be afraid of...and you know what? As wonderfully realized as they are...the visual effects come off as sort of silly. And the climax is a phantasmogoric mess...but things had gone terribly wrong long before that. Everything in The Haunting is overdone and overblown. I'm afraid there are no real thrills or creaks in this old haunted house monstrosity...only groans. Check out the original instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Darn Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For movie fans who have never heard of the book (Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House") and have never seen the 1963 Robert Wise production with Julie Harris, this remake will seem pretty darn bad.For those of us who have, it is just plain awful.Bad acting (what was Neeson thinking?), goofy computer enhancements, and a further move away from Jackson's story doom this remake.Do yourself a favor and rent the original movie. It still effectively scares without hokey special effects. The acting is professional and believable.For readers of the book, the from 1963 follows the it much closer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing could have saved The Haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting, if you have seen the original, you know a great ghost story, it's perfection on film. It's a haunting tale of 4 people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements, it terrified people. It still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film. So when The Haunting was remade in 1999, a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction "WHAT? WHY? WHAT THE?" But in my opinion if a remake is respectful enough and just wants to reinvent the story for the newer generation, I'm pretty cool with it. This is definitely not the case, this is just a disrespectful boring shame that will waste your time and I guarantee will deliver no scares? pfft! PG-13, what where they thinking? Not much apparently.When her mother dies and her sister evicts her, Nell receives a phone call, telling her about an ad for an insomnia study run by Doctor David Marrow at Hill House, a secluded manor. Upon arrival, Nell meets Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, a strange pair of caretakers who do not stay on the property after dark. Shortly thereafter, two other participants in the study arrive, wild Theo and "bad sleeper" Luke Sanderson along with Doctor Marrow. Unknown to the participants, Doctor Marrow's true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear. Each night, the caretakers chain the gate outside Hill House, preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning, when the caretakers open the lock. There are no working telephones inside Hill House and the nearest town is several miles away. Doctor Marrow revels the story of Hill House. The house was built by Hugh Crain, Crain built the house for his wife, hoping to fill it with a large family full of children, however all of Crain's children died during birth. Crain's wife killed herself before the house was finished, and Crain became a recluse. The first night, Theo and Nell begin to experience strange phenomenon within the house, including odd noises and inexplicable temperature changes. Nell is confronted after the main hallway is vandalized with the words "Welcome Home, Eleanor", and becomes extremely distraught, setting out to prove that the house is haunted by the souls of those victimized by Crain's cruelty. She learns that Crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him. He then burned the bodies in the house's fireplace to hide any evidence. She also learns that Crain had a second wife named Carolyn, of whom Nell is descended. Everyone thinks she's crazy while Nell is convinced this is where she belongs.Seriously, I suggest you stay away from this film, it's really stupid and pointless. Not to mention the actress the played Nell, Lili Taylor completely annoyed me, her performance, her look, just everything about her, don't get me started on things I would do just to not see her in film again. Catherine Zeta Jones just didn't fit in her role as well and Liam Neeson, a wonderful actor wasted talent once again. The effects are way over the top and too computerized, I just can't believe that they would trash a wonderful classic with this crud. Believe me, if you are going to be afraid of something, be afraid of seeing how you can turn a great ghost story into an annoying piece of overblown stupid?. Oh, this film is already hurting me, just don't see it, it's bad.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lackluster supernatural thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* and 1/2 stars out of ****The Haunting is actually a relatively decent film for the first 45 or so minutes. The setup is promising, the production design of the mansion is a sight to behold, and the cast seems to be enjoying themselves. It's unfortunate, however, because after that the film begins to fall apart, leading all the way to the ridiculously bad finale.Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) is conducting a test on fear, using the bait-and-switch method. By doing so, he's pretending to do a study on insomnia at the Crain estate, a manor 9 miles from the closest town. The "test subjects" that arrive include Eleanor (Lili Taylor), a hard-working woman who has had little success in life, Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an adventuress and proclaimed bi-sexual, and Luke (Owen Wilson), an all-around jokester.On the first night in the mansion, Eleanor and Theo hear thundering sounds in the walls, but pass it off as a problem in the plumbing. But events get even more bizarre, as Eleanor sees some sort of a figure inside the fireplace, that just as soon disappears. Slowly, Eleanor begins to believe that there are ghosts in the house, ghosts of dead children and the owner of the mansion himself, the evil Hugh Crain. She also makes a discover about her connection with the mansion that could help free the children's spirits.The Haunting never features one scary moment. Rather than going for subtle chills or all-out shocks like in House on Haunted Hill, Jan De Bont prefers to rely everything on the special effects, which really are rather unconvincing, particularly the statues that come to life and the CGI ghosts.It even manages to get worse. Now, to be fair, the film was getting dull by the 90-minute mark so I was initially entertained by the effects-filled finale. But everything gets positively ridiculous in the last ten minutes, as we find out evil ghosts like to play hide-and-seek and smash things up real good.The blame should fall on director Jan De Bont and writer David Self. De Bont seems to care more about what special effect to use next to "wow" the audience rather than actually trying anything innovative. Self really can't seem to write a good story or truly interesting characters. The dialogue is perhaps the worse of his writing skills.The only thing that keeps this film from a lower rating is the cast, and they do their best to keep the film respectable. Liam Neeson probably delivers the best performance, being neither as dull or unemotional as critics thought. Catherine Zeta-Jones shows a lot of life as Theo, as does Owen Wilson. It's a pity that Lili Taylor's performance, which was decent at first, turned to borderline camp by the finale.With nary a true scare in sight, The Haunting should best be seen by those who are scared easily or special effects fans. For everybody else, this is probably a house not to spend the night at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, but could've been creepier.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house, good effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you. What I wish could've happened is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror. The ending was for me, a little anticlimactic. Overall, I enjoyed it. The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. I just wish it scared me more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have too much of a hope I would like this new Jan De Bont film, but after giving it a go today, I was impressed. De Bont is a terrific creator of suspense and camera setups. All his hard work as a cinematographer paid off in movies such as these. He really knows how to build up an atmosphere accompanied by subtle visual effects and sound design. The way that big house groans and 'breathes' just makes my heart beat faster. Equally great is Jerry Goldsmith's score. In some scenes when combined with the atmospheric sound effects it made my neckhair stand up. I was genuinely terrified. A special mention must go to the art direction and set decoration. The house has such wonderful and at the same time disturbing architecture, the thought of having to spend a night there gives me the chills. About the acting, I thought it was nothing special. The Haunting is a solely audiovisual experience, where acting is only of secondary importance. In short, I enjoyed this movie and didn't think the ending was bad. I see about 200-300 movies each year, and I see a lot of bad ones, but this is not one of them. Go see it and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Like Hammer Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie. I have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 Haunting as well as most of the Hammer films. This film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it. Yet many viewers can accept out of control films like Scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts. Actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great. I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense. The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring. Perhaps this film might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure. The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963. It was even more scary. See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than it's score would suggest although not without faults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the sixties classic of the same name has unfortunately been somewhat slated by critics, although I feel it's better than most people seem to think it is.The location work is stunning and the set design has clearly had a lot of work put into it.Liam Neeson, Owen Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones all perform their parts quite well, but Lili Taylor is not as good as she should be. On paper she should be perfect for the role of Nell and for much of the film she provokes the necessary sympathy. She seems unable, however, to scream properly, instead letting what sounds like an animal cry. Also, she seems to say "Oh No" in exactly the same tone of voice every time she sees something frightening, although to be fair this is as much the fault of the script as it is hers.Towards the end the atmosphere is slightly diluted by such things as having the beds and statues spring to life which makes these scenes much less frightening than they could be.In spite of all this, this movie has a certain something that regardless of it's faults, makes me want to watch it again and again, and ultimately you can't ask much more from a film than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildly entertaining big budget horror, nothing special but not too bad either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting starts with Eleanor Vance, Nell for short, receiving a phone call telling her to take a look at an advert in a paper. An advert which is seeking people who suffer from sleeping disorders to take part in some research conducted by Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) as well as paying $900 a week she gets a roof over her head for free. Since Nell has just been chucked out of her flat &amp; has no money this doesn't sound such a bad idea &amp; gives Marrow a call. Nell is instructed to go to a huge Gothic cross between a castle &amp; stately home 'Hill House' which in reality is called Harlaxton Manor &amp; is located in England, once there she meets up with another test subject named Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), they talk about Theo's fetching thigh high boots for a bit &amp; explore the House &amp; eventually stumble upon the third &amp; final volunteer, Luke Sanderson (Owen Wilson). Then as if by magic Dr. Marrow himself makes an appearance along with a couple of assistants, Mary Lambetta (Alix Koromzay) &amp; Todd Hackett (Todd Field). That night Mary suffers an accident &amp; is taken to the hospital by Todd &amp; strange things begin to happen, banging at doors, whispering noises &amp; an overall feeling of unease. The house seems to be effecting Nell more than anyone else, it seems to be trying to tell her something, something about it's dark past that Nell can perhaps put right but there are evil forces at work that don't like house-guests...The big, no wait sorry at $80,000,000 massive budget remake of The Haunting (1963) was co-executive produced , along with an uncredited Steven Spielberg, &amp; directed by Jan de Bont &amp; I actually found it a reasonably entertaining way to pass an hour &amp; fifty odd minutes. The script credited to David Self based on the novel 'The Haunting of Hill House' by Shirley Jackson had a re-write done on it by script doctor Michael Tolkin &amp; maybe the reason it's a bit of a lightweight mess is because two separate writers worked on it at different times, maybe. The characters are dull &amp; unoriginal with virtually no development at all, I didn't care about anyone except Zeta-Jones &amp; even then only because she's a bit of a looker... The ghost story itself is weak, big bad ghost wants to kill everyone &amp; generally be evil while one character has a sort of sixth sense to know what's going on while the others don't. It's all rather predictable, yawn. The Haunting is at it's best at the beginning when it relies on noises, spooky goings on &amp; an air of mystery but unfortunately The Haunting then descends into a succession of CGI ghosts &amp; special effects which are not scary in the slightest, from this point it's downhill all the way to the obligatory happy ending. On a positive note it moves along at a fair pace, it has a few decent sequences &amp; it kept me entertained for it's duration. The one area where The Haunting does excel is with it's production design credited to Eugenio Zanetti which is both a wonderful asset but at the same time a problem. While the film undeniably looks sumptuous with some truly fantastic &amp; grandiose sets which create a certain atmosphere I couldn't stop thinking that this was indeed a film I was watching, something very man-made, it all looks very fake &amp; overblown. Technically The Haunting is top-notch &amp; very polished throughout. There is no violence or gore besides a quick bloodless decapitation, this is family friendly horror all the way. The acting is pretty bad by all involved, Neeson looks embarrassed, Wilson is a crap actor whatever he's in &amp; The Haunting's only saving grace is the delicious Zeta-Jones &amp; her thigh high boots... The Haunting is a passable time waster of a film, there's nothing deep or meaningful here but it kept me quiet for a couple of hours. Everyone seems to hate it but I think it's just about worth a watch, definitely not the worst horror film I've seen but definitely not the best either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a touch on the Robert Wise classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the original film version of 'The Haunting" is in my top ten films of all time' I approached this adaption with trepidation. I was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh, all those involved should be ashamed. the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason! you see nothing. Robert Wise used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work's. The shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B, sadder still is that the ingredients were there (actors such as Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different. This film should only watched as an example of studio butchery!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of a truly horrifying and nightmare inducing 1963 film of the same name. Why Hollywood thinks that digital effects and campy acting is better than the imagination is beyond me. This film is so full of digital effects (none of which look real) and overacting that it cannot compare to the original film which starred Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. This film is just plain stupid. The original (in black and white) is still the scariest film I've ever seen (and I've seen them all). The original makes you use your imagination to fear the unseen - this remake doesn't allow you to do that and that is its biggest mistake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting. A remake, of course. The original was a creepy psychological thriller, and one that has improved with time. Compared to this 1999 remake, it's a classic. There is no character development here, only caricatures (the slut, the authoritative brain, the "I'm gonna get us outta here" fellow, the oh so sensitive bookworm). But, seeing as how the were banking on the special effects being the "star", I guess characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern. Unfortunately, the effects are laughable. Mewing cherubs, stretchy doors, irritating dead children that can't speak plainly ... and an idiotically sappy ending that does it's darnedest to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainbows. Ill take my Skittles orally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I've liked you since "The Cowboys". Stop it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor remake of a classic chiller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well, then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects. For example, in the original, one of the most chilling moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying side by side in twin beds, listening in terror to the noises outside their room. Nell tells Theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her. Nell then looks across at Theo, who is several feet away and realises that it was not Theo holding her hand. In the latest version, Nell is lying alone in bed, when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor. It is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened. And can anybody explain what Nell's final words mean - "It's about family. It's always been about family"?The one redeeming feature is Lili Taylor's performance, but even this cannot save the film. Catherine Zeta-Jones demonstrates once again that, beneath her pretty exterior, there is little depth. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion. Zeta-Jones, however has to spell it out, for example, by asking Nell if she has a boyfriend - or girlfriend.Definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful and frightening terror movie about a haunted mansion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a remake to long deemed one of the masterly crafted stories of horror ever brought to the screen ¨Haunting¨(1963) by Robert Wise , a gripping film which still packs a punch . Hill House is a hundred-year-old haunted mansion , it is the setting for chosen group . The haunted house has an evil history with tragic accidents, suicide, and human misjudgement. It seems which the scary mansion has been the place of several killing deaths . A psychologist scientist (Liam Neeson) is a Pyschic researcher who assembles a group with histories linked to the paranormal. As three people are lured to an eerie mansion deceived for fake pretenses realized by a psychological researcher . Nell (Lili Taylor) was the subject of unexplained poltergeist activities as a child. She also is riddled with pain over her mother's death. Theo (Catherine Zeta Jones) is a clairvoyant who befriends Nell at Hill House. Owen Wilson plays a cynical and Bon Vivant sent to make sure that the property is not affected by the researchers. Together the group explore Hill House and their own insecurities and finally face off the evil that inhabits with hair-raising results .Mindless and average film is packed with thrills, intrigue, suspense, horror and lots of interminable screams with no sense. However , this is an inferior version that relies heavily on the impressive special effects courtesy of ILM - Industrial Light Magic- , George Lucas owner . High budget makes for big scary scream-feast and frights . Splendid Lili Taylor as a fragile , lovely youth who results to have unexpected ties to the creepy ghost , she's the only redeeming feature of this uneven movie. Supposedly based on Shirley Jackson's creepy tale titled ¨The haunting of Hill House¨, it has little in common with the novel . Stirring and exciting musical score fitting to terror by the veteran maestro Jerry Goldsmith . Very good and colorful cinematography by Karl Walter Lindellaub . Director Jan De Bont created a taut drama where the real question is who is haunted and who may be unstable.The picture is middling realized in his third-time as director by Jan De Bont, a successful cameraman (Basic Instict, Die Hard) and Paul Verhoveen's ordinary photographer and occasionally director (Speed , Twister). The film will appeal to Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta Jones fans. This is a chilling adaptation from Shirley Jackson's novel based on an assortment of ghouls and ghosts and gets a mediocre rating . It turns out to be a chiller with all the FX budget can be created , being lavishly produced ,but also contains several scenes in little sense and no logic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One would like movies like these to be scary, or at least chilling, but de Bont's Haunting is just plain stupid. The house and settings are great to look at but most of the effort on making the film has gone into over-the-top computer generated effects and zombie looking actors, while the script makes no sense at all. How much fun is it to watch Lili Taylor walking around talking to herself in order to help the audience understand what is happening on screen? Unintentionally funny moments include Mr Crain's incredibly bad make up and Owen Wilson not being able to climb over a closed gate. In short, stay away from Hill House.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best and beautiful horror films that I've seen and I'm sure others have one way or another retained the images that are so eerie yet majestic in a sense because of one, we have this marvelous setting, the elaborately mystical house to begin with ...and because of careful direction along with characters that are goodness, not stoned as prevalent in today's standards, there is a genuine and yes, scary feeling you could walk away from when watching the film. The elements of the house and the characters are in perfect symbiosis...you keep your eyes open because the perspective of every character that enters in each floor and room are in a way, extensions of each other...what a classic way of enjoying films that don't rely on convoluted plots and/or reading the psyche of the enemy as if its mind is stretched to a 100 ft. deep. Nothing is far too complicated here and it makes for a pleasurable experience. It's an awe to watch the scenes unfold in this film...the images are hidden dialogues for themselves and this saves the audience from over-analyzing things. If you want to get spooked anytime of the day on the pleasure of your simple couch and TV, I think The Haunting works....and the wonderful thing is that after, you can go about doing your normal things. The 'haunting' starts and stops when the movie's finished. Simple!</fullReview>

I think this movie was well performed, and it really gave me chills every second. The children's statue and the special effects were pretty unique. We can also observe how every character shown their different personalities, and they try to fight against the evil spirit or get defeated by it.

Anywhoo, the people laugh, joke etc. This Dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids. They get scared, they start to feel stuff. Oh no, a girl see's s ghost. Some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc. This girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls, yeah yeah, blah blah. She does but, oh no, she dies as she does. And goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape the house. The script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and Elanor (the one who dies saving the kids) says "oh no". The acting is wooden, the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again. Basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it, but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss. I was extremely disappointed when I watched this. A very big let down. My sister (who gets sacred very easily) got bored in this film it is appalling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hauntingly Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting is yet another bad horror remake with phony overdone special effects and a big cast of on screen favorites and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever except maybe for the cinematography.Yes remakes aren't all bad but remakes directed by Jion Da Bont definitely are.I suppose that the A-List actors (Liam Neeson,Catherine Zeta Jones,Owen Wilson)are there to distract us from the boring plot,ridiculous special effects, and terrible attempts at scaring it's audience however this is a movie not a tabloid magazine we don't care whose in it we care about the characters and story two things this film missed.The storyline is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and ripping out four chapters and then using whatever's left for the film it is so boring and a lot of it is unexplained.The characters are pretty thin and while the acting is good you don't really care about any of the characters at all.Lily Taylor gives a horrendous performance and sounds like she's 8 years old when delivering her lines not to mention what a horrible screamer she is.Lily Taylor isn't made for the horror genre at all.The ghosts are stupid and cheesy, they look like a bunch of Casper The Friendly Ghost's and the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim reaper for Halloween with a smoke machine.There is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and it's not even funny unintentionally just plain sad.The house is pretty and well designed that is probably the only positive thing about this movie it looks nice but that doesn't save it from it's brutal everything else.I can honestly say i felt like i was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV for no price so I would've been even more pi$$ed if I had paid to see it but luckily it was on Scream Channel.Overall The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a poor attempt at horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both deep and scary as Hell - but suffers from the comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big disadvantage with a remake, is the fact that one always compares it with the original. For this reason, I think the movie-makers should stop making remakes, and try to find some fresh new stories instead. All the fantastic special effects in this film, for instance, should have made a perfect horror movie somewhere else. But now, I could just think that they are trying to compensate for the perfect psychology and understated creeping horror in the original, by throwing in a lot of expensive technology instead.They also missed one important thing in this film: Eleanor should have been attracted to one of the men, and the other woman, who was beautiful and self-assured, should have stolen him in front of her eyes. For this was an important psychological turn-point in the original: Eleanor realized once and for all, that she had no hope of love, family or belonging in the world outside... And why should the other woman be bisexual, suddenly? - that did not add anything meaningful to the story.However, in both movies I find the basic story very sad, convincing and realistic. I think many lonely women - "old maids" - can relate to it. In reality, they often turn to religion to find communion with both the parish and the supernatural beings (God, Jesus, angels...) - that do not demand beauty, style, charm or social skills, but are there for everyone.In this story, it is only more extreme. Eleanor is so lonely and unhappy, that she is not even afraid of ghosts manifesting themselves anymore. Because she sees them as as a possibility of company, family at last! And she sacrifices her mortal life entirely, to become one of the ghosts in the haunted mansion (in the original), which is the only place where she ever feels that she has _belonged_, or sets them free and follows them to heaven (in this remake).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best special FX ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the other reviews it hardly seems necessary to go into vast detail about what the film is actually about. But it certainly uses superb special effects to give it a very supernatural atmosphere. I grant you that it does rob you of the use of your imagination by showing you exactly what's happening, but what's happening is hardly boring, so I don't know why so many people are complaining about it. And don't even think of criticising the ending, when practically every horror movie ever made turns out like this. By that I mean the source of the all terror is finally revealed, and all the scariness suddenly disappears. Don't you think there's a reason for that, so that the movie can end on a more pleasant note, and we're not all lying awake at night, too terrified to go to sleep?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this when I was 11, and liked it. Granted I didn't sleep with my feet over the bedside for a while. After watching it again tonight, I realize that I still like it. There is symbolism in having a 'no-name' actress play the main character. It goes with the character. The effects were fun, and very much my style of creepy, suspense, and just plain disturbing. And for being made in 1999, The Haunting is very well done. You clearly see the fear in the characters as they try to figure out what was going on, and the change that happens in the main character is very subtle and empathetic to a receptive audience. I don't watch horror/suspense movies because I am very empathetic and remember details, but this is a movie even for 'chicken' audiences. I recommend this movie if you prefer suspense and thriller with dignity over gore, blood, and screaming college students. ^~^</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Shirley Jackson becomes Scooby-Doo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The setup was creepy, the cast interesting, production values remarkable. Too bad director Jan De Bont is to horror what garlic is to vampires.An adaptation in name and general premise only, the movie has doctor Marrow (Liam Neeson) invite patients Nell (Lily Taylor), Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson) - plus other two who leave after a minute - to Hill House, a sinister isolated mansion, for a psychological study about fear. It soon becomes clear the house is haunted and the group in danger."Some house are born bad", recites the ominous tagline; to this I may add "and so are some movies". De Bont, who did a competent job with a fast-paced action movie like Speed, is unable to craft a sinister atmosphere, relying instead on the patented "whispering children" shtick and on cheesy CGI ghosts. Too bad, because the set for Hill House is an appropriately tasteless, unsettling Gothic manor. Acting is bland. Even a magnetic actor like Neeson looks bored; Taylor starts well enough as vulnerable Nell but then lapses into histrionics. Others aren't given much to do, with Wilson as the comic relief and Zeta-Jones as the eye candy (sadly, no Entrapment-like tight jumpsuits here).The Haunting has plot holes so big you could drive a truck through them, a sign of blatant disrespect towards the audience. It's funny how the survivors, at the end, don't bother to mention to the returning caretakers that THERE IS A BEHEADED CORPSE IN THE CHIMNEY. I guess they are in for a rather unpleasant surprise - just like viewers.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this remake of the 1963 excellent predecessor does not offer much new to the good old proven concept of scary tale, but it's well made and entertaining - although personally i tend to lose interest gradually once the eerie innuendos are over and the action has begun.and that is the case with the haunting also. although you generally know what's lurking behind corners, you hope it's not coming out just yet. after it does, the movie loses it's grip. and i'm not just talking about the haunting, but most of the scary movies out there. those visual elements and animations are nice but always overused. when the big wheel starts to turn there's no stopping it and that is really exhausting!actors are good although liam neeson doesn't seem to get carried away with the script. actually he seems quite uninterested throughout the movie (or maybe it's just the "sceptical, cool scientist" act). and catherine zeta-jones offers her natural charm again - she really has that star quality, but not the neurotic and complex diva-kind, more of a "i'm self-confident and gorgeous and i don't have to pretend anything"-kind. there's nothing extraordinary about her work, but she totally seems to lack mannerism and boring self-awareness!</fullReview>

Guess they had some CGI money left after making Start Wars (excuse me) Star Wars, so they remade "The Haunting" with extra-special special effects. Shirley Jackson wrote this, her last complete novel, about 40 years ago. If they don't watch out, she's going to rise from the grave and come back to haunt them. And she'd be just the one to do it, too. Now there's a "haunting" I'd love to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a horror film, I think its a descent watch compared to many out there. Its a good watch to have one night for sure. Its different from most horror films because it basically deals with spirits and a haunted house. I would say this haunted house really did have a good way to grab the attention of the fans. So as far as directing the house to appear as an identity, I would say it goes as far as hitting farther than Amityville Horror. You could definitely feel the house. I was actually surprised to see the rating of the film. First of all, there isn't anything in this film that makes it BAD. To rate it a one, shows how terrible a lot of IMDb users are, who simply don't like something and put ones. I hardly ever give out a ten or a one because its an obvious ridiculousness. Okay, but what prevents this movie from being a big hit you ask? I would stress the acting as well as the plot are relatively underdeveloped. I think this is different from saying there is not plot or they didn't play out the plot very well. They invented a plot... and I'm just not sure many audiences can relate to it. Its an interesting plot but it doesn't really make you think you could be in a scenario like that. Part of scary movies and there suspense is that imaginative element that makes one play with an alternate universe where you could be in it. Instead, the scenario for these characters are not ones that anyone of us would like or even imagine ourselves in. As such, the protagonist and the actors aren't able to give that WOW factor. Mind you, it does have a creepy sense to it, but just doesn't hit it out of the park. I also question the use of Hansel from Derek Zoolander in this film. I actually think he made the movie less scary. All in all, if you haven't seen this yet, I say go for a watch. It will creep you out, and could give you the chills.</fullReview>

Creepy statues move on their own, Ghostly figures and faces are seen everywhere! Its like a supernatural roller-coaster ride! I don't understand everybody's complaints! Sure, sometimes less is enough but sometimes I just wish to see all those ghastly apparitions.. The music and setting of the movie is eerie, and it captures that kind off Speilbergish feeling which made Poltergeist so haunting. Sure some of the Cgi is dated now but still effective. So I give this one a solid 8/10 perfect if You like eerie ghost story's. I like the original too, but just bending and slamming doors makes it feel kind off like a disappointment..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shirley Jackson novel 'The Haunting of Hill House' is an atmospheric tale of terror, which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion. The atmosphere is well set out, and the chills are staged well. A haunting masterpiece.The 1963 chiller 'The Haunting' stays closely to the book, but also adds its own details to the plot. Fortunately, these are very few, and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen. The black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie. Excellent! And then, Jan de Bont made this. In 1999, the remake of The Haunting hit the cinemas - if you could call this a remake. Why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself, but for the moment, lets look at the film itself.It starts off averagely, as most horror movies do. The set used for Hill House is beautiful, and oddly mysterious, and for a few minutes, it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair re-telling. And then, the first scare comes: a loose harpsichord wire slashes a woman's face (Dr. Marrow's assistant). This is hilarious, and truth be told, it nearly had me in tears.From then on, the film just spirals downwards. The acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on, with Owen Wilson's character being particularly irritating (so it's such a relief when he's decapitated by the flue).The special effects practically make this movie,, which is a shame, because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated. Examples of these are many, so I won't bother listing them.So, all in all, I, along with hundreds of others, strongly recommend that you watch the original chiller, or, as an alternative, buy the novel by Shirley Jackson. But please, stay away from this. And, if you do decide to watch this, watch it on the TV (as a lot of the channels love to screen this film, and not the original) or rent it cheap, but please don't buy it, whatever you do. Don't waste your money!Final rating: 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of insomniacs do their best to put viewers to sleep in 'The Haunting', a truly disappointing attempt at a horror film. Eleanor (or Nell) lives a boring life and has for years, taking care of her ill mother. Now that the mother has passed away, she's having trouble sleeping so when she see's an ad for a sleep study on insomniacs, she jumps at the opportunity. She and two others (along with the head of the study) have to spend a few days inside a creepy old mansion in which it's deceased owner (Hugh Crane) was a sadistic creepy guy who loved children. Each night some strange stuff happens; loud noises, ghosts climbing into bed with Nell, that sort of stuff. The group discovers the secret behind Crane and the children who died there, leading to an odd ending in which Nell feels compelled to stay in the haunted house forever.'The Haunting' has got to be the most non scary horror film out there, when it really shouldn't be. It had a huge budget, a large creepy old house, a decent story had it been told better... but at the end of the day is just not scary or even remotely terrifying at all. The "scares" are few and far between, and when a ghost does appear they aren't eerie to watch. Most of the ghosts are the dead children from years ago, but they are nice ghosts and try to help Nell. The main villain Hugh Crane is not scary or intimidating at all, even when he finally appears it falls so flat. And one of the most disappointing things about this remake is that it does not use the huge mansion to it's advantage. The noises that we hear late at night are not well done at all, and the actors do not react in an appropriate way to the "scares".I thought Lili Taylor put in a very weak performance as the lead Eleanor. Some of the acting choices she made during the "scary" moments feel flat and felt forced from on her part. Liam Neeson hammed it up for the cameras and seemed out of place in this. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luke Wilson however did good jobs in the supporting roles. Overall 'The Haunting' remake is a failure. Stick to the original 1962 film, it was much better.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would suggest that before you see this film, watch the original version. Then don't watch this one. The original Haunting is one of the very best of the genre, with a cast that effectively fits the story. This version ends up being an incompetent parody, neither scary nor funny. This remake dumbs down the story seemingly to target 8 year-olds. It relies on artificial special effects rather than good acting. The cast does not fit the story, indeed the cast seems like a random selection of mostly comedic stage personalities, not chosen for their acting ability, Liam Neeson notwithstanding. With all due respect to people who like this version, I was offended by it.As with too many other films such as Cat People and Diabolique, the modern remake is a feeble imitation that distills and dilutes the story down to fetid bilge water.</fullReview>

But why not rent it I thought and thank heavens I did. Maybe its the way about changing the feeling of the original The Haunting into a festival of special effects that puts this film in a bad light but saying that the film doesn't scare you is just not true. My neckhair was standing more up than I had to breathe. Jan De Bont just gives the film the right touch with his energetic way of creating the ultimate effect. The Haunting is in that opinion a cracker of a movie because everything you expect comes forward in a believable and scary way. The actors do their best and the one is better than the other but what I liked the most was the way the camera showed the house as a haunted and scary place where not one person would dare to live. Jerry Goldsmith brings as always the perfect soundtrack with excellent tones to frighten us. Jan De Bont has given us more than a horrorride, the thrill of being scared at any time just gives you goosebumps. But anyway, the film is not that bad, on the contrary. It's scary and fun put together by the most amazing special effects.</fullReview>

I was disappointed to a certain extent- because it just was not at all scary. it looked like it might be, and the haunting of Hill House certainly is a very creepy novel- but this film is just special effects wizardry and thats about all. It has a great cast, particularly Taylor, Neeson and Zeta-Jones, but they really do play second fiddle to the special effects. The set design really is magnificent, but the story is fairly average and the characters are unfortunately a little underdeveloped. By the end I was bit bored with the 'creepy house', because it just was not 'creepy' enough. Some of the lines were so laughable it could have been mistaken for a comedy. Visually stunning for a while, but when you run out of things to look at- there is nothing else of interest.</fullReview>

Theres NO blood and guts...NO slasher in a mask.... and that seems to be a lot of people's complaints........................"not as good as "Halloween"... If you liked the original, imagine a version of the story with special effects worthy of Ray Harryhausen. The sets are extremely massive and exotic. Attention to detail is more intricate than the eye can take in. Visually, the film is a treat, and the soundtrack is terrific. Anyone who has seen the original will have to admit that the "spiral staircase" scene is a big improvement over the '63 version. I think the people who claim they weren't scared, are too guarded AND jaded to BE scared. If a good ghost story is your cup of tea, make some popcorn, turn down the lights, and hold on tight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like The Haunting, I really did. It's been a long time since I've seen a good spooky movie about ghosts and haunted houses. Most of the horror fare that's been released in the last several years seems to revolve around alien monsters that have a penchant for disemboweling or beheading hapless humans. The last good scary movie I saw of this sort was Aliens. So I was really looking forward to The Haunting. The cast looked pretty good. I'm not Liam Neeson's biggest fan, but I can think of worse actors to cast in role like this. This film showed a lot of potential. The story is intriguing, and the lead character, Eleanor Lance, played by Lili Taylor is very likable. I found myself more interested in seeing the story revolving around Eleanor (or Nell, as she prefers to be called) unfold than the plot that brings the characters to Hill House in the first place. The story goes something like this: Psychologist Dr. Jeffrey Marrow (Neeson) decides to gather a group of folks suffering from insomnia at Hill House under the pretense of curing their sleep disorders. In reality, he's bringing his subjects in to study the phenomenon of group fear. Thus, he's using this creepy old house to scare the folks. This brings us to the first problem with the film: Marrow's group consists of a mere three subjects. Two folks accompanying the group exit very early after a freak accident injures Marrow's assistant, who, unfortunately, of all the people present, seemed to be the most genuinely afraid. I still wonder whether or not the accident was real or whether it was part of Marrow's plan to spook his subjects. He seemed rather unfazed by the incident. There are several events like this that occur in the film, and it's often difficult, if not impossible, to discern whether or not they're a part of the Marrow's experiment. Director Jan de Bont could've used this ambiguity to his advantage to create scary situations, but he doesn't. When Eleanor and fellow insomniac Theo, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones arrive at the mansion, Mrs. Dudley (Marian Seldes), one of the caretakers of Hill House, states that she and her husband, played by Bruce Dern, don't stay overnight. They leave ? before it gets dark. They never stay ? after it gets dark. The whole thing is overplayed, and Eleanor even mocks Mrs. Dudley's spiel as she's delivering it to Theo. I was sure that this melodrama was part of the instructions given to the Dudleys by Dr. Marrow, but, honestly, I can't be sure. The characters don't take it seriously, and since the whole purpose of it would have been to set them on edge, it fails miserably. Thus, it fails miserably on two levels: It fails to spook the characters, and it fails to do anything more than amuse the audience. Owen Wilson, who plays insomniac Luke Sannerson, provides the comic relief in the film. He has quite a few truly funny lines. I found his character to be one of the truly enjoyable aspects of the film. His character reminded me a great deal of Hudson in Aliens. Maybe they should've cast Bill Paxton in this film somewhere. The best scary scene in the movie comes when Nell hears strange noises and jumps out of bed to investigate. Nell's problem you see is that she had so much of her life caring for her recently deceased mother that she's still awakened in the middle of the night by the sound of her mother rapping on the wall with her cane. So when she hears the cane knocking on the wall in Hill House, she reflexively jumps out of bed and says, `Coming, Mother.' This was the one spooky moment in the whole film, because we all know it's not her mother. The question is, is it Marrow's doing or ghosts? I suppose it doesn't really matter, but this is a part of the story that's completely ignored. Nell's story is the focus, and rightly so, unfortunately, it falls on its face after showing some early promise. Which brings us to the real problem with the movie-plot elements are far too often revealed in flourishes. I won't divulge any secrets, lest you decide to subject yourselves to the film, but instead of feeding the audience key bits of information a piece at a time, some elements are pulled abruptly from behind a curtain. I'm reminded of the scene from Independence Day in which the President states, after having had psychic contact with the aliens, `I could sense its thoughts. I know what they're planning to do.' I could probably have forgiven the overblown effects if the story had been handled better. If you want to see digital wizardry used more effectively to create scary situations and images, look at The Frighteners, a film that was not outstanding, but was certainly better than The Haunting. The special effects, like many other elements designed to scare us, were a horribly overdone. The house itself is overdone. The architecture, the elaborate mantle carvings, the columns, the huge doors, all of it is hyperbole. The most effective horror films are much more subtle than The Haunting. And the end of the film is the worst offender. De Bont decided to rely on big-budget, overblown special effects in attempt to bring this film to a shattering climax. What he actually accomplished was send the audience a clear signal in the form of a digital crescendo that their suffering was nearly over. All subtlety in films is gone. I think one of Eleanor's lines offers the best summation for this film. As she walks toward a door behind which she hopes to find the answers to the mystery of Hill House, she covers her nose and states, `What's that smell?' Alas, it's this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lili Taylor is reason enough to love this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lili Taylor is terrific. She's many times more beautiful and interesting than Zeta-Jones. Bruce Dern's the only other actor here who seems more than cardboard. Too bad he didn't have a bigger part. This has been on TV several times and it's top notch by TV standards. It's entertaining, and one of the few films I've enjoyed watching more than once. If you found "The Others" a total bore, as I did, you might try this film instead. Beautifully filmed and with great special effects. I tire of films being attacked because they don't measure up to expectations based on an earlier version, or the book, so judge this by what it is, not what it isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting is one of the best horror films I have seen in quite a while. Its not so much a scary movie but a suspenseful supernatural drama horror movie. The Haunting is sadly underrated and with a score of 4.7/10 when I did this review its quite sad. The movie doesn't pile on the gore like in most other horror movies and instead there are more screams and a sense of a ghostly presence.The Haunting should have been nominated for at least one oscar but poor reviews from the critics and people made it poor for some people. It may have been a box office smash in both the uk and the usa but its not no Carrie or The Exorcist (which are both crap). 10/10 If you like The Haunting try: House on Haunted Hill, The Others, The Haunting (1967), Scary Movie 2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely the best movie ever done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To all horror movie lovers, to see a couple of times, attentionaly and bearing in mind that some bad reviews must not influence the final appreciation of a fantastic movie.The Best: The actors, the special effects, sound, art direction, sceneries, photography, directing, the majority of the script, after all : THE MOVIEThe Worst: Saying nothing would be stretching things too much, but my only complaint goes to the non inclusion of images of the house's past: construction, deaths? and probably if there were more characters trapped in the house would be interesting.As almost everyone should know this movie was based upon the novel by Shirley Jackson ?The Haunting Of Hill House', and the following 1963 Robert Wise's movie with the same title. The first movie was very faithful to the book and this one was just based on it. So, for those who compared both movies really don't have a point for it, as the only thing in common are some common places, character names and plot scenes. Back in 1963, Robert Wise, director of West Side Story propose us a visit to hill house resulting in one of the scariest horror movies driven and acted well by someone who knows what is doing. Three and a half decades later, Jan De Bont, director of the fantastic box office hits, Twister and Speed offer us another visit to Shirley Jackson frightening manor, this time with frankly terrific results. Both movies are good and scary, but Jan De Bont's is incomparably better.For more than one century that the frightful and sinister Hill House stands alone and abandoned? or so it seems. Intrigued by the house's storied past, Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) draws some people to the house Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Nell (Lili Taylor), Luke (Owen Wilson), for an apparently innocent experience. But since the moment of her arrival, Nell seems frightenly mutual. As soon as it begins to get dark, the study about fear is horrifically abandoned as the people discover the haunting secrets that fill hill house. This secrets are allusive to the house's owner Hugh Crain and the house's construction. At first they believe that the story is some kind of a fairy tale but as soon as this secrets are revealed by apparitions to Nell, she realizes that it is not that fairy tale but a haunted story of terror, slavery and death until the very revelation in the end.The movie is mainly focused on Lili Taylor's character Nell which drives her character's acting remarkably well, although the other main character's acting are very good indeed but it is clear for everyone that the ?acting' that steals the show is hill house itself. Set designer Eugenio Zanetti did a very good job designing the interiors of a huge manor that is creepy, beautiful, charming and mysterious altogether. It is very rewarding to see that this is one of those movies that are rewarding in every aspect you can examine. But this movie works fantastic as a whole not only in some aspects. Music composer Jerry Goldsmith gave us pleasant movie scores like ?Poltergeist', ?The Mummy', ?Hollow Man', ?Star Trek' among other instant classics and once more he did a fabulous job composing this score that perhaps is his best one in his career, creepy, beautiful and suggestive. Some time ago before 2000 Oscar ceremony I read a comment that if this movie was not nominated at least for special effects, sound, photography, set design and sound design ?I will be haunted', I just have to say that I totally agree. Director Jan De Bont proved that he knows how to direct not only action adventure movies but also horror/ thriller/ suspense and still keep the audience on their nerves. David Self's screenplay is not what people make of it, it contains very well written descriptions, memorable sequences, not included on the original nor on the book, remarkable dialogues and quotes.After reading hundreds of comments here on IMDB and other sites about this movie I just find curious that in all of them they only refer as negative the slowest parts of the movie never the best and memorable, why is that, were they to embaraced of stating they were truly scared or touched by those scenes. Are they true critics or selective critics. A movie comment is written selectively or as a whole? I have to confess that I laughed my stomach out reading those comments.Anyway, for those who are reading THIS comment and haven't seen the movie, don't let yourself be influenced by those critics, you better don't, and for those who have seen the movie and feel somehow divided, I advise you to see it again and again to let yourself be swept away by the hugeness and strength of the movie. If you allow it, Jan De Bont and David Self's THE HAUNTING will do it for you. I've seen hundreds of movies so far and none of them could touch me so positively as this one.The Haunting will also make you wonder: Who called Eleanor to respond to Dr. Marrow's ad?See it, enjoy it! Oh, and Sleep Tight!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Step-up And A Step-down Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yet to read the novel by Shirley Jackson, but I have to assume that this remake covers all the material left out of the original that would have gone so far to explain the house's history and idiosyncrasies. The effects are very good, but they aren't very scary or likely in the boundaries of true haunted houses.Lili Taylor's performance takes back stage to Catherine Zeta-Jones which is quite the opposite of the original and does obviously impair the movie's likeability. Liam Neeson is rather distant to the character and events, and Owen Wilson is quite annoying as he tries to copy the original role set forward by Russ Tamblyn. The house, however, takes centerstage as the special effects take over the storyline midway through the movie. Complaints aside, this is a very good if not excellant movie. It ends rather on a confused edge, but thankfully, it does not try to copy the original.</fullReview>

I think the movie also gets unfair treatment because it's a remake of an older film.

		<shortDescription>The battle of the versions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get this out of the way first. I like this remake of The Haunting better than I like Robert Wise's 1963 version of the film. However, the discrepancy between the two in my eyes on this viewing is nowhere near my last viewing in 1999, when I felt the remake was a 10 and the original a 6. My opinion of the original has gone up slightly, to a 7, and my opinion of this film has gone down two points, to an 8.Still, I can't see how someone can like the original film a lot and dislike this remake. There are more things about them that are similar than most folks admit. A lot of the negative views on the remake seem centered on CGI and other special effects. I think that puts a disproportionate emphasis on one element of the film, and it's not as if the Wise film was really devoid of effects, although I agree it had far less.Most folks think the original is scary and this one isn't. Maybe that's part of the problem. I don't think any films are scary and I never have. Fear is just not an emotion I can get from films.Like the 1963 film, the focus here is on Eleanor (Lili Taylor). The premise is basically the same, if some of the details have been changed. An academic researcher, Dr. David Morrow (Liam Neeson), wants to study the fear response, especially as it relates to group interaction. Morrow poses a ruse to get research subjects. He says he's going to be doing an insomnia study. He draws a few participants, including Eleanor, Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson), to a huge old mansion--more like a palace--called "Hill House". He invents a story based on the true one (per the film's world) about the history of Hill House and plants the juiciest details with Luke, along with an instruction to keep quiet about it lest he scare Theo and Eleanor. Of course, Luke blabs, and soon afterward, spooky things begin happening. But is Dr. Morrow behind the strange occurrences or is there really something supernatural going on at Hill House? What will happen if the participants discover the truth behind Dr. Morrow's experiment? And why does Dr. Morrow, or whoever is behind the "haunting", appear to be picking on Eleanor? Director Jan de Bont gives strong nods to the original film in the remake's script, and he even goes so far as to recreate performances, specific shots and sequences. The strongest recreation of a performance is a minor one--Marian Seldes' Mrs. Dudley, who delivers the infamous speech about the "rules" of the house and her and her husband's caretaking habits with almost identical dialogue and intonation as Rosalie Crutchley's Mrs. Dudley in Wise's film. But all of the principal cast members are directed to give performances close in tone and disposition to those in the original. Sequences such as Eleanor and Theo running to each other as they experience strange sounds and something trying to enter their rooms are almost identical to the original, with de Bont taking great care to block infamous shots so that they're the same as the beloved Wise film. Other sequences, such as the sudden presence of cold, are changed in structure a bit, but retain the spirit of Wise. This is all evidence that despite the reputation of the de Bont film, it is much closer in tone--even with its strong emphasis on things only heard or glimpsed out of the corner of one's eye--to the Wise film than almost anyone admits.Of course, this version of The Haunting does have differences. De Bont was not shooting for a Gus Van Sant-styled recreation, ala Psycho (1998), after all. De Bont dispenses with Eleanor's narration (which I've always found annoying in the original), shoots in color, and goes bonkers on production design, cinematography and yes, special effects and CGI. Personally, I prefer going bonkers on production design and cinematography. On both of those ends, The Haunting easily deserves a 10. The sets are breathtaking, beautiful, bizarre and stunningly shot--the exterior of the house, too. I also like the special effects and CGI, but it may be important to remember that I'm not someone looking primarily for realism in films. To me, it's absurd to watch a film about the supernatural expecting realism, anyway. But that's because in real life, I'm a skeptic on all of this stuff. To me, this is a fantasy, as is the Wise film, and I welcome fantastical, surreal (read "non-realistic") imagery.However, unlike the first time watching the remake, I felt that The Haunting had flaws this time around. Maybe I didn't notice them in the theater because I was so floored by the beautiful visuals projected larger than life. The problem is that the story and the dialogue become gobbledy-gooky. There are a lot of non-sequiturs in the plot. Characters disappear for arbitrary lengths of time. Eleanor figures out mysteries that should require complicated sleuth-work without much information to the viewer about how she did it. Characters say things to each other that seem like necessary foundational exposition was edited out. On the other hand, the Wise film wasn't exactly free of these problems, either.And the focus here isn't primarily on a tightly woven story in the vein of a mystery flick, anyway. The focus is on atmosphere--a rich tapestry of visuals and sound, where the actors are just one element, all meant to evoke moods. The film tends to be more poetic in this regard. Viewed that way, it succeeds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Haunted by the new The Haunting... (may be spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How viewers react to this new "adaption" of Shirley Jackson's book, which was promoted as NOT being a remake of the original 1963 movie (true enough), will be based, I suspect, on the following: those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one...and those who have never been exposed to either, and who are big fans of Hollywood's current trend towards "special effects" being the first and last word in how "good" a film is, are going to love it.Things I did not like about this adaption:1. It was NOT a true adaption of the book. From the articles I had read, this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to. And, that seemed reasonable, no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of THE STAND! (And not even then) But, there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at, in the movie. Reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of THE SHINING. I didn't like that, either. What the movie's press release SHOULD have said is..."We got the basic, very basic, idea from Shirley Jackson's book, we kept the same names of the house and several (though not all) of the leading character's names, but then we decided to write our own story, and, what the heck, we watched THE CHANGELING and THE SHINING and GHOST first, and decided to throw in a bit of them, too."2. They completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts, to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been "born bad". No, instead, this "doctor" got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their "insomnia" (he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear...like lab rats, who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment...nice guy). This doctor, who did not have the same name, by the way, was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day.3. In direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies "some houses are just born bad", this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there...and, this time around, Nel gets to unravel the mystery (shades of THE CHANGELING). The only problem was, the so-called mystery was so incoherently told that I'm sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience...but, then there was no mystery in the first place (not in the book), because the house was bad TO BEGIN WITH. It's first "victim" died before ever setting eyes on it.4. The way the character of Luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous. He was supposed to be a debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house (and was a true skeptic of it's "history")...and in this one he was just a winey-voiced, bumbling nerd who couldn't sleep(insomnia remember) and was a compulsive liar.5. I was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word (the scene with Nel's sister's family, and Mrs. Dudley's little opening speech...) to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than THE HAUNTING. It's like it couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to do.6. I missed Nel's narrative through the whole movie. The original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person, through Nel's eyes, and we always were privy to her thoughts. That totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version. They also tried to make Nel much more of a heroine. The original Nel was not a bad person, but she was a bitter person (could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister?) and she liked to moan, and she lost her temper... This one was almost too good to be true. This was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writer's had obviously been watching GHOST one too many times.7. They changed the history of the house and it's occupents too much. There was no Abigail Crain (the daughter of Hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions), there was no "companion", and there was no nursery. There was also no "Grace" (wife of the original doctor) and Hugh Crain's wives died in totally different ways. These changes, changed the story WAY too much. I don't know whether the producers of this movie should be glad Shirley Jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they should...BE SORRY (if ya get my drift!!! The hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with!!!).In conclusion, let me just leave you with some words from the original Luke (appropriate substitution of the word "house" for "movie"!): "This 'movie' should be burnt to the ground, and the ground sprinkled with salt!" My favorite movie of all time remains so. No competition from this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The latest lame Hollywood blockbuster is definitely disappointing, and not in the least bit scary. Now, the original 1963 film wasn't scary either, but at least it managed to be creepy, with the aid of subtlety and suggestion. Just the opposite of this film, in fact. Jan De Bont shows that he should stick to making slick action pictures and has no idea how to scare us.In fact, only the basic plot has been taken from the original film. Some scenes are copied, but in this film it's all basically overdrive on behalf of the special effects team. From the first moment on entering the house, ghostly faces are appearing on bed sheets and walls, and these just increase and increase throughout the film in number. The trouble is that only on two or three occasions are the characters put in danger by these effects, and the rest of the time you just know they're going to dissipate and not cause any harm to anyone.The cast is full of familiar faces, such as Bruce Dern in a wild-haired role as a rarely-seen caretaker. Liam Neeson is good but goes through the paces as the stern doctor, he's no match for Richard Johnson in the original, but at least he's something of an actor. The same with Catherine Zeta Jones. Unfortunately, her character is the least subtle of them all, constantly wearing revealing clothes and flaunting her lesbianism. She fits her role like a glove. Lili Taylor, however, I didn't like. She's one of those actresses who think expressing fright is opening their mouths and eyes as wide as possible. It doesn't look like a believable expression, it just looks ridiculous. Taylor is sadly given the most to do and the largest role, but I just didn't warm to her at all. Owen Wilson is also awful in a comic relief role.For the most part, the special effects are bad and totally unrealistic. Big faces coming out of the ground just don't look real at all, it looks like a computer game and nothing else. Therefore these kind of effects quickly become boring, as you expect what's coming, and there's just so much visual bombardment that it becomes tiring to watch. There are a handful of good scenes in the film, like a surprisingly brutal decapitation or Neeson getting attacked by a statue, but the ending is a real letdown with a sugary happy ending with angels and the like. The final apparition of the ghost is just a big guy in a cape, it might as well be Godzilla. Size isn't everything but that's something this film doesn't realise. Frankly, I think upcoming flicks like THE SIXTH SENSE, THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL remake and, of course, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT all look more promising than this silly and unsurprising entry into the genre. Nauseatingly bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pieces Are Here? Save For One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Haunting' is a theatrical adaptation of the Shirley Jackson novel "The Haunting of Hill House". Therefore, despite what some seem to think, it is not really a remake of the 1963 film. I myself have not read the novel, so I cannot tell you how closely this follows it. I have seen the original film, but a while back. I seem to recall enjoying the movie, but not the ending. I was always a "Happy Ending" kind of guy.But this review isn't about those stories; it's about this one. So here goes:First we are introduced to Miss Eleanor "Nell" Vance; a mousy, yet good-hearted caregiver. She receives a call from a Doctor David Marrow(Or is it?), who invites her out to Hill House, the estate of the late Hugh Crane, to assist in a study on what he claims to be Insomnia Research. He pays 900 dollars a week, plus room and board. She accepts (I would too) and journeys to the manor itself. Quite a home. The exterior of the mansion was Harlaxton Manor. The interior was most likely sound stages, for it was a bit too creepy to be real. What with spikes hanging over the bed and all.Nell meets the caretakers, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, played by Bruce Dern (The 'burbs), and Marian Seldes (Tom and Huck, Home Alone 3). Mrs. Dudley gives Nell a lengthy explanation about just exactly how alone her and her fellow research subjects will be. "I don't stay after dinner. Not after it begins to get dark. We live in town, nine miles, so there won't be anyone around if you need help, we couldn't even hear you. No one could. No one lives any nearer than town; no one will come any nearer than that. In the night. In the dark." She ignores this not-so-subtle B-movie hint, of course. If she didn't, there would be no movie.Next she meets Theodora "Theo". (I don't remember her last name. She might not even have one.) Theo is a gaudy, brazen, bisexual cosmo girl, who is apparently attracted to Nell. (In spite of what some think, there was no deleted "love scene", just a slightly sensual scene leaving Theo's attraction to Nell undeniable. Read the script for further info.) Next comes Luke Sanderson, the boyish cynic with the dry wit. And finally, Dr. Marrow. After dinner, some drinks, and a bedtime story involving the house's haunted past, Marrow explains his goal: OK, so why are we here? Probably to answer the most basic question: "What is wrong with you people?" After a pretty much unnecessary scene where Marrow's assistant gets slashed with a piano wire, and taken to a hospital, never to be heard from, or of, again, we descend into the pit of Hell, I mean Hill, House, and watch as the main characters get chased by ghosts, spooked by specters, and haunted by haunts. Think 'The Haunted Mansion'. But, we mainly get barraged by some of ILM's special effects. Which are quite good, I think. Scenes that stand out for me include a ghostly scene involving a ghost traveling through and under a bed sheet and curtains (you really have to see it), and scenes with hands reaching out of walls. (Those are always cool) And, of course, a breathing ceiling.When I started watching, I thought to myself "Jerry Goldsmith would be perfect for this movie. To my pleasant, he did compose the music. What more can I say. It's awesome. The sound effects are also very good; a 5.1 speaker viewing is recommended.The movie's errors lie in the screenplay itself, which is plagued with plot holes and corny lines. It's as if there were no rewrites. The screenplay is obviously the most important factor in a movie, so I am forced to give this film 6 stars out of 10 stars. Extremely fun to watch, and listen to, but that's about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How this doctor managed to pay the rent for this huge castle ? How a poor girl like (Lili Taylor)'s character afforded the journey to this one-of-its-kind therapy ? (Or was it on the house ?) How the doctor was that stupid to invite all of those guests to something else what he told them (they could've easily sued his ass to jail later ?!). What is the need for transforming (Catherine Zeta-Jones)'s character into a lesbian ? What (Owen Wilson) is making in this movie exactly (He even wasn't a satisfying jerk !). We hear (Liam Neeson) says something about "Mr. Dudley will fix everything" though there is no Mr. Dudley at all !?. Why the C.G.I wasn't scary or whatsoever ? Why the damn gatekeeper locked all the castle's doors ? Why the castle's evil dark owner seemed in his photos like someone wearing a wolverine shitty mask in a bad Halloween day ?!! Why (Lili Taylor) while she's a good actress for sure wasn't appealing to be the lead ? (At many points I found myself muttering "go and die, I don't really care !"). And why oh why the so desperate desire from the movie makers to remake an old movie even by resorting to the original novel since they didn't own the movie's rights ??.I think the answer for this last question can answer all the previous as well. Hollywood lately lives a bankrupt when it comes to good ideas, so they relied on the old story, hired the big names, and saved some extra money for the massive expensive sets by hiring a small name as the lead, then made enough C.G.I, and the rest is history, crap history ! They gave the director chair to someone who with all the cleverness in the world can't make a good thing out of flat script. It's simply the case when nearly everything is high except the screenplay. You can scene the bad irony during all the movie : Grand music, dull characters. Great décor, trivial story lines. Good direction, idiot movie ! It's all in the cheery music of the revolving ring that the movie concludes itself with it, it's more like : thank you for visiting our amusement center ! Which wasn't that amusing at all by the way. So when the gatekeeper asked (Neeson)'s character at the end the philosophical question : "did you find what you've been looking for Doctor ?" I was laughing in bitter sarcasm at 2 hours I had lost from my life and freely, responding instead of (Neeson) : "No, I didn't, but the producers in Hollywood maybe found what they've been looking for since the oldest times ; the money that I paid for renting this, though dear gatekeeper, I'll tell you what, they were making those kind of flicks better and scarier in the past, Hmmm, I'll let you rest now, there is a lot of mess that you'll going to vacuum-clean inside, good day folks, taxi.."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but still creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only saw this film recently even though it's been out for almost 10 years now - but I definitely think that it's worth watching. The film builds pretty slowly and the house itself if wonderfully mad in its layout - leading to some pretty good set pieces. There's a bit of gore but most of the 'horror' is moans, groans and chases - with a nicely dark back story to build the tension. The biggest downside is the 'special' effects - they're quite frankly awful. When a ghost is crawling down the wall, you don't really want to be laughing at the shoddy computer graphics so a great deal of the tension is lost. Aside from that, this feels like an old fashioned ghost story and for those looking for a film that slowly builds the tension and opts for creepiness and shocks rather than gore, it's worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eleanor Lance is called to meet at Hill House for Dr. Marrow's sleeping disorder studies, along with three other people. The owners of the house tell them that no one will be around and that they won't be able to hear them. The first night they all sit around and talk. Eleanor tells them that her sleeping disorder is different because she can sleep it is just that she wakes up because she thinks her dead mom is still living with her. Well that isn't the case now because she is woken one night in the Hill House bedroom by talking children's voices asking her for her help. At first scared by the voice, she learns to avoid them. Later, the group finds out that Dr. Marrow is not using them for sleeping disorders but a test in fear. The fear is first thought to be fake but eventually turns real when loud noises are heard and objects start to move. Now they must try and escape the house before they are all killed.Remake of the 1960's film seems to have all the stuff for success; a creepy house, terrific special effects, some good actors, and a decent director at the helm. However, the laugh out loud dialogue and some miscasting sink it.Rated PG-13 for Violence and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesson in stripping down the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The television of Saturday evening. Am I glad this was not something I paid for! "The Haunting" must be one of the worst 'reading' of an old masterpiece.As viewing the original before the remake, I pretty much knew the story and the intense scenes to watch out for. A fun cast is the positive thing to begin with, the acting was mediocre but I really developed a 'relationship' with all characters in the film. The movie, had its moments. The ghost chasing Nell through the building being the thrilling scene. Just that this thrilling scene did not come over as horror/thriller at all. It truly gave me the feeling I was watching a fantasy film, for instance "Lord of the Rings" even. Luke's death must have been the biggest injustice against the original and was the biggest anticlimax in a movie ever, him being the funnest character. The whole confrontation of 'Nell' and the Ghost only gave a bigger feel of fantasy film. 'Nell' dying the death she did die, is the absolute no-no.The original was so much better than this weak remake. It was not bad, and it had its moments, but it lost the complete mood of the original. The whole ending was different, and it did not do the film good at all. Watching this makes the remake of 'The Birds' even more disappointing than it already is. Let's all remember the great originals and forget the remakes, as soon as you possibly could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this when I was about 10 or 11 years old, I was sort of spooked when I have watched this movie, but when I had seen this now, 17 years old, I became irritated. Knowing the plot was a little bit elementary and the characters were incoherent in the story, The Haunting made my nerves stiff. What really bothered me throughout the movie was the main character, Eleanor. The actress who plays this role can't act. Throughout the entire film, she always seem to be delusional, psychotic, and plain mad. She sees the children ghost fluttering around, but she isn't terrified by this abnormal sight. Instead of screaming her lungs out, she goes along with the ghost and tries to help free the children from this old guy and I don't want to spoil the rest for you. Another thing that annoyed is the reason why the ghosts only communicated to Eleanor but not the other three members. It's like they're there just to be there. I am going to sum it up for you: Eleanor is completely annoying, the minor characters don't really do much, could have been a lot more spooky, and the ghosts should had affected everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than House on haunted Hill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting is Jan de Bont's first attempt a making a coherent film since the execrable Speed 2(1997). The pleasing thing is that he manages to make a better than average job of it. Don't get me wrong, the film has many flaws, but to an undemanding audience, The Haunting delivers the goods. It was understandably compared to House on Haunted Hill(1999), both have nice touches, but the The Haunting wins in the end. The good points are it's special effects, as with most modern effects movies, the special effects are excellent, but The Haunting really does impress, making it difficult to tell the difference between, reality, model work and CGI. The only slight lull in the effects is the climactic ghost, who looks a little too much like a cartoon for my liking. But the film never really over does the effects, and for once, they are subtle. Children appearing in curtains, faces at windows, even the cold breath that the actors breathe. the sets are lavish and beautiful to behold, there are a lot of nice shots in the film, something that i wouldn't have thought a big action director such as Jan de Bont to have employed. The sound is superb, adding to the creepy ambience of the film, but there are a few drawbacks. The script is atrocious, like the remake of Lost in Space(1998), the story has the underlying message that the family is the most important thing of all, but the way the message is expressed in both these films make you want to reach for the sick bag. The acting from Lili Taylor is quite good, for she has the only character who is fully fleshed out. Owen Wilson, who is looking increasingly promising, doesn't have much of a role but manages to make good. Liam Neeson who is usually very good, isn't given a decent script to work with, and Catherine Zeta Jones, is clearly only in it for looks. Also the script tends to veer towards the melodramatic, especially when the housekeeper warns the houseguests of things that go bump in the night. The pacing of the film also slightly lets it down. The film only runs for 1 hour and 40 minutes but it feels like well over 2 hours. Understandably, the director wants to make the most of his sets etc and spend a lot of time working up the creeps and scares until the climax, but we are in a age when as an audience we have already seen amazing special effects, and an effects dominated climax is very unlikely to impress as much as it would have done 10 years ago. Jan de Bont started his career off with the excellent Speed, The Haunting isn't as good as this, but more on a par with Twister(1996), his second film, and while you may think that this isn't the greatest of recommendations, at least it's not as bad as Speed 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear oh dear. At first I was excited at the prospect of this film; the ghost-movie genre is one of my favourites, and Jan De Bont has directed some pretty good movies, if my memory serves me correctly. But then again... maybe it doesn't. THE HAUNTING tells the tale of a group of research subjects who are recruited by a psychologist undertaking a study about fear, who spend several nights in a spooky old mansion. For a scary movie, this is particularly dull. The architecture of the mansion is breathtaking, and so is the architecture of Catherine Zeta-Jones, but no other aspect of the film seems to have had any thought spared for it whatsoever, with the possible exception of Jerry Goldsmith's score (which still isn't a scratch on his work for POLTERGEIST). The script seems to be vying for an Oscar for Largest Number Of Predictable Clichés. I found myself just wishing it would end. And for another thing, the special effects are so obviously computerised that the actors seem to be haunted by a bored computer animator rather than a malevolent nineteenth-century ghost. It's so sad that Hollywood spends so much money to churn out trash like this. I should have been opening my mouth to scream, not yawn. One and a half stars out of four.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The characters are good and so is the acting. The scenografy is really nice and appropriate. Special FX are interesting and are used in a proper way. What dosen't work is the plot, too linear and not much developed. Also the general atmosphere should (and could) have been far creepier and obsessive. I think the production wanted to make a movie for the general audience, kids included, but that definitely ruined the movie. Horror movies should be scary, and, if it is necessary, graphic and disturbing; that's what they are supposed to be. I think that the best american movies are those whose production have the courage to make a movie that is not necessarily "for all the family" and don't have to be something even Disney would produce. In my opinion movies that are afraid of achieving their full effect are really disappointing. Fortunately ther's still someone who can produce a good horror movie (with capital H): The sixth sense is a great example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Effect(s) without cause is generally not possible in the real world but in the world of Hollywood remakes, not only is it possible, it's required. The Haunting has been given the computer treatment courtesy of a 1st-class cinematographer-turner-director who once showed promise (Jan de Bont- Speed) but has since produced a string of big budget garbage (Twister, Speed 2).Actor are superfluous in a movie of this type and they seem to realize it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones act like they wish they were anywhere but in this film. Lili Taylor makes an attempt to add something to the proceedings but whatever that something might be is unknown since the script feels like half of it is missing. Events just happen, good and bad ghosts show up with no rhyme or reason and then the story just ends with a most unsatisfying non-event meant to wrap up the previous 90 minutes of inanity.There really isn't even reason to see this for the effects since we all know that anything can be put on screen now. Why not watch effects in the service of a good story instead of just for their own sake?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A special effects masterpiece...but is it worth the time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An overall good film, The Haunting stirred movie-goers months before its release with its seemingly eerie previews. From brief sights of objects moving in the house to the fact that it did not say much about the film at all, The Haunting's previews perhaps mislead some of its interested viewers.The slogan "Some houses are born bad" caught my eye and my interest, so naturally I went to see the film and I loved it. It was a great film but I was a little disappointed. I had expected an R rated horror movie that would go all out to scare the audience. Instead, it was a PG-13 special effects party that used computer effects to scare the audience. The special effects did create a creepy scene for viewers to admire. And such frightening scenes as the fountain statue that came to life.The lack of rated R horror was made up for by stunning visual effects that purely express talent. Not to mention the surround sound of voices and strange noises all through the house. All in all, it was a good film and worth seeing again and again. In spite of its down points and perhaps too overly dramatic ending, it is a film that will sit in its video case in my movie library soon after its release.</fullReview>

There are plenty of moments that make you jump (and a few that made me scream), but the way the movie ends just leaves you feeling like you worked up all that adrenaline for nothing. I think DeBont should've not concerned himself with the MPAA rating and just gone for the full-on scare. The music is chilling, and if you get the chance, watch this on a home theater system because the sounds are amazing! The cast did a wonderful job of being terrified, and they passed their fear right on to me. There are a few places in the story that make you sit up and say, "HEY! Where did that come from?" Some details that one character manages to come up with are completely unexplained; I cry "FOUL" on a character that is suddenly imparted with knowledge that the audience has no idea of where it came from. Still, it's a good movie that's supremely creepy and chilling at times, and it's worth seeing at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting is a visual masterpiece. The special effects are phenomenal, and the images are very demanding; almost too demanding. Yet the film runs into a problem that many recent films have also encountered(in contrast to the technological revolution). The film is about two girls and one guy, placed in a haunted(literally) house, for the experimentation of human fear. As time passes, and the characters discover the horrible truths of the house, and the previous inhabitants, one of the characters finds a hidden and lost connection with herself and the house. Finally she is able to free the house from the haunting ghosts and demons that had roamed the house for years. The film depends on the special effects to carry on the movie, which is a mistake to begin with. The most important part of a film is the script, which can be simplified as the plot. Not only is the haunting too dependent on special effects, and visual scare, it lacks a decent plot to accompany it. A film cannot be good without a good script, but a film can be good without great special effects. Aside from these factors, the acting wasn't too great either, and the film also fails to accomplish one of it's goals. It isn't frightening. The plot is predictable, which results in a lack of fear in the audience. The film could have been a lot better, had it simply spent more time and concentration on developing a more believable and more detailed plot. *****(5 stars of 10)</fullReview>

The screenplay, though, sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird, surrealistic way. The entire team must have forgotten to read it through, maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was. Each member of the cast gives a worthy performance, although with little conviction to the material at hand. Lili Taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her. But that's about it.

		<fullReview>I don't know how this film could've ever looked good enough on paper to get the ball rolling for actual production. It is just plain lame.The dialog is very flat and unconvincing. Sure, the special effects are great but this just proves George Lucas right when he said that special effects help tell the story, they are not the story itself. (paraphrasing)The story's telling is very trite and shallow. The premise of what happened at Hill House should've set the stage for a very disturbing film. Instead of being scared from the start, you keep on waiting for fear to set in. You say to yourself, "So it's taking a while to get started, it'll get good soon." Just then, the credits roll and you're left with that post coital feeling of, "That's it?"The only endearing quality this film has is the eerie music bed along with the opening shots of the house itself. So, watch the first 30 seconds or so. That should suffice. By the way, I have a mint condition "Signature Collection" DVD of THE HAUNTING (1999) for sale. I would sooner be frightened by another viewing of Weekend at Bernies II than ever watch this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth renting-but lacked that special "something"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie was well done in that it had quality actors/actresses and the special effects were intriguing rather than gory, knock-you-over-the-head shocking-I still agree with other viewers that it lacked that "something". Yes, there were moments that made you jump and moments that made you hold your breath but something was missing. It could have been somehow more frightening. I think further background on Mr Crane as the evil, main character would have been helpful. Perhaps a flashback of him with some of the children....I was continually reminded of the 1963 version-which unfortunately a lot of the viewers of this 1999 version aren't familiar with. That movie always remained as the movie that "scared the pants off me" when I was young. For years afterward, I tried to find a video copy of it or tried to find it on t.v. but could never seem to locate it. That movie, by the way was in black and white! (Like "Psycho"-the #1 best horror movie ever) When I heard that a remake of "The Haunting" was in the works I was really looking forward to reliving that original thrill. The story line was substantially changed, however most of the characters remained basically the same. But the scene that scared me the most when I was young...was curiously not scary and almost went unnoticed in the 1999 version. It is the scene where Theo and Nell (in the '63 version) were waiting out the onslaught of the "ghost" in the dark and they were holding hands-or at least thought they were. One of them remarked that the other was squeezing her hand too tight...When the lights went on, the women were on opposite sides of the room. Then WHO had been holding their hands? That stills gives me goose bumps. In the remake-Nell was alone, the lights were on and the effect was lost somehow. I still think this kind of movie is much preferred to the kind of hack and slash stuff that has been common fare for so long. This movie is definitely worth renting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Succeeds as a ghost story, Fails at Horror and screenwriting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for The Haunting, I was expecting the film to be a "thrill-a-minute scarefest." When I went to see it, I left the theater feeling pretty disappointed in not feeling scared (in fact, I walked right over and saw Blair Witch for a 2nd time.) Now that The Haunting is on video (DVD specifically,) I wanted to give it another chance. After a 2nd viewing, I felt it was a good "old fashion" ghost story, but it still failed at being scary. This movie is Lili Taylor's movie. Her portrayal of a sweet, hopeless romantic is very convincing. Everyone else in the cast is along for the ride. Owen Wilson has to be one of the worst actors around. I would cringe everytime he was on screen. The story about the hill house was good, if not a little vague at times. There are many good scenes that are slightly scary, but none of it is terrifying. Even though her acting was solid, where was a scene where Lili Taylor was smelling something that was pretty laughable. The good: special effects, sound effects, story, Lili Taylor (most of the time.) The bad: most of the acting, some horrible dialogue. All in all, I can recommend this film because it is fun, has very little graphic violence and next to no profanity. I give the Haunting a B-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I avoided this film due to comparisons to the original until it came out on video. I thought it compared almost favorably to the 1963 version until the end. We really believe it's all in Nell's mind until the last 10 or 15 minutes. In the book and 1963 film, we are led to believe that Nell imagines the strange events at Hill House. Too bad that the powers that be decided to make it a horror film for the 90s and take the ghosts out of Nell's mind and into "reality." Still, there are some fun things in this film, esp. if you're not familiar with the original film or the novel. If you like blood'n'guts and gore, don't bother. If you like psychological horror--check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, dear, oh, dear. This was bad. Very, very bad. I went to see this with my niece (15 yrs) to be a good uncle and to give her, at least, a reasonable scare. But alas, Neeson, Zeta-Jones et al, couldn't scare a 15 year old girl from Northern Norway, let alone her uncle. I hoped it would be an ordinary but scary movie. But apart from the spectacular special effects, it was a huge disappointment, even for my expectations. The plot is wafer thin, the characters cardboard-like, and the ghosts are as scary as those in Ghostbusters. Two things crossed my mind when I was suffering in the theatre: What the hell was Neeson thinking, when he said "Yess!" to this movie? AND,It's a shame to use such splendid surroundings as the Hill house to shoot The Haunting... (And don't tell me the castle is data-animated?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading a lot of negative reviews about this film, I found the time ripe to see and comment it too. When I look at the other films I've seen that Jan de Bont has made, Speed and Twister, I think The Haunting is, when looking at the screenplay, better than both those other two movies. But overall I think this movie is the second best Jan de Bont has made. Twister had a meagre story but never seen before special effects, The Haunting told a more developed story and had great special effects. Speed is still the best movie that Jan de Bont has made. The Haunting had a few very scary moments but wasn't as near scary as a horrormovie like Halloween, but maybe that's because in The Haunting a house played the leading role. The sets used in the film were extraordinary, I'd never seen such a beautiful scary house in another movie than the one that was in this film. Still, the movie had it's flaws. Not all the characters were well developed, the ending was a bit anticlimactic and not everything was as scary as it probably was meant to be. But overall a pretty entertaining movie (a 7 out of a 10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special effects no substitute for good acting and plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic example of how modern day special effects, no matter how well crafted (which they are in The Haunting) can ruin an otherwise good, if well used, storyline. If film makers limited the use of special effects to support the actors and plot, rather than as a substitute, then I think we would all benefit.The film begins with a steady, albeit predictable build up and the first scenes in the house really make you want to believe it is has a mysterious and sinister past. However, about half way through the film the actors become secondary to the overdone special effects and seem to confine themselves to wandering around aimlessly.At no stage during the film did I ever feel scared nor did I receive any sudden frights (compared, for example, to the "choke on your popcorn" frights delivered in Sixth Sense). If this was the aim of the film, then I'm afraid it failed miserably. In the scariness stakes, repeated loud noises and wobbly walls are no match for the brief glimpse of an unexplained shadow or a rapidly moving household object narrowly missing you.I felt the ending to The Haunting was very abrupt and did not satisfactorily explain all that had happened in the closing scenes. While I usually don't mind films to end in such a way that make the audience work out the ending, I found in this case I didn't care.By no means the worst film I have seen this year - there are a few good creepy scenes and the house is truly magnificent. The Haunting was sufficiently "average" to avoid me feeling cheated of my admission money, but it is not a film I intend to see again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read the novel or seen the film from 1963, so it is safe to say that I, in that way, went in to see this film with an open mind. I had no expectations, just hope of seeing a scary film.The opening of the film was not that positive. The dialogues were bad and not remotely interesting, plus the acting of the housekeeper was simply laughable. The other characters were not that convincing either. Thankfully the creepy atmosphere of the house takes over, and both dialogue and acting gradually improves (the actors never truly impress, though). The peak of the film is definitely half way through, and especially the psychological thrills I found very scary. You also get a couple of shocks, but, in my opinion, a thousand shocks cannot replace a well made psychological thrill. Unfortunately the psychological thrills are much too few in this film. Towards the last part of the film, the visual effects completely take over, which is very nice to look at, but not scary at all. So once again, as it happens in several horror/thriller movies, the ending lacks tension and thrills.Hill House is without a doubt one of the most atmospheric settings I have seen in a long time. Only Bates' motel and house in Psycho and the Overlook Hotel in The Shining come to mind when thinking of more frightening settings. The fact that the house is truly magnificent as the setting just makes it all the more disappointing that it all ends up in a special effects orgy. Impressive as they may be, the effects did not scare me.All in all an entertaining film that could have been even scarier, if they had put some more weight on the psychological thrills. Don't get me wrong, there are several scary scenes in the film, but also several soft spots. So, what is my conclusion? Well, an above average horror flick with the usual cliches, a decent plot, average acting, a couple of good scares and thrills, and, unfortunately, a sh*tload of visual effects. Definitely worth watching, though.I rate it 7/10.</fullReview>

The only good thing was the set but that doesn't make for a good film. Nothing happens for at least 20 minutes and by then you just give up.

		<fullReview>The Haunting was made first in 1963 and was genuinely scary. It was made in black and white and what-the-hell-was-that-noise subtlety by Robert Wise (Star Wars, The Sound Of Music). Hardly any special effects were used. In true horror tradition it was what you didn't see that was terrifying!Bring in 1999. The target audience has changed. Cheap thrills for a modern audience, replace dialogue and inference.Hire the hardly subtle Jan De Bont the director of Speed and Twister, and a cast including the glossy Catherine Zeta Jones (Blue Juice, Entrapment, The Mask Of Zorro and The Phantom), the classy Liam Neeson (Schindler's List, Rob Roy, Dark Man, Michael Collins) and the reputable actress Lili Taylor (Mystic Pizza, Ransom) to sass up the business. Most importantly, as we can these days, throw the lot to the special effects gurus and hope for the best.Well the result is not remotely as spine chilling as the 1963 movie. Interestingly that earlier film wasn't even mentioned in the modern day's movie's production notes, even when chunks of dialogue were lifted directly from Robert Wise's production!But De Bont's film is far from hopeless. A doctor called David Morrow played by Liam Neeson is arranging a study about the process of fear. He takes his subjects Nell (Lili Taylor), Theo (Zeta-Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson) to a creepy house to frighten them but finds that the house is genuinely haunted.Most of the characters are secondary to the house in importance in this film. Luke is a sloppy sort who's given little to do but leap and run at the appropriate time. Dr Morrow is almost superfluous, as is Theo even though she'a flashy sex pot who is keeps throwing sexual lures to Nell.It's left to Nell to achieve any depth of character in The Haunting, and that's in spite of Theo's advances. Nell is the sensitive one of the group, the only one we know anything about before the main events in the film develop, and she's the one who has something to offer the ghosts who live in the house.Lili Taylor takes great advantage of this and charges the movie with its human element. But The Haunting survives not because of Lili Taylor but because of its set designs and special effects. The house is astounding.The exteriors are a house in England called Harlaxton Manor in Lincolnshire, England and a marvelous, strange, building it is. The interiors were shot in a sound stage constructed in the Dome in Long Beach California where Howard Hughes' enormous airplane Spruce Goose was formerly housed.The results really are impressive and fabulously ornate. There are huge staircases, hallways and rooms resplendent with ornate carvings often in the shape of young children. The Haunting lends life, gains vitality from its magnificent sets.The Haunting though is often inconsistent. There are some strange throwbacks to the 1963 film in the form of Mr and Mrs Dudley (Bruce Dern and Marian Seldes). Mrs Dudley repeats a litany about not staying in the house after dark but that is left hanging and out of character with the rest of the movie.Similarly the lesbian challenges offered by Theo apparently go nowhere and Dr Marrow's studies, the basic idea of the movie, appear to be silly and ill conceived. In the original film the team go to the house knowing it's haunted to check it out. That makes much more sense. The lesbian aspect, Claire Bloom played Theo in 1963, was then much more complete in its realisation and therefore more meaningful.But, obviously, this is the meaningless nineties. Special effects are allowed to rule. In some films good actors are left floundering, faced by an innocuous script, an unsympathetic director and profit driven producers.The Haunting does survive this assault by virtue of it's lavish, extravagant sets and special effects. It's mildly scary, reasonably entertaining, trashy and memorable.</fullReview>

I thought Liam Neeson could do no wrong after being a Jedi, how wrong I was.If you want to have a scare, rent the original, turn the lights off, and soak up the 'atmosphere' of a truly scary film.

OK, effect movies can work (Jan de Bont's 'Twister' did), and it is possible to make non-humans protagonists... but wasn't this film supposed to be at least a little bit scary? Interesting? Fun? Something? What were all these high-profile actors doing when they signed up to this bomb? Well, they certainly weren't looking to do any acting.I'm afraid it's an all round disaster. None of the roles' potential was remotely fulfilled (Zeta Jones' part was, to all intents and purposes, non-existent). And any interesting story developments were soon abandoned to some rather mundane effects, which rather than create anything nearing a frisson of cinematic pleasure, merely turned the whole debacle into a farce. And was it scary? No, it was just funny. The only shots or scenes which went any of the way to creating any feeling of tension or fear were made without a single computer effect. Which must be saying something.</fullReview>

The cast were okay with Catherine Zeta Jones being the highlight for me. The other cast members weren't too bad either. Although I was half expecting Liam Neeson to blame the disturbances on the FORCE. The plot was good but could have been fitted into a smaller film. There were no real scares for me, though admittedly I did jump when the skeleton popped up in the fireplace. There are good points to this film; the ghost of the child moving from the curtain to the bed and then the pillow was an Excellent effect; the house itself was superbly designed but the vastness of it was under used. The characters seem to stay in the same hallway and the same four rooms. The Endings effect were a bit of a let down, the door reminded me of the sculpture from the Devils Advocate.All in all a pretty average film, more a traditional ghost story than an updated classic.</fullReview>

The script writer (and De Bont) should have realised that seeing less is better, not the other way around. The ending though was a bit too melodramatic and groan inducing. Script wise, it started out excellent during the first half, with some clever dialogues before deteriorating tremendously near the end.All in all, not as bad as people would lead you to believe but it could have been great...a bundle of unrealised potential.

Twister was a real example of how to hook in an audience (didn't hurt that you had Helen Hunt as your heroine!)This movie is just what it promises to be, but in a whole different and not good sense of the word - a shocker.Comparisons with The Blair Witch Project are inevitable:- one film cost $50,000, the other $100 million or so - one had a crew of hundreds, the other, probably 5? - one is worth paying 12 bucks to see, the other is a bored Saturday night video view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had potential but the script lets you down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "The Haunting" was a classic. The monologue at the opening of the movie sets the viewer up for a frightening experience. The re-make had good effects, the house was wonderful and the acting was good. What let the whole film down was the script. In the original the characters faced an unknown horror. The Haunting 1999 the characters faced the bland. How old is David Self(the credited scriptwriter). This film appears to be written by an adolescent who has been brought up on re-runs of Fantasy Island. Of course maybe the director should carry some of the blame.Why did David Self change the script to that of episode of Aaron Spellings "Charmed"?We had all the cliches in this film. Being scared and hearing strange noises then going into dark rooms at night alone, The rest of the cast being really worried about the mental stability of the heroine and then leave her in her room alone. Finding secret passages, not tell anyone about them and check them out alone. Oh and to really scare the audience lets have a beheading! The final hokum was the relationship between Crane and Eleanor. Who made the damn phone call? Crane, Caroline, the children?Save yourself the money wait for the Video Release. If you want to be scared get the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To keep it simple: This film stinks. It falls on its rear right out of the gate and never gets up. The writing is hacked out of standard, sophomoric ghost story drivel. The characters are weak, the story is robbed of its original life, and the suspense is nonexistent. Above all, it is not in the least bit scary. The special effects are ineffective. The digital ghosts look like Casper and Friends and the gargoyles and various animated objects look all too campy. The House is incredible, for sure, but it's all too much. It looks like a gothic cartoon or what Disneyworld might build as its new Haunted Mansion with exaggerated features and caricatures. But the filmmakers can't even get these simple cliches nor the basic formulas right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the worst mistake is to promote it as a movie "from the director of Speed and Twister". I was prejudiced because of this, and you definitely can't compare "The haunting" with a flying cow flick, even when the character development failed in this haunted house story. The movie DOES create a creepy atmosphere, it's not just FX and money burning on the screen. The special FX are just amazing, and the art and production design are just unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but not scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DreamWorks' version of this classic story is not a scary movie. It contains a few chills and one unexpected fright, but unfortunately, you will not find yourself nervously peering over your bucket of popcorn. What The Haunting does provide is two hours of opulent sets, fun acting, and amazing special effects.In this remake of Robert Wise's film, which in turn is based on Shirley Jackson's novel, The Haunting Of Hill House, Liam Neeson is Dr Marrow, a research scientist interested in the study of fear. He invites his guests (Lili Taylor, Katherine Zeta-Jones, Luke Wilson)to Hill House under the false pretense of taking part in the study on insomnia.Director Jan DeBont takes the road less traveled these days with The Haunting. The film has more of the feel of one of the slower paced horror film of the late '60's-early '70's. The Haunting mercifully dispenses with the countless camera cuts and top 40 ready soundtrack that has become the norm these days. The film starts gradually and builds up. DeBont takes full advantage of the beautiful surroundings and shows enough polished marble and stained oak to make Bob Villa gitty with delight. Unfortunately, polished rock and stained wood won't sustain a horror film, and unlike the films it tries to emulate, The Haunting fails to invoke much fear at all. While fun and entertaining enough to keep my attention for two hours, I felt let down by the jokey, all too familiar family theme ending, and the '90's reference one liners are an obvious attempt to appeal to the widest audience possible. On the upside, when all Hell breaks loose, the visual effects are top notch and don't fail to deliver. Hundreds of small cherubs scream and moan, gargoyles and griffins take on a life of they're own, and one scene in a mirrored carousal room is a particulary creepy sequence.All the actors portray their character well, particulary Katherine Zeta-Jones. Her Nell is funny and sharp and watching her and the other characters interact reminded me of an old Agatha Christie film. In general, you won't regret spending your time watching The Haunting, it is an entertaining film. DeBont has made a very different version than Wise did. Wise's version is a classic ghost story. DeBont's Haunting is a product of the late 20th century. We've seen it all, the Titanic sink, dinosaurs walk, and asteroids destroy the Earth. Gone are the days when "thinking" films were the norm. Now they get lost in all the over-priced films that forgo story and thinking for F/X and adrenaline. The Haunting is a good film, unfortunately, it's not a film your likely to remember much about long after you leave the theatre. My grade: B-</fullReview>

This wasn't something to try to take advantage of the original...they just simply wanted the new generation of horror fans to see the story. Face it, these teens today are not particulary interested in going and renting some old film. The cast was excellent! And plus the special affects were awesome. No the film isn't really scary, but it makes you jump a lot. I found myself tense throught the whole thing even though I was not scared. The movie is pretty good! Go see it! And when you go listen GOOD, because the movie had a part that explained the whole thing, and if you aren't really listening, you will miss it because they talk low at that part. Maybe that's why the people don't like it. ALSO, dont take it too seriously either!</fullReview>

The effects were kewl and the house they built was beautiful and incredibly awesome. The movie is almost worth seeing just to see how gorgeous the house is, but they really needed less corny lines and more house. I don't know what happened, they spent so much money to build that house and make the effects and make a great movie, but someone got cheap when it came to writing the script. What were they thinking with lines like "Home is where the heart is"? And the ending??? Come on.. she sent the evil demons back to hell with the simple phrase "Purgatory's over, Go To Hell". If it were that easy, every child with a nightmare would be hollaring out the obscenity nightly. Besides looking at the visual stunningness of the house, this movie is a huge disappointment so don't waste your cash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: May contain spoilers!Just looking at all the shockingly bad reviews of this film,I dont know what they expected from this movie. "The Haunting" is one of the best ghost movies I have ever seen!It is nice to see a scary movie these days without seeing teenagers being savagley murdered and blood everywhere. This is a smart, well put together film. True, it may not be frightening,but the effects were very well done and imaginative. Many of the people that put this movie down said that the plot was ridicioulus, and made no sense, however for those of us who were really paying attention, it made prefect sense.The acting was very well done as well. They gave me a sense that they were real people caught in an unusual set of circumstances. I really most liked and identified with Elenor(played by the outstandig Lili Taylor).I really felt for her, and in some scenes I wanted to get up there and give her a big hug, I think that's all Elenor really needed. Owen Wilson's charachter had some serious problems(besides insomnia).He was antagonizing the ghosts from the start, he might as well have been wearing a "kill me" sign around his neck. Catharine Zeta-Jones's charachter was interesting at first, but turned from a strong willed woman into a frightened victim. I think what would have made her more interesting is if she hit on the two men as well as Eleanor.Everbody who said they were not scared of the ghost should think about this: if you were in that situation, you would be crying for your mothers! Jan De Bont did a great job in showing us how he thought these spirits would look like,and I applaud him for it.Overall, The house was outstanding, the effects dynamite(ecspeciaaly the end) and the movie great!!! 9 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

I liked this one because it makes you think. Maybe sometimes peoples expectations are too high to begin with . I do agree that sometimes previews and trailers give away too much info.

		<fullReview>I was wrong to expect this to be a truly scary movie, but I was not expecting to sit through something so silly. The cinematography is attractive, but the character development (even for the "main character") is non-existent. I was left wondering if "Eleanor" took off by herself for a few days and did some strange soul-searching while the audience wasn't looking. The last scene is silly and campy, and contains some of the most ridiculous lines ever. It seems as though the movie was way too long, or way too short, but there is definitely a gap between the slow exposition and the rushed ending, thrown haphazardly together with implausible plot explanations and dialogue. She might as well have ended the movie by saying, "Oh, wait, I forgot about these magic beans in my pocket. Let's just go home now." I could have forgiven that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a person that just wants to be scared and doesn't really care about plot or character development, then you'll love the '99 version of the movie. I have read the book and seen both movies (63 &amp; 99) which makes me a really big nerd, but anyway all three are geared for different audiences. If you like seeing the deep emotional effects and realizing how Eleanor thinks and feels about house, and you don't really care about the Special Effects, then you will LOVE the '63 version. There are no special effects, save voice overs of Eleanor's thoughts. If you are like this you will hate the '99 version. Personally, I can't stand anything made by Jan De Bont (Especially Speed 2), but I think that you should see them and decide for yourself. My favorite is the book, because if you have good imagination you can have the best of both worlds, and no Jan De Bont. It would be better if they had pictures of Catherine Zeta Jones, though. Too Bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the best "horror" or "terror" movies that I've seen, rely heavily on audience participation in creating a mood based solely on the movie viewer's imagination (case in point-"Don't be afraid of the dark.") The best horror or thriller movies that I've seen, rely on sound, a great setting, lots of darkness, great acting and a wild imagination to try and create a setting where the movie viewer places themselves front and center behind the lens of the camera and take the place of the hero/heroine (or victim.) We live their screams, their short breaths, their racing hearts right thru the screens in front of us. The better timed the loud thump, the quicker our hearts beat. The more abrupt the visual, the greater the amount of adrenaline rushing thru our veins inciting a flee or fight reaction, even tho we are miles removed from any real danger.The remake of "The Haunting" had a fantastic setting. Simply a gorgeous, intricate and old mansion that had a lot of potential. When used, darkness played right into the director's hands. But then for some reason, instead of making this an "evening" of terror, we see daylight again and again? The use of sound was superb. At least at first. And by not revealing the "monster" early on, we are forced to use our imagination to create a "beast beyond the walls".But then the director blows it. Sounds give way to actual images of the monster and heavy use of visual fx replace the director's best ally up until then; imagination. At the end we are left with a "Ghost Busters" meets "Indiana Jones" type of ending, for a movie we had hoped might live up to the likes of it's predecessor.On our ride home, we both wondered aloud, why the likes of a Liam Neeson or Zeta Jones would bother with such a silly movie, that was really, beneath them and their true talents. "Eleanor" was the only one that was allowed to act, but even her script turns silly at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gross Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been looking forward to seeing The Haunting, and thought that it certainly looked good from the previews. I was grossly disappointed by the whole movie. Despite more-than-competent cinematography and impressive special effects, the plot and the way it was played out are the film's major downfalls. Adding the attempt at over-compensation on the part of the actors, I regret having paid $9 to see it. The possibly-intriguing plot twists were seemingly thrown together haphazardly, mixing like oil and water. I left the theatre wondering exactly what the main plot was supposed to be. Overall, I found the film quite dissatisfying and couldn't recommend it to an enemy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I just have one question. I know when you go to see one of these summer horror flicks, you are supposed to suspend all disbelief for a couple of hours and go along for the ride, BUT, am I expected to completely disconnect my brain from the rest of my senses? To quote Eleanor, "what do you want from me?" I could go on indefinitely ripping this movie to shreds, but it seems like most of the bases have been covered by other reviewers.Just once, however, I wish the big scary ghost would just go postal right from the beginning. You know, if it's going to be the scare-you-with-special-effects type of flick, then let's just have the ghost pull out all the stops right from the beginning and just start hurling bodies around, setting stuff on fire, turning statues into living beasties and generally wreaking havoc. Why start off slowly - blowing curtains, making scary noises, writing on the wall in blood, that kind of nonsense when they are capable of so much more neat stuff. And why do ghosts only do scary stuff at night? Are they like, part vampire or something? Anyway, I'm being silly - but so was this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why can't Hollywood resist the temptation to remake movies simply because it now has the ability to use computers to generate really impressive graphics. Some of the best fright movies are frightening simply because of what they suggest rather than what they visualize.This movie is a case in point. I remember reading the book upon which this movie is based and remember being very frightened by it. Then, I viewed the 1963 original version and again, found it significantly faithful to the novel as to be chilling and engaging.This version is, at best, boring. In retrospect, the best scene and the one with the most chance of evolving into a decent flick of any genre is where Eleanor has to deal with her sister and a ruthless brother-in-law. From here on the acting falls flat and character development is non-existent. I remember thinking initially, how massive the house seemed but after a while, realized that it was a technique being employed to compensate for a lack of substance elsewhere.Totally missing was a really frightening scene found in the book and the original movie which gives credibility to Eleanor's question "Whose hand was I holding?"If you really want to enjoy "The Haunting of Hill House" read the book. Or, see the original film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1963's "The Haunting" is still one of the scariest horror films ever made. No blood, no gore, no special effects (except one) and it scares the hell out of you. Why try to remake it? Well, they did and, predictably, did a lousy job. First off, it looks great. The sets are incredible and take your breath away. Second everbody (except for Neeson) gives out good performances. This is particularly impressive when you realize how howlingly bad their dialogue is. The story was (unwisely) changed from the original (I'm still not quite sure who Neeson gets them all together--it sounds like to test fear????!!!!!). There are two HUGE gaps in the script--two other people are introduced at the beginning, one gets hurt, the other drives her to the hospital--and they're never mentioned again. The second one: when they try to leave the house when all hell breaks loose, the doctor says only the caretaker can let them out. However, earlier we had seen him unlock the gates himself! Those two lapses aside, the dialogue is incredible bad. I can't believe they actually let this script by. The audience was laughing at the lines! (Also there's a plot twist at the end that was so ridiculous, I yelled out "Oh come on!" and audience members applauded me!) Also it's not scary. The special effects are impressive, but you're always aware that they are special effects. I only jumped once (when a skeleton pops up). Let's see, horrible script, lapses in logic, ridiculous plot twists, nonscary...a must miss basically. If you want to be scared, rent the original. You'll be much better off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm beginning to think that director Jan de Bont's brilliant SPEED was just beginner's luck. It seems that no matter how many millions Hollywood tosses his way, he just can't tell a good tale.THE HAUNTING does have some good points, the production design being the most outstanding. Two of my favorite actresses, Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta Jones, turn in fine performances . On the other hand, Liam Neeson, another one of my favorites, was a poor choice for the role of an academic psychologist and is just about invisible here.The biggest problem is that this "horror" movie is not scary in the least. The digital effects are state-of-the-art, but what weight does that carry anymore? The component of the plot that brings the characters to Hill House in the first place, the psychological study of fear in insomniacs (why in insomniacs?) begins as vague mush, never gels, and ultimately is summarily dropped and forgotten. With his extensive background in cinematography, one would think de Bont would know how to work with a film editor, but the jerky transitions in THE HAUNTING are very distracting in a movie that is otherwise beautifully filmed.I was pleased to see Bruce Dern and the beautiful Virginia Madsen in the film but disappointed that the roles were about as bit as roles can get. Dern would have been a much better choice for Neeson's character, and Madsen would have probably carried Zeta Jones' role even better, at considerably less expense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been said that at some point in Hollywood history, special effects will outweigh all other elements of a movie, and we will swallow it whole. Hey, guess what? It's this movie! /The Haunting/ is horrific, oh, sure. In all the wrong ways. The writing's bad, the acting's bad, the special effects are only marginal. I will say now, and I will forever be prosecuted for this, but Lili Taylor is PATHETIC. She tromps through this movie like some extra in a slasher flick. The other two insomniacs are just weirdos...not even Liam Neeson can carry this trashy dialogue. Plot elements pop up out of nowhere through Neeson's stories to his 'subjects', and one is simply expected to piece them together. But even after the movie is over, not everything makes sense, and there isn't any way it will. But worse of all, the movie lets plot take a backseat to effects in a way not seen EVER, even in a world of /Wild, Wild, West/ and /Armageddon/. Lots of long, drawn out graphic effects lead to the little plot revelations, then to more effects. Some are so predictable that one sits in the theatre, waiting for them to do something 'special' (The Judgement Door or the spikes over Nel's bed, for instance). It's kind of like a third grader's short story--jumpy, uneven, and downright incoherent. And if you're looking to be scared, go home. /The Haunting/ has less scares than my last round of student loan paperwork. Sure, the intensity builds up a little here and there, and maybe my adrenaline kicked into gear once. But that's all. What comprises the 'horror' factor here are a couple of pop-up effects, meant to jump you, teamed with lots of graphic effects that, apparently, are scary to someone. The six year olds I was sitting near didn't even flinch. All in all, shaft this flick. It modifies the original novel enough to almost be a new movie, and uses special effects as not just a crutch, but a glorified wheelchair, trying to keep a poorly done movie from falling over on its respective butt. Hey, it failed! Save your cash, rent the 1963 legend or read the book, and go see /The Blair Witch Project/.</fullReview>

The cast manages to be believable for the most part, and the couple of plot devices that appear are relatively subtle.Unfortunately, the last quarter of it comes across as just plain tacky. The major plot revelation is botched, and the end result has little or nothing frightening about it.

Lili Taylor is a mentally unstable participant along with zesty artist Catherine Zeta-Jones and suspicious dude Owen Wilson in Liam Neeson's cruel study of the "science of fear" under the guise of sleep disorder sessions conducted at an early 19th-century mansion, which turns out to be full of the ghosts of children worked to death by their evil textile mill boss and builder of the house. Jan de Bont's take on Shirley Jackson's THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE feels more like an overhyped Disneyland ride (with Tippett Studio FX and Jerry Goldsmith clich's) than a horror movie, but it serves a good purpose...to remind us to rent Robert Wise's 1963 black and white UK classic, if for one reason alone: to hear Julie Harris scream, "It's in the nursery!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've read most of the other user comments you will see a great difference of opinion. The bottom line is see it for yourself. No one person on the planet has the same taste as you. But if you want to know my opinion read on...The Haunting was originally a book that was made into a simple b/w film in 1963 which wasn't all that bad. They had to use different methods to get people to jump though. Strange camera angles and sound effects worked well. In the new version, the computer generated effects possible today allowed the director to expand and make it more like the original writer possibly imagined. Though very different, the new movie is rather suspenseful, has its jumps, and some of the effects are really neat. But all this is my opinion. The average theatre goer won't find much wrong with the acting. Zeta-Jones' character is annoying, but she was cast in the roll for her looks, not really to act. Lili Taylor was great. She did an excellent job. Although the movie has some minor holes, i give it ***1/2 out of ***** stars.</fullReview>

Although, I must give them credit for the special effects and the house did give off a haunting sensation. There was one scene when the skeleton came out of the grave that made the audience jump but that was the only scary part in the whole thing. It is not really worth seeing. They could have given the actors more meaningful roles, instead they were downgraded to insignificant supporting actors and it really made me feel bad for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having read the novel upon which this movie is based years ago, I was struck by how much the creators of this movie decided they would alter for the screen. The scientist is there for different reasons in the movie, not for the paranormal, but for the study of fear. Boring. Liam Neeson, who is a very fine actor, was wasted. He was good, but not good enough. The actor who played Luke was badly miscast. In the book, he stood to inherit Hill House. In the movie, he makes no sense whatsoever. Eleanor, who was such an interesting person in the book, with her self torturous thoughts comes across as some sort of martyr and related to the man who made Hill House in the film. Catherine Zeta Jones is okay and is great to look at, but here again, we know next to nothing about her and have little reason to truly care what happens to her. The 1963 version of The Haunting was frightening but on a subtle level. That is filmaking at its best. To be able to convey the terror of a haunted house without resorting to gimmicks. In this version, the house is spectacular viscerally. In fact, the whole film is that way, but it goes nowhere. I was hoping the movie would just end so I could go home. The director threw in so much in the way of special effects, changed story lines, altered characters and made this great story a shambles. The music was fine, but it never seemed to stop. The original novel by Shirley Jackson and the Robert Wise film are proof of the old saying 'less is more'. They had no need to have the house come alive in obvious ways right before our eyes. They did something far more impressive. They made the house come alive in our imaginations.</fullReview>

As with the original film there is excellent use of sound but with little variety thus wearing thin after a while.In the end we are left with yet another ho-hum Hollywood special effects film with little substance.</fullReview>

It started off being "not bad"; I could see that the film had some potential to be adequately scary, if it was developed right. Too bad they *did* hire Jan de Bont, because as it went on, it became more and more predictable and ridiculous. In the end, it was in shambles. The special effects were even overdone, and I even say that realizing that this was a Hollywood-ized movie. Skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie, But Only For Entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Haunting the second day it was out. I had heard that the acting wasn't too hot, but I saw in the teasers that there might be some great special effects. In some parts of the movie, the "dramatic effect" that the camera moves tried to create was so overdone that it was too obvious. This is not the best role that Liam Neeson has chosen to accept, but he tries (sometimes) to work it out. Catherine Zeta-Jones' character was sometimes too obvious, and the departure of two of the characters was too swift. Lili Taylor did a C-/D+ job playing Eleanore Lance; sometimes I just wanted her to go crazy and get it over with.The special effects were great. I saw 98% of the audience jump when the skeleton pops up. You'd think people would expect something like that to happen, but the suddenness of the actions throughout this movie are great. Some things happen long after you expect them to, but it works out any way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Essentially, about an hour and forty minutes of decent movie followed by 15 minutes of the most ludicrous mishegoss it has ever been my displeasure to see. I was just laughing at the end, but not *with* the movie... *at* the movie. Any guffaws were derisive in nature.Once again De Bont proves he has a great talent with action, but has no talent with a story. The ending was so cliche, so trite, so hackneyed... It's like he took every horror movie cliche he could find and threw them all into the last 15 minutes.He's a director who needs some studio masters to take him in hand and assign him projects where he cannot deviate from the screenplay. A decent development exec or producer with a head for a story instead of bean counting and testing things to death, combined with De Bont's skill, and you could get a few more good movies out of him.Sadly, the grosses on this one are likely to give De Bont carte blanche to do a couple more bad movies.</fullReview>

This movie was really quite solid, and the digital effects were remarkable. I typically despise CGI, but it was in rare form for this film. Oh yeah...it was also a PG-13 horror film. When was the last time this happened? As far as that goes, this was a stellar excursion. For an R? No. A PG-13 was just right for this since there were just enough startling moments to keep you on your toes. I genuinely enjoyed this movie, for what it's worth.

The fright is built on the sounds, the tensions, and the feeling that things are not at all well in this house. There are only a few physical manifestations in "The Haunting" and these few are enough to convince you that something is terribly wrong without going over the top as they have done in the new version.As to its adherence to the story line, this version is only very loosely based on the book. If they had not used the same character names and lifted a few lines of original dialog, it would be nearly unrecognizable from the original story. That's too bad because, being regarded as a classic horror story, it's hard to imagine how the filmmakers sought to "improve" (?) on the original by changing it so drastically.Finally, while the original has a brooding ending, this film has a basically triumphant Hollywood happy ending.

		<fullReview>The Haunting, in my opinion, did indeed live up to the original.If we look at the first "Haunting" we are messed up with psychologically, [a psychological thriller] but if we look at today's "Haunting" we see it is more visually thrilling from the first one.It is so interesting to see that they can remake a movie, and change it around so much. We have all the people coming to the house for "sleep disorders" not knowing that they have been there to be scared. In the first one, they know they are there to be subjected to the supernatural, as odd occurances have happened in their lives.There were some lines from the first one in the new one, such as Mrs. Dudley's lines about no one coming after dark, and altered ones such as, "You know I don't have an apartment!" and things like that.The trickiness of this movie though, is that because it is so visual you are looking for the big things, such as the statuettes moving around, instead, look for little things.. such as, a painting a necklace, and a quick glance at a statue.The only thing that through me off was the continuity problem- in the first dinner scene we see Theo filling up everyone's wine glasses, but she doesn't appear to have filled up Nell's. So, we see that Nell's glass is half empty, then when we get back to Nell, her glass is full. Unlike the critics I think that this is the movies only flaw, I loved it.Although the story line has been drastically altered, we still have the characters we love, [Lilli Taylor has a striking resemblance to the Nell in the first movie!] and the same haunted house [name wise, not look wise] and we fall amist under its spell as we watch it take shape into things it is not.I do recommend however, that you watch the first one before you go see the new one, it's fun noticing all the things they used from the first one, and they are both wonderful, and full of thrills!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was one of the worst movies ever made. It ranks right with "Twister," and "Friday the 13th Part VIII," which this movie resembles. This movie was one of the clumsiest, most obvious, and down-right funny horror movies that I have ever seen. The person I saw this with told be to hush because my laughter was disturbing the rest of the people. But, the movie is not all bad.Plot: Great plot. I am sorry but the plot is one of the creepier plots ever made. They mangled it though. The idea that a house where a man hunted children, and a distant relative saves their spirits is pretty good. This was done from a book, and is a remade movie. I have not seen the original, but since it had a different director, and special effects that couldn't try to steal the show, it must be better.Acting: I loved Lily Taylor. As Eleanor, she was wonderful. However, the rest of the cast needed a little help. Owen Wilson was decent, but Zeta-Jones, although very nice to look at, was too outlandish in this movie. Liam was way to obvious for me. Lily Taylor was good as a person suffering from true delusions, and almost breaking-down. She should act her way into a better movie.Special Effects: Nice to look at but too much. I mean, they were the most obvious effects imaginable. The roof beating, the spirits in the drapes, and the pointy things on the bed were too obvious. However, it also suffered from the "Gee, how could I have missed that" syndrome. The room that resembled her mother's room was a direct result of that. The eyes in her room were also direct results of that. The only thing that worked in my opinion was Mr. Frosty. You'll know what I mean, as the guy in the window.Dialogue: Horrible. Not much else to say.Direction: Blunt, obvious, and horrid. He set everything up early. The revealing of the fear experiment would have been a nice discovery/twist late in the movie. The guy in the pond was too obvious. Nothing shocked me, or made me scream. I laughed at some of the things, like the fireplace.Sound: Louder than a rock concert. I can hear the movie in the next theater. Really, I saw "Eyes Wide Shut" and I heard the rumbling from the theater. Prepare for loud decibels. Also unnecessary low rumbling is constant through the movie. It got annoying. One cool effect is you hear the house quietly settling, and it goes from the back of the theater to the front. That was cool.The house rocked, and I want to live there. But, I laughed through the movie. It is blunt, obvious, and you will laugh at the bland attempts to scare you. It is like going to a haunted house in October, everything jumps at you, and it does not work. However, I laugh at those houses, as I laughed at the movie. For making me laugh--------3</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comment comes from a guy that wasn't too impressed with the original telling of the story back in 1963 (Robert Wise). I thought the casting was fine, the house was more beautiful that scary, and the special effects made the film seem more beautiful than anything else. There were probably one or two time when I felt "spooked", but other than that, I almost fell asleep. Then again, it takes a lot to frighten me :). Then again...my date thought it was pretty lame as well. You decide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They hyped the movie with "from the director of Speed," what they didn't tell you was that De Bont also directed the sea-going waste-of-celluloid known as Speed 2! Like the marketing tagline, this movie was "born bad." Sure the effects were pure ILM, but they couldn't save the proverbial sinking ship. The characters were awful (Liam--why?!?), all stereotypes, the direction and camera angles tried oh-so-hard to inspire fear but didn't, and the acting was awful. And this chubby lady sitting behind me kept gaffawing every two seconds. Was that a horror flick or a comedy? No, it was so cheesy it was funny. All in all, I'm glad I know the manager of the local cineplex and didn't have to pay for the ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie starts out quite slow,by the last half hour I couldn't even get up from my chair to go to the bathroom it was as interesting. "The Haunting" is very scary and do not be fooled by the PG-13 rating, because it is way to intense for little kids. The film is one of the better that I have seen this year. I'd give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

The original movie created an ominous mood by not revealing what was behind all the frightening events. This version shows the watcher everything that is going on but chooses to rely on cheap overused scare tactics in a futile attempt to create a dark mood.

		<fullReview>Seldom has Hollywood produced as utterly wrongheaded a remake as this. Probably only the 70s KING KONG comes close--and at least that had a sense of humor. Shirley Jackson's original novel is one of the pinnacles of horror fiction and as for the 1963 Robert Wise film--it resides comfortable at the top of my list of the best horror films of all time. Unlike the '63 original, this year's model feels compelled to make all of its scares MIND-NUMBINGLY LITERAL. House haunted by the ghosts of murdered children? HEY...LOOK...THOSE 35 BUSTS OF CHERUBIC LITTLE KIDS ARE COVERING THEIR FACES IN CGI TERROR! Neurotic Eleanor can't sleep because her invalid Mom used to POUND ON THE WALL WITH HER CANE! Which her annoying little nephew GETS TO DEMONSTRATE FOR US! Just like THE BANGING ON THE BEDROOM DOOR IN THE NIGHT THAT WAS REALLY SCARY IN THE ORIGINAL, BUT IS NOW JUST THE BEGINNING OF A LONG SLIDE DOWN INTO UTTER TEDIUM. If ever a movie was doomed to failure by the hiring of a director, this is it. Jan De Bont has displayed no understanding whatsoever of psychology or nuance or...hell, let's call a spade a spade...of acting in his directorial career to date. The whole project is an overblown and patronizing mess, only slightly redeemed by some beautiful sets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie that falls apart halfway...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere halfway in the movie it just goes straight downhill. The special effects were one of the redeeming parts of the movie, along with the acting of Lili Taylor. The buildup of the story was done nicely but it became absurd as we begin to find out how Nel is connected to Hill House. The ending was completely predictable. There was also no real development of any other character asides from Nel. The little subplot of sexual tension between her and Theo appears and disappears as quickly without much relevance. By the end of the movie I was hoping that it would be over already. If you don't mind paying $9.50 for a mediocre film w/special effects as its main feature then this is for you.</fullReview>

I was also mad that the TV previews say only Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones's names when Lili Taylor's character was the lead! Yeah, sure, she's an independent film queen, but at least give her some "big-studio" credit!Well, anyway, the movie was good in some ways, and it was bad in some ways. It was bad that the special effects weren't very scary, but in the original, it was scary with no SFX whatsoever. Also, the best moment that was in the original was NOT INCLUDED (the hand-holding scene)! It was good because it did not have a single F-word in it and there was minimal gore. Also, it was a little scary with the startle sounds and the sound effects (scary sounds were the best part of the movie.) It was still kind of scary, but I still think that the original is best. Also, don't go to the movie expecting Liam Neeson and CZJ to be leads, expect Lili Taylor. She was great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but not terribly frightening, cinematic romp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting was an exciting, fast-paced horror film, based on a short story by Shirley Jackson, that was previously adapted for the screen in the 60s.It features a great cast, including the stalwart Liam Neeson and the sultry Catherine Zeta-Jones, and also turns great performances out of Lili Taylor and Armageddons's Owen Wilson. The frenetic, energized direction of Jan De Bont is fully realized throughout The Haunting, and while it is a great leap over 1997's dreadful Speed 2, it is still not a perfect film.It should be said that the thrill factor is terrific, and the special effects are top notch, but The Haunting is not thoroughly scary. You may notch your eyebrow, or jump slightly in your seat, but you will never once become enthralled in fear.However, despite this, I still recommend The Haunting, because it is exciting, action-packed, and features very good performances.</fullReview>

He gets up and calmly walks away showing no emotion. I thought that the story line would make a much better ghost story. This movie ruined the whole haunted house stories for me. I didn't understand why the director decided to show camera shots of completely unrelated things like water dripping off of the car. That served no point at all. Let's even assume that it was gas dripping from the car instead of water, THE CAR WAS TOTALED! This movie put me to sleep three or four times. All my friends said that I didn't miss anything.

		<shortDescription>Though in itself a moderately entertaining film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you plan on feeling fear, being constantly frightened, and shuddering from spine-tingling psychological horror...you will be sadly disappointed. Though in itself a moderately entertaining film, The Haunting proceeds with standard "horror-movie" techniques (loud noises, sudden movements, hanging bodies) and fails to succeed where the previews lead you to believe you were going.The moving children, living statues, and windows effects - once you become immersed in the story - are no longer scary because of their involvement in the plot. Cliche story development, typical plot additions, and over-used plot-devices slowly begin to weed away at a potentially great film.Towards the end of the movie you feel cheated at having believed that you were seeing a mind-tingling, spine-chilling movie and thrust into a fear-lacking and story-boring standard "horror flick". Worst yet is the actual ending. The defeat of the "villain" is an overdrawn scene with a "whole lot of nothing" going on.Overall the effects were absolutely brilliant, but over-used. It seemed that some scenes had no reason to be used other than for the presentation of "special effects"...something too many films suffer from today. The acting was excellent, but the end of the movie pollutes these great characters with useless actions balanced with just as useless lines of dialogue. The word "cheesy" came to mind more than once. If you are expecting nothing more than "another horror movie" then you should enjoy "The Haunting". For those hoping for something different, let's hope that the "Blair Witch Project" can deliver.</fullReview>

The film plays on the "psychological terror" alittle too much. Sometimes it works, sometimes, it doesn't. The pacing was all wrong. I wish Jan DeBont and writer David Self didn't count on the loud poundings so much. It makes you wonder why the ghost would do the things he did. There's no real explanation. After finding out what the movie was about:It's about childrens' souls being tormented, even in death, by the ex-owner of the house.I wanted the movie to be about something else, but it does good with what it's got.

		<fullReview>I'm saddened that such great talent from all aspects of film production went into creating such a lackluster "blockbuster." With the exception of Jan De Bont(whose ONLY good movie is Speed), they had a stellar crew on this movie; why did it have to be so bad? Worse dialogue would be very hard to write. Worse hack directing would be even harder to do. I hope Liam Neeson, Jerry Goldsmith, and the other true talents trapped in this catastrophe can put this production behind them. Liam, I suppose, did the best he could with the "material" given him. Jerry Goldsmith, one of the pioneers of film scoring, turns in an overly elaborate and unoriginal score that completely lacks in subtlety. Please, lay off the "cheap" scares. I mean, I like them as much as the next guy, but why don't you try something original or, at least, a scare that actually stays with the audience after they leave the theater to cap off all the "cheaper" thrills(sudden loud noises, things jumping out, etc.)? Jan De Bont: stop making movies like this. You can do better. You're 1 for 4 right now, headed straight down. If they'd only try something different for a change... Kudos to Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez III; at least the Blair Witch Project was unlike any "scary" movie I've ever seen, even for those who didn't like it. I am annoyed and saddened that I paid money to see the Haunting; most people with at least half a brain should be too.</fullReview>

Though the FX were quite brilliant (DreamWorks, SKG rocks), they did not embellish on anything that was the least bit scary. Liam Neisson was under-used and mis cast and the supporting cast was adequate at best.Though the premise of most horror films are usually quite flimsy, this movie makes Jason Vorheeves and Freddy Kruger seem as though they were born from Academy Award quality scripts.Sorry there is not much of a plot summary here, but, alas, there was none.

		<fullReview>I mean WAY better. I already had a lot of respect for the original as a neat little 60's horror flick but this movie made it look even better in comparison. Why didn't they leave it alone? It didn't help that the original was a classic. But they messed up here. I hardly ever say this, but the effects were overdone--they didn't make up for the putrid script or lack of scares. There was only one moment when I jumped and that was because everyone else in the theater screamed and scared me. Plenty of people were laughing at parts that were not supposed to be funny--not a good sign. There was just no excuse for the amazingly stupid line, "It's about family!" which would make you wince under any circumstances but came at what was supposed to be the climax of the film. The house is supposed to look old, but it is so obvious that it was just created by a set designer or is CGI. Really not very scary. The sound was good, I'll give it that, but that was about it. The writers obviously just threw in Theo's character being bisexual because they knew the guys who think Zeta-Jones is hot would get off on it--unlike the novel, where there is a point to it. Really, see a matinee--if you really MUST see it, that is, which I do not recommend--and see it while the theaters are still packed, which makes it more of a thrill ride. All the so called 'scares' and CGI in this film put together do not even measure up to be 10% as scary as the scene in the original where Nell thinks Theo is holding her hand in bed but turns on the light to see her friend across the room, who had been asleep in her own bed. I had a bad feeling about this movie when I saw the trailer months ago that featured the tagline "Some Houses Are Born Bad". Should have stuck with my original instincts on this one and saved my time and my 7+ bucks. Do yourself a favor and rent the original instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Haunting" plays more like a made-for-tv movie than a big-budget hollywood film. The ending is one that's so simple and disappointing, I was let down. The film plays on the "psychological terror" alittle too much. Sometimes it works, sometimes, it doesn't. The pacing was all wrong. I wish Jan DeBont and writer David Self didn't count on the loud poundings so much. It makes you wonder why the ghost would do the things he did. There's no real explanation. After finding out what the movie was about:It's about childrens' souls being tormented, even in death, by the ex-owner of the house.I wanted the movie to be about something else, but it does good with what it's got. A minor recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm saddened that such great talent from all aspects of film production went into creating such a lackluster "blockbuster." With the exception of Jan De Bont(whose ONLY good movie is Speed), they had a stellar crew on this movie; why did it have to be so bad? Worse dialogue would be very hard to write. Worse hack directing would be even harder to do. I hope Liam Neeson, Jerry Goldsmith, and the other true talents trapped in this catastrophe can put this production behind them. Liam, I suppose, did the best he could with the "material" given him. Jerry Goldsmith, one of the pioneers of film scoring, turns in an overly elaborate and unoriginal score that completely lacks in subtlety. Please, lay off the "cheap" scares. I mean, I like them as much as the next guy, but why don't you try something original or, at least, a scare that actually stays with the audience after they leave the theater to cap off all the "cheaper" thrills(sudden loud noises, things jumping out, etc.)? Jan De Bont: stop making movies like this. You can do better. You're 1 for 4 right now, headed straight down. If they'd only try something different for a change... Kudos to Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez III; at least the Blair Witch Project was unlike any "scary" movie I've ever seen, even for those who didn't like it. I am annoyed and saddened that I paid money to see the Haunting; most people with at least half a brain should be too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting was, in as few of words as possible, really - very - unbelievably - with out question, the worse movie (that had hype) that I have seen this summer.How, you may ask? Well, for starters, the plot was non-existent. There was some plot about the main character being the great, great, great, great, great grand daughter to some malicious evil man who tortured and murdered children. Apparently this is the same man who, though dead and a ghost, picked up a phone and suggested that the lead maiden check into a psychological experiment that would lead to Hill House. Nothing at all in this movie made any sense. I love a good scare and I am unquestionably a die-hard horror fan, but I would rather sit at home and watch MST3K than sit through this mostly boring film.The lead up to the "scary" stuff was much more tense than the actual "horror" scenes in the movie. Though the FX were quite brilliant (DreamWorks, SKG rocks), they did not embellish on anything that was the least bit scary. Liam Neisson was under-used and mis cast and the supporting cast was adequate at best.Though the premise of most horror films are usually quite flimsy, this movie makes Jason Vorheeves and Freddy Kruger seem as though they were born from Academy Award quality scripts.Sorry there is not much of a plot summary here, but, alas, there was none. Two words of advice... SKIP IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original was better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean WAY better. I already had a lot of respect for the original as a neat little 60's horror flick but this movie made it look even better in comparison. Why didn't they leave it alone? It didn't help that the original was a classic. But they messed up here. I hardly ever say this, but the effects were overdone--they didn't make up for the putrid script or lack of scares. There was only one moment when I jumped and that was because everyone else in the theater screamed and scared me. Plenty of people were laughing at parts that were not supposed to be funny--not a good sign. There was just no excuse for the amazingly stupid line, "It's about family!" which would make you wince under any circumstances but came at what was supposed to be the climax of the film. The house is supposed to look old, but it is so obvious that it was just created by a set designer or is CGI. Really not very scary. The sound was good, I'll give it that, but that was about it. The writers obviously just threw in Theo's character being bisexual because they knew the guys who think Zeta-Jones is hot would get off on it--unlike the novel, where there is a point to it. Really, see a matinee--if you really MUST see it, that is, which I do not recommend--and see it while the theaters are still packed, which makes it more of a thrill ride. All the so called 'scares' and CGI in this film put together do not even measure up to be 10% as scary as the scene in the original where Nell thinks Theo is holding her hand in bed but turns on the light to see her friend across the room, who had been asleep in her own bed. I had a bad feeling about this movie when I saw the trailer months ago that featured the tagline "Some Houses Are Born Bad". Should have stuck with my original instincts on this one and saved my time and my 7+ bucks. Do yourself a favor and rent the original instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a simple plot that movies today are missing. There's no corporate businessman that steals a nuclear weapon from the US Air Force that sets a diversion from the blah-blah war, just a handful of people in a scary house. Watching the first half of this made me feel like I was watching a movie version of "Resident Evil" (no, I'm not a video game freak). Some scenes had me jumping out of my seat (really). However, after the first half, I found myself staring at my watch and looking around. Bottom line: If this was a 30-minute "Tales From the Crypt" episode, it would've been AWESOME, but stretching this to a 2-hour movie was WAY over the line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a word: Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In some cases, less is more. In this case, it certainly would have been better. Being a fan of the original "Haunting" from 1963 (and of the book), I was hoping for a little more subtlety, but unfortunately EVERYTHING is on display here. But it might not have been so bad if the CGI ghosts were not so...dumb-looking. And the ending was a little too Disney-esque for me. Although this is just my opinion, a haunted house movie, particularly in a house that was "born bad" does not necessarily need a "happy" ending (especially one that seemed so contrived). But it certainly wasn't all bad. The house is incredible, and I thought the sounds and music were first-rate. There were a few good effects too. I'd just like to use my imagination a little more and not have everything spelled out for me. Maybe a slightly more literal interpretation of the original storyline (from the book that is) would have worked better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable remake of a scarier movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Haunting" in the same week that I viewed "The Blair Witch Project." It probably would have been better for me to see this movie first, since "Blair Witch" was so much more effective at being scary, it probably ruined this experience for me. I watched, predicting most of what would happen, when things were about to jump out at people or objects would fly around the room. "Blair Witch" was largely unpredictable, in that the characters behaved realistically, like they were really in the unpleasant situation of being pursued by supernatural forces. The characters in "The Haunting" are bound more or less by the demands of the script to behave in remarkably stupid ways, considering the position they are in.That's not to say "The Haunting" is a bad movie. It is surprisingly entertaining. It is one of the few movies I have seen where the location upstages the actors. The plot, involving psychiatrist Professor Morrow (Liam Neeson) luring unsuspecting insomnaics to the mansion under the pretense of a sleep study while actually conducting a study of fear, is really just an excuse to get these people together in the house.The most interesting character is Nell, played by Lili Taylor, and the movie is sort of her story. Her mother just passed away, and she is about to be evicted from her apartment by her uncaring sister and her husband. Her life has more or less led up to this moment, and she harbors a secret about her past that even she doesn't know about. The other characters involve a bisexual named Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and a smarmy guy named Luke (Owen Wilson). Theo spends a good part of the movie making advances on Nell and fending off advances from Luke. Luke is there to investigate the strange noises because the women, true to movie fashion, are too scared to do so on their own.Trust me, the characters are not the reason to see the movie. The real reason is the house. This is the best horror movie house I have seen. There are several high-angled shots of the exterior (an old mansion in England that now serves as a university campus, I am told) which effectively set the mood. The interior is full of bizarre sculptures of griffins, demons and lions. Cherubic children decorate the fireplace in Nell's room. The walk-in fireplace is almost like another character in the movie. I had a great time just looking at the sets in this movie.I more or less could not really care about what happened to the characters, which ruined whatever scary moments the film dished out. "Blair Witch" frightened me because it was shot from the perspective of the characters directly through the camera lens they used. "The Haunting" makes its audience observers to the action. This is the standard Hollywood approach, and I don't knock it. Not every movie can be a "Blair Witch." But you have to care about what happens to the characters to be scared by what happens on screen. The special effects are nicely-done and convincing, but failed to really shake me up.I guess I would recommend the movie to people who like good set design and don't mind looking around a ridiculous plot and passable acting. People familiar with the 1963 movie of the same name, which I found much scarier may not like it so much. Neither will fans of the Shirley Jackson story, "The Haunting of Hill House" that inspired both movies. I would suggest it to people with an eye for good architecture, on a rainy day when they have nothing better to do. Call that an endorsement if you will.</fullReview>

The reason it was scarier then Scream and all the horror movies in recent years is because you were made to imagine the danger and the menacing ghosts around the whole mansion.

		<fullReview>While waiting for the film to start, I commented to the person I was with "It can't be scarier than the first one." I was dead wrong! While the 1999 movie was far different than the black and white version that had kept me up every night for a month after first seeing it, it was terrifying. The house literally came alive in this movie, not merely implied as in it's predecessor. Lifeless objects move. Walls move. Everything moves, and you don't want to move out of your seat, you're so scared. The legend and story of Hill House itself added an edge that would have made the special effects seem lame and pointless. I heard a few people in the back row of the theatre laughing themselves silly, but I wasn't going to let their lack of imagination ruin it for me. Don't let the bad reviews ruin it for you. Watch it in the dark with the volume up. It was worth my movie ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It serves me right, really. From the director of such "classic" bad movies like "Speed" and "Twister" comes an overlong, pointless, and terribly written and acted remake of the 1963 movie of the same title.A group of disturbed insomniacs are led to Hill House under false pretenses by a doctor (Liam Neeson) doing a psychological study, only to find that the house is haunted by the spirits of people who died there many years before. If the story sounds unoriginal, that's because it is. Like all remakes, it attempts to modernize the older movie by giving it bigger name actors, better special effects, and a more modern script. And inevitably, it looses all effect the first movie had in the process. While the first "Haunting" was more of a psychological horror movie, this new one is all special effects, a few creepy moments, and nothing else. The acting is terrible, which is a real burn considering the cast (headed by Liam Neeson, who I hope was well paid for this). If you take away the movies impressive special effects, than all you have is a third rate script rahashed from countless other hunted house movies ten times better than this. Even "House" was better.</fullReview>

But I really wanted some serious scares and they just didn't come. The acting was fine, and as always, Catherine Jones looks as nice as the special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, when I see a horror movie, I expect to have AT LEAST one the following reactions: excitement, fear, surprise, or humor (even some of the most grim movies have some humor). This movie surprised me maybe once (with the familiar something springs out of somewhere unexpectedly trick) ... there was a little humor, but as for excitement or fear ... not much of that there.

		<shortDescription>A film that tries to go deep and creep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting displays stunning sets, eerie and sometimes pretty realistic special effects. It has a beautiful Catherine Zeta Jones, a talented Liam Neeson, and a reasonable Lili Taylor as Eleanor. The film begins slow and gradually speeds up. Actually, I feel the slow paced area was the better half of the film. The scenes that are supposed to be truly frightening, aren't, and the only moment where the audience is shocked is at the jack-in-the-box scares which come every so often. It's also hard to enjoy a film that is supposed to be terrifying horror, and five year old children line the aisles. The few scenes that are memorable are too few and far appart. The film basically just relies on special effects, which do not make a movie. If you want to see a creepy, intelligent, and ultimately chilling film this summer, see the Blair Witch Project. If you want a so-so, special effects filled movie with a really cheaply bad ending, see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Haunting Disappointment (5 out of 10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the quick take... pretty decent special effects; a beautiful house; great performance by Zeta Jones but lackluster Liam Neeson; somewhat confusing script; weak story with lots of holes in the plot; hokey ending.The truth is, this film could have been scary, but wasn't. The ghost had a good deal of menace, but the explanation of what he did in life is scant and doesn't give the viewer a sense of creepiness or horror that you'd expect an evil ghost to give. Hence, the audience laughed a couple of times where laughter wasn't really called for. This was also due to the lackluster plot, which contained some cheezy lines. I could go into how some of the various effects were nice but misguided (a ghost who can turn statues to life could easily dispose of house guests without the elaborate nonsense as seen in the bedroom/ceiling/spike sequence). As for the acting, Neeson's understated acting was perfect for "The Phantom Menace" but here seems ineffectual. Zeta Jones is great, and Taylor does a solid job.When the movie ended I felt strangely unsatisfied. Movies like the Haunting have a way of creating hype and promise in previews, and most always have a way of being a disappointment. It's too bad, because there was great potential here. If you're really looking for scary, go see "The Blair Witch Project".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film very skeptical. I figured that it was going to be a cheap Hollywood horror film designed to deliver profits and not much else. I was wrong. Though it starts just a little bit slow, once the action gets going it doesn't let up. The special effects used in the curtains and the stone creatures is fantastic. As far as spirits and ghosts go, it's no Exorcist, but it is a decent horror film with scares guaranteed to make you jump in your seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to walk out of this movie. I stayed in, hoping that the ending would redeem the rest of it. It did the exact opposite. The chaotic, loud ending was basically the effects people having fun playing with their computers. The only scary thing about this is the thought of all horror movies turning into 'THE MATRIX with a monster.' The movie had one (maybe two) creepy parts and a jump or two, but it almost doesn't even fit in the horror genre. The story was confusing and not worth caring about. The acting was up to par, but the actual characters weren't worth getting into the movie for. Owen Wilson's character was hilarious and well-played too. His performance was probably the best part of the movie - not a good sign.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the good points of the film. It was visually gorgeous, incredible in fact. Some of the best sets ever. The actors were well chosen and did a good job of things. Catherine Zeta Jones especially was marvellous in her role, playing it with obvious relish.The special effects were middling; slightly unconvincing, plus, as is all too often these days, YOU'VE SEEN THEM ALL (almost) IN THE TRAILER.The script, however, sucks. All the time is spent in setup, and the payoff is pathetic and over WAY too quickly. Kudos to the writer/director/studio for not slavishly following the who lives/who dies formula for horror movies so perfectly captured by 'Scream' -- but that's all the credit they're going to get from me. The ending is all too pat and too easy, and doesn't make enough sense. There are some good lines, but the overall structure is bad, and one leaves with a sense of dissatisfaction with the entire thing. I really hope that the flaws are due to overzealous cutting or meddling -- if the original script was that bad, I'm amazed they ever started to make the movie, and spend that much on it.</fullReview>

From the launch of truly captivating trailers, through interviews I'd seen of reputable talents like Catherine Zeta-Jones and Liam Neesom, this film -- along with the "Blair Witch Project" -- promised to mark the summer of '99 as the season in which intelligence made its long-awaited return to the horror genre. What was offered by Dreamworks was (another) CGI-riddled, thinly acted waste of time, money, talent and celluloid. An abuse of special effects may spook your 5-year-old and dazzle your 11-year-old, but the most frightening thing about "The Haunting" to any movie-going adult likely will be its $75 million price tag.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was watching "THE HAUNTING" I was trying to compare this movie to one of the best haunted house thriller's of all time, THE SHINING (Kubrick's version, thank you). But the movie that came to my mind wasn't THE SHINING, it was another haunted house classic, POLTERGEIST. In THE SHINING, Kubrick used creepy music, scary scenes, and terrific acting to make THE SHINING one of the most scary movies of all time. In POLTERGEIST, Tobe Hopper and Steven Spielberg used visual effects to scare up the audience. THE HAUNTING does what Hooper and Spielberg did 17 years ago, to try and scare today's audience. And does it work? Well yes it does. The plot has a scientist, Dr. Jeffrey Marrow (Liam Nesson) who brings three people who suffer from insomnia to the gigantic and mysterous Hill House. One is a beauty (Catherine Zeta Jones), one a some kind of jester (Owen Wilson), the other a sensitive and depressed woman who just lost her sick mother after years of being taken care of and years of being ill (Lili Taylor). While they stay at Hill House, there are mysterous sounds going on at night, and scary voices crying for help. That is when THE HAUNTING works, it's creepy scenes. And they are pretty creepy. It's not a jump out and scare you surprise scary, it's more of a slowly approaching you scary, then it strikes you. There are some pretty creepy scenes in this film, and with the visual effects, they help quite a bit. The production design (by Eugenio Zanetti) is fabulous! I have never seen such a beautiful, mysterous, and scary house. I won't be surprised if Zanetti is going to pick up another Oscar award for this film, he did a fantastic job! The visual effects are also quite good, they look more realistic than your average "computer-generated" film. And the acting by all of the leds (especially Lili Taylor) do a good job. The only thing that doesn't work for THE HAUNTING is the pacing, and the story. The pacing picks up speed, then slows down, it picks up speed again, then it slows down. Director Jan De Bont has made one of the fasted paced films of all time (SPEED) why didn't he make this a fast paced scary horror film?

		<fullReview>We'll I've been waitin to see this movie, it seems like forever, and now that I have I gotta say I'm very satisfied. I loved the atmosphere. It starts out extremely beautiful, you almost want to see this house for yourself. but I'll tell you, your glad you'll never set foot in it by the end! I loved how everything focused on one main character, this poor girl and everyones reactions towards the house's repeated attempts to get her. As much as I loved this movie, I do wish they had done certain aspects of it better. The movie seemed to start at a very unhurried pace, Pulling us into it. We get to enjoy the character's reactions to the house. I think one of my favorite parts to this movie are the ones that involve everyones reactions to Nell when they think she has snapped. Though, I do believe the ending to this movie is quite hurried and left a lot to be desired. The ending felt extremely rushed through, almost like they didn't know exactly how to resolve it so they spent most of the movies time in the "getting to the end" parts that were wonderful, because they knew the ending wouldn't live up to the rest of the movie. It needed to be longer and they needed to touch onto more aspects of the plot than they did, instead of slamming it to a halt. Nell's speech to the " bad guy" at the end is even a little bit silly! But the ending didn't stink, it was even pretty cool, it just could have been better. The movie as a whole was great, and there were no parts in it that detracted from the enjoyment of it. I totally recommend this movie to anyone!</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong, the special effects were incredible but they completely undercut the suspense of the whole film. It is obvious very early on (fifteen minutes into the two hour movie) that the house is in fact haunted, which kind of takes the fun out of it. However the actors do an excellent job and for the most part, the script is pretty good. Owen Wilson is hysterical and it's worth seeing just for the amazing sets. If you want real suspense, check out the original Haunting of Hill House.</fullReview>

I thought this film was going to be a masterpiece.On the other hand, the second half of the film is sometimes silly (but never boring) most of it because of the digital special effects excess.Finally, I must say that I enjoyed the movie but it would be more powerful if the spirits were suggested instead of being shown to the audience.

		<shortDescription>Fun but inconsistent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me get this out of the way: I am head over heels in love with Catherine Zeta-Jones. So I admittedly give this film more leeway than I might with another actress in the role.Having said that...THE HAUNTING is a fun ride. Outstanding visual effects, great use of sound, amazing sets. Some hokey dialogue (mostly from Lily Taylor's character and progressively more of it as the movie goes on) and some thin plot points hamper what was otherwise a good light-hearted scare. Some of the early scenes and dialogue are very self-effacing and tongue-in-cheek. The welcome-to-the-house speech from the caretaker's wife is hilarious. If that tone had been maintained throughout, so much the better. Sadly, half the cast plays it straight. Would have appreciated a more consistent tone from director Jan DeBont.Worth seeing for the effects. Some decent frights. It'll make you look at your own house differently. Just don't expect serious white-knuckle terror.One nagging question: why is it pointed out that CZJ's character is bisexual? It plays no role in the plot or story. Seems an odd detail to point out so blatantly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was watching "THE HAUNTING" I was trying to compare this movie to one of the best haunted house thriller's of all time, THE SHINING (Kubrick's version, thank you). But the movie that came to my mind wasn't THE SHINING, it was another haunted house classic, POLTERGEIST. In THE SHINING, Kubrick used creepy music, scary scenes, and terrific acting to make THE SHINING one of the most scary movies of all time. In POLTERGEIST, Tobe Hopper and Steven Spielberg used visual effects to scare up the audience. THE HAUNTING does what Hooper and Spielberg did 17 years ago, to try and scare today's audience. And does it work? Well yes it does. The plot has a scientist, Dr. Jeffrey Marrow (Liam Nesson) who brings three people who suffer from insomnia to the gigantic and mysterous Hill House. One is a beauty (Catherine Zeta Jones), one a some kind of jester (Owen Wilson), the other a sensitive and depressed woman who just lost her sick mother after years of being taken care of and years of being ill (Lili Taylor). While they stay at Hill House, there are mysterous sounds going on at night, and scary voices crying for help. That is when THE HAUNTING works, it's creepy scenes. And they are pretty creepy. It's not a jump out and scare you surprise scary, it's more of a slowly approaching you scary, then it strikes you. There are some pretty creepy scenes in this film, and with the visual effects, they help quite a bit. The production design (by Eugenio Zanetti) is fabulous! I have never seen such a beautiful, mysterous, and scary house. I won't be surprised if Zanetti is going to pick up another Oscar award for this film, he did a fantastic job! The visual effects are also quite good, they look more realistic than your average "computer-generated" film. And the acting by all of the leds (especially Lili Taylor) do a good job. The only thing that doesn't work for THE HAUNTING is the pacing, and the story. The pacing picks up speed, then slows down, it picks up speed again, then it slows down. Director Jan De Bont has made one of the fasted paced films of all time (SPEED) why didn't he make this a fast paced scary horror film? Instead he tries to blend both the horror/effects with the plot. And the plot of this movie is the film's weakest point. The plot is pretty thin and silly compare to the set designs and visual effects. You figure that with sets and effects like these, that the plot would be somewhat intelligent. At least on the same intellegence level as POLTERGEIST, but it isn't. Overall, I'm sure people are going to be asking, "is this scarier than THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT?" My answer, "no." But that doesn't make this a horrible film, it's still worth watching, but I would suggest to pay a matinee price. Also, many might be upset that this film got a "PG13" rating. Well, for a PG13 rated film, it's pretty darn strong. I'm surprised that Jan De Bont got away with this rating. But most of the reason the film is rated PG13 is for it's intense scenes, and violence, there is no sex and only one use of profanity. This is a o.k. summer film, but not a horror classic that many people were expecting it to be. *** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fairly good remake of the original film, but where the first film relied on camera angles and editing to frighten you, this one hits you in the face with special effects and leaves you thinking, wow, that was interesting. Effects, in themselves, are not frightening - they just make you decide if yes, it was pretty realistic or no, it was pretty fake. I found the first film creepy due to its lack of explanation. The remake was tiresome because it tried to explain everything and make the horror a physical entity. I'd give it a C+. It follows the first film fairly faithfully for the first half, but begins to misfire as the special effects take over in the second half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original film of Shirley Jackson's seminal horror novel was a masterpiece of suggestion, its frisson of fear coming from the expectation of what might be just about to happen rather than, wallop, here it is, now look at it.Many of the classic black and white movies have been remade in colour in the (often justified) belief that a modern audience won't watch monochrome movies. The Haunting didn't escape.This remake, blessed with living colour, glorious set design, and state of the art special effects, does away with suggestion and dumps its supernatural manifestations right in your lap. It also does away with subtlety and, sadly, what might have been its saving grace, heart.What is left is a generic, going through the motions, last man standing haunted house movie which flounders and ultimately sinks under the weight of its voluminous and largely unnecessary special effects.If you've never seen the original then you may well enjoy it. But once you've watched it, seek out its predecessor: you deserve to.</fullReview>

It's surely what happened with me when i watched Hantise for the first time ten years ago, i wanted to watch it these days for remember it.I remember it was scary so i turn off the lights and started to watch it at 11p.m. The first hour was good, many scenes are stressing for example when an invisible force hit the room door during night or when the head of the statues suddenly look at the girl sleeping whereas they didn't do before.The second hour was pretty ridiculous especially the special effects like the spirit of the householder which attack the main protagonist, Lili Taylor. Also, i'm disappointed of the acting of Catherine Zeta-Jones who is an actress as i like, but she looks silly on this movie and she more appears like a secondary role.Don't watch this movie for be scared, you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the classic 1963 movie "The Haunting" about a team of paranormal experts who look into strange occurrences in an ill-fated house. Through the course of the night some will unravel, some will question, and all will fight for their lives as the house fights back.Some people might not be afraid of random noises or echoes by no one or blood foot prints on the floor or even just how a place looks. Well, others, on the other hand, are afraid of those things, and that includes me. This movie basically scares people by using some creepy noises, chilling moans, and some great special effects to achieve the scares.And it works. I love these kinds of films! I love haunted house movies! Unfortunately, I saw "Scary movie 2" first, which spoofs most of this movie. Still, I was frightened. I will also praise this movie for the great special effects and the extensive and elaborate set designs, which I found really amazing.The performances are great, by the way, although sometimes awkward by Lili Taylor. Apart from that, I liked the other's performances. This movie might not be scary for some but others, it will scare you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality Haunted House Yarn But Doesn't Do Justice To The Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A psychologist researching fear invites Eleanor, Theo and Luke - three insomniacs with unstable personalities - to Hill House, a forbidding Gothic mansion. When ghostly noises and spectral visions start to haunt Eleanor in particular, her fragile psyche starts to crack and her soul is in danger of being trapped forever by the evil house.This is a thrilling, scary, brilliantly-designed haunted house flick, with a good cast and fantastic spooky imagery. Its one big flaw is that as an adaptation of Shirley Jackson's classic 1959 novel The Haunting Of Hill House, it's rubbish, both in comparison to the book and the spine-tingling 1963 film version. The first third is reasonably faithful but then it goes in completely another direction, inventing a standard fairy-tale mythology and warping the lead character of Nell into someone unrecognisable. In the book she's a childish, self-obsessed, neurotic but chillingly recognisable narcissist, whereas here she's some sort of avenging ghostbuster. If you take it as a movie in its own right however, it's a lot of fun; best of all is Eugenio Zanetti's amazing production design - the house is an incredible ramble of Gothic madness, peppered with hellish gargoyles, marble columns, gargantuan spaces and bizarre decor. The cast are all good actors stuck with a slightly lame script, although Taylor really gives it her all, but it's a movie where the characters are pretty much a distraction from the marvellous sets and nifty special effects (by Phil Tippett and Craig Hayes). With exteriors shot at Harlaxton Manor in Lincolnshire, and a grandiose score by horror expert Jerry Goldsmith (The Omen, Alien, Poltergeist), this is fine horror fare, confidently lensed by Dutch former cameraman DeBont. It's scary stuff, but it's not a patch on the book, which is one of the best horror novels ever written and will leave you shivering for a week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Take: A triumph of style over substance. Many critics hate this remake of Robert Wise's classic haunted house movie because, they say, that it has little resemblance to Shirley Jackson's classic story, which it was based on. Well, the film does overemphasize the special-effects to produce thrills rather than story or the use of imagination. The film stops being Shirley Jackson's subtle haunted house story when the film itself becomes a haunted house. Well, the story does tell about a group of paranormal investigators daring themselves to live inside the old Hill House and find its mysterious remnants. But they, instead, discover a mysterious legacy of evil. The film was directed by "Twister"'s Jan De Bont, so expect it to have a lot of special-effects and a famous lead cast, save the subtlety and psychological punch of the story. What story? Screenwriter David Self leaves it to De Bont and the parade of special effects to tell the story, as if the thing never needed the screenplay. Still, THE HAUNTING is more of a second round on Disneyland's The Haunted Mansion rather than a redo of the Shirley Jackson story. The lack of imagination to tell the story is made up by the imagination used to put it on screen. The special effects leave very little to our imagination, but it's as if a large amount of imagination used to create them. Eugenio Zanetti is the real star of the show, making Hill House a triumph of style and the stuff of nightmares. All this and more, save the messed-up screenplay and uneven use of its popular cast (Owen Wilson as a paranormal investigator?), make THE HAUNTING a worthwhile, but not necessary, diversion. Rating: *** out 5.</fullReview>

It was slow at the beginning, but eventually sped up rather admirably with unique visual effects and dialog. Most of the actors/actresses gave strong performances, but definitely not all. Liam Neeson was excellent, as was Zeta-Jones (although I'm not a big fan of hers). Luke Wilson should stick to comedy. His performance was a bit unbelievable at times (as when he was supposed to be terrified).

		<fullReview>First off, I don't get some of you people. Lets just take a look at the top horror movies in this database. I mean, films from 1920-40 are among the top ones. We live in the years 2006 now, not 1930 or something. Like Nosferatu. OK, its a classic but I don't want to say its a scare, or even horror. Mostly, for me its a laugh at what people found scary back then. And its a B&amp;W. Meh...But anyway, back to this film. I rather enjoyed it. It had a very creepy atmosphere and some scare moments. The story, well. I haven't seen the original, nor do I want to, but as a horror script its OK I guess.The CGI use is excellent in this one. Quite effective use of it, like when the children manifest themselves in bedsheets and so on. The music is pure genius, but its a Goldsmith score so no surprises there.As a horror movie this one is one of the better out there. Some of the other, so-called horror-movies, or as I call them, yawn-exercises, cant even compare to it.But the only thing I think ruin the whole thing is the ending. Too predictable, and typical Hollywood. They really have to smear it to your face in this one. That was unnecessary and it would have been much better without it. But overall, a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 4 of 10. However, if you'd ask me to rate Hill House itself, I'd definitely go for 10 out of 10. The only thing I truly enjoyed about this (fancy?) remake was the house, in my humble opinion the true star of the film.The acting was so-so (though Lily Taylor did a nice job, same for Luke Wilson) and the effects were not as creepy as they should have been for a movie that's rated +16 (in Belgium this equals the 'R' rating in case you're confused)... not to mention they look 'old school'. This movie lacks soul, and the plot gives you a 'been-there-done-that' feeling. Yet I bought it on VHS, because I simply LOVE Hill House. The sets are magnificent and it's best to simply not pay attention to the action or dialogues and feast your eyes on the splendour of the rooms and hallways. The Great Hall is my favourite: with its huge empty space, creepy statues (the lions above the fireplace are much scarier than Hugh Craine's portrait...) and the large doors which, *possible SPOILER* according to Theo look like Rodin's Gates of Hell are splendid examples of Eugenio Zanetti's talent.Other than that it can and will be a boring, dull ride...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite As Haunting As You Might Expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film knowing that it might not be my cup of tea but i was willing to give it a chance knowing that Liam Neeson was starring and Jan De Bont was behind the camera.I'm watching the film but after the first hour i realise that i'm completely bored out of my skull and waiting for something good to happen but the last forty minutes provided suspense and a tiny bit of action and a lot of great CGI prove that the last forty odd minutes are the best of the film.I wasn't surprised to be not scared because of the horror films we get today couldn't scare a three year old and give him nightmares for years. This is more of a family friendly horror film that really shouldn't be classed as a horror.Liam neeson gives a fair performance as does miss Zeta Jones but Lilli Taylor is depressing as the first hour is and seems to constantly repeat the same actions of running from her bedroom to the corridor then back to her room then being scared and going into the corridor again to which i found to be craptacular. Owen Wilson well, we'll just not go there.Jan De Bont really let himself down here, from films such as 'Speed' and 'Twister' to this which i was really looking forward. Another problem is that he did not pace the film well which is perhaps another reason for this film to be such a first hour of a shambles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to the script?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how many movies i've seen that start out well but end like a train-wreck. Quite a lot of movies, i can tell you that. And still this is one of the worst i've seen.Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson) have a newspaper ad out looking for people to participate in a study about sleeping disorders. But in secret he is really doing an experiment about fear and how it affects people. Soon though it becomes apparent that the house he has chosen for his study has more than planned to offer in the ways of fear.The cast of "The Haunting" is maybe not excellent, but it does contain a lot of famous names. The budget and premise also seems perky. And yet this turns into a crap-fest before long. How did this happen? In my opinion it's mostly due to the fact that the director and script-writers know nothing about the elements of good horror film.They seem to be completely ignorant when it comes to the concept "subtle horror" and "chilling moments". Instead we are treated to a special effects-extravaganza. It starts out rather well with a house that looks simply amazing. The art direction is excellent to say the least. But soon the movie derails completely and the special effects take over. I even get the feeling of a Disney-musical sometimes when the furniture and the whole house seems to start moving. Just add the carnival music and you would have a decent live-action "Beauty and the beast". Seriously this is just too much. Instead of creeping horror they opt for shock-effects, which is almost always the wrong way to go. And it shows here.This is just another movie that shows that special effects can never replace a decent script. I rate it 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the fairly interesting start, the mildly interesting characters and the drop dead gorgeous sets I thought I might be on to something with this movie. Surely with all they had invested including the wonderful photography (okay the director is a cinematographer) I thought surely they could come across with something scary, right? Wrong! This movie was dull! Blah blah blah insert innuendo of horror and then more blah. I love Liam Neeson and I always enjoy watching his performances. And that Lily Taylor, I could just stare at her face for hours. Basically that's all I did. A screen test would have been as engrossing. Nothing spooky here. Don't waste your money unless you like watching pretty people slumming around. That was a beautiful mansion though. I'd like to spend the night there. I'll wager I'd sleep pretty well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with this movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be. It starts out like The Others, really slow, almost creepy (but not quite). Then throws that idea out and becomes a slow-paced and impotent thriller. Then away with that one; now it's a sap-fest.Whatever, this movie is lame. The effects are kinda goofy, totally ruin what little movie there would have been. Sadly, an episode of Charmed will stimulate your brain more than this load did.I gotta say tho, Catherine Zeta Jones is sure fun to look at. She's more convincing hawking cellular phones than she is in the movie. And is it me or is Lili Taylor really attractive in a jump-out-and-say-boo kind of way. I mean, I keep thinking she's not that attractive, but then I keep staring at her. I think I've convinced myself she's kinda ugly, then realize she turns me on. Wtf. Avoid this movie, it's a snore fest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Example of Good Books Being Made Into Bad Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting happened to hit the stores on DVD a week or two after I finished reading The Haunting of Hill House for the first time, a book that has since become one of my favourites. Needless to say I ran to the video store the day it came out to rent a copy, I was so excited to see a book that was still giving me nightmares turned into a movie. Unfortunately my excitement and enthusiasm ended there. The character development was lacking for some and over done for others (Theo in particular). I had also been hoping to see minimal story changes, and although I was not fond of the few changes made, there really weren't many. Lastly, while there were some scenes (few and far between) that had very well done effects, I found most of the special effects to be rather bland and only sub par. In short I'd rate this movie about 2/10 and suggest, that if you ever have to make the choice between reading the book or seeing the movie, you chose the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie because The Haunting of Hill House is one of my favorite books and I love Liam Neeson and Owen Wilson. I was sorely disappointed with this take on the story.Possible spoilersThe great thing about the book is the quiet way it builds up to the climax. The movie seems hell-bent on the startled-scare reflex unlike the book, which was truely make-you-think scary. The special effects were good, but not effective. They detracted from the story, instead of enhancing it.The acting was good, very good, in fact, but it's not enough to keep the film from running off the track like a run-away train!5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this I spent 2 precious hours in Scotland during Christmas time watching this on Channel 4. I thought to myself that this was about the worst-or, at least one of the worst-movies ever. Some of the lines and the direction were so campy, it came across as a satire of a horror movie. So when my SO came home the other night with this tucked under his arm, I figured that maybe I was being too judgmental and would give it another chance. Well, it wasn't much better. What I did do this time, was to enjoy the scenery. The mansion is pretty cool. Liam Neeson is quite dishy. Catherine Zeta Jones' spends a fair amount of time running around in lace and tall boots. Lily Taylor plays the quirky girl to the max. And Owen Wilson brings in the bad-boy humor. Imagine: a bad movie that has something for everyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why people didn't think this film was scary. To me, it was among the scariest horror films I've ever seen. Director Jan de Bont allows the tension to build up, and while there are very few scenes that make the audience jump, the whole movie is loaded with creepy sound effects and a wonderfully disturbing atmosphere, not to mention state-of-the-art computer special effects, which are used quite nicely here.No, "The Haunting" didn't freak me out as much as last year's "The Ring," but it was a helluva lot better than 1999's other horror flick, "House on Haunted Hill," which seemed to play more for cheap gore, much in the vein of "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th.""The Haunting" is an overlooked psychological thriller that keeps the tension inside you for the longest time, and at the very last minute, something pops out at you. And while it doesn't startle as much as many pictures these days, "The Haunting" knows exactly when to do it, with very little predictability.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always find it so sad when watching films like this. It always seems to be such an awful waste of a good oppurtunity. The film is quite simply not scary at all, as it progresses it just becomes a joke.The film begins well, the whole experiment idea is a good one and the characters seem strong. As they spend some time in the house i became slightly apprehensive, expecting a shock at any moment. Then it all went wrong, from the statues of children pulling faces to and evil spirit chasing someone it just left the realms of even slight realism.Overall i would say that the film had the potential to be a good one but the inclusion of certain supernatural elements left me a little disappointed. Fantastic setting though, the house was quite amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After re-reading Jackson's charming chiller about a woman being absorbed by an evil old house, and recalling fond memories of the brilliant 1963 version, I can honestly say this is not the movie it could have been. The house sets are good, the lead actress is good, that one part where a character is "accidentally" eliminated is good, but the good parts are lost in the many not so good things. All of those in-your-face special effects belong in a movie that isn't based on this story. If they wanted to do something with the novel they might have put in the characters who live in the unfortunate little town near the House, or the grounds around the structure. They weren't in the '63 version, though they were sure haunted! Robert Wise did a good trick by sticking pretty close to the story and then haunting the heck out of the audience with a sense of the unknown. Despite all of the work that went into this movie I find the sense of dread missing. The great comic timing of Bela Lugosi and Lou Costello are also missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>waste of time, money, and film stock. This is a story that needs subtlety, understatement, mood, atmosphere. Instead, all we get is yet another (extremely) dumbed down version of a story that was done better 30 years ago with less budget and no special effects. It's the type of movie that makes me resent everyone involved in it. Jan de Bont should never be allowed to direct anything again, ever. You get the feeling that the scriptwriters' thought process was "Hey, that's a neat image! CGI will make it work! Story? Just throw something together to tie the effects around and we'll have a smash!"The idiocies in the plot are too numerous to mention. The gratuitous gore and violence (which I normally don't object to) don't serve the story at all. The acting is wooden, the characters are cheap cardboard cutouts...there's just nothing good about this movie. I could go on and on, but beating up on this piece of trash is just too easy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie could have been done much better. The special effects were incredible, and the sound quality was so immersive that one should listen to it for the experience alone. But as for the story, it was pretty lame. I don't remember how many countless times Lili Taylor (As Nell) was heard saying, "but the children!" "Oh! The children!" It was so much it began to become stupid. And just how she "knew" everything from the beginning. It was irritating. As for being scary, let's put it this way. I have a girlfriend who jumps at anything. I can say, "I'm going to scare you in three seconds. 1...2...3 Boo!" And she'll still jump. This movie bored her. Special effects alone won't save a movie any more. EVERY movie has special effects, and any more, almost all of them are good. This movie seemed to forget that fact and relied it's success heavily on amazing computer generated images and such. Wasn't enough. I guess if you're in the mood for just a movie to watch, this one won't hurt. It's not going to be overly entertaining for you, but it's not the worst movie made. Just nothing to get excited over.</fullReview>

The plot had massive holes and the direction was sloppy. Of course you could forgive this if the film was actually scary. But it wasn't. It was mind bendingly dull. You never felt threatened and there were no big shocks.All the actors tried their best, except for Lili Taylor whose performance was extremely annoying, but there was nothing they could do. "The Haunting"'s extreme lameness overwhelmed them.I gave this film 3 out of 10 because I was feeling generous. Avoid it unless you are a really big fan of one of the actors and if you do decide to watch it then prepare yourself for one and a half hours of pain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first scene in this remake of The Haunting is remarkably faithful to Shirley Jackson's subtle psychological chiller, but beyond that, any resemblance is almost purely coincidental. Jan de Bont's film is a gratuitous CGI-fest, visually spectacular but utterly inane. It owes more to television's Munsters and The Addams Family (both of which are mentioned) than to Robert Wise's eerie film or Jackson's novel, but unfortunately it is no more funny than it is frightening: any episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer would beat it on both counts. Lili Taylor performs well as Eleanor, and Bruce Dern has a nice cameo, but Neeson is wooden, Wilson is miscast, Zeta-Jones might as well be a shop mannequin, and the computer-generated ghosts overact atrociously. It's passable drive-in fare, and would make a cute ride at Disneyland, but it's a clear case of too many phantoms and not enough menace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is another piece of work with an impressive cast, but also a disappointing outcome.The guy we all loved and appreciated as Oscar Schindler, Mr Liam Neeson makes a bad choice by deciding to play in this one. May be they payed him good enough to make it bearable, but its a step backwards for the talented actor.Catherine Zeta Jones, who showed everyone in movies like 'Traffic' and 'High Fidelity' that she is not just a pretty face, but also can act as good as anyone, is not as impressive as in those works of her. Including the leading actress Lily Taylor (Gaudi afternoon, Ransom, High Fidelity) and Owen Wilson (Armageddon) although none of the four are at their best, I still can say that the acting is the only thing that makes you watch it till the end.This is neither a "guys &amp; girls from school goes to a deserted camp &amp; got killed" movie, nor an old fashioned thriller. Computer tricks supposed to scare us but most of the time it does not. I think the best word for the plot is dull. Instead of being scared, you got bored. You notice some logical mistakes while you are watching and this was a huge distraction for me.The director, Jan De Bont - who I must admit is not one of my favorites - was much successful as a cinematographer by involving in movies like Lethal Weapon 3, Hunt for Red October, Flatliners, Shining Through and Die hard. But if he insists on directing than I thing he is better in Action (Speed) or disaster (Twister) movies. I am not a huge fan of those two but I definitely can rate them higher than this one.</fullReview>

Jan de Bont has been involved in some great movies, but on checking his filmography I think I spotted a thread: He's done some great looking films as a cinematographer (Die Hard, Black Rain, Hunt for Red October, Flatliners) but his films as a director (Speed, Twister, Speed2 and The Haunting) all exhibit common traits. They are much more interested in stretching the technical boundaries than the dramatic ones, and they all really just let rip with effects in the latter part of the film. This latter trait of "last reel madness" is also something I associate with James Cameron. I think Jan de Bont should stick to making other peoples movies rather than his own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I'll just say that i was genuinely interested in seeing this movie when it first came out. My best friend has seen the 1963 version and she's always said how creepy it was, so when the '99 Haunting was released we went to the movies together to check it out. Big mistake! I can't believe i actually paid good moolah to see this insomnia cure. Neither of us found it particularly scary and to add insult to injury, we were sitting just 2 rows in front of a bunch of squealing teeny boppers who all SCREAMED really loudly about every 5 minutes - every time something "scary" happened. How annoying! Anyway, onto the movie itself...I'll start with the one positive: the magnificent sets. Hill House in this film was re-created as a stunning, opulent and eerie location, ideal for a haunted house movie. What a pity the film makers didn't use this wonderful backdrop to actually deliver some genuine chills. Sadly, the majority of 'scares' were created through use of those ubiquitous CGI effects. CGI really looks quite fake and this ruined the mood of the movie for me - I just didn't get scared, or even vaguely creeped out. There didn't seem to be much of an attempt to actually build a creepy atmosphere and create some chills by letting the imagination of the viewer come into play. Instead, it's mostly all done for us, and poorly at that. The script is silly and the characterization flat at best; I won't even go into the acting, if indeed you could even call it that...My two major issues with this movie were that a. (*spoiler ahead!!*) Owen Wilson's character gets decapitated - jipped!! why? why?!?! and b. Lili Taylor's disappointing performance. I think the material she was working with obviously had a lot to do with that, but I've always thought of her as a capable actress ever since I saw her in Mary Harron's I Shot Andy Warhol. Also, she was good in an X-Files episode ('Mind's Eye') a few years back. Anyway, in summary, if you're looking for a quality ghost movie with some good acting, a solid script and - most importantly - some *decent scares*, then unfortunately The Haunting just isn't it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly, the script for this film is so typical of a studio's effort to cash in on a venerable franchise, that the movie cannot be considered even remotely scary. The special effects suffer from the "computerized" syndrome of the late nineties -- the effects are repulsively artificial-looking and the characters do not interact with them realistically. Additionally, this is one of your few chances to witness a script so bad, that Liam Neeson gets a run at the coveted "worst dramatic moment of the year" award while he is confronting the other guests about a tired plot point that nobody in the audience really cares about.There are a few bright points in this hogwash however. The sets for the house are really very well done, and should have been put to much better use than in this nonesense. The real star of this film though, was the sound effects. The effects were amazingly good for such a poorly written and directed movie.To all you Hollywood directors out there, I suggest this. If you are ever planning to make a haunted house film, get the guys who did the sound and the sets for this movie. Then methodically do the exact opposite of everything else in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crappy but somewhat interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT!NOTE: After the first 30 minutes of the movie I was planning on titling this: I LIKED IT, SO SUE ME! Then I finished it. My zeal was misplaced.Okay, yes it was crappy but I still thought it (until the end) was interesting. The mansion (Hill House) rivals The Hotel Overlook as one of the best horror movie set pieces ever used. It was absolutely beautiful (inside and out). Spiral staircases, grotesque carvings, hidden passageways, and clinging vines. It's got it all!The premise (though not original) is interesting. I love haunted houses and this one's definitely haunted! However the whole `save-our-trapped-souls-the-mean-man-is-still-being-mean-to-us-beyond-the-gr ave' thing is pretty dumb theologically. I'm at least interested in the idea of trapped souls who aren't ready to move on (What Dreams May Come) or trapped souls who can't until they've righted their wrongs but souls that are trapped simply because they'd been abused? It's the kind of stuff that is only dreamed up so some doe-eyed heroine can free them from their never ending torture.Liam was kinda wasted here. Someone with much less ability would've done just fine. Catherine ZG was her usual cute but annoying self. Owen Wilson was his usual adorably droll self (until his pointless beheading). Lili Taylor is her usual endearingly disturbed self (ala Household Saints).While there were some genuinely scary parts (Nel's face distorting in the mirror) most of the movie was pretty eventless as far as thrills and chills. This fits more into the spooky category than actually scary.Finally, for the most part, the CGI was dreadful. I do think that it can be used well but, frankly, I'm sick of it. We used to call something that looked fake, `wooden'. Then we said it looked `plastic'. Now CGI has taken fake to a new low. Most of it looks like it's dipped in mercury. The faces in the drapery were particularly annoying. And am I the only one that can spot CGI breath mist from a mile away? Perhaps actually freezing a room (Exorcist) is a little archaic but it definitely looked better. As is the case with many other new movies, you can tell that the makers were assuring each other, `Okay, I know it sounds dumb on paper but just wait'll the computer guys get to it.' Once again, their blind faith was misplaced.In conclusion, I'm glad I saw it. (if only to see my beloved Owen Wilson). Visually it was pretty opulent. But I wouldn't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shirley Jackson didn't write this . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why the producers claimed that this "new and improved" version of The Haunting (1963) was based on "The Haunting of Hill House" by Shirley Jackson is beyond me. They kept a few of the character names, but only three of the actual characters remained more or less intact: Eleanor, though significantly toned down and "stabilized"; Mrs. Dudley; and the lesbolicious Theo. The other characters were completely rewritten, as was the entire plot. It really would have been easier to change a few names and call it a new story.This high-budget B-movie manages to obliterate the psychological terror of the novel, which was followed relatively well in the 1963 version of The Haunting. 1963 gave me chills without any visual special effects to speak of, while 1999 spent lots of money and computer animation trying to give me thrills, with really stunning effects with little purpose. The new plot, which includes scores of abducted children whose souls are being held prisoner, a la Freddy Krueger, seems contrived to move us from one special effect to the next.An unnecessary decapitation and the clear SANITY of Eleanor at the end leave all traces of Jackson's brilliant story in the dust. 1999 is a brutal rewrite which ignores subtlety and, like so many modern movies, needs to force the good-vs-evil duality in the viewer's face. Apparently, we're not bright enough to understand anything more complex.My recommendation, as I've said before, is to hit the classics shelf and rent the original. Read the novel. If you have a 2-4-1 night at your video store, then maybe rent 1963 and 1999 and compare. If you prefer slasher flicks to psychological thrillers, you'll like 1999. If you like to think a bit about a story, even after it's over, you'll like 1963. I, for one, decided that 1963 has a happy (well, bittersweet?) ending. 1999 doesn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Sets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>::::::::WARNING-SPOILERS AHEAD::::::::I think anyone who saw this movie even if they hated it would all agree that the sets themselves were absolutely stunning. I thought they did an utterly fantastic, breathtaking job on the sets. As a matter of fact, were they created especially for the movie? They are so well done that when you see them you could easily be fooled into thinking they actually filmed it in a real mansion and all props were real. My friend saw it and he said the only good part in the movie was when that giant lion's head comes down and cuts a guy's head off...that was quite a moment, I agree. The problem with this movie in my opinion was that it just wasn't very scary. I thought the little childrens' heads, especially the ones that were supposed to be wood were more scary than the villain, but the child ghosts weren't supposed to be scary. Also, the part when a ghost twists her hair around.....uh...was that supposed to be...scary? I think maybe one of the problems with this movie that the villain appeared to be computer generated animation. The animations were beautifully done, but do you think the villian could have been more scary if instead he was played by a real person or even a moving mannequin? At least on some parts? I don't know. I just can't put my finger on why this movie didn't spook me. I wish they'd make a video showing nothing but a slow walking tour of all the sets-I'd love that. For all the work they put into them, it seems much of the sets weren't shown long enough at all. All that work and expense for only a few seconds' worth of film seems like a waste but maybe it couldn't be helped. Maybe if Stanley Kubrick had directed it there would have been longer camera time on different highlights of the sets. I thought I read someone said to view this movie as more of mystery movie than a horror movie so it won't disappoint. I say if you want to be scared, see Blair Witch, but The Haunting still has some great things going for it, especially the extraordinary sets....however it may not chill ya.</fullReview>

No, its not the scariest film ever made. But it is NOT the worst film ever made. By any stretch of the imagination. At all. Anyone who says so has not watched B-Movies, late night filler movies or almost any sequel.With regards to its ability to frighten, it is a 12 (PG-13, whatever) so its not going to be that horrific.

Not bad, but corny again. Reminded me of adverts on TV - pictures and statues etc, that moved their expressions with every change of scene.

The special effects are also very good. I have the original film and although they are similar, they are enough different that you can enjoy one and then the other. Everytime I watch the new version I concentrate on the detail present, it is mind boggling. The ending of the film I think could have been a bit better, perhaps, but the rest of the film was good enough that the ending was OK; which made it a bit like the original film. If you have never seen the original, you should. It was super and it never really shows a creature or demon. But, you are convinced they are there, just the same. I should say that I have the advantage of viewing the new movie on DVD and with a very good sound system. With a big screen and a good sound system the film really gets you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting was a special effect spectacular starring a very life-like house. The house had some amazing tricks up its sleeve and put in a wonderful performance. Unfortunately the human counterparts didn't have as developed of roles. All of the stars in this movie seemed to be taking a hiatus in their acting career to do a freebie for a beginning screenwriter. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a stunning vision but her character has no depth or decent lines to work with. Lili Taylor makes the best of it and her character is definitely the most interesting in the film. Liam Neeson seems bored and Owen (can't remember his last name as of now) seems to be transplanted in from a different movie. Lots of talent, lots of promise but no deliver. See House on Haunted Hill. Though its not a masterpiece at least it has some balance between effects and character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay. It wasn't the worst movie ever made, by a long shot, but it wasn't the best either. The script and direction were bad...failing to suspend disbelief. Dialogue is cheesy. Seems to me,the Haunting is a b-movie script trapped in a big-budget blockbuster, with a lot of actors, storyline and effects stuck in the wrong era and an inconsistent tone. Like this movie was meant to be watched by 12 year olds in 1960...or something like that.Liam Neeson was just plain BAD. his character and acting bored me out of my seat and made me laugh.... Owen Wilson was so annoying, i cheered his ridiculous and appropriate death. Zeta-jones was not much better, i guess they meant her to be eye-candy, but i couldn't have cared less. Theo was totally dispensable, although it would have been nice if they had fleshed out the Theo/Nell relationship. AS it is i get the feeling they just sort of cut out any too-lesbian scenes in the final take, and then tried to gloss over it, leaving a sort of half-hearted subplot that could have given the characters a lot more life and compassion. especially the silly, one-dimensional Theo. Could have been a *whole* lot more interesting for me as an *uncut* DVD... (hint, hint, studio execs! my money is waiting for you!)Lili Taylor was the only one who got even half a character to work with, and she seems to have found some sort of empathy with Eleanor, because I found myself caring about her despite the silly circumstances. To be honest, the only reason i watched this movie in the first place was for lili taylor, and i definitely got what I wanted. It could have been her one-woman show for all that she's the only one on screen about 80% of the time(why didn't she get first billing? oh yeah... because Cathy Jones is SEXIER! Duh!!). The house was really beautiful and dreamlike, and it was a blast watching Lili for an hour and a half. Melodramatic as it is, she does manage to give the whole thing a shred of dignity. And she did pretty well considering what she had to go on.All flaws considered, i'm admittedly looking through childish eyes here, and with a sentimental bias... i've seen it 3 times on video, and it has been thoroughly entertaining. It is truly MST-able, one of my friends and I had a riot watching it with our comments. So take it with a grain of salt... enjoy the pretty house. Laugh at the silly ghosts and unreasonable behavior. Imitate overwrought dialogue in everyday life. Sigh over Lili, and love to hate the rest of them... lighten up, it's just a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The terrifying and soul-shattering mystery at the heart of this film is how Liam Neeson, surely one of the finest actors of our age, got himself tangled up in this dreadful B-minus haunted house flick. Like the house itself, the plot is full of long passages leading nowhere in particular. When the evil spirit behind the malefic mansion manifests itself, it turns out to be curiously impotent -- its scary antics are limited to slamming a few doors and producing a vaporous spectre that growls unconvincingly. Not exactly the stuff of nail-biting fear, but the film is good for a few laughs if you can't find a good comedy to rent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supernatural Mystery disguise as a horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summer movies are where movie studios put out the popcorn flicks to make the money back they lost from January to April. They consist of three things a big budget, big stars, and big special effects. The Haunting directed by Jan De Bont (Speed, Twister) has them all. But does it deliver? Sort of. It's about a doctor (Liam Neeson) who conducts studies in human fear. He takes three people (Catherine Zeta-Jones,Owen Wilson,Lili Taylor) suffering from insomnia to `Hill House' a haunted mansion the ideal place to study fear. What the patients don't know is this study is about fear and not sleep disorders. But what everyone really doesn't know is that they're not the only things alive in this house. This film is not what it seems like everything in this film. The ad campaign suggested a scary ride. It also suggested a haunted house horror film. Both of those tag lines are misleading. Oh this is a ride but one of the slowest rides in history. It's like a bad rollercoaster in that there is very long ride up and when the drop comes it's not all the exciting and nail-biting. I haven't seen What Lies Beneath but this film is like the '99 version of that, a PG-13 horror film that turns out to be a supernatural mystery that wants to scare you. This film has the setups but doesn't deliver the scares. Only two people get killed so this can't be called a horror film. Horror films have body counts, this doesn't. The only thing that snapped me out of my daze was the special effects. They save the film from being a total bore. If you're into supernatural films this is one with good special effects. But if you want a real supernatural mystery The Sixth Sense is what I highly recommend. And if you want a scary film about a haunted house where the bodies pile up get the other hill house film to come out in '99 House On Haunted Hill. Jan De Bont's The Haunting doesn't live up to its word. Big let down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One would think, with the caliber of actors in this movie, that it would at least be okay. One would be wrong! Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor are both excellent actors, and Catherine Zeta-Jones is fairly good also. (Owen Wilson is the only one I haven't particularly been impressed with in his past endeavors). But in this film, I couldn't believe I was watching the same actors. Especially Lili Taylor! All of the fault is not hers--the dialogue was atrocious--but her acting was so wooden it made me squirm. I actually laughed many times--when I was not supposed to! If she went running thru the house in her flowing white nightgown one more time saying, "Oh no" (like she has just dropped something instead of screaming it in terror about the things that she was seeing) I was going to scream. I couldn't believe at the end when Owen Wilson's character got beheaded--she just said, "oh no" the same way! The special effects were good but I thought there were way too many of them. It got a little ridiculous. I think more could've been gained from some creepy shadows and things like that instead of these over-the-top things like everything in the house coming to life. There is something to be said for being understated! Liam Neeson also sleepwalked thru his performance. Catherine Zeta-Jones had a completely useless role but I guess she did the best she could. The original is so frightening and so much more could've been done with this movie. Jan DeBont needs to stick to action films, definitely. The plot was totally confusing, with Lili Taylor being part of the family that had lived in the house. The dialogue, like I said before, was awful. The acting was pathetic. I was embarrassed for everyone in the movie. I am not one who thinks horror movies have to be full of gore. I just thought this was an incredibly bad movie. I would not recommend this to anyone. I give it a 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without overwhelming the film, the special effects in The Haunting nake it a very satisfactory remake. Perhaps this is a sign that producers and directors are beginning to learn that the FX need not be the star of the film, but an integral part. Most of the effects here lead up to a final burst at the end. Throughout they add to the ...well...spiritual ambiance. I felt it was a throwback to the old haunted house films, where mood and atmosphere really build suspense. Perhaps it's a good thing if a director has to work within a PG-13 rating. My love for Stephen King aside, it's sometimes way too easy to go for the gross-out. The plaintive sounds of the spirits haunting the house were truely evocative of their pain. I liked the way they connected with Lili Taylor's character, and her reactions to the manifestations were unexpected. It's an entertaining movie which keeps things going without going over the top.</fullReview>

Why do they have to linkthe main character, Eleanor, to the house to explain itsapparent preying on her?The sad part is that this film was perfectly cast. Lili Taylor,Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones and Owen Wilson could havedelivered knockout performances as the characters Ms. Jacksoncreated.

The scariest part of the entire movie was when the house formed eyes and stared down at the bed-That's it. Personally, I wouldn't want to watch an entire movie for only one scare. The computer effects were not in the least scary and at most startling. And, while the actors portrayed their weak written roles as best as possible, still the essence of the movie drains through the plot holes.

		<fullReview>This movie was the worst film of 1999. The actors seemed out of place. The visual effects looked cheap. I thought I was watching "Casper" before I realized I wasn't. I don't know why people as talented as Liam Neeson and Caterine Zeta-Jones would make such a piece of cr*p movie! Liam, you were once in "Schindler's List" and "Les Miserables". What happened? The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that the sets looked good. Other than that, this was money wasted!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The camera work, special effects and sound effects in this film are truly enjoyable, and give you all the creeps you need. Plus add a good cast to go through the haunting experience, and you've got a pretty good movie. Makes me wonder why critics were putting it down. I enjoyed it, and liked the fact that it actually had a plausible story. Not something unbelievable out of space or a cosmic creation, or a revengeful ghost killing everyone. Maybe that was best about the movie, killing the characters and thinning out the cast was not the main point but it were the creepy sounds, the things you didn't see and then the visual effects that kept you in suspense. Well, there are these haunted houses in New England... (though the "castle" of this movie was in Britain.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just bad....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...to one who loves Shirley Jackson's original novel and who is pretty keen on the original '63 version of the movie, this film is just awful.[SPOILERS]I heard that this wasn't the greatest remake but I was curious to see how the spookier aspects would be interpreted by more modern cinema. There are scenes in the novel that I always assumed had been left out of the '63 production due to special effects limitations. In particular, the outdoor scenes where Eleanor watches the process of "something" through the tall grass, or the ghastly midnight picnic that the two women find themselves involved in.But the '99 version dropped most of the original story opting for an other-worldly search and rescue mission for the souls of murdered children(Aliens meets Ghosbusters?) rather than a subtle and creepy tale of a vulnerable woman's unhinging. Not only the story is dumbed-down the characters are converted to either ludicrous parodies or non-entities. The fascinating interplay between the characters (Eleanor's crush on the doctor, Theo's hinted-at lesbianism) is entirely dropped.The over-the-top neo-gothic fun house really does star in the film, though it isn't spooky at all, it's just REALLY REALLY big .The last 20 minutes of the thing are when the special effects kick in to full gear. Strangely, as the special effects intensify, they also become more annoying and funny. I laughed out loud as Eleanor shooed the others off while she began whaling away at the animated griffin sculpture with a 2 x 4. This is also the point when the dialogue plummets to laughable outbursts such as "I'm back home, Grandpa!"It's just so...bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do any of my fellow Canadian IMDb'ers remember a TV show called The Hilarious House of Frightenstein? I think this movie was even funnier than that. To be fair (if I really, really have to be), the first 45 minutes were decent; Lili Taylor makes ya feel for her as someone set adrift from a life that wasn't so great to begin with, and I could look at CZJ for hours (and would do more given the opportunity). But once Taylor utters the immortal line "I can be a victim or a volunteer... I'll be a volunteer," the hilarity (or buggery if you paid nine bucks to see this) begins and never ends. The only possible Metallica song I could recommend to watch this movie to is their cover of "Crash Course in Brain Surgery" (re-released on Garage Inc.) because it features the band bellowing a verse in a state much like that which you should watch this movie in: drunk, with your even drunker buddies. If you really have to rent this, be ready to make like MST3K. I know I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand what it is that fans of the genre didn't like about this film. It was truly a lot of fun. The special effects were wonderful. I generally agree with reviews and with IMDB voters, but not this time. I waited until it came to home video which I felt was another reason that I wouldn't enjoy the film. I believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen, but again this was not the case. To me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time. Blair Witch and The Mummy. Both films that I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time. The Mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck. People liked it for it's special effects. Films like the Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development, they are more like funhouse rides. Well with that analogy the Mummy was a B ticket to the Haunting's E-ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>deBont brings life to a house ... as the movie arrives DOA.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure what it is about director Jan deBont that makes him want to animate the lifeless. I'm not talking about dead people walking again. That's been done before. I'm talking about buses. I'm talking tornadoes. And now he brings Hill House to life. In "The Haunting," deBont makes a large mansion breathe, crumble, scream, cry, and -- with the help of Phil Tippets' special effects team -- treat you to some eye candy you'd never find at a movie theater consession stand. I admit, what we see on screen in terms of eye-popping fun is a sight to behold. But other than that, the movie is lifeless. There are few scares and even fewer surprises. Liam Neeson is wasted as a fear researcher(!) and Catherine Zeta-Jones turns in a poor performances as a member of a trio of insomniacs temporarily residing in the monstrous abode I was especially disappointed with film editor Michael Kahn. In his realm, he's done magnificent work splicing together such action heavy flicks as deBont's "Twister" and Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" and "Jurassic Park." Unfortunately, here, he did some stunningly poor chopping, having characters suddenly appear when you thought they were at the other end of the cavernous residence of evil just seconds ago. One saving grace is Lily Taylor's performance as a single mother-wannabe. She is believable and plays off terror convincingly when all else around her is not so frightening. And, finally, what was the deal with Todd Field's character. This fine actor has been slowly making a name for himself since the 1980s, most recently starring in Stanley Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut." In this movie, he appears for a total of about 10 minutes at the beginning and then is written out of the script when he has to bring an early casualty to town for treatment. Maybe that's a good thing. At least now Field won't have to put "The Haunting" down on his resume. His role, along with this movie, will be completely forgotten long before deBont brings "My Pet Rock: The Movie" to the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much well lighted detail, not enough suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A misguided researcher tricks a group of insomniacs into taking part in an live-in experiment to be conducted in a haunted castle built by a nineteenth century tycoon.If there is a fatal error that a director with a strong background in cinematography can make when doing a gothic horror flick, it's to use elaborate scenes and light them so that the screen is always full of ornate detail. Highlighting just the spooky visual elements would have created a better sense of creepiness. The Pit and The Pendulum or some original black and white Frankenstein films are works in which one can find what isn't in this movie: a good dose of visual Poeism.The old castle is intriguing but too orderly and well kept to evoke the sense of impending doom that this movie desperately needs. A few well placed cobwebs and some appropriate moldiness might help but It doesn't happen in this film, nor do the elements of tension and suspense develop.Instead Jan de Bont puts all his money on effects and a weak script with a formulatic and flawed plot (in the beginning of the action characters are introduced only to unexplainedly disappear from the rest of the story.)The only thing new in this movie might be some special effects techniques, but the days of relying on effects to satisfy an audience are numbered. Producers had better get back to thinking about stories and scripts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror movie for the kids.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting had alot of good things going in its favour. For instance, the perfect setting of an old house, a shady history of a strange previous owner and a group of hapless people who have no idea what's about to happen. But sadly, none of these aspects are used to its fullest potential. It seems that through-out the movie there is a sence that it was made for the younger generation rather than the almost unshakable older crowd. And this is a problem. Because its aimed at younger people (and to acheive its PG type rating) the scares are extreamly subtle and the suspence and gore are practically non-existant. You can't help but think what type of movie it could have been if differant producers and a differant director were involved.The horror (if you can call it that) is mostly made of sound effects and CG soaked imagery. The CGI is another problem. It's so in-your-face and glossy that it looks out of place. Hollywood, it seems, needs to take a leaf out of the Blair Witch Project book. Much more could have been done here if simple suggestion was used instead of a barrage of technology.On the plus side of things, the preformances are fairly good. Liam Neeson gives his usual above average and Catherine Zeta Jones seems extreamly comfortable with her caracter. Lili Taylor, however, fell foul of the script writer. Her's is the deepest caracter here. There was enough scope to write a brilliant piece of script, but alas she is only 2 dimentional. Her climactic scenes are almost laughable.To sum up, The Haunting is a poor effort of a story that had so much potential. The kids will love it, but the older generation will be dissapointed. One only hopes that the director, Jan De Bont, is given back the freedom of film-making he had when he directed Speed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The preview drives you to see this movie. You expect ghosts, you expect screams, you crave blood, but you get very few of the above.The Haunting, for a thriller, didn't seem to thrilling. Sure, it had it's moments where it made you jump and shrink back waiting for the 'unexpected' thing to leap from the floor or a closet, but it happened very rarely.I admit that the ending or the plot of the story was not as I expected and in that sense it was very good. The preview made you think one thing where as the movie delivered something quite different.The effects were, of course, brilliant, with the ghost like figures creeping through sheets and curtains, giving the house an airy feeling.Unfortunately, the acting was not of the same caliber.Catherine-Zeta Jones, however tight her clothing, seemed a little loose on the acting side, where as Liam Neeson, who normally plays a good part, had almost no character to build on.Lili Taylor, of whom the plot is based around, played a fairly convincible psycho and we can't forget the over-sexed, smart mouthed Owen Wilson. Voila, we have a small 2 star team of actors who only provide the animals in which the cage is closed on.Despite the acting, the plot and the effects, The Haunting, is a cheap stress reliever. Providing the amusement and entertainment for a boring Friday night.If you are looking for spooky, stand in-front of a mirror and pull a really scary face, because the probability that *you* will scare yourself will be higher than the chance of this movie doing so!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally laughable, absurd, waste of time and money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With an absolutely perfect movie set, a good cast and much money for technically perfect effects, what could go wrong with this picture anymore ? Everything else.The director didn't cared about atmosphere, or character development. After an average well made start, only with some really bad camera positions in it, the movie grows worse and worse, mainly because the longer it continues, the more absurd and idiotic are the effects. For example, a woman watching her mirror picture getting pregnant, which should be the "message" that she is at home here. And the final solution is nothing but a sudden wonder.There is never very much atmosphere (in such a fantastic environment!) in this movie (for example, one never is allowed to watch the house itself calmly), there is no really good dialogue, the characters miss any surprising characterization, and so on. The movie is simply not operating at any level, everything grows worse and worse as if the script author ran out of inspirations.I think it was really a possibility for a fantastic movie with this excellent set and the wonderful Lili Taylor, but it has been completely wasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A talented director can make an enjoyable film from a terrible screenplay or story. Jan de Bont can't.This film had one good feature: the house. A beautiful mansion, impressively outfitted for spookiness and adventure. What a shame such excellent sets went completely to waste.The script was ordinary. The acting was unexciting. The story was.. well, it's hard to say how good the story was, because it was so poorly told. The story, as it was conveyed to the viewer, was insignificant and feeble.I've seen memorable thriller/horrors with all the same traits and made on one-tenth the budget. But they were good, because they made no attempt to pretend not to be bad. This film took itself seriously, and that was a mistake.And the worst thing? It was barely even scary. I was bored.It seemed to have potential at first. The caretaker of the mansion (Bruce Dern) delivered his couple of lines better than anyone else in the film. I liked him immediately. His wife (Marian Seldes) also made a convincing effort at being spooky, in the cliched manner you would expect from this genre. Sadly, neither character had any part in the actual story. The only other parts that were in any way entertaining were those of the mildly-amusing Luke (Owen Wilson), and Catherine Zeta-Jones' cleavage.Waste of time. 1.5/10 (1 for the mansion, 0.5 for the visual fx)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shirley Jackson, (she of The Lottery fame) receives a credit as writer, although seeing as she died in 1965 I doubt she contributed much to this unnecessary remake. Shiess-meister Jan De Bont has included every single gothic cliche in this confused, badly made, film and David Self has turned out the most bald expositional badly written script since the Thomas Crown remake.Lili Taylor as the heroine seems to be the only one who has read the script, as she explains things to the other characters before she's even found them out. This is funnily enough very annoying, and happens often enough to make you suspect a massive amount of restructuring was done to this shambling, dawdling, over- orchestrated nightmare in a desperate attempt by Dreamworks to get something for their money.The disappearance of two characters early in, on a simple errand, is not mentioned at all throughout the rest of the film. Their entire storyline seems to have been forgotten. Lucky lucky them...The effects are generally poorly rendered and over-done. No spoilers- but when the super scariest ghost of them all looks like The Cowardly Lion, it's hard to stop snorting openly in derision. Truly a film only for the connoisseur of really bad movies, I would rate The Haunting 1999- zero point eight out of ten. Jan, Catherine, Owen, Liam and Lili (who should know better) straight to Film Hell for you. David Self, you can have a special place in a septic tank below them.AVOID LIKE THE POX!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I'm a big fan of the original Haunting, so that's out of the way. I went to the cinema, not expecting much of a movie, with the history of Mr De Bont to go by (Speed 2, Twister). And he didn't disappoint me, this was an insult to Robert Wise. The original Haunting was a genuinely scary film, I only watched it a few months ago, and I still get goose bumps. But this remake is just bad. Take the original, take out the entire scare and horror and put in SFX, and it's what you are left up with. The only thing good I can say about the film was (a) the production, the house did look great and (b) there was ONE good scare, I jumped the once, and that was it. Even the acting was up to much, but I blame De Bont for this. I thought Liam Neeson could do no wrong after being a Jedi, how wrong I was.If you want to have a scare, rent the original, turn the lights off, and soak up the 'atmosphere' of a truly scary film. If you fancy a laugh, at cheesy SFX, bad direction, bad acting and some thing that's about as scary as Pink Fluffy Bunnies in Tinkly Winkly Town, see the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An English Teacher once advised me that no play or film is so bad as to have no redeeming qualities (this was after I had written a particularly splenetic and peevish review of a theatre workshop production of 'Macbeth'). Since then I have always tried to find something worthwhile in a film, no matter how disappointing...and 'The Haunting' is an extremely disappointing film.Set design and special effects are both excellent (although borrowing heavily from H R Geiger's designs in 'Alien') and, once again, Jan De Bont demonstrates that he is an excellent cinematographer. However, De Bont is not a Director and, in the light of 'Speed', 'Twister', 'Speed 2' and now 'The Haunting', it is time for him to realise his limitations.The 1963 'Haunting' was always going to be a difficult subject to emulate. Robert Wise's production relies predominantly on atmosphere and characterisation, so important in making it a genuinely frightening film. The 1999 'Haunting', however, opts for computer generated images rather than plot development and, as a result, betrays its weaknesses from the outset.Incredulity is stretched to breaking point (who would willingly spend the night in a house like this?). The characters are so thinly drawn that they evince neither sympathy or antipathy (this is a film Liam Neeson will want to forget) and, despite some pleasantly diverting shocks which send a ripple of nervous laughter through the audience, much of the film is so outlandish as to descend into farce (please try not to giggle when you see the portrait of the villain).In the hands of a better Director and with a more intelligent screenplay this film had the potential to be one of the best films of the year. Instead it is cliché ridden, predictable and, at times, boring.It is a piece of work which my English Teacher would have returned unmarked with a polite note saying, 'I think you should do this again.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 15 ~ 20 minutes of this movie set up for the greatest "ghost house" movie of all time,... but then it spirals in its own fatal flaws:The good: The setup was amazing. I still can't get over the house, those huge bed rooms, the "canal water" hall, the "revolving" room, The setting was just what was needed for the mood. The characters were better than average, we had a manipulative professor, the low-self-esteem house wife, the housekeepers that clearly know more than they let on, the sex-symbol incarnate of Zeta-Jones.... These people were classic requirements of the tale to be told.The Bad: After about 20 minutes of the movie, specifically the first night in the house... all that glorius setup is dumped in the toilet.... The professer turns out to be a sniveling waste of science with no real motive or control as we might have guessed. The fireplace was a b-movie side set... the "canal water" hall was never explained, it seemed to be just an excuse to see Zeta-Jones's rear as she hopped from book to book earlier in the movie.. The "revolving room" was just a visual effect, The much reported "stairwell scene" was more of an annoyance than any real story or plot device. Two characters were even dropped 1/3 of the way into the movie without any attempt to check up on them later.The Ugly: The story Clearly this is a case of a poor story that SKG tried their darnedest to hide with state-of-the-art FX, which by only helped to confuse the already clouded and vague "dead children who need rescued" plot line. The ending was visually impressive, but it made no sense on first viewing, and left no desire for repeat viewing to figure it out. Characters devolved into cardboard cutouts of their potential. Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones both need to have serious discussions with their agents. Liam is a proven actor when it comes to strong convictions and manipulative planning, (see Rob Roy and Schindler's List) but here his talents were wasted. Catherine was on a huge upswing when Zorro came out, due to her physical presence, and getting out of the hero's way when called needed. But with a dissapointing performance in Entrapment, and no real character in this movie, her career may be over before it beginsIn short, if they took the inital setup and ran with it, it could have been a hell of a movie. Don't compare this to Blair Witch, it wasn't trying to be that type of movie. The setup and special effects were fantastic, the story and plot were lacking5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie with great anticipation. And why shouldn't I? After all, it is based on my all-time favorite horror story; the 1963 version was terrific; and this new version has some of my favorite actors in it. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed!!!The greatness of Shirley Jackson's story and of the 1963 movie was the eerie, creepy feeling you got while reading/watching and that you came away with when finished... never being 100% sure about what happens. Is Lily crazy? Is the the house really haunted? The original story and movie allow your imagination to explore the many possibilities, and it makes it one of the top horror stories of all time.However, this new version of the movie leaves little to the imagination and relies on startling us so we jump a bit at what we see on the screen. Unfortunately, that's quickly over and it leaves no real feeling of fright--which is, of course, why we go to see these movies in the first place. All in all, a very disappointing experience!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is not a remake of the 1963 film classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not a remake of the 1963 film classic. In fact, it is only loosely based on the Jackson novella that is supposedly its source. Sure, the characters' names are the same and the basic situation is the same, but beyond that, almost everything has been changed. The ending, especially, was drastically changed to make the main character into a kind of a savior, rather than the hapless and pitiful (but highly sympathetic) victim of the original. I guess that was done to appeal to modern sensibilities? Also, this film relies heavily on special visual effects, whereas the 1963 classic relied exclusively on psychological terror and suggestion. As a result, the newer film is only about a tenth as effective -- that is, scary -- as the older one. I suggest all potential viewers skip the 1999 film and go straight to the 1963 one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The final third is a startling way-out-there mix of Dario Argento baroque and Spielbergian sentiment. It may be proof that there's poetic power in CGI--somewhere. And the heroine, a long-suffering lass given the (consciously?) Dickensian name of Nell, is played by Lili Taylor, whose face in wide-eyed and -mouthed closeups must make Lucio Fulci spin in his grave with envy.But the director, Jan DeBont, is perhaps the leading proponent of the reigning throw-money-at-problems school of studio filmmaking. Gothic horror requires tender, melancholic souls--Tim Burton or Jacques Tourneur. There may not be a studio moviemaker alive with fewer poetic bones in his body than Jan DeBont. (Michael Bay looks positively Byronic by comparison.) Contrary to the received wisdom, however, the early, low-tech, creaking-door brand of horror purveyed in the movie's first half is mostly dull and ineffective. The computer-born japery has a lyric bent. (Or maybe DeBont is just more comfortable in the bigger-is-better side of the building.)The best stuff in THE HAUNTING is image-driven, essentially irrational--PG-13 Argento. Had Spieberg hired someone more equal to the task--David Lynch? David Fincher?--the genre might have had a comeback. And next summer, we'd be watching a Jeunet-and-Caro remake of SUSPIRIA instead of THE BLAIR WITCH STRIKES BACK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the good side, the scenery and special effects are stunning. Unfortunately, this can't make up for a screenplay that has obviously been through Hollywood's "strive for mediocre" machine. The book and the original movie dealt with the psychology of Nell and how Hill House was ensnaring her sanity. This movie takes a great story and recasts it into the standard formula format. People in haunted house... Big "scary" effects... Stuff that jumps out at you... and a big showdown with a "finish off the baddie" tagline that would be suitable for ARNOLD himself. If you want to see a good scary movie abandon the Haunting at all costs.</fullReview>

Owen Wilson's was the only likeable character. the over-acting was very silly. the idea may be from the book, but not all books are meant to be made into movies. little is explained about the house's builder, other than he wanted kids and ended up taking some from his factories. they they mention he won't let them go even in death, and we're supposed to be scared by that. how can you call someone a villain when all you know about them is that they played hide and seek with the kids they won't let go. they should have used those special effects to computer-generate a decent story. on a scale of 1 to 10, i give it a 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film would have to improve a few notches to be considered merely bad. Whether in its acting or creaking FX, it was risible from beginning to end.Somewhere in the machinery of special effects, Hollywood has lost sight of the essence of a good scare, which is what H. P. Lovecraft, master of the horror tale, identified as "nameless terrors." What he meant is that no physical depiction of scary things can ever chill the marrow so much as what the mind conjures up from images implied but unshown. The fundamental error of this film is its reported expenditure of $75 million to create a mechanical set that makes the menace visible. The Blair Witch Project, with a total budget of $20,000, and without any resort to special effects or scary-looking things, is much more genuinely chilling than this lumbering, clanking bore.It would be indictment enough to call a horror film "numbingly dull," but this film commits other sins worth noting. For instance, what is Liam Neeson doing here? An actor of both stature and reputation, one can only conjecture that he was blackmailed into taking the part of the Machiavellian doctor who lures subjects to a purported sleep study at a creepy house, while actually studying the effects of fear. The role is so ill-defined and cartoonish that it could more inexpensively, but equally convincingly, have been occupied by a cardboard cut-out. Neeson barely improves upon that option. Other cast members are equally unconvincing: Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a schizophrenic role apparently cut from 23 different personae, none of them believable, and Lili Taylor's entire assignment is to look scared, which she only occasionally manages.If you want a good scare, read Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, on which the film is purportedly, though unrecognizably, based. I was afraid of the dark for years after reading it. This film, however, only instilled a fear of accidentally seeing more stinkeroos like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting exceeded my expectations to provide a fun filled afternoon at the movies with friends. After reading the critical reviews, the best I hoped for (in the unusual chance the critics were right) was a pleasant day. The movie is a remake so the plot is known; Forewarned, expect to see a story that you know. Surprises came in the form of direction, special effects and character development within a 125 minute time frame. The script is thin and editing leaves much to be desired, however these minor flaws are compensated by a strong visual effect and sound that could be award winning in another genre. Should entertainment be your reason for seeing a movie? I think so and I was entertained. I say go see it! This is a good film with a good cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting (1999) Director: Jan De BontI remember when I was 6 years old and I had to stay home with the measles. On television at that time there was a channel that played the same movie over and over all day long. On that day, I saw "The Haunting" (1963) over and over and it scared the [daylights] out of me. It was classic horror, playing with your head the whole time, making you think there were monsters and blood and guts, even though there wasn't a trace of it in the film. But that's what made it great. The fact that you were sure there was. And it stays with you. "The Haunting" (1999) is a remake of that movie I saw when I was 6 and, even with the incredible special effects and the unbelievable sets, it was scripted and filmed in that same classic horror tradition. I literally jumped out of my seat on two occasions and found myself back to the old habit of biting my nails. The special effects made it even bigger and better because they didn't interfere with the fright that was beginning to crawl up your spine as soon as you entered this HUGE house that seemed alive, no, not seemed... WAS alive. You could hear it breathing throughout the entire movie. Liam Neeson plays a psychologist, specializing in fear therapy, setting up a controlled experiment with a group who, unknowingly participate in his experiment, believing they are being treated for their individual insomnias. All the participants had their own problems. Catherine Zeta-Jones as a bi-sexual, nympho, dominatrix insomniac, had Owen Wilson (of "Armageddon" fame) crazy for her yet they were constantly sparring for dominance in their circumstances. Lili Taylor (memorable in "The Addiction" and "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle") was great in the starring role, never really sure if she was experiencing Parapsychic or just psychotic episodes. The story, originally penned by Shirley Jackson back in the 60's is one that takes your inner fears and brings them out. I enjoyed this movie immensely and recommend it to all who appreciate the tingle in your spine as you sit around in a circle in a dark room telling ghost stories. This takes you there.Chris Fata North American Ambassador Trash City Magazine email: trshctygal@aol.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An over the top turkey, a worthless waste.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shirley Jackson's story, "The Haunting of Hill House" is one which has twice scared the willies out of me. Unfortunately neither time was when I went to see Jan de Bont's film, "The Haunting," which opened this week amid hype and hoopla. Compared to Jackson's original novel and Robert Wise's 1963 film version, de Bont's remake seems cheap, obvious and phony. It neither scares nor convinces.Watching this movie is like having a talkative guy sitting next to you in the theater poking you in the ribs and yelling, "Hey, this is scary, eh?" For instance, I'm sure that the sound department didn't intend to make a confusing muddle out of the the story. But that's what happens. The major scares in Jackson's story come from the sounds of the house. De Bont fills the sound track with groans, creaks and heavy breathing, so many that the viewer doesn't know whether the sounds are there because they are in the story or are just window dressing for the movie viewer. This outright spoils several of the scenes and waters down the effect on those where the sounds are meant to be heard by the characters. In the earlier Robert Wise direction, the sounds truly mean something to the characters and present a wonderfully frightful experience for the film viewer. In this turkey some of the groans are coming from the audience.Character development is likewise in-your-face. For instance, where Wise lets Theo's lesbianism be subtle and under the covers (so to speak), de Bont has Catherine Zeta-Jones do her usual over-acting in tight leather in her very first scenes. Although Lili Taylor could probably do a very credible job as Eleanor, the script doesn't help her develop Eleanor's fragile persona. Regardless, what little good she does in the role is completely ruined by the idiotic and special effects filled ending which requires her character to somehow cast off the fragility and metamorphose into a pontificating Superwoman. The rest of the script is equally ridiculous and unbelievable. Liam Neeson's ample talents are wasted.If you are tempted to go see "The Haunting" in the next few weeks, my advice is to either go to the library and check out Shirley Jackson's wonderful novel, "The Haunting of Hill House". Or, if you insist on seeing a movie, make it Robert Wise's truly chilling 1963 black and white version, also entitled "The Haunting." And, sweet dreams.</fullReview>

The tremendous emotion that an effective sound editor can elicit is finally apparent as theaters are becoming equipped with top notch digital sound. Every creek and crash in the fantastic Hill House is perfectly rendered placing you along side Nell as she travels deeper into the legend of Hill House.Along with top-notch sound, the casting was spot-on. Owen Wilson, if you don't remember him from Armageddon as the ill-fated cowboy, or from the writing team that brought you Rushmore, steals the show. His one-liners (mostly improvised) remind you what quality casting can bring to a film.You think you've seen great sets? Wait until you enter Hill House (Built inside the Spruce Goose Hangar right next to the Queen Mary in Long Beach) You've never seen a mansion like this. Eugenio Zanetti has outdone himself once again. (Remember What Dreams May Come?)Don't forget Phil Tippet's visual effects. Remember Starship Troopers?

Owen Wilson was the worst casting choice in this entire movie, in fact, that might be one of the worst casting choices I've ever seen in any movie, is acting and here was just so bland and fake. Liam Neeson wasn't a horrible choice for the lead, although he wasn't great. What I don't like is this movie is not scary at all it's just not! Also the filmmakers overused CGI to where it looked cheap. I watched the original from the 1960's and I wasn't a fan, I didn't like it at all, but the remake is even worse than the original. I guess it suffices to say that I'm just not a haunting fan at all. Also the script and the dialogue in this remake is just so bland and boring. If you are a true horror movie thing and then this is not a movie you want to see. It's really just an insult to all horror movies because it's just not scary. I do feel bad for the audience that was really excited to see this, meaning the fans of the original, I feel bad that they were horribly let down. Now I know that the original from the 1960s is held up high as a horror movie classic, personally I don't get that, I did not like it at all, but it's just not my cup of tea I guess. The one word that comes to mind when I think of the haunting from 1999 is just plain boring. Do yourself a favor and watch insidious instead of this.

Except they don't know that Dr Marrow is actually trying to scare them for their tests. That's why he bought them to an old garish mansion. The Dudleys (Bruce Dern, Marian Seldes) are the caretakers. Todd Field and Alix Koromzay play the doctor's assistants. Eventually only the four leads remain in the house and the movie really starts.The four leads are capable actors. Although Lili Taylor can be grinding as the poor victim character. The story goes slowly for far too long. The house is not scary as much as it's a Hollywood fun ride. The problem is really the fact that the mansion lack the basic sense of dread. The CG really adds an artificial feel to the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, like many other people, am greatly surprised by the amount of hate and loathing for this movie. I think the main root of the problem, stems from the original. The original being a good movie with plenty of thrills and chills that got peoples hearts thumping and blood pumping. Due to the enjoyable nature of the original, people seem to instantly blacklist this newer version. However I extremely recommend that virgin viewers of this film, take heed in ignoring peoples opinion on it. This 1999 version is completely different to the original, so much so that perhaps it shouldn't of been coined as a remake to the 1963 one.The first time I watched this film, I hadn't seen the original, so I guess I had nothing to pin my hopes on. I personally loved this movie. So did all my friends that I showed it to. Forget that it's a 'remake' and just watch it without any outside or prior knowledge, but this is one entertaining flick.I'm no sucker for CGI and special effects; I've always been against them. However this movie has some very good effects, that are used well and for the right reasons. The creators don't overuse them or simply add them in for cheap tricks and thrills. They are placed in nicely and make the film feel a lot more exciting.The acting I found was very well executed. The actors, who were well cast I believe, are very interesting and their characters offer traits that are often found at the ends of the human psych scale. There are no average or normal people in this film and that keeps it entertaining and likable. They're 3 dimensional and you easily find yourself really giving a damn about them.The storyline I'll admit is slightly diluted. They seem to not give much suspense to the actual story behind why they are all in the house. However with that said, the script is well written and actually quite intellectual at points. I personally didn't find it much of a problem about the story line, because I found many other things that helped the film.The music and general sound of the film are wonderful. I have a sub-woofer and I honestly recommend you watch this with surround because it is just, epic! The bass in this film is so powerful, even during bright daylight I felt like I was in the actual movie itself just from the bass alone. Not exactly a big deal to many, but to those who have the right equipment, it's heaven! Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and watch it at least two or three times a year. You really should not judge this movie, as you shouldn't any others, by the reviews of other people. Mainly because I think as I said previously the hate is down to the love of the original. Definitely give it a go, you have nothing to lose but could end up finding your new favourite. Just like me.</fullReview>

I have watched it over and over, to see if I missed anything the first time around,lol. The actors and actresses have done a great job as well. My favorite being Nell, and Jake. I think I would have to say,, that I disagree with some of the others,,, this movie was very entertaining, and, it gave information on a well known house. I am not all together sure, that this is based on a true story, but if it is,,, well, I would love to visit that house,, and see if it really is haunted myself. I plan on getting this on DVD, so I can keep watching it. Thanks for listening,,lol! have a great day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr. Marrow, for research purposes, assembles at a large Gothic mansion, a small group of people with apparent sleeping disorders. Once the group are all present strange things start to happen, it's as if the house is itself alive, with the focal point of the troubles seemingly being Eleanor Vance. Pretty soon all those involved in the research here at Hill House are literally going to be fighting for their lives, sleep problems are most definitely now the least of their worries.This remake of the popular and infinitely far better Robert Wise film, The Haunting 1963, threatens to at times be an engrossing and scary viewing experience. That it fails to become anything other than an extended MTV video lays at the feet of a director getting carried away with the tools available to him (Jan de Bont), and actors who are either miscast (Owen Wilson), not good enough (Catherine Zeta-Jones) or merely phoning it in (Liam Neeson). As good as the original Haunting was, it wasn't such a bad idea to remake it, the premise is first rate and was ripe for a modern audience, but what made Robert Wise's film so excellently chilling was its ability to unnerve you with what you didn't see, it was by definition a psychological horror, Jan de Bont went the other way and showed us everything in a big blur of CGI overkill.Some moments do have the desired affect, cherubs creep us out at regular intervals and the magnificent location of Belvoir Castle is utilised to great effect, but this only furthers the anger one feels when thinking what might have been. Of the sub standard cast only Lili Taylor comes out with any credit as the central character of Eleanor, but even she struggles as de Bont goes berserk with his toys, one chase sequence down the winding hall is hilariously bad and conjures up memories of Scooby Doo and Shaggy fleeing from some grumpy ghost. The Haunting 1999 is far from being horrendously bad, and it comes out nice on a good home cinema system, but it's well below average and not a film to revisit too often, I would think the makers and actors probably feel the same way too. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie (some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I have been reading a lot of bad reviews for this movie. So many comments are saying how the 1960s one is the best I cant even try to understand how an old movie that probably had bad special effects or no special effects can be better then the 1999 version. I mean seriously the movie was beautiful it had a good plot and great characters and a nice story line and for those who do not understand the movie must not have been paying attention at all. My god people these days don't know how to review a movie take the skeleton key for example that movie was good till then end then it just sucked. That was two hours that I wont get back,But people reviewed that movie as if it was the best thing they had ever seen. I think this movie was great because how remarkable it was. Eleanor was the best character in all the movie how she wanted to save the children and how caring she was.This movie may not have been scary but I enjoyed the movie till the end especially the music which was remarkable. That movie is old but I can still watch it over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I have recently watched many rather stupid and low budget horror movies, 'The Haunting' really did it for me. The set was definitely mind blowing, even though most of it was recreated on a sound stage in the US. The enormity of the house depicted has to be seen to be believed, even then it cannot be.I found 'Hill House' incredibly haunting, so any plot staged in that place would be creepy by nature. I don't usually find special effects believable and mostly they are completely over the top. Effects in this movie are excellent with photography to match. As for the very creative and enormity of the sets, they were stunning and very professionally done.I rate this movie as a 9......that's quite high I know, but it really tickled my imagination. The best movie I've seen in quite a while, (most movies along these lines are rubbish) so I'll definitely watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've only seen the second half of this movie, for the most part; but I've truly enjoyed it. I always enjoy a movie that uses the supernatural to its advantage, so to say. Instead of just throwing a ton of good graphics around with barely any connection between them, here everything is well-put together. Even the ending has more of a psychological and moral meaning than most of the ghost movies I've seen lately. I realize it was a remake of a 60's movie, however, and the original always has a bit more insight than a remake, so I'll probably watch the original version now, and recommend anyone to do the same. However, if all else fails, the graphics and real-looking ghosts that this movie dazzles us with would certainly overcome the its 60's roots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scenery is better than the acting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A haunted house with a shady past is a wonderful subject for a movie. Don't get me wrong, I do not hate this lame 1999 update of the 1963 Horror classic "The Haunting". What I like about this movie is the scenery which is the eerie, medieval, and menacing Victorian Mansion and the creepy woods that surround it. De Bont(the director) calls it a psychological horror film. Problem is it works! The house is as comfortable as looking at an Iron Madien torture device from the Dark Ages. The plot is interesting but not interesting enough it could use a little detail. As for the acting and dialog...well...IT SUCKS! With Catherine Zeta-Jones and Liam Neeson, who happen to be A-listers who could've done a better job than this. The effects should've been Hitchcock-esqse, climatic enough to leave chills up your spine not Disney-level CGI.And what the hell's with Lily Taylor's screaming(sounds like a tone deaf 12 year on a roller coaster!). What this should've been was a warning to the movie industry that remakes aren't big sellers. There needs to be something more. We couldn't they show more information about the Hugh Crain saga, show a flashback...a gruesome one. Because we need to know the reasons why this house is "alive" and is the way it is: "absolutely creepy" and evil. "Did Crain practice the Black Arts, Witchcraft, Satanism, etc.?" Is that the reason why the children are stuck in the house 120 years after their death? I mean come on. We the audience want to know what the hell's with the "bad guy"? What's his friggin' beef with the present-day visitors? Too may things have been left out to even classify this as an authentic thriller! Alright! We came to be terrified and entertained not forced to think and draw our own conclusions. De Bont should've studied Hitchcock more intesely if he wanted a "psychological thriller". This movie is interesting, but leaves more (especially its "balls")on the cutting room floor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was incredibly appalling. As a fan of the book, I was interested to see if this version could hold up. It couldn't. It's funny with trying to be with horrific dialogue predictable events. I ended up laughing through 90% of the movie and groaning through the other 10%. The special effects are horrible as well-I wondered through most of it if the animators even tried at all. Everything's very cartoonish and cheesy, which took away a lot for me. Even seasoned actors such as Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor couldn't pull this mess up. I expected better from them, but they didn't have much to work with. The only really good part of the movie was the photography, but that was overshadowed by the bad.Read the book or see the original, and skip this one.2 stars out of 10, out of pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people confuse the story of Hill House with the badly made movie "The Haunting of Hell House". The plots are very similar but the Shirley Jackson story is far superior. Jan de Bont could have made a delightfully terrifying movie but instead made a movie in which the special effects are comical. Stained glass that becomes eyes, ceilings that twist and swell. The set designer for this movie missed an opportunity to use available technology to scare the daylights out of us. Instead of a truly frightening house, we got a mishmash of tacky decor and comically used sculptures. The only element of Gothic scariness was the painting of Hugh Crain at the top of the stairs. The house looked as though it had been a project on HGTV's Designer Finals and the designers lost. The story, itself, could have been retold by de Bont, in a way that would put it right up there with the 1963 version but he chose instead to try and frighten us with cartoon-like special effects and a lackluster and disjointed script. Too much about the Hugh Crain story is left as a puzzle. But, the biggest puzzle of all was why de Bont wasted all that talent and money to give us such a disappointing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of the novel by Shirley Jackson and the 1963 film, I would be inclined to critique this film with that bias however it is best to evaluate this film as if the novel or 1963 film did not exist. Here is my unbiased opinion.What I did not like about this movie were the choice of actors and their characterizations. I think Owen Wilson (Luke) was misplaced in this kind of film and my choice would have been Johnny Depp or someone similar. Another thought of mine was; Why would they waste a great actor such as Bruce Dern by giving him such a small role in the film? On the positive side, The sets were very good, the mystery is intriquing and the Dreamworks effects are stunning. I think a lot of work and cleverness went into the sets used in this film especially the carousel room and the room with the water on the floor.To bottomline my opinion of this film, I saw it first in the theatre and then bought the DVD to add it to my collection. I liked the film well enough to have my own copy of it so I feel it is a worthwhile film to see, and to see again.</fullReview>

Also, the special effects themselves just aren't that good. They look very fake, and verk plastic.

The rest of the film istn't scary even as a ghost story... Very surreal and interesting but not scary!!!I saw the Haunting during the same time as House on Haunted hill (remake) and was really disappointed when Haunting didn't come even close to the other one...I guess this might work for some, but for horror buffs, it's more a joke than a scare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A badly directed remake of the 1963 Robert Wise film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is characterization here but it only touches base and dwells on one trait only, making each character fit better into their part, but one-dimensionally. The Hauntings simple 'skeleton in the closet' plot depends heavily on the pitiful but uncomplex personalities of its characters. The makers seem to want to compensate for this by adding extra, clutter scenes. One of which consists of Mary, (another of the insignificant organizers of the trip to Hill House), freaking out and saying that the house is evil for no apparent reason -Marys character seems to have been moulded purely from the original Theodora, as psychic, and Julie Harris' original representation of a scared and neurotic Eleanor. Catherine Zeta-Jones turns Theo's character into a wise, artistic, bisexual love goddess, from Clair Blooms jealous, bitter, and beautiful lesbian witch. One thing I noticed is that its very hard to tell, if your not looking for it, that Eleanor is actually a social, psychological and emotional alien amongst her peers, this I think would've been a good thing to develop better. Liam Neeson seems almost bored in his part of Dr. Marrow, while Owen Wilson carries his character through pretty well from thirty years ago. With better direction, a more thought out ending, and a less inhibited script a remake of The Haunting could have worked well.As it was, this one didn't. Pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some have said that the main character in "The Haunting" is the house. I disagree - it is the SOUND TRACK. I saw this on DVD, with a proper home theater surround sound set-up, with a powered subwoofer, and the sound track is truly great. The frequent background emphasis rumble rattled framed posters on my wall, and such sounds as chains on the iron gate, the opening of giant carved doors, loud banging on doors, giant footsteps from above, and wood floors cracking open are all among the best effects I've heard. Without the sound track, most of this film would be very dull, and most would turn it off before the half-way point. I watched the whole film and, while it is not a particularly good film, I found it highly entertaining in places. Funny in some.SPOILERS - Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones get top billing, but the real people star is Lili Taylor as "Nell", who turns out to be a descendant of the dead man who is responsible for haunting the house. She had received a phone call telling her to look for the ad in the paper, and it must have been one of the children of the house. She is the only one seeing the ghostly visions, and she is the one who finally demands that the dead man "go to hell where you belong", to free all the dead children of their purgatory.When the man and woman housekeepers return the next morning, and see the damaged iron gate, the crashed car, the injured people standing there, waiting to get out, she just mutters, "City folk!" The exterior of the "house" is a very large manor in England, built in the 1800s. The giant sets for the interiors were built in the dome building in Long Beach, Ca which once housed Howard Hughes' "Spruce Goose" airplane.As I already said, the sound track on the DVD is one of the best. There is an interesting "making of" special in the extras. Anyone not yet watching home movies on DVD with a good surround sound system is missing at least half of movies like this. Get out of the dark ages, buy a Digital 5- or 6-channel receiver and a good set of speakers, a subwoofer, and a DVD player. Your movie experience will totally change. Honest!!</fullReview>

The only thing this one has going for it are the lovely, imaginative sets. All else--the script, performances, and especially the direction by Jan DeBont are, to put it kindly, not good. All the subtlety and ambiguity of the original are tossed out the window in favor of a lot of noisy special effects that wouldn't scare a 5 year old. The only frightening thing about this nonsense is that it received as many positive reader comments on this board as it did!

But also the perfectly captured atmosphere in the music of Jerry Goldsmith! I have the soundtrack and it's just as scary as the movie itself!! (I'm playing it while I'm writing this!) There weren't really scary moments that made me wanna jump up, like the 'sound explosions' of WHAT LIES BENEATH (also a beautiful movie), but for this film it's perfect because it's not good for the whole story and the atmosphere. Good work, Jan de Bont!! My favorite moment is the final 15 minutes, that made my hair stand up (again because of the special effects and music).

		<fullReview>The movie is about a study in fear. I was reading Leonard Maltin's review, and he seems to state there were "virtually no scares" in the movie. I was really scared. Perhaps people are getting desensitized because the movies are getting more and more graphic, more special effects, more deaths, more explosions. I think that what made Hitchcock's movies scary was what your mind put into the movie; suggestive, not graphic. I will not watch movies that will bring fear to my mind. My husband picked this one and we watched it together. I though it was just as scary as "The Shining." As far as scary goes it gets a ten on my fear scale.

		<fullReview>The genre should have been comedy. This movie was neither scary, mysterious, or thrilling. It was a horrible movie. Please tell me the book was better. I found myself during all of the "scary" parts of the movie. The scariest part to me was probably when Liam Neeson got the class stuck in his hand and had to pull it out. I found myself wondering why good actors such as this would actually agree to take part in this sorry excuse for a horror film.  Liam Neeson was in good, quality movies until he hit "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace" which is number 1 on my list of over rated movies. It's like that was the movie that ruined his career. Catherine Zeta-Jones (Traffic) is also a pretty decent actress. I can't possibly come to understand what she was thinking when she said yes to this movie. That blonde guy...I don't even know his name...will probably never get another role after this. And then there's Lili Taylor. What can I say about her? She was horrible. Isn't she the girl from Ransom (which in my opinion was a good movie). I can't remember her acting on this but I hope she hasn't gotten worse through the years. I found myself wanting to jump into the movie and slap her. Is this how she really talks? Or is it her acting voice. She had lines like "the children need me," and "even in death you wouldn't let them go." Who the heck cares about some children that died like 200 years ago? They're dead...get over it. And she has to be the one to save them because she is their great great great (sure there are some more greats in here) aunt. There was no plot to this movie, none of the stuff that happened was explained, and the stuff that was supposed to be scary wasn't. OMG it's a statue...let me scream in fear and trip over myself while I'm trying to run away! The ending will have you laughing and thanking God that this movie is over. Rent the movie if you want a good laugh... 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wondered during watching this flick whether Jan De Bont (a fellow Dutchman) had seen the original Haunting. Because from this movie he could have learned that LESS is MORE. This is the ground rule in making a successful horror flick. Alien, Jaws, Poltergeist are all movies in which most of the time you don't see what the characters are up against. The same with the original Haunting from 1963 in which you don't get to see the enemy at all, you just hear it.This suggestion of 'something's in here with us' has been totally annihilated in this version. Added to that the horrible acting performances of the cast except maybe Lili Taylor who delivers a somewhat credible performance.The only positive credit goes out to the CGI and physical effects people for delivering astonishing effects, but regrettably this didn't help the movie much, it even diminished the scaryness factor. It's these effects people that prevent this movie from getting a 1 instead of a 3.Better luck next time, Jan.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed watching the updated version of the Haunting. The special effects and color were very vivid and well done, and with a slight twist from the original I thought it was a well done re make, However these same qualities does not make it as scary as the original 1963 version which was done in black and white, its what you don't see that I feel made the 1963 version more scarier, and haunting</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film on video. I knew beforehand that if it was to come anywhere near the 1963 B&amp;W classic of the same name it would have to be good. I was badly let down. The story line had been destroyed, the special effects were not special (the use of angles, lighting and sound was all that was needed in '63'), the characters were cardboard. If anyone enjoyed this I ask them to get the original and prepare to be terrified by the simple things. I gave it 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good actors; horrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be the worst horror film of the decade. The story was sketchy, the character development non-existent, and the house a cartoony joke. The scariest part of the entire movie was when the house formed eyes and stared down at the bed-That's it. Personally, I wouldn't want to watch an entire movie for only one scare. The computer effects were not in the least scary and at most startling. And, while the actors portrayed their weak written roles as best as possible, still the essence of the movie drains through the plot holes. A movie as strongly advertised as this brings down the entire genre when it promises great fright but turns out deader than the ghosts haunting it.</fullReview>

With none other than Sylvester Stallone in the lead role!! Can you imagine Stallone saying: "You're a big guy, but you're out of shape. For me, this is a full time job!" No, I don't think so.Back to the Haunting. Its really annoying that younger people of today will probably have enjoyed this drivel, because they haven't seen the original. It will be the same with Get Carter too probably. Tsk. Tsk. When will Hollywood learn ? What's next? James Bond remakes with an American actor in the role ? Frenzy ? The Italian Job ? or maybe Zulu ?BE MORE ORIGINAL. Stop Nicking our Ideas, and come up with some of your own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a little bit better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film relied a lot on visual effects (which were amazingly brilliant) and the house itself, which was a sort of "Citizen Kane meets the Munsters". The house itself was awe-inspiringly immense and ornate beyond description - it cannot be put into mere words the size and decor of this place.The beginning of the film was quite boring. For the first 5 minutes I had no idea where the film was going. I think it was just there to tie up what the rest of the film was about.The film itself started off with a good storyline which it kept almost until the end. Having a main character become one with the door (and therefore, of course, the afterlife) was, I think, a bit of a let down. They could have done something else with her.I think overall the imagery in the film made it the hit that it is, but it is still definately worth a see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!!!!! This movie was sooooo good. I went with a group from work and we all loved it. It was the late showing and the auditorium was packed. The whole audience got into it and laughed a little in the couple of humorous spots and jumped and screamed in the rest. The acting was superb and the fx were top notch. (Done by ILM so of course they were.) :) The story was great. I saw the original a few years ago and it was great for it's time but this new updated remake for the 90's does make it even better. I know not everyone likes it and of course the critics have given it bad reviews overall but hey, they're critics. They wouldn't know a good movie if it came up and bit them in the a**. :) Face it, a good rule of thumb is, if the critics don't like it, it will be excellent and probably a block buster; if the do like it, then it probably sucks. And excellent example is the Blair Witch Project. They've given that movie top ratings and it REALLY stinks as far as it can. Take the Blair movie and think "Plan nine from outer space" and you just be touching the tip of how bad that movie is. But I digress. Sorry. GO SEE THE HAUNTING!!!!!!!!! IT'S AN EXCELLENT FLICK!!! :)</fullReview>

I felt the rest of the cast was good as were the special FX. I was shocked they decided to make Theo bi [in the original it was hinted she was a lesbian]. I thought the script held a new perspective.

		<fullReview>This was a TRULY amazing movie. I highly recommend it! Its got great acting (especially from Lili Taylor), awesome effects and stunning production design. But all the kudos should go to director Jan De Bont for combining all these elements and more into a thrill ride that doesn't stop. It has funny moments without being corny, it is scary with about being gory and it is dramatic without being boring!! All horror films should aim for this high level of filmmaking craftsmanship. The pacing is perfect - the FX don't overwhelm you, they slowly increase to build your suspense and amazement. I literally jumped out of my seat and had my mouth hanging open several times. In the horror genre, this movie is head &amp; shoulders above all the other recent films like SCREAM, etc. I always thought horror movies were mostly dumb, but this movie can be summed up in one word: SMART. It harks back to classics like THE SHINING where psychological horror was better than pure gore. And that, I think, is the ultimate compliment!!</fullReview>

To pad the review let me add Owen Wilson should be forced to eat brussels sprouts while buying a used car with a loan from a bank. Lili Taylor should stay away from the front of the camera and maybe work as a grip or in the deli section. Zeta-Jones should have taken all of her clothes off. At least it would have been a distraction. Liam Neeson should simply go find the original negative and burn it. Jan de Bont should pal around with Owen Wilson and eat lots of brussels sprouts. Finally, if you're gonna make a movie and spend a ton of money on it, why not hire a scriptwriter instead of just asking the pizza delivery guy to come up with some 'hot' ideas.And the ending sucked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie upon first impression leaves this reviewer asking, " Did I do something to mess this up? Was it me?" Only after a second viewing does it becomes apparent that it's the movie's fault. This is a remake of a 1963 movie that was itself a poor poor adaptation of the Shirley Jackson masterpiece The Haunting Of Hill House- if you haven't read it, the book is like a modern day epic poem as a tale of horror. Certainly the 1963 film adaptation fell short, and this version manages to fall short of the '63, that's a big empty space of a difference between The Haunting (1999) and the book. The book is classic, the movie is lowest common denominator over-the-top Hollywood psychopathy on display. You would have made more money if you just did a film version of the book- good stories are eternal, special effects are forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shouldn't be compared to the 1963 film, but still a (very) atmospheric chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Haunting (1999) when I was 4 years old and I loved it as a kid. Although I don't consider it such a great film nowadays, specially when compared to much superior 1963 original, I consider it a fun movie that works better as a stand-alone film. As a matter of fact, I think it would've had much more praise had it been a stand-alone film. It's also better than most of the stupid, PG-13 remakes out there, like the godawful Prom Night remake. The film has something else that lacks in every PG-13 horror remake nowadays: the atmosphere. The Haunting is filled with atmosphere. The set desing is jaw-dropping, for the likes of Suspiria and The Shining. The dark imposing mansion, it's very creepy and the house setting in this film is better than the house from the original. The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith is haunting and beautiful, showing us he hasn't lost his touch, and it's up there with the scores he composed for The Omen and Poltergeist. The acting is, well, not so good, and you can expect that from Owen Wilson (WFT IS HE DOING IN A HORROR MOVIE ANYWAY?!). Lily Taylor does the best she can as the outcast protagonist and I sympathize with her character more than I did with Julie Harris in the 1963 film. However, the 1963 film is better in almost every way and it's of course a classic, one of the best of the genre. Liam Neeson also does a good job. Catherine Zeta Jones steals the scene as the wild Theo, and is probably the best actress in the film. Even the direction is good, which surprises me considering it came from the director of Speed. DeBont proves to me he's a big fan of Kubrick's The Shining, considering how the film appears in a terrifc scene in Twister and here it's obvious he's influencd by that film. In any case, watch The Haunting. It's worth it, it's not as bad as people claim it to be and try to watch it with an open mind, I really hope you enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, a big mistake on my part: watching this movie the night after I watched 'The House on Haunted Hill'. Since the two movies were made in the same year, and both involved a ghost house, I thought Haunting would be as good as Haunted Hill (I consider B-rated special effects and many by some called 'cheap' thrills good, Haunted Hill was one of the few movies in a long time I saw that gave me the creeps). How could I be so mistaken? This movie is called a horror, I would go as far to call it supernatural drama. The only time the house really murderers (I don't consider the ending murder), It was over too fast and you could see it coming from two miles away. Only plus to this movie are the special effects and Liam Neeson's acting. You want horror with ghosts inside walls? See House on Haunted Hill, or The Frighteners, even Casper is scarier than this.</fullReview>

The photography through out the picture was great and the acting of Catherine Zeta Jones,(Theo),"Chicago",'02, was very outstanding. Theo was very sexy and showed her great beauty in all the modern fashions that she wore in many of the scenes. Liam Neison,(Dr. David Marrow),"Gangs of New York",'02 gave a great supporting role and appeared as a very confused Doctor who had a bad experience climbing on a spiral staircase! Bruce Dern,(Mr. Dudley),"Madison",'01, was a mysterious grounds keeper who gave a few quick chills as he opened and closed the huge castle gates.

		<fullReview>What a sad, sorry mess "The Haunting" is. As one who realizes that the original 1963 version is THE most frightening movie ever made, I knew an FX-laden "new" version would be unlikely to hold a candle. But I went anyway, hoping for a pleasant surprise, hoping I'd see a movie which--even if I didn't like it AS much as the original--I could like in a different way, for different reasons, and on its own terms. No such luck. It was far worse than I'd anticipated."The Haunting" '99 is the antithesis of "The Blair Witch Project" of the same year: BWP is a no-budget, no-stars, no-FX project that (for those of us who get it) delivers an emotional impact that transcends "scary" into such territory as panic, dread and despair. H'99 is a slick, big-budget, star-studded, FX-burdened product typical of the sort of "horror" movies made by people who have no idea what a horror movie is. Director Jan De Bont, whose oeuvre includes such other empty exercises as "Twister," "Speed," and "Speed 2," has joined my short list of directors to avoid.Not content with cluttering up the story with CGI effects (virtually all of which are telegraphed by the previews), this version also completely bastardizes the story (i.e., Shirley Jackson's). Instead of a straightforward paranormal investigation, we get a study of fear (why?) masquerading as a study of sleep disorders (why?). The investigator's wife, who plays such an important part in the novel as a New Age flake who wants to communicate with the spirits, and in the '63 movie as a total skeptic, is completely absent here! The psychological tensions of the original book and film are gutted in favor of too-literal CGI FX for the cast to yell at, plus a cause-and-effect karma that make this more of a remake of "Poltergeist."Seems Hugh Crain, the builder of Hill House, was an EEEEEEEE-ville capitalist who--when he got tired of working children to death in his sweat shops--would abduct them to Hill House and not let them leave... not even now, years after his and their deaths. As if this metaphysical meditation on the Marxist view of "capital as dead labor" weren't bad enough, it's worsened by another of those heretofore-unknown, gee-that-explains-everything family relationships that were such unconvincing afterthoughts in the sequels to "Halloween" and the first "Star Wars." Shirley Jackson's estate should have pulled her name off this piece of... work.All the very finest moments from the first film--the perilous spiral staircase, the eerie suggestion of a face in the wallpaper, the heart-stopping scene of the whatnot on the other side of the door, the chilling question "Whose hand was I holding?"--are tossed off and trivialized here. The fine cast deserves better: Liam Neeson, as the investigator, is mostly wasted. Catherine Zeta-Jones is ideal as the wicked, impish, arty, sexually ambiguous Theo; if only she'd been allowed to play the role in a better film. Owen Wilson, whose best work is in comedies, plays Luke with his perpetual pucker. And Lili Taylor, always interesting, never cast in a stable role, is the perfect choice to play Eleanor; she's the main reason I decided to give this movie a chance. So it's disheartening to see her reduced to facing off against the ghost of Hugh Crain (a dead ringer for the Emperor in the "Star Wars" series) and mouthing such ridiculous dialogue as, "It's all about family! Well, I'M family, Grandpa! And I'm home now!" While it's good to see Bruce Dern is still alive, he, too, is wasted in a tiny role, but not one so brief as to be spared inane dialogue.Boring, silly, and trivial, not for one second frightening, made by people so out of touch with their source material that they thought a gratuitous decapitation was a good idea, "The Haunting" '99 succeeds only in making the original film--and Shirley Jackson's novel--AND "The Blair Witch Project"--AND "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"--look better by comparison.</fullReview>

Scream was (for me) perhaps the scariest movie I've ever seen (the first time not the 30.) The Haunting doesn't come close to Scream - but it has its scary moment. The acting is pretty good, but not more. It is obvious that it is the special effects that must carry The Haunting all the way as in one of Jan de Bont's (director) previous movies Twister. I expected a thin story, but instead I got a non-existing! It is totally crap - the main characters just runs around in a house that attacks them - with a very thin background story of the previous owner who beat up some kids....

The whole movie is really a big shame. All that money to build those impressive sets and all we get is a bad Poltergeist rip-off.

A few of the "disturbances" and the character names (except Liam Neeson's character) were the only things that resembled the "Haunting of Hill House." Well, that and the house of course.BUT...having said all that, I did enjoy the movie very much. It was a roller-coaster ride all the way through. The acting was very good (although I think Catherine Zeta-Jones' character Theo was UNDERused). But Hill House was, without a doubt, the star and main attraction. The special FX?

The first one didn't need special effects at all, and this computer generated farce made a mockery of the good work that was done by Ms Jackson and Robert Wise. I even wrote to the distributor from which I bought the flick, and they were going to give me credit for it if I sent it back. I didn't take them up on it however; I merely wanted to register my distaste for it.Owen Wilson was atrocious as Luke Sanderson; how could someone be so obnoxious? Lili Taylor was good as Nell Lance, however, and I felt sorry that she had to deal with this tripe. Catherine Zeta-Jones was good too, but I felt the same about her as I did about Taylor.The really stupid part was the carnival room scene. Who dreamed that up? They shouldn't have! What a waste of precious money on a really good story!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 1963 version was better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've read Shirley Jackson's story, "The Haunting of Hill House", you'll probably like the 1963 film, "The Haunting", fine. But this remake totally misses the point.The whole idea of a horror film is to scare the audience. But director Jan de Bont completely dropped the ball here. Instead of staying true to Ms. Jackson's story and leaving most of the details to the viewer's imagination (i.e., you're more afraid of what you CAN'T see), he gives us far too much information, thereby taking away many of the story's most frightening moments.Now don't get me wrong. The special effects in this version will knock you out of your seat. They are truly spectacular in and of themselves. But they are, for the most part, not scary. In fact, I actually laughed out loud at least twice.The acting isn't particularly impressive either. Liam Neeson (Dr. David Marrow) and Catherina Zeta Jones (Theo) have done infinitely better work, and Lili Taylor (Nell Vance) probably has. But it's probably not fair to fault them entirely. After all, it has to be difficult to act scared at such overblown, occasionally cartoonish special effects. But I did enjoy Bruce Dern's rendering of Mr. Dudley the caretaker. He played it to the hilt and I think he had fun with it.My recommendation: don't waste two hours and three bucks on this. Read the book instead, and then if you really want to see the story on screen, rent the 1963 version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you watch this movie you will be haunted by how bad it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was just talking about how awful this movie was with my wife the other day and decided to chime in. I rate how I feel about a movie based on a combination of what my expectations are for it based on the advertising, how much they spent making it, who is in it, and how much I paid to see it. So, a low budget clunker that I see at a $5 matinee show will get a pass over a high budget clunker that I pay full price for. The Haunting fits into the latter category. This is just a putrid pile of puss of a movie and I would think you would be better off in a dentist chair than sitting at home watching this film.I was sitting around a few years back watching some bad horror movie and realized that I had not seen a really frightening movie in a long time. I was in the mood to be scared and I saw the making-of video for The Haunting on HBO. It looked like it might be scary, with all of those menacing looking sets, so I decided to go see it that night with my wife, thinking we would be in for a scary movie. Turns out that the whole movie was nothing but menacing looking sets, with no scares behind them at all. In fact, my wife and I spent most of the time in the theatre laughing very loudly at the horrible plot, the inane dialogue, the misplaced special effects, and the absolutely horrid acting by Lili Taylor. I'm not sure what else she has been in, but based on her performance in this film I would never watch any of her other movies. I literally laughed every time she said "Hugh Crane" or whatever the ghosts name was. She acted the way a little kid would on the playground if they were playing The Haunting.By far, the thing that ticked me off the most in the movie was the menacing sets. It felt like they were setting you up the entire movie for something really scary to happen in one of these ominous rooms, but nothing ever happened. They spent an hour showing off the mansion and how weird it was, but nothing happened. A great example was the mirrored-room with the carousel. They went in there in the beginning and I thought something would happened. It conjured up images of Something Wicked This Way Comes, so I thought "OK, something weird has to happen in here". When they finally go back there, all that happens is that Nell sees herself in the mirror looking pregnant or something. What is that? How do you run around for two hours going "oh my God, something frightening is going to happen" and then nothing happens... Oh my God, the one lady got hit in the eye with a broken string form the harpsichord...ooooo I have to hide my eyes.I normally give any movie a chance, but we almost walked out of this one. If it had not been so comical seeing these actors floundering in the muck, we would have left. Never rent this, never buy this. It's one big, over-budget, set-driven nightmare that stole $18.00 out of my pocket. You want to be scared? Watch Jeff Goldblum's performance in The Fly. You want to laugh? Watch The Haunting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Films are about images; horror films moreso. Sets and effects are there only to create powerful, ideally lasting images. The images should transport, and in the case of horror, transport to a really uncomfortable place.To say that de Bont doesn't think this way is an understatement. He's a cinematic thug. There's a great tradition of making architectural films, of making a building a character. `Shining' is in this tradition, preceded by `Usher' and `Pendulum' in the horror genre.It is possible to have a flashy environment to no effect (`The Cell'), to have terror by not showing much of the environment (`The Cube'), to have a truly scary environment in a non-scary film (`Casper'). I'm not kidding about Casper, check it out -- a true master of form designed that mansion.I see this film as a parody of itself. The builder of the mansion, Crain, overdid it because of inept, misguided, overblown power, which is also the story of de Bont.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most frightening thing about this misbegotten mess? THE BUDGET!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, this should've been titled "Eugenio Zanetti's THE HAUNTING." The extremely prolific and talented production designer is now batting two-for-two when it comes to creating dazzling, breathtaking sets for movies that absolutely tanked, (WHAT DREAMS MAY COME was the other one.) I got more goosebumps wondering what it would be like to personally tour the HAUNTING'S sets, than to watch the movie.Oh, yeah, and we DO have to talk about that, don't we? Four blatantly miscast actors in a ham-fisted script that completely dispenses with the concept of subtlety in horror. What, didn't anybody ever watch the classic Robert Wise original and realize what its "secret" allure really was? (Did they even read Shirley Jackson's source novel, for that matter?)What I would give to have seen what a director like David Lynch, or Darren Aronofsky, or even Ang Lee would have done with the prospect of a remake of this material. With all due respect to Jan de Bont...SPEED? TWISTER? Where in his pedigree did it indicate that he was the man to recruit to tackle a tale whose creepy shivers are almost solely derived from the ethereal, the atmospheric, the UNSEEN? Oh, well. Chalk up another monumental example of Hollyweird ineptitude. Besides the near-perfect Wise adaptation, the best contemporary version of the tale after it still remains to be THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, with Richard Matheson's superb tip-of-the-hat to Ms. Jackson's novel in both his own novel and the excellent screenplay. Want to see four people in an old dark house explore the boundaries of unseen terror? Clive Revill, Gayle Hunnicutt, Pamela Franklin and the late, great Roddy McDowall were every bit as convincing as Richard Johnson, Russ Tamblyn, Claire Bloom and Julie Harris. With Neeson, Taylor, Wilson and Zeta-Jones, I wasn't buying it for a second, though they are all fine actors when given material that is truly worthy of their capabilities, and Lili Taylor does manage to come out of this with a measure of dignity.So do yourself a favor of fear...skip de Bont's place, and "pass go" directly to the old Hill House. Or even Hell House.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tales of old haunted houses have always been a big kick for me and while this one might not be a classic it is a lot of fun to watch. The effects help tell the story rather than dominate it and the acting and characterisation draw you in nicely. The pacing could have been better but it's still adequate enough to hold the interest. It's not one to go see in a cynical or analytical frame of mind, just put the brain in a jar and watch - much better that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1963 version of this film managed considerable chills and thrills WITHOUT resorting to silly special effects. This awful re-make is an example of Hollywood at its laziest. They've taken the basic premise (a scientist enlists two young woman and a skeptical young man to participate in his overnight study of a haunted mansion) and stuffed it full of loud, obnoxious special effects. Director Jan De Bont doesn't know the first thing about suspense in film. With any good horror movie, the imagination of the audience is the most powerful tool in a filmmaker's arsenal- Hitchcock, Craven, Carpenter, and Shyamalan all know this. Unfortunately, the dreadful 1999 version of THE HAUNTING never even tries to engage our imagination; it's too busy piling on the CGI.</fullReview>

But The Haunting is the most frightening film since The Exorcist. In my 18 years of existence, I never saw an audience so scared in a theater.The Haunting is starring very good actors and actresses: Liam Neeson(The Phantom Menace), Catherine Zeta Jones(The Mask of Zorro) and Lily Taylor. It is rare in a movie these days that we see such a very good chemistry between the actors. Liam Neeson is very good as usual and Catherine Zeta Jones is very beautiful as usual. I never saw Lily Taylor in other movies but she is a very wonderful actress.Finally, go see The Haunting. It's the scariest and one of the best movie I've ever seen. ***** out of *****</fullReview>

There is not one ghost or swirling mass in the 1963 version with the incredible Julie Harris and Claire Bloom, but it will put you under the covers! Robert Wise treats his audience with respect and let's us scare outselves. Knowing the human imagination, when allowed to run, is scarier than anything you can put on film.

Of course, special FX are pretty well special in the FX dept, but this is marred by the weak plot and lame acting.

		<shortDescription>Not the worst movie ever made, but horrible none the less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the other reviews call this the worst movie ever made, well, it's not.I'm first going to say the good points about it. First off, the special effects will make you drool. They are so good, and so original that no one, NO ONE can say this movie is 100% bad. Oh, and Catherine Zeta Jones is in it. That's about it though.Movies like this are like M&amp;Ms (this is a long analogy, so go with it). The movie's soul (the characters, the acting, the plot, the theme, etc...) are like the chocolate. The extra stuff (the special effects, the sound, etc...) is like the candy coating. As you know, about 90% of an M&amp;M is chocolate, because that's what tastes best. Same goes with movies. Now, M&amp;Ms need the coating too. Other wise, it would just be chocolate, boring chocolate. In movies, special effects are nice editions, but they need a chocolate center to cover.Now, if the IMDb editors haven't cut out my analogy, if the Haunting was an M&amp;M, it would be all coating. No chocolate, at all. And that is pretty sad seeing how this movie is a REMAKE, of a movie BASED on a book. You would think at some point along this movie's script they could have added interesting stuff. But, noooooo. It's almost like they subtracted stuff and replaced it with uninteresting dribble.The thing I hate most about this movie is Lillie Taylor and her character Eleanor. First off, this woman can't act, period. I break out laughing whenever she speaks. Her character is also way too complex. When someone makes a stupid movie, just leave it stupid. There was no way of making this movie smart, and the good people at Dreamworks know that. So why, WHY did they try to put a complex character in a movie where all the other characters are 2-dimensional recycled trash?I really don't consider this a movie. It's a demo tape for the Dreamworks visual effects team. It was made so they could say, "Hey, I did the CGI effects on the Haunting", and people will be impressed. But, if some one, say the actors or the director says," Hey, I was in/directed the Haunting", people will run in terror. This is a scary movie. It's scary that someone had the idea to make it. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! (Note; buy this movie if you want to impress some friends with you new home entertainment system, other wise, avoid at all costs)</fullReview>

Who wrote the screenplay, R.L. Stein?The characters are utterly alien. They rush into situations where they should be terrified. They brush off serious questions, leave Nell alone when they think she's in danger, fail to even check on her claim that she found skulls under the fireplace (okay, the headshrinker makes a dulsatory attempt, but doesn't follow through), send the biggest and heaviest member of the group up a fragile set of stairs instead of having the slender woman come back down them, et cetera ad nauseum.If the dialogue got any cornier, the FDA would classify it as a vegetable and add it to the Food Pyramid.Visually, it's beautiful. If you want to feast your eyes, watch it without the sound, maybe listening to some classical music. Then it's salvageable. Otherwise, it's a waste of time.</fullReview>

There is no gore. There is no ceiling hand. It is only the ghost ad how ghosts can truly kill a person. They cannot kill us, they cannot throw us about the room or fly a knife into our head. No. They can only drive us mad. Taking away all our senses of security. Nell was a selfish woman. She only wanted good things for herself. Yes, she cared a little for the others, but not too much.

There was no eerie mood set by the music, the lighting, the characters, or the dialog.

Then, all of a sudden, Theo asks if it's one of Luke's sick jokes, considering that they've known each other for 30 minutes and Luke hasn't made even one single joke before that. Second, people start thinking that Nell is having a mind disturb due to the fear and the scariness; then, instead of doing everything to not scare her anymore, Theo leaves her in that creepy big room by herself - turning the lights off and closing the door before leaving, oh yea of course.

The only person who comes out of this relatively unscathed is Zeta-Jones, but this is probably because she was at the beginning of a relationship with one of the most powerful men in the business, and her previous two films were solid performers at the box office.The film isn't scary in the slightest, not even for a haunted house movie, and it has no sense of dread or emotion at all.See for the sole reason of De Bonts career at it's worse, and he directed Speed 2...</fullReview>

It didn't show any gore, not even any blood, yet it had you checking under the bed, inside the closet, and behind every door before you went to bed that night (&amp; maybe a few nights thereafter if you were sensitive to horror movies). This re-make is a substantially different plot. In the original Eleanor is a highly sensitive weak willed single woman (read "Spinster") who was badly taken advantage of by her family. She has no will to resist the deadly spirit of Hill House. In the re-make, Eleanor is a highly sensitive strong willed single woman (if she's a "Spinster", WOW!) who was badly taken advantage of by her family. Having gone through 11 very hard years with her invalid mother, she has developed the inner strength to stand up to, and defeat the deadly spirit of Hill House. The all-star cast helps the re-make, the house itself (well, the special effects) is a leading character in the re-make &amp; is VERY impressive. The set (I include Katherine Zeta-Jones as a moving prop) is incredible. All in all a good one for horror fans if not a blockbuster for the rest of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am usually not scared of horror films much, but I will say the original 1963 classic chiller 'THE HAUNTING' based off of Shirley Jackson's novel 'THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE' scared me to death! I think what made the original film so scary is that it makes you rely on your imagination, as you never really see any monster or ghost, while here it's one huge special effect after another which really, the CGI effects look terrible. The problem I think here is everything is handed to you with poor special effects that look cheesy...BUT if you can get passed those, even though it's a remake, and not very good...'The Haunting' is enjoyable.The house and set and Jerry Goldsmith's amazing and gorgeous score help engage you into the film as well as some nice cinematography. The acting is so-so, with Catherine Zita Jones being a pretty face to look at, but an 'OK' performance. Lili Taylor, I personally think does very well, though sometimes a bit fake...Owen Wilson makes things look too goofy, but isn't terrible and Liam Neeson is okay. Over all is you can tell this was a Hollywood movie...it looks as if the film makers and studio said, "Lets make a film that we can have loads of special effects with!" Not even bothering to care about atmosphere and other important factors of a horror film.But after all these terrible not very good moments and even though it is a remake of one of my all time favorite horror films, if you can get past the terrible effects, sometimes bad acting and writing...well you might find 'The Haunting' pretty enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunted house movie that's high on budget, but low on scares.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Haunting" came out back in 1999 and is directed by Jan de Bont (Speed, Twister). The story is set up when Dr David Marrow convinces three insomniacs to spend the night in a mansion. He does so by telling them that he is studying insomnia in an attempt to help individuals such as themselves. What he's really doing though is studying the effects of fear and how different people react in very diverse ways. Sure enough, the group begin to show signs of paranoia and fear. But are they imagining things or is there something far more sinister happening in the house? I thought this version of "The Haunting" had a fair few things going for it when I heard about it. Firstly, it's based on a successful 60s film that was really very good. You'd think that with an increased budget ($80 million) and standard in both audio and visual effects, they'd be able to improve on the original. It also has some big names in it with Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson all included. Even the house that the film takes place in is suitably massive and creepy. Surely all these ingredients would add up to an above average fright flick! Well unfortunately, it didn't work out the way it should have. The reasons for this aren't all that easy to define. I mean, the acting is OK (Owen Wilson shouldn't play these roles though, he should stick to comedy), the house itself is perfectly designed and the audio is filled with creepy sounds and disturbing whispers. But even with all this, it's just not frightening in any way. The movie spends the first hour setting things up and your patience will seriously be tested. When things actually do start happening towards the end of the film, it feels contrived and even unintentionally humorous at times. The dialogue is fairly atrocious, the first death scene is ridiculous (will you just move!) and there's nothing subtle about anything that occurs. This is the main difference between the original and the remake. The 1963 version worked on the viewer's nerves through suggestion and believability. It was all about what you couldn't see that was frightening! Instead, the creators of this version decided to show us everything, and considering how fake a lot of the CGI appears, it only lessens the effect rather than improving on it.As you can tell, I'm disappointed in this film. It's not a complete waste of time and I've definitely seen worse. But I can't really recommend it as a must see film. I know it has been said a thousand times already, but "see the original instead".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weak horror movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting is a very disappointing movie. Although the actors play well the plot is so absurd, weak and ridiculous that it is not a good movie. The first 30 minutes of the movie are quite boring and nothing happens. Then the persons in the castle are attacked by ghosts and the plot becomes absurd. I really wondered how film-makers can have such absurd ideas by developing the movie. The only point I like is Jerry Goldsmith's score. The main theme which is related with the score of "Hollow Man" makes the atmosphere at least a bit scary. But all in all this film is not a good horror movie. There are many other films which are much better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice creepy movie for kids.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is wild (in a boring way), the effects are good but simply not creepy at all and the actors seem to be as bored as the audience.The only tension I felt throughout this whole movie was when Catherine Zeta-Jones approached Lili Taylor with her sexual hunger. I was hoping for a little lesbian scene.You don't feel the evil in the house (which is a very nice house, I give the movie that) and without that, a movie about a bad house can't work. What does one need to create some nice horror? A bit of gore, some suspense, believable work of the actors, characters to relate to and an uneasy style. This was just a children's birthday party. Boring!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but could have been MUCH better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented the movie in DVD and I don't regret for not having watched it to the cinema. It is a pure DVD-made horror(?)movie with some very good points and plenty of others which were either bad or improvable. The setting of Hill House was MAGNIFICENT: all the large rooms with all these carvings, statues and cherubims-work of art set an ideal surrounding for a creepy story to take place. I also have to praise Lili Taylor for her (although debut)very good and sensitive performance on the role of an ordinary woman with financial problems who realizes that her familial past has something to do with this house. I believe that she carries on her shoulders the whole acting level, although i also liked Catherine Zeta Jones and Liam Neeson. The picture was beautiful, the score adequate. That's it for the good part. Let's move on to the bad points. Although the plot and the past of the house is really interesting, the interest at the beginning expires after the first half, when the pure ghost atmosphere is replaced by VERY cheap, and goofy, and funny, and stupid, and uninspired special effects, clear product of the American comprised film-making.Some scenes are really funny, but I won't mention them:whoever has watched it knows. Owen Wilson breaks on my nerves as he is too cool and "I don't care about anything, I live in my own world" character, and I really liked it when the flue eats up his head!I also have to say that the ending was OH MY GOD!Just awful! Generally I expected much more. I will also watch the original movie and I hope this one doesn't "die" when I compare them.5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed watching the actors and the music was good. The scenery was also quite fantastic. And I do enjoy watching my DVD version now and then. However, I also watch my other DVD of the original with Julie Harris, Richard Johnson, Clare Bloom and Russ Tamblin which was much more mysterious. I don't mean scary slimy bloody stuff they throw at the audience now to make money...I mean it was actually a good old fashion MYSTERY!!!! The house in this version was large enough to get lost in but they all seemed to have no trouble at all running around from room to room. Eleanor being a relative came out of the blue in a way that you weren't sure whether it was in her mind or not. If it was actual in this version, they should have had her find something to allude to it and surprise her! But I watch this version for the pleasure of enjoying the performances of the actors, especially Liam Neeson!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's leave aside the Gothic architecture of the haunted house(although I cannot deny I like the griffins)and let's focus our attention upon the message the movie wants to convey. And the message's this: you cannot escape your fate. Poor Nell Vance played by Lily Taylor thought she could find relief living for a short time in this magnificent mansion. She had been taking care of her Mom till her death and she doesn't know that she'll find in that haunted manor not only the ghosts and the fears of her past but that she's also doomed to die there. What I mean is : is there an unluckier woman than her? Lily steals the show undoubtedly in this flamboyant movie, whereas Catherine Z. Jones shines only because she's really very , very hot.As for Liam Neeson who plays Dr. Marrow and Owen Wilson who stars as the third guest of the manor,: well let's be honest their roles are not so poignant in this movie although Dr. Marrow's idea of causing fear in his patients is not such a bad idea.Problems come when he loses control of the whole thing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The problem with Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting perfectly demonstrates EXACTLY what the problem is with Horror films today. I don't think The Haunting is an unforgivably bad movie, it just so happens to make all the mistakes that most horror movies do, and is more obvious in doing it. You have a menacing setting for a movie, throw in a cast of actors that deliver empty and meaningless performances, and completely misuse your elements of "terror". The problem with The Haunting is that it actually does an OK job of building suspense and making the audience feel a little awkward and tense, but ruins it by the end. There are some decent sequences that visually work and in the end, do make me jump. Like the scene with the fireplace. That was pretty good, because you didn't see what was coming. We've heard it a million times. It's always scarier NOT to see something. Now here's the problem. In the last 30 minutes of The Haunting, they have the idiotic idea of SHOWING us everything. All secrets and mysteries are revealed, which takes away all intrigue we had, because like in every horror movie out there now, the whole movie has to be explained so in depth. Remember when Horror movies were great because they didn't always answer all the questions. And then the second major problem. We get a huge visual effects sequence that's supposed to jump right out at the audience, stun us, shock us, and blow us away. But of course, how can this work when there's no mystery or suspense anymore. In the last act of this movie, there's nothing to be scared of because you've now seen everything, and know everything that's been going on. Plus, the audience can't be shocked or terrified by a huge visual effects monster when we've pretty much seen it all before. When effects have reached the point they have, nothing is stunning or frightening to look at. Also, if we know it's a visual effect, there's nothing scary about it. The Haunting does a good job of building suspense, but throws it all away on a cheap and goofy over-the-top ending. Strangely enough, this review I just wrote could be posted for House On Haunted Hill, 13 Ghosts, Ghost Ship, or any other of the countless movies like it. Bringing me back to what I said at the beginning, The Haunting demonstrates what is wrong with ALL horror movies.But I will give Liam Neeson some credit. He had a really interesting performance, that unlike everyone else in the movie, he plays well. But alas, no matter how good a performance is, it's not enough to make up for cheap material. But I did catch myself flipping to this movie a few times on TV recently to see him again. That must count for something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Haunting could have been so much better, it is just a shame Lili Taylor is boring and that there are not enough scares to keep us interested.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*MINOR SPOILER* I was definitely intrigued by a cast which seemed a bit mixed - Liam Neeson (serious), Owen Wilson (comedy), Catherine Zeta-Jones (Welsh) and the other one who I had never seen before (Lili Taylor), or again for that matter. So didn't know quite what to expect... And so onto the film, it concentrates (unfortunately) on Eleanor (Lili Taylor) following the death of her mother. She responds to an ad looking for insomniacs to take part in a study undertaken by Dr David Marrow (Liam Neeson) who is actually going to try and scare them and see what happens. Fair enough, so they meet up at the haunted house along with Theo (Catherine Zeta Jones), and Luke (Owen Wilson) and we wait for scary things to happen. Unfortunately it takes far too long for the scariness to begin (what little of it there is). Yes, the house is weird, lots of odd rooms ready for scary set-pieces, but they are not exploited as they could have been. Eleanor is just so dull that I just ended up not caring about her in the end. The special effects were also a little boring. It is much scarier not to now what the cause is, rather than seeing some face in a curtain. Our one quality piece of entertainment was the flume-decapitation of Owen Wilson, a classic. Sorry to spoil it, but we knew at least one of them had to die. The story grinds on to its boring, pointless conclusion that we just don`t care about in the end. It could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly - forget the comments that one reviewer has said that this is superior to the original - just two simple words 'its not'.Yes the effects certainly are impressive, but where is the story? Where is the suspense and where for God's sake is the acting? The effects are so much in your face it leaves nothing to the imagination - and there's nothing scarier than what you can conjure up in your own mind. Zeta Jones is laughable (but I have to admit beautiful), Liam Neeson looks like he's half asleep, Owen Wilson is Owen Wilson - a word of praise for the casting crew though for Lily Taylor - she gives the film's only half-way decent performance and she actually looks like Julie Harris, the original Eleanor.I judge a film to be scary by the fact that I cannot watch it alone at full volume and at night. This I watched very late on - all around me got bored and went to bed - I stayed with it and had a darned good laugh - but that is all it is good for.Marks out of ten as a comedy - 6 Marks out of ten as a horror - 0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quit the CGI effects...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers ahead*First of all: The House is amazing. I know that everyone has said so - but I had to say it as well. Whoever did the sets must have had a great time. Everything in the house (more or less) was beautiful but very sinister. They spent about the first ten minutes just showing us some of the creepy places in the house - unfortunately this meant that you knew what was going to happen. I mean, take the Lion Pendulum. When you see it fall down for the first time, without anyone getting hurt - you know that someone's going to lose their head there. Because if they didn't - we wouldn't have seen it, would we?I think the first half of the movie works alright. Strange noises, rattling doors, that woman almost losing her eye and the creepy paintings - it all helps build up to something that I, wrongly, expected to be interesting. But when the CGI comes in, the movie completely loses the eerie touch that the wonderful sets tried to make. Nowadays we've seen about EVERYTHING in special effects - especially in this genre. So what's scary nowadays is to NOT show us what's going on. We don't need to see animated ghost kids (which only made me think of 'Casper' and completely ruined the movie) AND especially not the ridiculous animated Hugh Crain in the end. The paintings and photographs were spookier - the part where 'Nell' finds the photo album and flips through the pictures that animates Carolyn pointing at the fireplace I personally thought was a nice detail. But those darn little kids... The animation ruined everything. I was laughing through the last half of the movie because that really sucked. And all of a sudden Nell's not even scared of anything - come on! She spends 90 minutes of the movie having nervous breakdowns, and when she finally sees this huge, animated cloud of... something... apparently being the spirit of Hugh Crain, she just stands there in her nightie and scolds him, yapping about family. Resorting to a Disney-like ending where the heroine stands up to the bad guy and talks about the values of life does not work here. And why oh why did those skeletons on the gates of purgatory not drag him to Hell a long time before??? Anyway - the movie gets credit for the sets and the music... The rest was ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The '99 version of The Haunting is not nearly as good as the older version with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. That was true classic psychological horror. The new version, however, does have a great House. Hill House itself is the star of this movie. It may be that people truly knowledgeable in special effects might not think so, but to me, just watching the house was enough. I enjoy special effects that are not blood and guts. I can't even begin to describe all the things the house does, and anyway, I would not like to spoil it for someone who has yet to see The Haunting. If you like really wild special effects, watch The Haunting, and I hope you aren't disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of cheesy horror flicks. In fact, in general, when it comes to horror movies, my conclusion would be: the cheesier, the better. I especially love it when horror flicks stop trying to be scary and just mock their own genre. It is for this reason that I enjoyed the _Scream_ trilogy quite a bit. _The Haunting_ tries. And fails. And that's what made me pity it as a movie. The plot is minorly interesting in parts, but it seriously fails at the end. I hate when movies do that. They give you the impression that there might be some interesting plot-twist waiting at the end, there's all this build-up, and then it's like the film lets out one weak, wheezing breath at the end. Then, the screen goes blank, all is quiet, and you think, "That's it? What the hell?" The film had a couple redeeming moments, if they could be called that. When Lily Taylor's character begins shouting at her long-dead ancestors (supposedly now a part of the house, making it misbehave), I couldn't help but laugh. Oh, and when Owen Wilson gets his block knocked off by a gigantic lion's head on a pendulum, that made me laugh aloud, too. Other than that, I really wouldn't say that this is a film worth your attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very hopeful when I rented this film. It had a wonderful cast, and the mansion setting was spectacular. Unfortunately, the good news ended there. The premise seemed to lock the movie into two possible endings: either everything will be part of the scientific experiment about fear, or it would turn into a true ghost story. Thus, I never felt like there was going to be a real shock in the movie. I was prepared to simply enjoy the ride, but there was nothing to enjoy! The acting was wretched, the plot stumbled along, and the special effects were technically well done but artistically dead. I was hoping for something like 'What Lies Beneath,' but got only 'What Wastes Two Hours.'

		<fullReview>Spoiler This movie by far was not meant in my mind to be scarey. I truely find it only to be full of some scarey moments, but the movie is a mystery. You don't know the whole story about the house until the end. Although many think that it is meant to be scarey through out the movie and I have to admit that it is scarey in some points. I found in watching scarey movies (although I don't care to much for them) that some don't get scarey until the middle of it. It has another twist to it because within the mystery/scareyness of this movie there is also a love story going on. Theo has had a very unhappy relationship with both a man and a woman at the same time and finds in the beginning Nelle to be attractive at least in her sense. Theo flirts continuously with Nelle in the movie plus a little with the other character Luke whom I have to say I found to be quite annoying but that may just be me. I loved the ending because it showed that Theo eventually developed some love toward Nelle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The spooky house concept is used to moderate effect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it is far from being a bad movie, `The Haunting' is still unsatisfying in a few aspects. While the cast works well and the storyline is amusing, it doesn't let out its intended effect. The spookiness and disturbance seems very artificial and doesn't seem to flow naturally in the film. While the storyline itself is plain freaky, what the film delivers is something on a much lower note unfortunately. `The Haunting' takes on many of the usual horror clichés but, in this films case, it is used to its advantage.Luckily, its small but likeable cast makes up for most of the flaws. Lili Taylor takes on the lead role and is adequate for the part. She is ably supported by the more experienced Liam Neeson. He is a welcome addition to the film and makes it all the more watchable. Owen Wilson is equally impressive and likeable as a super cynic and cocky show-off. The most colourful and developed of the cast, though, is Catherine Zeta-Jones as a flamboyant over-the-top bisexual. The fact that her character is bisexual is a blatant draw for the male audience but she does a good job in her role, even though. The only other problem with the film is the resorting to shoddy computer images at the end of the movie (the same problem was in the similarly themed `House on Haunted Hill'). As if the scares weren't disappointing enough as they were, the CGI didn't help matters one bit. Nonetheless, some genuine scares come out of the film among the rest of the dross.The performances and likeabilty of the film fortunately overshadow the evident flaws, making `The Haunting' a general success. The formula and moderate blandness prevent it from being anything above good but you have a satisfying movie despite this. 6.2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really neat effects- and it actually has a story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess people have canned this one because it doesn't have a lot of gore and blood.. but it's called "The Haunting," which does suggest that it will be more about ghosts than murder, right? (I mean, you wouldn't expect "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" to be about bumps in the night, would you?) I saw this in the theater and was scared out of my wits, but of course it's much less scary on TV. I still like it a lot because instead of showing mindless dismemberment and disemboweling, they spend the time providing some personality to the main characters and letting you come along while one of them learns the secret of the house and eventually goes nuts. (Ehh, and of course Liam Neeson is there looking very sexy and captivating, as always. That doesn't hurt at all.) It also has really neat special effects that aren't just ghosts walking around (ala House on Haunted Hill), but the house *itself* actually comes alive and you can feel the evil presence in it. Only at the very end do they show a definite "ghost," and they build up to it - which is rare in modern movies. I am surprised so many people disliked "The Haunting," but I suspect it's because they were looking for a splashy-blood movie with main characters that are just dopes who wander around alone in basements, all but begging to be chopped up... not a "real" movie that details its characters and offers a genuine story. The only fault in "The Haunting" is the ending, which is hokey because Nell ends up blabbering some really cheesy lines. Otherwise I think this a really good one - (I've rented it several times.) because it isn't a brainless gorefest. If you want a movie like that, rent any of the Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street installments. "The Haunting" is a serious, chilly movie, not a cheaply made horror flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie to those who GET it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel sorry for this movie, for the horrid reviews it seems to be getting here. It seems that the majority, (if not the entirety,) of those who have commented here were looking for a gory, bloody, shock-horror, b-rate fright-flick. True, this movie does not live up to that style and if, at the time this came out, you wanted to see one of those, "House on Haunted Hill" was the better option.However, this movie was not INTENDED to be that sort! The story line is a far cry from the 1963 movie. "The Haunting" (1999) is meant to be a touching story, a story of discovery, of restitution almost. And in that, it does QUITE well.Lili Taylor does a very good job of portraying down-on-her-luck Nell, dealing with the death of her mother, the loss of her home, and her greedy siblings who took all that the mother's will had to offer. She may not be the quality of "It Came From the Swamp" or "The Blob" when it comes to shock-horror acting, but her quality styling of a more serious, down-to-earth role wins her much praise from this movie-goer.For those seeking to be scared out of their seats or, perhaps, their lunch, this is not a good movie. For those seeking a good story with a real plot and real characters, for those looking for a pleasant experience tempered with a bit of suspense, "The Haunting" is the most perfect film to have come to the screen in a long time. ... oh, and yes, the CGI effects were excellent, as well.

		<fullReview>The Haunting is not the best ghost movie around, but I still think it's great. Lili Taylor who plays the lead role of Nell here gives the best performance in the movie. Owen Wilson is okay too. Catherine Zeta Jones is awful though. The Haunting wasn't a creepy or chilling or even a scary movie, but it's definitely still worth seeing anyway, especially if you like these kind of movies (I do.) and you want to see a good movie. I give The Haunting an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>********THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SMALL SPOILERS!!!***********What's the matter with trailers these days? They show only the best parts of a movie, so that when you're watching the damn thing, you can find out it actually sucks! Like most of the movie fans on this site, I can conclude that the acting was terrible! I mean, I've seen Liam Neeson in 'Nell' and 'Rob Roy' and oh yes, 'The Phantom Menace ( Star Wars )', anyhow: he can do much better than THIS! Lily Taylor ( never heard of her before ) and Catherine ( yuck yuck ) as well as Owen Wilson ( look at that: the giant lion head bites his head off: yippeee! ) playing Luke Sanders, but erhm, it wasn't Wilson who annoyed me but his character, so sorry Owen..., they ALL seem to have no experience with acting. The plot did it again, right?What is so great about 'The Haunting' that I've bought both the VHS and the DVD-version? Well, listen up: **********HILL HOUSE-HILL HOUSE-HILL HOUSE-************* The Great Hall is the most spectacular part of the set, the painting of Hugh Crain, the fireplace,... Most people think the SFX suck too, but hey, that's not TRUE!!! The statues coming alive and the ghosts are very realistic. I do admit they could have made the children look less cartoony and Hugh Crain's ghost more scary. The hand coming out of a door, the voices etc. they were funny, yes, not even SPOOKY! I thought the giant lion carvings on the fireplace were the most scary, but also most beautiful parts of the interior,and more scary than Crain's huge painting. As I already said in my previous review: a sequel of this movie shouldn't contain actors of flesh and blood; no way: they should use Hill House itself. The outside, the inside, everything. Because th?t does deserve an Oscar. Have you heard me you Hillbillies in Hollywood???10/10 for Hill House 2/10 for the actingA 7/10 for the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first reviewer said pretty much what I wanted to, except for a few things. The house looks nearly identical to the one from "Casper 'Friendly Ghost'" &amp; "The Canterville Ghost" - The acting was not bad but not good either with a few over "exaggerated" moments. The bedroom in which the spikes came down is a cut + paste from "Murder by Death" - All the scary scenes &amp; animation were well put together and very believable. The cast was picked well except for Owen Wilson who was better in "Meet the Parents" then this flick! Out of 5 stars, I give this movie 3 1/2. If your TV is plugged through your receiver, turn on the bass for this one!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good scary film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting is a traditional scary film, complete with ghosts and a haunted house. However, the scriptwriter manages to make this film slightly different to the original haunted house movie. Four adults are locked up in an old-fashioned mansion for-they think- an experiment about sleep. Actually, the experiment is about fear, explaining the eerie setting. The house is very old, dark and sinister, making you want to tell the characters to look around the corner. It also contains many mirrors,from old gilted-around-the edge to new, modern square-shaped. The mirrors are one of the main props and reflecting on the past is an important theme in this film. The music in this film is also very effective, and is used to express the several different feelings of the main characters. Furthermore, when the ghosts appear, spooky background music creeps in. In fact, sometimes you don't even notice the music separately as it blends in so well with the characters and the setting. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this film. On the outside it seems just like another scary film, but once you have seen it, you realise that it has its own particular identity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the thing that people didn't like about the movies is that it was not scary enough.I have to agree with that. It was not too scary for the most part. The most intense scenes of horror only appear in the final quarter of the movie.For the most part of the movie "The Haunting" is a mystery. The ghosts of the children keep on trying to tell Nell something and it is only when she starts to figure out that Hugh Crane takes control and the terror level goes up big time.I believe that people will like this movie better if they think of it as a mystery instead of a 100% horror movie.If you want a haunted house movie that is 100% horror go see "House on Haunted Hill"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>... And what a house it was!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To use an old cliché, if nothing else, this movie is truly a "triumph of production design". The house really is quite spectacular, beautiful, mysterious, filled with wonderful artwork - and lots of SFX.While the 1963 version was very powerful in creating a "haunted" atmosphere, mostly by using the power of suggestion (using mostly sounds, special camera angles and creepy music, and letting your own imagination do the rest) here the makers took the opposite approach and pulled out all the stops in order to create a supernatural feast, truly making the whole house come alive.Also very nice is the music by veteran Jerry Goldsmith.So... is it a good movie? Well, I liked it. Was it over the top? Of course it was. And why not? What's the point in doing a remake of a classic if you're not going to try a different approach? If you don't like it, there's always the original...Check it out, if only for the gorgeous set design. A feast for the senses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What made me want to see The Haunting was it's awesome trailor and basically what was in the trailor were the only real exciting parts in the movie. The special effects were great and I loved the house it was a beautiful house. I think that they shouldn't have used cartoon type ghosts in it. I didn't like that to much and I also think the director shouldn't have been afraid of getting an R-rating, if he decided to go for it and not care about the MPAA. It might have been a real good movie and scary at that matter. The ending was quite a disappointment though I was intrigued by the whole Hugh Crane story. That was creepy..

It's terrible.This isn't much better but at least the house has more character and the cast is likeable enough. They must realize theyre trapped in a bad movie and are making the best of it. I think Lili Taylor is a great actress but she is wasted here. After seeing her in I Shot Andy Warhol, this is a step down. However: the special effects are pretty good, if you can overlook the fact they're in a plot that's as silly as a breakfast cereal commercial...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been reading the reviews that make this sound like the worst movie ever. I must admit that I found it scary and interesting. No, it's not great. The mansion and the effects are fabulous, but there's not a whole lot of story going on here. They also missed many opportunities to make you wonder what is really going on. I think it would have been more interesting if they had:1. Not killed anyone. The one killing was gratuitous and not necessary to the show at all.2. Kept you wondering if this is real or a put-on. It would have been far more interesting and much more of a challenge to the viewer.A bit more subtlety would have been really helpful, too.But, it's worth renting or watching on HBO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes the film barely worthwhile seeing is the mansion, the photography, and the special effects. If one expects a thrill, forget it. The plot is very predictable and there is no suspense. Part of the problem is Lili Taylor who plays the main character. Her performance at times makes one wonder whether they are watching a comedy or a thriller. The film opens with a scene between Taylor and Virginia Madsen in a battle over the estate of their mother but the story never resolves that issue and leaves it dangling. The ending leaves one unsatisfied in that it leaves too many ends untitled. One gets the feeling that they are not watching a thriller but only the hallucinations induced by the fear that the Doctor has generated. Catherine Zeta-Jones provided nothing in her supporting role. One good thing for the movie was that there was no gratuitous sex and no profanity or vulgarity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie clip of "The Haunting", and I just loved it. It was really scary, I couldn't wait to see it. Imagine myself in an old and haunted house must be really frightening, I thought. Moreover, the charming Catherine Zeta-Jones, who had really impressed me in "The Mask of Zorro", was in it. It was one of those "can't miss" movies. Consequently, I went to the movie theater with great expectations about it. I thought I would fell that I was there, in this startled house. But it wasn't that good. It is really slow, sometimes sleepy, it looses its way still in the beginning.Even so, it's a good movie, with some enterteining scenes and a little fear. People who wasn't expecting so much probably enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first "Haunting" is a genuinely scary movie. Special effects can be impressive, but a good story is needed to make the images cohesive. The new "Haunting" is artificially scary, all visual, offering nothing to crawl creepily under one's skin while watching alone on a dark night. It has none of the magic of the original Julie Harris / Claire Bloom movie. This technically wasn't even a remake, as the essence of the story was changed too much and overly complicated - when a straightforward ghostly mystery would have been much more disturbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie came about the same time House On Haunted Hill (the 1999 remake) came onto the big screens. While House on Haunted Hill was rated "R", The Haunting was only "PG-13."It should have been obvious that The Haunting wouldn't be too great of a scary movie from the PG rating, I saw it anyway. My hunch (which I ignored) proved to be right.The Haunting has some nicely done special effects. Unfortunately, this was about all it had. The movie had a few parts that might make you jump but these were so scattered and few that the movie doesn't really rate as a horror movie.The actors played their parts rather well, even though there wasn't too great of a character development; and finally, the ending seemed tacked on.I would recommend House on Haunted Hill over The Haunting. There's a lot of other movies in the horror/ghost genre that are scarier than The Haunting but since Haunted Hill came out at the same time, it's the first one that comes to mind. And besides, Famke Janssen (Haunted Hill) makes for a far better temptress than Catherine Zeta-Jones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the movie a starts very slow, and the effects part started half-way through the film, it's worth a look. Great acting work of course, and not even a bad story. Too bad the CGI isn't as good as it will be in a few years, you can see it's computer generated here and there (the eyes of the children's ghosts in example), but for the rest, it's really cool. The 'fight' between Nell and Crain in the end is over too fast, it should have lasted a little longer and it could have been more complicated. Conclusion: although I've seen better, it's a good movie with an even better cast that makes you speculate about such things as ghosts and stuff.</fullReview>

He gave a truly boring and poor performance. He was much better in Star Wars! Owen Wilson was also pretty irritating, but that doesn't matter he always is. Catherine Zeta-Jones was definitely the best of the cast. She had a very unusual part for her. Lili Taylor's voice is truly ear-cringing, but she acted well. The ending was kind of stupid, with all those computer generated angels flying all over the place. It also wasn't very emotional, and it didn't make much sense. Anyway, some good acting and cool special effects make up for some of the stupid parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's my opinion that when you decide to re-make a very good film, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least give it a fresh point of view. Now the 1963 Robert Wise telling of Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel "The Haunting of Hill House" is worth the price of admission even today. Now fast forward to 1999 and the re-make. I was left shaking my head and asking, why? The acting is wooden, the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate. I had heard that this update was bad; but couldn't believe it was that bad, considering the source material. I was wrong. After watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was, she said; "Well they got your money!" She's right, don't let them get yours. If there's no profit in making lousy re-makes, maybe they'll stop making them or come up to a higher standard that doesn't insult their audience</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very well done movie. I can't understand people who bash movies for having bad dialogue and bad plot, when it's only as bad as every other movie.Jan De Bont is a very talented director. He handles the atmosphere very well. In fact, I would go as far as saying that this movie has the best atmosphere I've seen since Poltergiest. Jerry Goldsmith's score, the massive, thoughtful and "Haunting" production design and the very creepy sound effects add to this. I was afriad of this movie being crud, De Bont being an action-man and not a horror movie veteran, But I found myself watching a nicely crafted film. Wes Craven couldn't have done better. It does have its flaws. It's a bit anti-climactic at times, and it does get a bit boring, but it is generally a very good movie. So, why didn't it do well at the box office, and why didn't anyone like it. Simply because it was a $100 million dollar film, the previews made it look scarier and more action packed. So, when people saw it, they were expecting a different movie and they were disappointed. It's not supposed to be a fully fledged gore fest, but a thoughtful and entertaining peice of film. It has the good old things, like the rattling chains, gothic wall sculptures and massive blowing curtains, which means that this movie doesn't takeitself too seriously, either. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Flick offers few surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty bad movie offers nothing new. The usual creaks and moans attempt to make-up for a muddled, but thin story. Acting is barely above pathetic. Why Liam Neeson signed on for this is anyone's guess. Owen Wilson truly turns in one of the worst performances in recent horror-movie history. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun to look at and not much else although Lili Tayor did an above-average job. The special effects were fairly memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous. However they can't makeup for the poor acting and the storyline which appears to have been thrown together at the last minute. Don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't even know where to begin on this one. "It's all about the family." That has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a "horror" movie, although this couldn't be a horror movie even if it tried!!! Ugh!!! And I know that Owen Wilson is a better actor. He needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man did co-write "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore." He does have some talent. Also, Lily Taylor should stick to indie films. She has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There's no room in legitimate acting for her. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, EVER.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was very awkward; but it's my kind of movie! the special effects were unbeatable. I liked Theo in it. She looked pretty good! First, Eleanor appeared as a dimwit to me, but then she become pretty cool. Liam Neeson was pretty cool too. I liked how he laughed when they were eating dinner. I do not know when and what guy that Hugh Cran could have built such a castle without people constantly looking at it. Jerry Goldsmith's music was also a plus. Even if you don't like the idea of ghosts, it's worth watching just for Catherine Zeta-Jones. 8*/10*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky, but not especially scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of pretty much all four of the main actors in this movie (some more than others) I was looking forward to seeing THE HAUNTING. After seeing the very cool-looking graphics that were on the commercials, I was even more excited. Unfortunately, I found that I had already seen most of the best-looking graphics on the commercials. I didn't find the movie too scary, but it was spooky at some parts.Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) wants to perform experiments using human guinea pigs to learn about human fear. He takes three subjects, Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Luke Sannerson (Owen Wilson), and Nelle Vance (Lili Taylor), who believe that the tests are about insomnia, to a giant mansion. The mansion has a scary history and some very creepy rooms, decorations and gargoyles. The subjects come to learn that the mansion truly is haunted, though Dr. Marrow thinks it is just part of his experiment. Soon, the four have to struggle to survive the night and get out of the mansion alive.The story line is fairly interesting, but this movie is overlong and tends to get boring at parts. The computer effects are fantastic, but they aren't shown enough until the end and most of those effects you probably saw on previews and commercials.Catherine Zeta-Jones stole the show, playing an extremely sexy bisexual. Liam Neeson did a fair job, but he does tend to go into spurts of over-acting. Owen Wilson does well as the comic relief and Lili Taylor did an OK job as the first woman to notice the mystery of the mansion. All characters are very different and it is fascinating to see how they all react to the haunted mansion.This movie is definitely worth a rent. You might be bored at some parts, but the action is good and the ending is fair. Go enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effects Film Low On Any Type Of An Entertaining Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yet to read Shirley Jackson's novel, something of which I've been meaning to do for quite sometime. I am sure it has got to be scarier than this film. I remember jumping once when I watched it the other day, although I cannot recall the scene. The special effects are great and I watched this on DVD, but I am sure in the theatre it must have been an awesome sight. After the first few special effects are done with I was waiting for a story to develop.I figured this movie at the least has to be loosely based on the classic novel, so a good story should be there, but it wasn't. I was relegated to staring at the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones character throughout the movie basically because there was nothing much else to watch. Lili Talor was such a suck character. I did not like her one bit, something about whiny people. Also, the guy in this film reminded me of the cartoonish Dudley DoRight with his voice and face. I could not relate to the characters at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with some type of acting.Half to three quarters of the way I was just dying to go see a campy Friday the 13th or a Scream Queenish film! At least there is some type of entertainment value. If there is no story there at least they fill it up with gory deaths or attractive females. This had nothing. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starring Lili Taylor and Hill House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting takes place in an awesome mansion (Hill House), a very rich set for a scary haunted house tale. Unfortunately, despite some pretty elaborate special effects, the movie is simply not very scary. It could ... and should ... have been much better, especially since the budget appeared to offer considerable resources to the film's creators.Although this flick is billed as starring Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones, it's Lili Taylor's character ("Eleanor") who, along with the House, are really the stars. Rent it to see Lili and the House. But don't expect to be scared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly fun and scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little apprehensive in viewing the Haunting as I'd heard several critics and friends slam it to hell and back, but upon seeing it for the first time recently I was pleasantly surprised and found that I liked it a lot. The performances are suitably great from it's leads but Lili Taylor just steals the show as innocent and vulnerable Eleanor "Nell". The screenplay plays great with her emotions and you really feel for her character as the movie progresses. Rather than remake the original as in "Psycho" 98..Director Jan De Bont has told his vision of Shirley Jacksons wonderfully creepy novel and what he delivers is really breath-taking...from the house's gaping interiors to smothering carvings, he really uses these as characters unto themselves and as the story unfolds and night falls the films atmosphere stirs up a suitably wicked air of menace. I can't recommend this movie enough...don't compare it to the original, go in from a fresh perspective and I guarantee you'll be enthralled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the Movie on DVD I realized that one of the trailers on the DVD disc contained almost the entire movie (about 90% of it).What The Haunting is, is really the trailer I mentioned above (which is a few minutes long) extended to almost 2 hours of repetitive acting. The movie itself is very slow moving and what little that happens can easily be guessed long in advance. (Facts are I could guess 100% of what little story twists existed in the movie and I had not even seen a single trailer before seeing the movie. Nothing like any of the twists in The Usual Suspects)For the hype about the special effects.. well to start with, they were few and the quality of them was nothing spectacular.. about the same as all other movies with digital post production effects released -99.My tip to you: See the trailers and skip the movie, since the movie itself was among the worst I've seen in years. (not counting B movies). If you're still stubborn about seeing the movie, another tip: Bring 5 cups of coffee and bring a jar of Caffein pills. You'll need it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading many of the negative reviews here, I was curious to rent this movie and form my own opinion. To get straight to the point, I think this film is getting a bum rap, at least from most of the reviews in this forum and, because of this, I wasn't expecting too much upon inserting the video into my machine. However, when it was all over, I was surprised. This remake held my interest from start to finish. I felt the performances were good, the storyline believable, the effects very good. After seeing the video, I would really like to see this on the big screen- I'm sure it would be even more intense. Okay, so it's no "Poltergeist" as far as scare factor, but I still think it held it's own, as far as being true to the original movie. Personally, I'd like to see a sequel. Definitely worth renting, if you're into haunted house flicks- despite all the bad press.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you hear the word "haunting", it makes you think automatically of some spooky old house with ghosts that chase you around. Well, basically, as you have seen in the previews, this is what this film is about. 3 complete strangers stay in an old house and get freaked out by some"thing".The thing is, this film is unlike any other scary movie i have seen before. It is a scary movie, but not in the usual sense of scariness. There is no guy in a black hooded costume chasing innocent young girls with a butcher knife, but instead a house come to life by things unknown. The special effects are used in this movie like no other. Instead if using goriness to freak others out, they imply violence, rather than showing it to you face to face. The CGIs are astounding. They bring the house to life for the viewer without making you feel that you are inside some elaborate computer game. Overall, this movie is the best horror movie to come out since "Screa-": well let's not give that gore-fest too much credit...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading a great deal about the film on the IMDB and in magazines, I was delighted to find my expectations for this film pretty much at rock bottom when I walked into that theatre last night. Unfortunately for me and my sister, the Fight Club was sold out, so we had to settle for the Haunting instead. The movie starts and we get a great shot of the haunted house known as Hill House. Wonderful! Beautiful sets and location saved this film from totally bombing but the effects were of no assistance. I've seen cooler looking ghosts in Casper or the Frighteners where they were supposed look cheesy. The Haunting was supposed to scare me. Guess what...it didn't. Instead of being scared I spent the whole time trying to figure out why supporting actors and actresses were vanishing from the script, if Liam Neeson was and good guy or a bad guy, and if Zeta-Jones is a lesbian. These are the only things that the film succeeded in making me think about. As such, I can basically sum up this movie in one word: boring.</fullReview>

During this first part of the movie director Jan de Bont stimulates the viewer´s fantasy. He manages to scare you mentally. Good job. However then you realize that the movie lacks a good story. The movie can´t live up your previously set imaginations. That´s why I left the theater discontent...</fullReview>

In '68 they emphasized on the psychological, because they didn't have the technology to show the ghosts. Today we have the technology but the film lost the edge and depended too much on the visual. If you could take both movies and make one out of all the good parts and throw out some the not so good parts, you would have a story that scared visually and psychologically</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read and heard a lot of unfair criticisms of this movie. That is their opinion and they are entitled to it. Granted the films script was not up to scratch and the director Jan De Bont could have lifted the movie as it had heaps of potential. Overall though this was a fantastic movie, i wouldn't say the best i have seen but it was still pretty good. Lili Taylor as Eleanor played an excellent role, Liam Neeson looked like he did not want to be there, and Catherine Zeta Jones was way better in Entrapment. The awesome part of this movie was the special effects, they were fantastic and made the movie eerie and scary. I would rate this movie 71/2 out of Ten. Lili Taylor was excellent and even though the majority disliked it. I throughly enjoyed it and would encourage people to see the movie and form their own opinions about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I very nearly didn't bother going to see The Haunting when it was released in England recently, as I had not yet read even ONE decent or praising review. Thankfully, I had a change of heart and went with my good friends, Jason &amp; Dave. ALL three of us agreed that although Robert Wise's version from the 1960s is superior, Jan De Bont's 1999 version is in a league of its own. It certainly isn't a masterpiece, but it is a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining chiller. EVERY single member of the audience leapt out of their seats during the skeleton scene!What makes The Haunting worth seeing is the outstanding performance from the excellent Lili Taylor as Eleanor "Nell" Vance, the most sensitive and vulnerable member of the group. It was a tough role and, considering Nell is in practically every scene (often alone, to boot), Taylor did a first rate job. Personally, I think she deserves a Best Actress Oscar nomination, but as the film was so badly received, she'll probably get an undeserved Razzie nomination instead.If you can forgive the final few minutes, which are admittedly weak, I think you'll enjoy The Haunting. Hell, it's worth seeing for that screamingly funny/creepy woman as Mrs Dudley - "I don't stay at night. Not when it begins to get dark"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting is quite an unusual movie to review. So many people have dismissed it, feeling it is just another one of those movies that has been run through the remake machine. Luckily I took a completely different view. After reading so many reviews that described The Haunting as what I wrote above, I went to the cinema feeling a little apprehensive, and not at all expecting what I received. The Haunting starts judderingly bad, with a stumbling script that sounds ridiculous, and characters that you are almost certain you will dislike. But, slowly, and as the eeriness and tension mounts, The Haunting turns into quite a respectable movie. Gradually you begin to like the characters, particularly Theo (the fun-loving bisexual) and Nell (a shy, protective woman) who become quite close almost from the start. The first "scare" scene was excellently worked, in which Nell is awoken by a thundering booming at her door, and is chased through into Theo's room where she slams the doors and the temperature suddenly plummets as something colossal starts to charge at the doors. The sound effects in this movie are mastered brilliantly, the music including echoing whispers which send chills down the spine, and jarring, blaring notes when something dramatic occurs. It seems that The Haunting is more of a new interpretation of the original The House on Haunted Hill novel than a remake of the first movie. Jan de Bont obviously wanted to bring a classic movie back to life in the '90's, knowing what would appeal to the audiences of the 21st century. The special effects are absolutely stunning. Mind-blowing would be the word that best describes them, and though some critics have stated that they spoil the effect this picture creates, I rather think that the movie benefited greatly from them. Mainly because a couple of the effects give rise to quite a few "jump" moments. Overall this is a movie created simply to entertain, and though it's not exactly a "scary" movie, it's definitely one of the eeriest things ever put on film (mainly because of the beautiful carvings inside the house). I would recommend it greatly, though older viewers who caught the original way back in those days most probably will hate it.Rating **** 4 / 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that The Haunting was one of the best films I've seen in a long while. I know all the other reviews around say it isn't scary and there's no characters or plot, but I personally found that the characters had substance, there is a pretty deep plot (though they could have made more of the sub-plot between Nell and Theo), and it DID scare me. I have the childrens' voices in my head still. I went to see it at a late night showing (midnight), which I guess probably helped somewhat in making it really scary. Amazing special effects too. I liked the idea of using the curtains as a way to see the childrens' ghosts. And Lili Taylor was brilliant in it. I did think that it shouldn't be a 12 though. Okay, so there's no swearing or gory violence, but all the scary things - rooms changing shape, statues and pictures coming to life - are things that will really scare younger children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting started off wonderfully. With each bang on a door or sudden movement, I was definitely startled, if not full-blown scared at times.But then, as some movies do, the last half was disheartening. Without giving away the ending for those who haven't seen it, let's just say Hollywood struck again, leaving a ghostly and terrifying tale flopping around with no plot to stand on. I was nearly cheering when a certain fate befell one of the characters (Luke) and had to close my eyes in embarrassment at Nell's final triumph.Do yourself a favor and read the book (The Haunting of Hill House, by Shirley Jackson) It may not be the thundering, twisting freakshow that was the movie, but I guarantee a more psychological scare... and isn't that the more frightening?</fullReview>

My computer speakers work better than most of our theater speakers. Anyhow, the first time I saw it in SS and I was so scared at the end, i was shaking. Not like "BOOO!" "OMG!" scared, mentally scared. I love this movie, and mainly b/c of two things, it isnt gory and bloody yet a mind twister (for those who are intelligent enough to see this), and Mr Neeson is OH LA LA sexy! I dont care if he IS 47. He has got it going on, his smile is just too gorgeous. Okay, back to the movie though, It isnt all about BOO! scares...mainly a mind torture chamber. For those who want blood and gore, I dont recommend, but if u like mind thinkers...see this one. The ending may be a bit strange, but all is good. The effects are killer awesome, and the acting is major perfect. Kinda has a bit of everyone in it. but there is one thing id like to know...What was the deal with the car when they were trying to run the gate down?? The gas leak, sparks, and all(if uve seen it, you'll know what i mean)...and at the end, if u noticed..there was a big enough hole to escape...kinda confusing, but over-all it was a major mind bender.</fullReview>

With bloodbaths like Carrie, The Excorsist, and more, I think its gratifying that Jan De Bont made a horror film that almost everyone can see.Bad points include that the movie has an incessant banging throughout the entire film, and, some of the scares are really destroyed by shots of fat statues of children with terrified looks on there faces.A real SFX explosion, recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jan de Bont strikes out again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought de Bont reached his nadir with "Speed 2," but lightning can strike twice. This movie is horrible. Obviously tinkered with in post-production. A waste of good actors. Yes, put Lili Taylor in the lead of a mainstream movie, but NOT this one. The sloppiest handling of a lesbian subtext ever in cinema. The choppiest editing since Lizzie Borden. Not scary at all. Laughable dialogue.But you know what? The sets were gorgeous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Lili Taylor's movie, not Catherine Zeta-Jones' or Liam Nieson's. They're guest stars in comparison and are used for name recognition only. A truly mediocre film. Not scary at all, but not completely boring either. Special effects and "Theo's" clothes are the best parts of this movie (superficial, but true).</fullReview>

In any case, the movie's one incredibly strong point was the mansion that it was filmed in. It contains some of the most ungodly amazing architecture I have ever seen.

		<shortDescription>Well, at least the effects are "special"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing quite like a good scare in a film. And that is exactly what you get from The Haunting, for about a split second. In fact, the only thing impressive about this film is the house itself. Somebody must have spent a good long time making it move like that, and for that I am grateful, because nothing else in the "movie" moved at all. I'll make this short and sweet: If you are a fan of special effects, or just really cool looking houses, this is a movie for you. Otherwise, you're wasting your time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealized potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is surprising how many of the characters in the film come across as superfluous. I mean, really, the whole tale seems like it could be carried by Eleanor Vance vs. the spirit world, if only they could come up with a more convincing way of getting her into the house.The character of Theo is a prime example. Catherine Zeta-Jones is gorgeous and provocative, but one can't help feeling that her sole function for being in the film is to look pretty and say outrageous things in a desperate attempt to shoehorn sex appeal into a plot that has no real room for it. In fact, the only part of her that is not shown off to good advantage is her acting skill, making it painfully obvious that her role is primarily decorative. But the sad part is... that alone makes her far more useful than most of the rest of the cast.Her scene, for example, with Liam Neeson, as Theo chastises the good Dr Marrow for his tarnished ethics and poor judgement in having put them all in this situation in the first place lacks the passion one would expect from someone who's got so much right to be angry at being made a lab rat, yet, it's just as well, as Neeson himself seems half asleep while she rants, and strikes me throughout the film as never really understanding his role.And as for Luke (Owen Wilson) --- oh, my. Has there ever been a character so utterly pointless for anything but getting himself killed by angry spirits? And the way the whole thing is put together and acted out leaves us unable to believe the whole death scene ever happened in the first place. I mean, what was that emotion supposed to be, anyway? Panic? Or just utter stupidity? If possible, this character and his portrayal are even more disfunctional than any of the others.I agree with other comments I've read, that Lili Taylor manages to pull off her role [Eleanor] with some degree of dignity, but even she has a hard time portraying the sense of encroaching madness one would expect under such stresses, though her role was the best one the film had to offer, and she does manage it with some degree of grace and skill.The technical effects in the film were very nice. I'm a fan of such things in general, although I was disappointed that easily four fifths of the best fx were already seen in the local TV ads, they were, in general, nicely supplemental to the incredible atmosphere created simply by the sets themselves. A house so elaborately designed as Hillhouse is portrayed would, in and of itself be an awesome effect, even without the techno trickery brought on by the plot. Regrettably, between the house and the special effects, I found myself leaving the theater wondering why the humans in this film got so much screen time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be retitled: The Scooby Doo gang and the Haunted House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting has been an all time favorite of mine. So, naturally I was excited and enthused to see that a new version was coming out this summer, but much to my surprise it was a big let down. I admit the special effects in some scenes were absolutely mind boggling but it was a big let down. Now I mean why are these movies called "Horror" movies? Because they are supposed to scare us....If you wanna be scared by a good old fashioned haunted house movie see the original. Even with a cast like the new (Liam Neeson, Lilly Taylor, Kathrine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson) it's not really worth your six bucks unless you want to laugh. In that case you'll enjoy Owen Wilson's performance. (He has the best one liners! Especially the Teletubbies...If you've seen it you know what I mean. And his strange choice of clothing.) All in all I guess It just comes down to taste. So go see it and decide for yourself: Chilling or just plain cold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad...if u don't compare it to the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't compare it to the original classic, the remake is pretty good. One of the more interesting things was that they created a different "history" of the house, which is revealed, slowly, as the movie progresses. It adds a "diffent dimension" (and, an interesting one, at that) to the film.But, the character's acting is EXTRMELY wooden, and Hill House is impossibly over-ornate (they would've needed over 100 servants to clean it all! They went "overboard" on this!). And, of course, the special effects are top-notch!!!!!Again, if you forget about the '60's classic, and judge this film by it's OWN merits, it's pretty good! (Look at the remake of "Psycho" -- they copied every frame, and everyone said,"Why bother remaking it?"). But, 1999's "Haunting" is NOT a remake -- they take the original story line and, in myopinion, make it BETTER!Norm</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low on horror but great summer fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Haunting the night it opened and I loved it. Let me say that I'm a horror fan in general, and I prefer a good ghost story to a hack and slash movie anyday. Still the Haunting had very few scary scenes. It is not in league with "The Shining" or even "Burnt Offerings". That aside The Haunting had an interesting story, great music/sound, good FX, and the coolest mansion even filmed. Indeed the house is the star of the film (as it should be). For haunted house fans it's worth the price of admission alone.The movie has some faults, but most are minor. A lot of reviewers note the cheesy dialog, but the truth is that there are only about 2 or 3 bad lines in the whole picture ("home is where the heart is" &amp; "it's about family" being the worst). Not enough to ruin it by any means. The acting is top rate. Lili Taylor (as Eleanor) is fantastic, but Catherine Zeta Jones seems to steal every scene she's in (doesn't she always). Liam Neeson is somewhat wasted as the doctor conducting a study on the other three.A major complaint I hear a lot is that only Lili Taylor's character is really developed. True, but so what. Do you really need to know everything about a character in a movie. The Haunting is about the house and it's relationship to Eleanor. The other characters only serve to define her. For example: Catherine Zeta Jone's overtly sexual Theo serves to contrast with Lili Taylor's Eleanor to show us a woman lacking self esteem and confidence. It is Eleanor who the story revolves around, and Lili Taylor does an excellent job of bringing her to life.It's also nice to see a horror movie that uses style and mood over gore &amp; blood (of which there is very little). Those expecting to be scared out of their skin with the Haunting will be disappointed. Those wanting a good summer movie with a big budget, big stars, and lots of special Fx set in a very cool haunted house, will find The Haunting very satisfing. 9 stars (out of 10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast, sets, and effects add up to Summer popcorn fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lavish sets, playful effects, another great Jerry Goldsmith score, and a delightful main cast made this Fun-House Thrill-Ride my favorite "Summer Movie" in many years. While it doesn't achieve the "Great Movie" status for richness of story and characters, like say Good Will Hunting or As Good As It Gets, it's not supposed to! This is Summer, time to chuck reality and have some fun at the theater! This is a theater-experience movie, with sound that rumbles your seat, and eye candy to fill every inch of the big screen. It's what makes you want to go over and over again because it won't be the same when it comes to video. I've heard so many poor reviews of this movie and some people say it's not scary, but they are all missing the point: it may not be scary, but it's thrilling and fun; good old fashioned popcorn fun. I also like the liberties they took with the original story, which gives it a life of it's own. It's a good balance of having enough the same and enough different to keep it fresh and exciting. So, in my book, it gets top honors for a Summer Thrill Ride. [9 out of 10] [****] [A]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Movies Are Made Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A laughable exercise in gaudy CGI effects and bad dialogue (ex. a staircase comes to life and starts moving...a character says "...the staircase is moving!!!").Jan de Bont seems absolutely clueless as to how to reach an audience's subconscious---all the elements from the original story are there to send chills up an audience's collective spine, but he seems to think that it's enough to throw expensive, massive effects on an audience to get a reaction (this was the same problem with "The Mummy"). Special effects don't mean a darn thing if there's no soul behind the story and the characters aren't developed. A film like "The Exorcist" reaches an audience not because of the effects or gore---they are merely adjuncts to what is a very involving, dimensional drama and "The Haunting" has the potential to be a subtle, effective fright flick as well as a moving story about loneliness and fear of isolation.This is an utter failure. Despite some good and interesting actors and some baroque sets, no one's given anything interesting to say or do except gather at the spook house and stare up at the "horrors" going on the blue screen. The whole thing feels artificial because de Bont hasn't created a horror film so much as a theme park ride, and a rather dull and poorly thought out one at that. It's even more depressing that audiences are buying into this fakery and shallow nonsense because it only encourages talentless nitwits like Jan de Bont and Joel Schumacher to inflict more of their junk onto the multiplexes of America.</fullReview>

I figured if Darkman chose to perform in this movie, it must have had substance. Unfortunately it didn't deliver on either accounts. Sure, the effects were cool, but the movie had nothing else going for it. It was 5 underdeveloped characters thrown into a premise that didn't make much sense, and the sense that it did make made the audience say to themselves "ugh". Nothing interesting comes out of this movie, unfortunately. For a movie with very similar special affects and a much more entertaining plot, go see the Mummy. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

Okay, the face-in-the-sheet trick definitely gets old, and the story leaves something to be desired, but the effects are great, as anyone who has seen the previews knows. The acting is terrific most of the time, especially Catherine Zeta Jones and Lili Taylor (who looks eerily like Jamie Lee Curtis did in the original Halloween).

Catherine Zeta-Jones was a cool character, but the audience never got to know more of her character. Liam Neeson is well, Liam Neeson, in every movie he was in he did a good job acting, and it doesn't stop here. Lili Taylor was so so as Eleanor, and some of her scenes with the ghosts make your hair stand up, they literally give you the chills. Some of her lines were pretty bad though and even though you weren't supposed to laugh, you do anyway. The special effects were terrific, statues move, dead children talk, faces emerge behind curtains, etc. All in all, this was a very good film. Go and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would have been so easy for the makers of this "Haunting" remake to actually leave viewers with the same sense of foreboding dread we all got from the original. More of a sequel than a remake or retelling, the film is horribly miscast (with the exception of lead Lili Taylor, who doesn't even get star billing), flatly acted, and only marginally scary. The religious overtones in the new, happy ending are so ham-fisted and glopped on that it ruined the entire experience for me. EFX and locations were completely excellent, but the original 1963 version is one of the most terrifying films ever made, and this one is hardly a blip on the radar screen of summer '99 movies.</fullReview>

Lili Taylor turns in a solid performance, considering the script this is quite the feat! Liam Neeson proves once again that Schindler's List was a fluke, as he still can't act. Catherine Zeta Jones is lovely window dressing, but serves absolutely no other purpose in this film. Visually , the house itself steals the show. Too bad, that in this version, the house itself isn't evil, but merely houses the vicious spirit of a child killer. Go rent the 1963 version instead, and find out about horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three-dimensional effects don't make up for one-dimensional acting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the sneak preview for this movie, and I'd like to tell you to wait for the video, but since most of The Haunting's virtues (if any) are in it's special effects, it's probably best to see it on the big screen, if at all. This movie was NOT SCARY...in fact, people were laughing throughout it. The acting was bland, and the characters flat. The dialogue was utter cheese, and the story full of holes. The only plus to this movie was the set design of the house itself, which was magnificent. In short, go see this movie expecting to laugh at the corniness of it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mess of special effects and set design that works to a point in a very sloppy way but ultimately backfires with a terrible ending. Wasted cast, no script, no story. Typical summer crap. After this, Twister, and Speed 2 Jan De Bont needs to be sent away. He is quite possibly the worst director working today on the Hollywood A-list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting is pretty good as far as remakes go, however that is mainly because of the special effects. They were incredible. The story was decent and I also feel it was a scary movie, right up to the ending. The movie builds up this sense of horror inside this evil house, and then ends with a silly sequence that supposedly ties everything together. Liam is his normal Schindler-Qui-Gon self and Catherine just spends a lot of time looking hot. I'd give the movie a B- and Catherine Zeta-Jones an A+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting How Much Better the Original Is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting (1999): Dir: Jan De Bont / Cast: Lili Taylor, Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson, Bruce Dern: Remake of the Robert Wise classic about past incidents that stir horrid images. A group of individuals suffer from insomnia and are summoned to an isolated mansion for treatment. This mansion has a past as the heroine can hear the echoes and cries of children. The film contains an eerie soundtrack and startling images. Special effects are breathtaking with an ominous presence about to give the mansion its haunting appeal. Unfortunately the screenplay presents a formula story with a climax that becomes ridiculous. Director Jan De Bont allows it to get away on him. It is as if he was given all of the budget and he could not figure out what was needed. He made Speed, which is his one worthy film but this film is a tad better than his embarrassing Twister and Speed 2: Cruise Control. Of the ensemble cast Taylor seems interesting as she struggles to figure out the bizarre around her. She comes from a broken home only to learn that she has connections here that elevate to a laughable outcome. Liam Neeson passes as the doctor while Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Owen Wilson wander about as if bored. Bruce Dern plays the gate keeper who is suppose to look sinister and more or less over the top. Special effects are the one saver otherwise it is hauntingly bad. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loose the CGI!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What made the original so haunting and unsettling is its atmosphere, and its psychological effect on the main protagonist. This film, however, takes the whole psychological and atmospheric concept and replaces it with crappy CGI and a horribly written story. Since this was during the time when CGI was being exploited, I see what they were trying to do with this. However, its tacky that they should rely on new technological features on a remake of a film that was purely affective for its subtly. In terms of writing quality, if your expecting a film that dives into questioning the parallels between the paranormal and the human psyche like the original, be prepared to be disappointed. There is no mystery behind anything- this purely a light vs. dark movie. It's not smartly written what-so-ever. This being said, I surprisingly do have a couple of pros. (1) the mansion is unbelievably and gothically beautiful, and even more than the one from the first movie. The house they used is called Harlaxton Manor, which is owned by the University of Evansille for students studying abroad. It is the PERFECT setting for a Gothic horror movie. (2) casting is actually decent (minus Owen Wilson. Sorry bud, not your movie). Lily Taylor is actually a pretty good replacement, bringing a gentleness and gravity to the role. These two pros are what really makes me sad. With such an incredible setting and actors who can actually act (once again excluding Owen Wilson), and if they had just lost the CGi and stuck to the psychological story- this could have been a decent movie. Really disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original version of 'The Haunting' is famous for its power of suggestion in place of special effects, for scaring you without showing you much. Well, the direction in that movie was so demented, and the acting so hammy, and the score so over-the-top that it all became pretty laughable. You might not see a ghost, but the tone was so delirious that the so-called 'suggestion' was far from from subtle. Thirty-six years later we have the remake, which rockets past subtle in the first five minutes and keeps on going.Liam Neeson is David Morrow, a doctor conducting research into the mechanics of fear, who invites a bunch of people ? Nell (Lilli Taylor), Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson) ? to a creepy old mansion on the pretext of researching insomnia when he really wants to scare the crap out of them and see what happens. Needless to say, the house has a dark history and pretty soon the haunting becomes all too real for our cardboard friends, and Nell in particular, who tries to find out what's going on. The basic idea behind what's causing all the goings-on is a good one, but there's so much stuff piled on top of it it's impossible to care. This is a movie that's been constructed, not created, and it turns out to be a soulless machine that doesn't let you think for yourself.For a start, I lose patience with any movie that feels the need to have the characters supply a running commentary on what's happening, and 'The Haunting' can't hint at it or let you figure it out. There's a bit where Nell's name is scrawled in blood in foot-high letters on a wall, and she helpfully says, 'That's my name.' Another scene has her discovering a book containing the names of various dead children, and she proceeds to read out all their ages, even though there are shots of the text as she does so. This kind of thing plagued Jan De Bont's previous movie, 'Speed 2', with characters helpfully yelling things like, 'The boat's tipping over!' when the boat was tipping over. Using this device is fine if done do it sparingly, but here it's relentless.The movie is also so obsessed with its bullying soundscape that it forgets to include any build-up or atmosphere. As soon as everyone enters the house, the soundtrack cranks up to maximum eardrum penetration and is weighed down with moans, groans and various other continual distractions that are presumably meant to supply a feeling of foreboding but instead become so overused that it's wearisome. There's a scene where Nell and Theo become trapped in a room, and the air gets cold, and then the doors start banging like someone's breaking in, and they're screaming, and the sound effects are booming away. Later, they decide it was all down to noisy pipes. Stuff like this just makes the characters look stupid and the audience feel insulted.The visual effects are fine, but overbearing. There's a really lovely moment when the outline of a child billows through a curtain, but then the shape continues up the bed and onto Nell's pillow, where the kid talks to her (watch her reaction to this ? there isn't one), and it spoils the effect. There's a great bit in the trailer where a statue reaches out its arms, but in the context of the movie it just becomes one more effect in an unending barrage. There's another nice bit, when wooden carvings of children's faces change expressions. Unfortunately, little creepy bits like that are offset by bombastic stuff like when the ceiling becomes a face, and starts to fall inwards, and pins Nell to the bed, with plenty of noise. Strangely enough, the others hear her screaming but not the room taking on another form. At first I thought that was because it was all in her head, but then it turns out to have happened in reality and makes the whole scene seem ridiculous.The acting and direction leave a lot to be desired. Taylor's good, but otherwise you could almost forget there were any other actors in the movie. De Bont's direction of the actors is hopeless. When Neeson is confronted with a huge ghostly face staring at him from the caved-in ceiling, he looks vaguely bothered rather than scared out his wits as he should be. Most of the time the reactions come across as though De Bont forgot to tell everyone the effects would be put in later. Neeson gets nearly all the rubbish stuff in this movie; he barely does anything sensible at all. Zeta-Jones' first few lines basically amount to, 'Hi, I'm bisexual, bit of a tease, wink wink,' which is clumsy and fails to lead anywhere. Wilson's character serves no particular purpose, and Bruce Dern has next to nothing to do in a brief role as the house's caretaker.The house is the one thing this movie really has going for it. It's a beautiful creation, and production designer Eugenio Zanetti has done a great job. There's imagination and detail all over the place, and it's the only thing that holds your attention while everything else blares around you. While statues are trying to drown people, and staircases are falling apart, and doors are growing hands, and skeletons are leaping out at people, and the sound is bellowing with all the scares of a cheese sandwich, your time's better spent taking in the gorgeous, eerie design work of the house, and wishing a better movie took place in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely psychologically boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So pleased to see this has got the lowest collective score I've come across on IMDb! When I saw this in the TV schedule, a 1999-made horror which I - a horror enthusiast - had never heard of and starring some big names, I thought it had to be worth a try. I'm all for 'psychological horror' - which is what this smugly claims to be - and atmosphere in lieu of visual horror, but this fails to deliver in every way.The 'tension-devices' are clichéd and hammy, from creaking doors and continual little anti-climaxes such as coming upon people by surprise. The slightly grotesque and creepy gatekeeper, Bruce Dern (his very casting here a cliché, and could barely be called a cameo) is supposedly meant to create menace. Ditto the weird female housekeeper and the little introductory talk she gives to each arriving guest. They do not. By this point, it's plainly obvious the movie is crushingly bland, self-indulgent and uninspired anyway.You can feel this aura right away at the prologue, where Liam Neeson is being debated by his boss on the ethics of his 'sleep/fear project'. It is presented with no tone of intrigue or drama whatsoever, and just a smattering of cod-intellectualism. Then we are introduced to one very big haunted (we presume) house through the eyes of the first guest arriving. This is where the clichés come thick and fast, as things plod along at the very pace she is walking through the house.The building itself does not convince, an utterly fantastical and fake construct inside and out. Liam Neeson's dour acting style can be great in some roles, but given the wrong script or casting he can be blandness personified - as here. The end result is his persona simply reflects instead of carrying the entire movie (as he manages to do in Taken). By the time all the 'fear' comes, it does not convince. As the plot is gradually revealed, it does not convince. The horror effects, excellent though some of them are, are laid on so thick and fast that - you've guessed it - they do not convince. Every so-called fright becomes - I fear - a total yawn.Catherine Zeta Jones is good to look at - 1 point.There are some original supernatural effects - 2 points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While being a Horror freak, I'm still only 27 years of age, so I guess I wasn't here for many of what others might call "classics". I wasn't even aware this movie was a remake before checking IMDb. Now that I've finished watching it, I remember that I saw it around 13 years ago with some friends in Junior High. I also recall not losing sleep over it even at 14.From an older and more experienced point of you - this movie isn't scarier than the witched in Disney's older animated pictures. The story might have been original before too many films used the same idea of a bunch of strangers arriving on an old haunted manor for this reason or another.Lili Taylor (main protagonist Nell) might be many things, but she's no actress. Her acting was so amateur and childish, it was like seeing a 5 year old playing pretend... the rest of the all-star set was luckily better. Catherine Zeta-Jones was exciting and sexy as city-girl Theo, Owen Wilson was as funny and charismatic as always, and Liam Neeson was a perfect choice for the role of Dr. Marrow.The children's "ghosts' were a nice touch, but the main ghost was quite a let-down. Nothing scary in this one... I'd say this film would be good for children who're about to become teenagers and would like to ease their way into the horror genre. However, for us adult audience - this film was nothing more than a waste of time.</fullReview>

Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones are great actors, and they deserve to be in much better movies than this. We've even seen Owen Wilson do better!Other than that, it just didn't do anything for me. The story, the CGI effects, and the attempts to build suspense just fall flat.

		<fullReview>For the exception of Lily Tyler's admirable performance and some fantastic set decoration/art direction for the Hill House, this stinker of a remake should've forewarned others of attempts to revamp a classic horror film that didn't need such treatment. The rich dialogue and characterizations are gone, and in their place is the absolute dependency on CGI and a laughable developing plot that takes a giant dump on Jackson's classic story and Wise's superior companion film. I think the film just gets worse and worse as the house "comes alive", Hugh Crain's monstrous ghoul, in computer generated form(not to mention the awful children ghosts moving through curtains and bed sheets), wanting to stop Tyler from releasing "his children" from their eternal prison.Lily Tyler is the center of the movie, her sleuthing and the ghost children who depend on her to save them from the house's purgatory are of crucial focus, while the other cast members are just wasted in roles as characters who respond by considering her delusional, or constantly worried for her mental welfare..until they find that the owner of Hill House, Hugh Crain, still resides, as a benevolent spirit, in the vast mansion and estate, spending the remainder of the movie trying to find a method of escape. When the parts are right, actors like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, and Owen Wilson are at always worth watching, but in Jan de Bont's The Haunting they are given little to work with.Zeta Jones' bi-sexual sexpot is eye candy, but pales in comparison to the pitch-perfect performance of Claire Bloom's intellectual lesbian. Jones doesn't tease Tyler's character as Bloom did in the original, knowing how to toy with her easy prey, doing so lovingly, perhaps ill-advised considering the worsening state of Nell(..portrayed in the original by the incomparable Julie Harris).I think Tyler does well in the film, though, showing a woman damaged psychologically by the past, but her Nell(..nor the screenplay) doesn't dwell on the trauma caused by an ill, uncaring mother in the past. This remake focuses distinctly on the loopy plot of the children(..and a second wife murdered by Crain)communicating with Nell, and Crain trying to stop her from saving them, with the other characters running around or questioning how nuts she might be. Neeson's Dr. Marrow may be given star treatment, but he barely factors at all, and certainly his value is inferior to that of Richard Johnson from Wise's film. Marrow essentially is evaluating sleep-deprived insomniacs and their reactions to hysteria and fear, how such emotions derive from a house with a diabolical history. Wilson is the cynic who finds Nell to be whacked out and Marrow a creep, eyeing(reasonably so)the delicious Theo(Jones). The bloated f/x climax leaves much to be desired. A real bottom-of-the-barrel Hollywood bomb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie that does not start well and gets worse the longer it goes on (and it does go on). The basic premise of Liam Neeson's character Doctor Marrow conducting a study into fear by inviting people to a so called "haunted house" under the misinformation of it being a study into people who suffer from insomnia is interesting enough. This could of lead to some good psychological scares. However when the house itself does turn out to be haunted we really do gets by numbers horror where I found it incredibly difficult to find any empathy for any of the characters and also struggled to maintain interest in the film. Even the normally likable Owen Wilson was poor here. Certainly one to avoid abd not one for re-watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess the remake of 'Psycho' opened a door because since then we've had remake upon remake, upon remake. The 1963 version of 'The Haunting' is an eerie haunted house flick from a time when special effects weren't needed to scare audiences. Not that I'm knocking effects, quite the opposite, but if it worked in the original then why change it for the remake? OK so try something different, but I would think the possibilities would be greater than that. Does that make this film awful? Not really, but it's not much more than OK rainy afternoon entertainment.Pros: A good cast that gives it's all. Moves at a decent pace. The exterior and interior architecture of the house are simply exquisite. Some good jump scares. This time we're given more back story on the house and owner and it's quite sinister. Some of the computer graphics are really impressive. Another solid score from Jerry Goldsmith.Cons: The makers of the film seem more interested in spectacle instead of depth, strong character development, etc., which cripples the suspense. Some of the computer graphics, for example a door that turns into a hand, are very unconvincing. Not even slightly scary. An ending that feels like it's been done a thousand times.Final thoughts: This remake of the 1963 classic and second adaptation of Shirley Jackson's novel is proof that less is more. Whereas the original was more suggestive and you don't see what "it" is, this film we're shown the force in the house. I know I'm making it sound like I don't like this movie at all, which is not so. It's entertaining, visually appealing, and has a good cast.My rating: 3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tried to take it far but didn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie wasn't necessarily scary, but it was mysterious and freaky, I'll give it that. The set designs were great; they really gave the spooky haunted house feeling. The artistry of the multiple statues in the house was good, too. The cinematography was OK; the lighting kind of weakened it. And the acting was good. They weren't the best, but, fairly talented.However, it was disappointing. The script was, I guess, OK, but the rest - the story, the children's tale, the drama - were all things to frown at. A few of the actions there were really unnecessary, some of the elements of the house that "welcomed" protagonist Eleanor (Lili Taylor), I could see was sort of copied from Rosemary's Baby, as I said - were unnecessary. I think they were put there to make intense moments in the film or "take it far," But as my title suggests, they just couldn't.Let me state some examples (if some of these were in the book, I can understand why they were there. If not, then I cannot). Near the end, an enraged Luke (Owen Wilson) suddenly went mad, tearing away at Hugh Crane's portrait with a candlestick and then raving away that they should burn the house down, thus angering the spirit of Hugh Crane. This gets him killed. First of all, I don't think they should have gotten him killed. Luke was just a "fellow insomniac," as he likes to quote so much, with opinions and reputations no worse nor better than any of the other characters in there. He had no reason to die. It wasn't going to alter the film so much, nor was it going to teach anything, and it wasn't going to make it better or more intense. In fact, it just made it worse. I was thinking, "whoa, why'd he just do that?" Even so, if he really had to die, then he could've done it in a better way, instead of that random, suddenly-going-mad drama (that was very unlike him) that he broke into. The part where the carpet drags him to the fireplace and he is smashed (or gorged) by that chimney opening thing was scary, but honestly, if the film went like it was supposed too, it wouldn't have to have been there.And especially so, what was the conflict between Hugh Crane and Nell? At one point she says that he wants her, then later it's revealed that she is one of his great-great granddaughters, indicating the obvious fact that Crane won't let her go like he didn't let his other "children" go. But sooner or later (or the middle of that), Nell sees herself pregnant in the spinning room illusions. Now what? He wants incest with her too? Even if that pregnant thing has got nothing to do with Hugh Crane or her, it's too random. Why'd they put it in there? And if it's not random, that some of the hidden facts in there set if off, then I demand an explanation telling exactly why.Overall, I would have enjoyed this film if it didn't have such excess intensity. Anybody else would have. I wish I'd seen the original film based on the book (which I haven't read yet). It sure would be nice to watch as a light fantasy-suspense entertainment, but don't expect too much out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Put Casper In While You're At It (Sigh)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie about the haunted house (hoping it would be like others, much older, that I've seen), especially after seeing the special about it on the TV, made prior to its release.However, this movie did not work at all for me for the following reasons:1. Hard to believe at first, but it had too much of a "Casper" feel. I think this is because the children's "ghosts" are so amazingly unconvincing and fake-looking, that it is hard to believe they would even release it like this. The children are all generic-looking and doll-like, as if the people who made this never saw a real child. (Could they not get any child actors?) It also reminds me so much of the CGI trickery in the Casper movie, but unlike Casper, this is supposed to be realistic looking, yes?2. I did not at all like the character of Dr. David Marrow, especially in thinking anyone who acts a certain way is having some sort of "episode" and is in a state of delusion as if he "knows" everything. Why do some "professional" people assume they have any more understanding than anyone else (relative to actual experience, not just going to school)? This does happen in real life, but far more in movies, it would seem, I guess to purposely make you hate the character?3. I may be wrong in this, but how many absolutely identical paintings (one in the kitchen?), one on the wall in the stairwell, and at least one more? - were there of Crain? This is not in the lists of "goofs" as far as I can tell, but seems very obvious, more than other listed goofs. Why would you have copies of the same very large painting in different areas? This was very annoying for me and damaged any potential realism. Dorian Gray, he is not.4. I know the house is always "changing", but how can it be so different on the outside than the inside?5. Finally, Mrs. Dudley's "in the dark" speeches made me laugh, which I do not think was intended, and the "I can see my breath" scene was also a bit silly.I will say that the carved cherubic faces of the children "coming to life" and also making outlines in curtains and sheets was very creepy (perhaps the most interesting facet of the whole movie, in concept - having the feel of an old DC comic), but the more obvious CGI ghost children, as well as their unchildlike voices (with regard of what their spirits must have went through, especially), completely ruined these connecting elements.I also feel this movie would have been more entertaining if they had not shown Crain at all in his "human" form. And the ending made no sense to me at all. I didn't at all understand the supposed explanation of Eleanor's history, nor why she had to die when I thought the ghosts were "protecting" her. This, as well, was extremely annoying.I will give this movie a 4/10. Not so bad as to deserve a 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the original The Haunting for the first time in a quarter of a century and it is a masterful piece of horror. From the technologically necessary reliance on sound, camera lenses, and dead-on performances to the depth of the psychological drama, Robert Wise's version of Shirley Jackson's novel is vastly superior to Jan De Bont's over-heated and almost-pointless remake.The only saving grace to this misfire of a movie is Lili Taylor. It's the first time I've seen her on screen. She almost reinvents Julie Harris' Nell, making her stronger, less of a shell of a person, and easily more compassionate (to the suffering of the children of Hill House).Taylor is not a classically beautiful woman. She has a quirky face and voice, but she elicits real concern and affection from the audience with her oddball performance. By the end of the movie, the viewer is appreciating her beauty and her decency. Probably the only false note in her performance is the weird, honking screams she utters (and yet, even her screams are out of sync with what you expect from an endangered horror movie heroine).Taylor stands out in a dull cast of popular professionals--Liam Neeson is wasted here, and looks mildly embarrassed, Owen Wilson is a ridiculously bad actor who apparently knows how to hit his marks and has some sort of flair for comedy, but he drawls and squeaks his annoying lines to the detriment of the story, and Catherine Zeta-Jones is voluptuous and luscious and is a complete nothing here. When stacked (quit giggling!) up against the much more elegant Claire Bloom from the original, she becomes even more of a piece of flavorless eye candy. Jones prances about in one bizarre costume after another and the few hints she gives that she's bisexual and interested in Nell are so pointless and watered down that the edginess of that subplot in the original seems to be even more uneasy and profound than before.Yet, I found the movie mildly entertaining. Some of the special effects were genuinely creepy (the carvings of the children and their movements and emotions were a knockout). Just seeing Bruce Dern is enough to put a sentimental smile on my face. And how about Nell's AMC Gremlin? Wow, what a blast from the past! Speaking of blasts from the past, stick with the original The Haunting and accept that the remake is almost a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Giving this 3 out of 10 is being generous. Let me say first that this is probably what happened after shooting was finished and all the King's Horses and all the King's Men were trying to figure out how to put this movie together. Producer 1: "Let me see...the underlying theme in this movie is..." Producer 2: "Family! It's about Eleanor being the bad guy's third wife...or fourth, and she's pregnant...but not really and wants to save the kids."Producer 1: "The kids that died about 150 years ago right? Producer 2: "Yeah, the ones he used in a sweat shop...or was obsessed about...or something like that."Producer 1: "So he trapped their souls...and his...in the house...because why?" Producer 2: "No no no, they're stuck in purgatory b/c he's bad and can't go to hell right away unless Eleanor sends him there by yelling at him a lot."Producer 1: "You really think people will watch this? I mean OWEN Wilson is in it for God's sake!" Producer 2: "What if we re-shoot Zeta-Jones in some sexy thigh high boots?"Producer 1: "Sure, that'll do it for me."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky Haunted House film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Haunting" is a far better film than what most would believe.**SPOILERS**After her mother's death, Eleanor (Lili Taylor) is desperate to get over her feelings of despair. Research Scientist Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson) is searching for subjects to participate in a study on sleep disorder, and Eleanor is a perfect candidate. Accepted, she travels to Hill House, the site of an infamous massacre years ago, and meets up with the other subjects of the experiment Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson). After the usual introductions are done, Dr. Marrow briefs everyone about what they are doing and the purpose of the experiment. After an accident nearly ruins the experiment, Dr. Marrow decides to carry on. That night, strange banging noises haunt Eleanor and Theo as they try to sleep. The next day, she begins to see and experience strange events in the house. Trying to convince Theo and Luke that Dr. Marrow isn't interested in sleep deprivation doesn't work, but it brings Eleanor close to a secret that even Dr. Marrow didn't know about and that could bring the house down around them.The Good News: OHMYGOD! This has one of the creepiest houses ever in a horror film I've ever seen. It has the perfect blend of Gothic atmosphere and modern touches. It has an overall feeling of dread and suspense. With it's long, winding corridors, creature-busts for decorations, and artwork that is just as creepy as spending an eternity in hell itself, this house is just as creepy as the original. It is big and cavernous, and yet confining. These two ingredients are essential in creating the perfect haunted house movie, and the third ingredient is one of my favorite rules for haunted house is the "things that shouldn't be doing that/that shouldn't be there" philosophy. I love when haunted house films do that. If it's done right, it is an effective scene that really brings out the suspense of a movie. This movie does it right by keeping the first part of the film as a mystery as to why it's haunted, and the second half as a series of clues to lead us to a terrifying secret about the house. For the first half, though, we don't know the secret, and therefore we are left with a very spooky haunted house film. By making it just a spooky film, the paintings looking at us, the walls moving, it adds to create an atmosphere that very few haunted house films have created. There is one standout scene that really goes to prove this: as Eleanor is lying bed, she sees a black shadow enter the room on the ceiling and go over to her doorway. As the shadow gets to the doorway, it causes the archways in the door to raise, and it lights up these two red crystals. When it finishes, it appears that the door is looking at Eleanor with this demonic impression, and it is a very creepy scene. The ghosts are sometimes pretty creepy, and the way they interact with the cast is some great shocks. The one death in the film is one of the highlights. After attacking a picture of the owner of the house, the ghosts strike the person in the back and knock them onto a carpet. The carpet is dragged over to the fireplace, where it has a lion's head for a swing. The lion then opens its mouth and decapitates them, right in front of the rest of the group. There are many more different scenes that give some good chills, but would take up too much space to describe in detail. I even enjoyed the two different tones to the film. The mysterious first half is very well done, but the puzzle painted in the second half is very well thought out and is a bit out into left field, but it does make the movie seem a lot smarter than it probably is to some people.The Bad News: Despite one of the classic scenes from the original being cleverly homage in a scene that really sticks out since it doesn't follow the tone of the rest of the movie, this has one very classic mistake: the ghosts are shown. There are several scenes where we see the ghosts up close, and that really irritates me. This is the only real complaint: the ghosts are far too visible far too often.The Final Verdict: This is a better film than most admit to, but it really isn't all that bad. It has loads of suspense, a chilling house, and standout performances, all combining into a film that is a bit underrated. Watch this late at night with the lights out, and this might give you a few chills.Rated PG-13: Mild Violence, some language, and themes involving abused children</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm Haunted by how bad it was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A re-telling of the classic haunted house flic from 1963 (based on Shirley Jackson's famous novel), this was criticized for being nothing but non-stop special FX. In this day and age, that's no surprise. The makers here obviously attempted the ultimate haunted house epic. We are privy to view some of the most opulent sets ever conceived; some of the rooms are larger by themselves than what an average house is sized at (some of this impressive set design may lose its impact on the small screen). Neeson is the researcher investigating causes of fear who invites a trio of insomniacs to this gigantic house under false pretenses. The house has a sad, evil history, the focus of which is lost under the weight of innumerable FX shots in the 2nd half. The house-spirits focus on the character played by Taylor, a social outcast who spent many years caring for an ailing mother. Plot revelations concerning her relationship to the house seem contrived &amp; unnecessary, adding to a messy ending (also, a character's death is just ridiculous: how about just ...stepping out of the way?). Zeta-Jones is suitably great to look at. I get the impression of filmmakers given unlimited funds to realize a glorious vision and completely forgetting the main purpose of the whole project: making it scary. Yeah, yeah, OK, it's an impressive looking house - now what about the fear? As Jeff Goldblum might say - 'Now, we are going to see some scary things in this haunted house, right? Hm..? Hello? Hello?'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catherine &amp; Lili are superb!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(CONTAINS SPOILERS)People who are hard on this film should get a life. It's not a bad movie. Two of my favorite things about 'The Haunting' are Catherine Zeta-Jones &amp; Lili Taylor. They deserve nothing but praise for their acting in this film.When I first saw 'The Haunting' I didn't know anything about the book or original movie. I'm open to slash pairings &amp; immediately fell in love with the Nell &amp; Theo scenes. I hate it when two characters of the same sex have chemistry, but because it's a mainstream film or whatever they bring in a love interest of the opposite sex. I liked how in 'The Haunting' Nell &amp; Theo's relationship was taken the most seriously. Now when I first saw the movie I mistakenly assumed this was the filmmakers putting a new spin on an old story, but I discovered that it was actually a big part of the original.I've seen a lot of put downs towards the Nell &amp; Theo relationship. People so uneducated on the story that they assume the relationship was to cash in on Ellen &amp; Xena. How mistaken. I've also seen barbs at Zeta-Jones' Theo. The only complaint I have is that the story should have had her as a flat out lesbian &amp; not bi-sexual, but that's the screenwriter's fault not Catherine's. She takes on the role of Theo with real energy. She's an actress who probably never takes on a role half heartedly. She's trying her best &amp; she's not afraid to show interest in Lili Taylor's Nell. Also if we're going to give Nell a female love interest, why not give her one of Hollywoods most beautiful women? I applaud Catherine's performance. I also appreciated the subtlety of the Nell &amp; Theo scenes. Their relationship was never exploited. I wish people would show this some understanding, but then again they never do. What did they expect to see anyway: Catherine as a stereotypical female Bubba forcing herself on some unwilling victim?I only have a few problems with 'The Haunting'. Catherine &amp; Lili are so interesting that they overshadow the male characters who end up coming off as very bland &amp; boring. Also Nell's background relation to Hugh Crain's wife could have been a bit more fleshed out, but who cares? Catherine &amp; Lili more than make up for any flaws &amp; I also liked the film's spirituality.I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half or so of the movie is not bad at all. Interesting characters, intriguing premise, engaging storytelling. Even the thing about the kids make you want to know what's behind it all.The latter half of the movie is as disappointing as it could possibly be. The characterization (incl. some promising innuendo) is utterly abandoned, the story doesn't really go anywhere, it's boring, and nothing of what we want to know is actually revealed. The movie begins fine, and then ends as a mess so bad it isn't even ridiculous. It's tragic. (This is, by the way, the exact same problem Thir13en Ghosts had: a set-up, but an incoherent ending that fizzled out into nothingness.)The actors suffer under that same malady. It's not their fault that they don't get to develop their characters in the second half of the movie. Zeta-Jones is drop-dead gorgeous as always, and Lili Taylor is also interesting and appealing. Liam Neeson's heart is never in it (and who can blame him?), and Owen Wilson, well, he's never an asset to any movie, in my opinion.I give The Haunting 5 out of 10. And that's generous.</fullReview>

I sat in the theater whacting this and thinking too myself, is anyone getting scared by this? I mean I understand that it could be scary to some, back in 1920. But now, immune systems have been built up againt horror films, and while they don't have to be gems to be good, they shouldn't have to sucfk like airplane toilets anyway. The plot (with very little to do with the original and the book) involves a lady who can't sleep, so she goes to a big house hosted by a doctor (Liam Neeson) and with 2 other insomniacs (Owen Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones) to find out why they can't sleep. But the doctor has more secrets that the others know, as the house becomes alive. Some good visuals can't make up the fact that it is really dumb, with a horrible script, not good performances and stupid scares (the only one that was fair, which makes this film pass, is when Wilson looses his head). Definately not for sharing. D-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely better than HOHH but it was panned severely by critics because of the extreme overdose of CGI and the camp-Gothic sets. Like HOHH, it is a remake of the original of the same name. The original Haunting was quite good for it's day. But let's be honest?it's not it's day anymore.But what annoyed ME most about this movie was Lillie Taylor's character. I just didn't like how she whispered every word and was a bit of a weirdo. The ending's a little corny but some decent frights throughout make up for that.The sound design in the cinema was incredible. I was very scary and you really did feel like there were ghosts behind you and from every other direction. It was most impressive.HOHH tried to be quick and frenetic. In doing so it lost character and dialogue. But The Haunting takes a little bit of time to build and in some places is almost a psychological horror. For these ambitions alone, it is better than House on Haunted Hill.</fullReview>

The problem we see here is whether it's a horror movie or just a movie that is creepy. It's just your classic haunted house movie. Original no. But I personally loved it. If you've ever played the Sierra video game Phantasmagoria (7 cd roms long) as it is an interactive movie, you'll simply love this movie. I also appreciated the fact that whomever designed the pan/scan version took it upon themselves and preserved some integrity of the film by putting 1 particularly widescreen moment in the film along with a smaller, but equally just widescreen towards the end of the film. Aspect wise, I think people are still confused with widescreen. They would call us purists I suppose, but movies are meant to be shown in widescreen. Widescreen is not like those rip off panaramic shots used by Camera's. (those who have used it know what I mean) I think it was wise that they used that widescreen shot in the movie to show what difference it could make. Pan/scan versions are cropped and destroy the movies integrity. Some movies are shot in good and poor widescreen, but one this is for sure. Get ready for HDTV..... :)</fullReview>

Neither of us are jaded horror film fans--to this day I don't know how Alien ended,I couldn't watch past the chest bursting scene. What was scary about this movie was that we paid money to see it. The plot such as it is was about a doctor who wanted to do an experiment about fear. He recruits 3 insomoniacs for the experiment,but he tells them its a study about insomonia. One of them,Eleanor,played by Lili Taylor,has just lost her home because her mother from hell has died. The experiment is to take place in this abandoned Victorian mansion.The doctor plans to elicit fear among his recruits by telling them a "scary story".What's wrong with this movie? Bad acting mainly and bad story telling. There is nothing wrong with the story,it was told before in 1963--this is a remake, and it was told very well, but this movie is not plausible. Lili Taylor,what can I say,wooden acting,and totally unbelievable. All the characters were 2 dimensional,and none of them did anything to make me care about them--I absolutely hate bad acting.The house on the other hand was the one good thing about this movie.It was a gothic masterpiece,full of hugh statues of mythic animals, and bas relief cherubs and seraphims covering almost every wall. It was huge,with massive doorways,and rooms and the scariest fireplace ever constructed. A classic,perfect haunted house. The house was a 10,the movie 1.</fullReview>

No one : Liam Neeson, owen Wilson and Miss Zeta jones might die,disappear, desintegrate... the story's still here, it can go on without them. Only Lili Taylor is necessary : do you call that a screenplay? Let's be honest, it's a symptom of screenplay. So D'WORKS needed name to sell this piece of rubbish called movie : let's take these guys, they might sell this good! (did they?) Second :Who Cares about the story? Why, why this need to rationalize fear, this need to explain evertyhing what's happening in the house, why can't people learn from what's has been already done? and WAY much better! Look at Robert Wise' THE HAUNTING. He just had the power to terrorize an audience without showing any ghost, without explaining the strange power of Hill House. The characters in 1963 had real motivations : they were real characters. The ghosts here are no the ones you expect. Jan de Bont piece of rubbish is no more than a wannabe-funhouse, totally useless, not needed, badly scripted and always looking for some more FX to keep you awake. Even the John HOUGH version of 1972 is far more scarier.Avoid that 1999 version at any cost!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly awful film. I must say I almost threw up once I left the theater after seeing this sure to be a golden raspberry nominee. The direction is more stale than a box of old donuts and the writing is even worse. I wouldn't even call this a remake of a classic. I'd call it a disgrace to a classic. A lame subplot overshadows a film that had such potential. DreamWorks should employ a new marketing department because they showed the best parts in the preview with this seriously awful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe DreamWorks poured $80 million into this sorely overhyped horror movie with all the best parts spoiled in the previews. This movie is so bad that the moments in the movie intended to be scary are laughable. It's hard to believe that such a talented cast would do such a terrible film. Jan DeBont, a very good director at action adventure movies (Twister, Speed) but a terrible director at horror movies such as this. If you want scary, I suggest the original which is disgraced with this version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*Having read a number of reviews on this website, I think that my summary of this movie will ring false to many people. I thought for some time about what to say about this film, and realized that very little else would express my views. This movie does have good special effects, and it is only due to that that it gets the one star out of ten that I would give it. I can deal with movies that are supposed to be fun lacking brilliant cinematography or fantastic acting. All that I ask is that the film live up to what it is meant to be. In the case of "The Haunting," that is a horror movie. I swear to you that I am not exagerating when I say that the closest I came to having a frightened response to this film was one slight flexing of my right calf muscle in one scene of the movie. It really wasn't a frightening scene - just startling. My biggest beef with the movie is that it has all of the sterotypes and stupid audience grabbing devices that tend to piss me off. An example: Catherine Zeta-Jones has several incredibly heavy-handed lines that hint at her bisexuality. Message, "hey adolescent boys, this character might hook up with another woman. Watch and get turned on." It is a lame device used in the abscence of real plot to draw people into the film. The same thing is done with the special effects. Basically, I hated this film. If I hadn't been with a group of friends on whom I was dependent for a ride home, I would have walked out. It was not fun to watch in any way. As a fellow audience member said on the way out to people waiting in line to see this film, "Just stick a fork in your eyes. It will be cheaper and more fun."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be absolutley honest, I don't understand those that cannot stand this film. The cinematography was beyond what I expected, the special effects were seamless. This was the kind of film that makes me proud to be an aspiring filmmaker.So the characters weren't so deep you couldn't follow a line of dialogue, but were you expecting Shakespeare? So the plot was pretty much predicatable, but was Titanic really a surprise in any way?I was amazed at how much I enjoyed this film. Because I managed to let go of preconceived notions and let myself be scared, I let my imagination run wild rather than expecting the movie to do it for me. I slept with the lights on because I kept seeing faces and movements in the shadows. I used the film as a vehicle for enjoyment, and that's what it was. Stop expecting your movies to be James Joyce and let them be Jan De Bont. It's a movie, not a masterpeice. Enjoy yourself. If you're the type that goes to the theater to have a little fun and let go, you'll surely enjoy The Haunting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>modern trashing of a great classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently, Entertainment Weekly published a list of the "25 Scariest Movies of All Time", compiled by the employees of the magazine. Clustered atop the list were the usual horror film suspects, fine films all: "The Exorcist", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Alien", "The Silence of the Lambs" and "Halloween". Perhaps predictably, absent from the Top 25 were the horror films of yesteryear, particularly four films from what I consider to be the "Golden Age" of horror. For in an amazing four year span, 1960-1963, a quartet of films, each released in a different year, emerged to lift the genre to heights it has not been able to reach again. In 1960 came the great British sci-fi thriller, "Village of the Damned"; in 1961, there was Jack Clayton's brilliant ghost story, "The Innocents"; then, in 1962 came the piece de resistance, what, for me, is the greatest horror film of all time, Herk Harvey's low budget masterpiece of eeriness, "Carnival of Souls"; finally, in 1963, Robert Wise directed the classic haunted house spectacular, "The Haunting", based on Shirley Jackson's novel "The Haunting of Hill House". Each of these films share, in addition to their effective use of black-and-white photography and haunting musical scores, an appreciation of the power of suggestion, their realization that true terror lies in the imagination and that a creepy mood counts for more than inane gruesomeness and heavy handed special effects that just end up detracting from the horror. (I would include "Night of the Living Dead" on my list except that it was released in 1968).Now, with the new version of "The Haunting", each of these films has been subjected to the indignity of a modern day remake. Jan De Bont's version is a travesty on so many levels that it's hard to know where to begin, but each of its many failures stems from a basic problem of modern commercial moviemaking: wretched excess. The first element that makes it inferior to the original is one that probably can't be avoided in this day and age; the simple fact that black-and-white is far more effective a medium in establishing the kind of eerie atmosphere necessary for this type of tale. In color, the picture is simply too clean and bright and one loses the sense of danger hidden in the shadowy corridors and corners of the house. And the house itself creates a problem. For although the art direction is a true miracle of design and decor, it actually detracts from the suspenseful ambience the film so desperately wants to achieve. Even Hill House has to be realized on a scale of some believability. In the original film, the rooms looked as if someone might one day have actually lived in them. Here, the setting is so preposterously ornate that the house looks more like a museum or grand fun house than a center of ghostly activity.The film fails far more dismally on the level of its screenplay. In the original story and film, the parallels between past and present that connected Eleanor, the protagonist, to Hill House were worked out with such a fine logic that they helped hold the plot together. For instance, an earlier inhabitant of the house was a bed-ridden invalid who had to be looked after just as Eleanor had looked after her ailing mother. Also, the car crash that kills Eleanor in the original is presage by a carriage accident which kills one of the earlier inhabitants and which begins the curse that befalls this house that, as the originals claim, was "born bad". In the remake, the house has no logical reason for choosing Eleanor so the plotting degenerates into arbitrary silliness. Indeed, part of the fun of the original was the atmosphere of anticipation that came from knowing this house had a reputation for evil and the slowly dawning realization that it was searching for a new victim. In the new film, this is never established and, in fact, the characters aren't gathered to hunt for ghosts at all, but have been lulled there by a researcher, ostensibly to help them cope with their insomnia, but actually to function as guinea pigs in a study of the effects of fear on the personality. Yet, this is inexplicable because the doctor has nothing to do with the ghostly phenomena and, in fact, doesn't believe in its existence, so, by what method was this fear to be manifested? This is typical of the illogic that permeates the film. And, of course, all the sexual tension between the doctor and Eleanor is completely eliminated from this version.The ultimate indignity comes in the film's appalling final half hour when any attempt to replicate the subtlety of the original film is abandoned in favor of overblown special effects and lines like "Hugh Crane, I'm not afraid of you!". By this time, the audience has erupted into bursts of incredulous laughter and Hollywood has succeeded in trashing yet another of its classic films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting (*1/2 out of ****) Well, that's strike two for Jan De Bont. I swear if they ever give Kevin Costner or this guy another movie camera, I am gonna be sick. Well, after "Speed 2: Cruise Control", De Bont could have really used a push, but, unfortunately, this film pulls him back even farther. This awful remake of the 1963 Robert Wise classic stars Liam Neeson as a doctor who lures three "ordinary" people to an old, allegedly haunted mansion to use them as guinea pigs on a test to see how humans react to supernatural experiences. Well, it turns out the house is really haunted by the owner...blah blah blah...yada yada yada. I think you can fill in the rest, because we've seen it all before (only done better). Unlike the original, this one relies solely on special effects rather than its actors. Just like an old comedian's sidekick that sets up the jokes for his partner, it seems like the characters are just there to set up the house's special effects. Anyway, to save you seven dollars, the movie is two hours of excruciatingly loud door-slamming. There, now you don't have to go see it. You're one of the lucky ones.-Bryan A. Hicks</fullReview>

So it was strange when I really wanted to see this movie... My reasons being I love Liam Nelison, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Also the speical effect totally blew me away during the trailers. So I went to go see it on opening night in my very small home town. And I have to tell you I LOVED IT! It is very creepy and scary, but not in the blood and gore way like all the rest I've seen. The story is original, each character is in depth, and the effects are even better. Thanks to Stan Winston, our friend who created the effects in my all time favorite movie Jurassic Park!

		<fullReview>As I think of summer 1999's poorest movies: Wild Wild West, Inspector Gadget, The Thomas Crowne Affair, and, of course, the Haunting, it becomes clear that Hollywood is not having much success at riding on past successes. This is a result of the difference between a producer discovering a good script and then producing it vs. deciding to recreate a concept and then delegating the scriptwriting. The lack of any suspense in this particular film is demonstrated by Lily Taylor's line following one of the film's attempts at a horrifying scene: "Oh no." Oh no, indeed.</fullReview>

Had the script writers/editors picked one plot line to develop, movie-goers may have cared what happened to the different characters. As it currently stands, this movie is more laughable than frightening.

		<fullReview>If you enjoy the absolute WORST movies that have been featured on Mystery Science Theatre 3000, then you may want to consider seeing "The Haunting"... that is, if you can find a way to see it without spending money. From start to finish, "The Haunting" was one of the worst movies I have seen, including those on MST3K. There was no suspense at all, as the movie repeatedly told you everything that was going on. Nothing was scary, since when something potentially scary occured, you could see it coming from a mile away. And when someone was killed, it was generally very funny, not scary. Furthermore, the director had some bizarre obsession with constantly showing closeups of Owen Wilson. That, combined with the laughable acting and extremely obnoxious character Mr. Wilson played, had me screaming for his character's death the instant he appeared in the movie. This was a very poorly written and a very poorly directed movie. I admit the CG effects were neat to look at, but that doesn't make a movie. Neither does casting Qui-Gon. Indeed, I think that is the only reason Liam Neeson appeared in the movie... in attempt to milk success from Star Wars. Had the movie pursued what appeared to be a potential relationship between Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor, it may have been watchable. But alas, the focus was on a convoluted, nonsensical... something... that may remind one of a plot. I give this piece of dung 1/10th star (and the CG was what give it that).</fullReview>

The special effects, while maybe good, become annoying and you soon finding yourself questioning your own sanity as the characters lose theirs. And that brings me to my next point...the characters are not identifiable to the average person. I felt no sympathy to any of them, save for maybe the comic-relief guy.

		<fullReview>I consider the original 1963 version of "The Haunting" to be one of the scariest, if not THE scariest movie ever made. I first saw it when it was released (I was 12) and to this day if I watch it I get chills (and I've seen it many, many times.) The terror came from the fact that you never saw what, or who, was haunting Hill House. You only saw a door bend in and out, or you heard weird sounds, etc. Everything was pretty much left to your imagination--and that's where this remake goes terribly, terribly wrong. Aside from the fact that parts of the original Shirley Jackson story were changed for no apparently valid reason, in this version, you see far too much, virtually nothing is left to the imagination, and the end tries to wrap up everything in a "we've got rid of the ghost" scenario, (also a departure from the original story.) The sets are about the only good thing in this disaster. Do yourself a favor and rent the original version, and watch it alone. At night. In the dark.</fullReview>

Be sure, this is not the mousey Nell of the novel but a new, heroic Nell the Conqueror.If you have not read the novel, avoid this movie. The characters exist for no reason other than to be exposed to the crumbling house and mobile statues in the climactic scene.

Like when the phantom house makes a harp string hit a woman in the eye, the audience was howling, and a painting of the man who lived in the mansion looks like a cross between Jack Nicholson and a werewolf, which also got laughs. The movie is actually quite good, until Lili Taylors character starts to begin to think she's 'been chosen to protect the children'. Then everyone in the audience got restless, and you could hear alot of 'Aw, come on..'. Another ill-thought out part is when Taylor asks Neeson about when he called her, and he says he didnt call.

I could live even with this if the movie hadn't had such a cheesy ending. Why do Hollywood folks seem to think that movies must have some sort of happy ending? The original story was a tragedy, and it's been turned into some god-awful redemption and salvation story. I'll give it this much, the interiors were creepy. That was ruined, though, by all the CGI crap. I think CGI is great, but I'm afraid that CGI is taking the place of story and camera work. "The Blair Witch Project" had no effects, no fancy equipment, and it still scared the crap out of me. As a plea to filmmakers, please don't assume we won't like the movie unless we can see everything! Sometimes what isn't seen is the most effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some genuinely creepy moments in the first few minutes, then it all goes to hell. De Bont has forgotten that horror lies in subtlety and suspense -- you can't put a scarier image on the screen than the one the viewer creates in his mind. But De Bont tries like hell, and ends up throwing out one bad computer generated special effect after another. After the third or fourth ghostly face in the sheets, you'll be giggling. By the time Liam Neeson is confronted with a huge face (in the ceiling, for a switch) and doesn't even blink, you'll be laughing out loud. The house twists and turns and creaks -- except it really doesn't; it's all in a computer, and it's obvious.The end, with its lethal combination of terrible acting, horribly cheesy special effects, and utterly clueless sappy screenwriting (I don't want to spoil it, but it does feature Lili Taylor beating the hell out of a stone gryphon with a candlestick), will have you either rolling in the aisles or walking out of the theater.The movie is boring when it tries for suspense, funny when it tries to be scary, and braindead when it tries for drama. It's a great, big, blunt object of a movie, and by the time it beat me over the head with the hundredth dumb line of dialog and the thousandth cheap special effect, I was down for the count.If you're looking for a laugh -- eh, go see South Park.

Whilst the film boasts a handful of unsettling moments they bear no excuse for the rest of the film's fatal flaws. Lili Taylor's constant bawl scream is unnecessarily frequent and is quite annoying. The characters are over-baked stereotypes - see Catherina Zeta-Jones playing a bisexual "free-love" artist. I found most of the characters to be so unlikeable that I was waiting for each of them to be killed off as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing haunting about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A supposed remake to the 1963 film, The Haunting, this movie is about a group of people taking part in a sleep study at a mansion and then finding themselves getting caught in the middle of the house's sinister ghostly past.I remembered watching this movie on TV and from what I've remembered, it wasn't a very haunting movie. The plot wasn't very captivating, with nothing that really stands out that would grab your attention and in which you would find riveting; the story was filmed in a way that is a basic, ghost-on-the-loose movie. The acting was pretty bad, as there is limited character chemistry or development, and the special effects for the paranormal menaces were not sophisticated.A few frightening moments may jump out at you here and there and the chase scenes might be a tad exciting, but overall, there are much more scarier and intriguing horror flicks than this.Grade D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I saw this in the theatre and still lament the two hours of my life that I cannot get back. The only reason that I am even bothering to write a "review" of this, for lack of a better term, movie is that I just want to warn people to stay away.If ever you feel the urge to put this unholy tangle of bile on your television, just put on the original. The original 1963 version of "The Haunting" isn't just a good haunted house movie, it's an absolute genre masterpiece.This "thing" that Jan de Bont hobbled together is dreck of the lowest order. Sure, there are some good actors in it: Bruce Dern, Liam Neeson, but they are wasted.Don't waste your time. Seriously. You'll never get it back.</fullReview>

The 1963 movie is one of my all time favourite films. Its a movie that if you watch alone at night try just try to sleep with out the lights off! The sounds of banging on the door is chilling. This movie version does have a great house as did the 1963 film. I don't know where the new one was filmed. The house in the 1963 version was filmed at Ettington Park Hotel in England and its house that truly has a life of its own. And this house in the new one has that same feeling. So there was all the ingredients for a good film. But they missed by miles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I could give this movie less than 1. It's terrible. Shirley Jackson's novel is, in my opinion, the finest horror novel ever written. The 1963 movie followed the book, and was truly scary and well done. This abomination is just plain bad. I like Liam Neeson as an actor, and I could just sit and watch Catharine Zeta-Jones for hours at a time, but their talents are wasted here. The idiot writers changed the story (where do the children come from?) so that it's nearly unrecognizable and then add the usual bloody gory special effects which are not in the original at all. One of the things that makes the novel and the original movie so special is the fact that nothing happens on stage at all. Everything is left to the mind of the viewer and that makes it very scary. In this movie, all subtlety is gone and it's just plain bad. Don't even bother to see this one.</fullReview>

The *whole* point was the ambiguity.The reader (or watcher if you're talking about the old B+W version) is supposed to decide for themselves if the house was really haunted, or if Eleanor was just suggestible and in need of a home, or if Eleanor was doing it herself with her mentioned paranormal abilities, or if it was maybe the house *and* Eleanor both doing things. You never saw the actual ghosts because you weren't supposed to know for sure if there were any! This bears no resemblance at all to Shirley Jacksons lovely, spooky psychological thriller.</fullReview>

We are introduced to characters with a slightly forced depth, especially Theo, but at least these are three-dimensional, interesting figures. The stage is set.And so, it begins. And this is where the true miracle of the screen comes. This movie is completely and utterly UNfrightening. In a set like that. I just don't get it. It's a miracle. Give a monkey a camcorder and stick it in that set, and it would shoot a more suspenseful movie than this.

		<fullReview>This movie was so much better than the original because we now have a better understanding of what our main character is going through. In the first, we didn't give us anything to scream about, now we have better technology and graphics that we now can put ghosts and the creepy children into a very scary concept, which in my opinion was a very smart way to go but something ruined it. The ending! The ending, what were they thinking bringing Hugh Kane to life, why was that such an important thing to do.I mean, seeing him wasn't scary, wasn't thrilling, it wasn't shocking but in fact, it was ridiculous and severely boring. Other than that, we our great actress and actors. Liam Neeson plays our Doctor who brings our "insominics" to the great looking house under false pretenses. Great way to start the film. The guests are, Theo who is portrayed by the lovely and talented Catherine Zeta-Jones who plays a wild hellcat who screams out that she's bi. Whatever, like we care anyway, we know you're not. Even though, she feels there is no need for her insomnia but as the story and thrills arrive, she shall soon realize that she doesn't want to toss and turn anymore. Luke, played by Owen Wilson, "Look at his hideous nose" the smart one of the group who is the first to suspect that Dr. Marrow testing isn't what he said it was. Even though, his character seems to be fun and very thoughtful guy, he realizes that making fun of Hugh Kane, could be the last thing we will do. Nell, who is our star for this evening is played be the best Indie Actress of our time, Lili Taylor, who is struggling to keep her house from the unexpected appearance of Virgina Madsen and her husband. Then as she sees Dr. Marrow's ad in the paper about testing for insomnia, she goes on the the house and soon discovers the horrible truth hidden within the house and how she shares her strange connections with Hugh Kane and she'll soon think that battling with her sister for the house, seems so much better than the dangers she shall soon face. All and all, this movie takes us in depth about the true horrors that await for guests to unfold. But still take a time to think about this ending, better the second time around. B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are several things wrong with the remake.First of all, I kind of get this feeling that no one who was involved in the production ever saw the original film by Robert Wise. The 1963 film was a marvel of suspense and one could look at that film as being the spiritual cousin of Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING. If they did, they would have know that they had to work toward something.Let me tell you why the 1963 film worked: it was its subltety and the way it allowed you to fill in the blanks. (Is she imagining all of this? Is the house trying to control her?) From this, this is main reason this version fails miserably.When we come to the Crane Mansion in this film, there is nothing to wonder. It screams BIG SCARY MOVIE SET. All of the apparitions jump at us in their computer-generated glory. Above all, the climax of the film......I felt my brains oozing from my ears.In short, in order to make a decent horror film with subtlety requires thought and intelligence from the screenwriters. That, for this film, was in short supply....</fullReview>

I thought it would suck too, BUT, I rented it anyways, and I was NOT disappointed. Didn't regret a minute.This is really a good flick. It has a good story, a good cast ,in which Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta Jones (damn she's hot, wish I was Michael Douglas) stand out, the rest of the cast is OK. Taylor as the 'psycho' and Jones as a BISEXUAL (I believed it, then again I'm a guy). The effects and the music are great, the combination of the two really excited me and had me sitting on the edge of my couch (seat). Good direction too, no doubt as the effects and music made it an entertaining and exciting movie. It was not that creepy though, but still good entertainment. Now for the downsides of this flick, well there are actually no more than two or three: 1: Where does Taylor get the stuff she's saying from about family and so on. 2: I do not understand THE CALL (you'll know what I meant with these first two, after you saw this movie) 3: Ending is a bit vague.Take my advice, ignore everyone elses opinion and see this one, or look at how much money it made (pretty much I daresay), that says something too, you know8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-the-top special effects make this look like a Children's fantasy film directed by Tim Burton. No atmosphere whatsoever, and poor performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the 1963 film, "The Haunting" is a lavish production which ironically is really a poor-man's film, in spite of the CGI scares and images that it relies heavily upon, that consequently contribute to it's ruin as a horror film. Liam Neeson is Dr. Marrow, a psychologist who invites five people to take part in an experiment in a secluded Manor out in the wilderness of the Berkshires. The five people, including Eleanore - a sensitive and slightly na?ve young woman who has spent all of her life caring for her invalid mother, who has recently passed, a young, witty joker named Luke, and a nympho named Theo. They all suffer from insomnia of some kind or another, and Dr. Marrow has tricked them into believing that they are taking part in an experiment which will attempt to understand and possibly cure insomnia. However, his real motive is to study the psychological response to fear. As he believes that the emotion is a handicap, when it should instead be a psychical and mental boost when triggered. He has the caretakers of Hill House lock them in for the night, and he sets about telling them the story of Hill House and it's deceased owner, in an attempt to make their minds act up on them when they are together and scare them. But when unprecedented things go bump in the night, and other strange events occur which begin to put their lives in danger, the group, and Dr. Marrow must realise that they are now in way over their heads.The first hour drags on with not much happening. Liam Neeson looks out of place here. Owen Wilson has the potential to ruin any film that he is in with his awful acting and funny-guy image, and he really looks like a donkey wearing a hat in a horror film. Catherine Zeta-Jones was pretty lame as a nympho-vampire-looking chick and then Lili Taylor over-acted every scene she was in. Her character was particularly poorly handled by the weak script. The CGI effects ruined any chance the film had of generating a decent haunted house horror atmosphere, and someone needed to remind the director the value of the fear of the unknown, instead of in-your-face effects and moving objects (In this case, flying cherub statues that just look like something from a Tim Burton fantasy film). I didn't buy the story at all, and the funny thing was that this didn't drag as much as it probably could have once they got to the house. This prevented me giving it anything lower than a 3-star rating. The set was impressive, I'll give it that, but the CGI was uncompromisingly ridiculous. Only one particular scene came anywhere near to being a scare and that was the mirrors sequence, which appears to be infamous here, with many users stating that this scared the hell out of them. Overall, this was a rather poor-man's attempt at a supernatural flick, disguised by a lavish production that seemed to just revolve around the scenes in which it got to show-off it's ridiculous CGI, which looked completely out of place. Makes one appreciate some of the 21st century supernatural flicks that we have today, that's for sure. At least they do be scary, if not overly original.</fullReview>

I made the banners so awful that no one ever asked me to create such nonsense again.The lessons from this film are obvious: just because you have the technology to create special effects does not mean that you must use everything available in a silly Disneylandish orgy. And secondly: just because an actress is beautiful does not mean she has to play a vacantly stupid vampy campy beautiful lesbian.

		<fullReview>The house itself is absolutely breathtaking, the cast of characters is completely wonderful and the performances are purely professional. The effects are superb and the finished product is way more than the sum of its mere parts.In this jaded, desensitized society in which we live, it is growing harder and harder to find a movie which can really make you JUMP...rare indeed are the moments when you actually utter a small shriek and snuggle down beneath a blanket...from a movie.This movie is one of those rare gems of the horror genre. The house itself is the most beautiful example of late Gothic design I've ever seen. This movie is an absolute masterpiece of scenery, settings, dialog and effects. The story line moves smoothly and the characters were perfectly cast in this shining example of superb directing. I have watched this movie many times and have never found it wanting in any area.Since the death of her mother after a long illness, and a harsh betrayal by her sister, Nel's life has taken a sudden turn. Understandably, Eleanor, "Nel," is having trouble sleeping. Upon receiving a phone call from a leading psychiatrist, directing her to a newspaper ad calling for volunteer insomniacs, Nel finds herself homelessly standing at the gates of Hill House, bags in hand. She has come to participate in the psychiatrist's psychological study centered around sleeplessness. The cast members are then brought into the plot one by one, as the psychiatrist introduces the "experimental story" concerning the past history of the house, and the story line begins to move.The visual effects here are far more than mindless "industrial" eye candy. These effects are absolutely stunning. You have to SEE the movie in order to appreciate how beautiful the house and how breathtaking are the effects. "I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer. I'll be a volunteer." Nel.As events begin to occur and Nel begins to puzzle out the reasons for them, the pieces begin to fall seamlessly into their appropriate places. This movie contains a certain ... Agatha Christieesque .. plot, in that you can figure it out with Nel. You are given all the information you need in order to make the determination for yourself as to why the house is haunted and why Nel was..."invited."I know I've gone on and on about the house, but I can't accurately describe the beauty and grandeur of it. It's one of those things you simply HAVE to see for yourself. It's absolutely breathtaking, and so is the plot to this wonderfully SCARY movie. ~I~ wouldn't want to live there, even for a night.As the plot unfolds, so will your wits. This is one of those movies that still gets my blood pumping, no matter how many times I've seen it. Every scene is a veritable feast of visual effects and psychological stimulation. If you liked the "Amityville Horror," or "House on Haunted Hill," you will absolutely LOVE this movie. There are no hokey effects, no trite dialog, no sloppily delivered lines and no failures in setting, scenery or prop detail. This movie delivers a solid, professional and delightfully scary end product which will make an excellent addition to ANY movie library.If you've enjoyed this movie, I highly recommend House on Haunted Hill, Poltergeist 1 and 2, Disney's Haunted Mansion, The Entity, The Bat, and the original The Haunting.It rates a solid 9.6/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a film of three parts.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, this film was bought for me as a birthday present. I'd seen it in Woolworths, looked at it and thought it might be interesting, but nothing special. I had not specially asked for it, and the original film was rated by one magazine as the 4th scariest film of all time. Therefore, I didn't really have any expectations of this film. I expected it to be average, nothing spectacular and probably not as good as the original. Indeed, I began watching it in a fairly neutral mind.And it has to be said, things were going promisingly, what with the weird caretaker and wife, and the 'beautiful' (although that's arguable) carvings of the children's heads. The story about the former owner, who couldn't have looked more evil in his portrait if he had tried. It was working well, leaving me intrigued as to what was going to happen and when.Then we move to the rather unfortunate second part of the story. I can't really describe this part in any detail simply because it was so rushed that I didn't really have any idea what was going on or why. The startling discovery (which wasn't all that startling anyway) simply lacked justification. Why did it happen? Why did the former owner do what he did? Hello????And of course, the totally rushed second part makes way for the utterly awful third part of the film. What took place, for lack of a better word, was inane, utter drivel. And because I didn't know what was going on in the second part, I honestly couldn't say I cared that much about the third part. But what I find all the more amazing is claims by people that they found it scary. Er, when exactly? I found myself mildly amused by the pointless chasing about and ridiculous ending, but I never even jumped at it. A house with lights for eyes, and a plume of smoke for a villain simply made me look on in disgust.What started promisingly became a messy, ridiculous, overplayed storyline lacking any sense or ways to justify it.3/10 - simply for its promising start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice try</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched this movie first, I was in for a scaring and thrilling film since it was declared a "Horrorfilm". However after 30 minutes I wondered what that was supposed to be. I would rather describe it as a horror-comedy or even parody. But even if that should have been the intention, it went wrong. The film is full of cliches of average horrorfilms. Additionally the story is completely predictable. There are strange statues in the house, blowing winds, whistling sounds and of course an ancient ghost. Even the special effects, which are in fact high-quality don't prevent the movie from being boring. These effects create an artificial impression: The winding of the ceiling or the braking window might have worked for a sci-fi movie, but not for a horrorfilm which is supposed to scare. The actors can't save the movie either: Liam Neeson is top, but the two girls (especially Lily Taylor gets on your nerves after a while)are just average.The set of Hill House is nice, and the rooms in there are pretty impressive but without convincing story-who cares? The only thing I can say is: Try again-it can only get better</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original movie ( dated 19??)did not show any "monster" , it just SUGGESTED scary "things" , .This version however shows every aspect of a "sick minded ghost" , including unnecessary special effects . The "mystery " ,as presented in the original movie , was the most scary part : one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened. By showing the face of the "old man" , this Mister has completely disappeared. Even worse : the special effects ( crying wooden children faces) is ridiculous. This is a stupid remake , too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bold Experiment In Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lili Taylor starred as Nell in The Haunting (1999) around the same time that co-stars Owen Wilson and Catherine Zeta-Jones were starting out in their own film careers. Lili's character in The Haunting was an amazing transformation as a sexy love interest of Ben Affleck's character in the super action blockbuster at the time Armageddon (1998) starring Bruce Willis along with Owen Wilson again as a co-star to a dowdy, care taker in The Haunting. Director Jan de Bont attempt at a different, creative special effect atmospherics is notable as the haunting ambiance presents an somewhat original eerie, almost living entity of an entire mansion. Yet de Bont's experiment with his special effects doesn't seem to quite have the same shocking horror value as one finds in Thir13n Ghosts (2001) or The Haunting of Hill House (1999) release as a remake of the 1959 version all based on similar written source material.What does make The Haunting stand out is the singular focus on the one character Nell, somewhat reminiscent of The Cell (2000), Cube Zero (2004) or Dark Water (2005) as well as the overall tone and outlook of the movie which isn't as common as other haunted house movies. But at the same time, it also makes The Haunting also somewhat more mundane for such a movie genre which was later more effectively captured in Soulmates (2013), or The Awakening (2011). For a even more intense haunting experience, Silent Hill (2006) or 1408 (2007) is suggested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie. It seemed to be a throw back to the Hitchcockian type of horror/suspense movies where the writers and acting left a lot of the scary stuff to the viewers imagination. Until the last 30-40 minutes when they got way to weird with the special effects and the CGI's. I did figure out that the carved kids faces represented the dead children but I did not know he was the killer until it was explained. Liam Neeson's doctor character seems to be rather unethical in doing a study without the patients knowledge or permission. Owen Wilson was not that impressive in this movie. Zet-Jones acted a bit strange in her role almost like she was not fully committed to it. While Lili Taylor only got fourth billing her character is really the main one that everything ends up revolving around. The special effects with the children's faces were a little wooden (pun intended) but also kind of interesting. Will I own this movie? No. Will I watch it on TV again? More than likely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent, but lifeless remake of a film I've recently watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before any of you get angry with me, no, I haven't saw the original film directed by Robert Wise, but I heard that some fans liked it. I think I saw this remake three summers ago back at 2009 on a videotape and I thought it was just OK. Nothing terrible or anything, but it could've been a *lot* better because there are some flaws that bothered me in my first viewing.Now, I've heard that this and the original were based on the book, but it has subplots that were totally confusing. It has a nice back-story about the house, but everything else completely ruins the overall tone/atmosphere of the film and the ending feels like it's been done a thousand times before like in the Disney films or something. The first 30 minutes started out well, but then it gets pretty boring throughout the rest of the film. Some of the computer graphics are nice, but most of them are just silly. The script is terrible with several unfunny scenes that totally bored me to death while lacking not only subtlety, but it's heart as well and the dialog is the epitome of tedious.It does, however, have a top-notch cast like Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta Jones, Liam Neeson, and Owen Wilson that did fine with what they were given, some nice visual scenery especially the look of the house, some OK-ish direction from Jan De Bont who brought us "Speed" and "Twister", and a solid music score from the late Jerry Goldsmith.Overall, The Haunting isn't a terrible movie, per-say, but with a better script and a better story in the department, it would've been a lot more better. I may have not watch the original, but given the terrible reception in this mediocre remake, I think I would like to rent it if I have the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it was a poor remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>comparing this film to the original it was a poor childish remake. The special effects were nothing special, its one of those films that when you look at it you instantly know it is CGI and pretty bad CGI at that. None of it looks realistic, the scary moments are not scary and thats the biggest problem, its not scary. the original was beyond creepy dwelling on the main characters psyche and all the torment shes going through so you get a good sense of whats going on and how it all fits together being a pretty scary film. this movie was pretty childish, especially with the windows becoming eyes it just looked like a silly cartoon. The characters are pretty bland and are way to underdeveloped. the worst part of the whole thing was the climax which was literally a big silly looking monster and it was defeated by the girl giving a speech about family (the power of love) all in all it is probably one of the worst remakes around comparing it to the original film and if you were to look at it on its own its still a clumsy poorly made film. my advice is go watch the original</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the 1963 version as a child and as an adult, and I have read the actual Shirley Jackson novel. What the heck does this movie have to do with any of it??? SO much of the plot is NOT in the book or the earlier version. They took a title and made up their own movie around it, and the result was horrible. Whose idea was this anyway??? In the original, Hugh Crain was NOT some industrialist who exploited children. Eleanor was NOT his granddaughter. The original movie and book made the idea of "haunting" a very individual experience, and most of what happened happened inside the heads of the individual characters. This movie, though made in 1999, was obviously made for small minds that lack imagination and cannot deal with suggestion. These folks need the computer-generated nonsense, the gore, and the whole thing laid right out there so that no imagination needs to be utilized. Sad, sad, sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How would anyone ever believe they could make a remake of that fine 1963 film of the same name is beyond me. The original was creepy in the extreme with top notch performances and a truly believable script deftly directed by Robert Wise. This film is ridiculous in is setting and concept, and I have no idea what Liam Neeson was thinking when he signed on to do this stinker. Way over the top with special effects (why do so many filmmakers today think special effects are of paramount value? The are to be a part of the storytelling, not the story itself). A so called sleep study goes awry when the participants discover their host, good ol Liam, has held back the fact that the place is haunted. He should have held back the entire production. Don't waste your time on this, check out the still effective Wise production instead.</fullReview>

Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to provide eye-candy. Liam Neeson was totally wasted in this film. Like Jones, he had no role at all. The film was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). She was the only one that had any real part in this crappy script by David Self. OK, it was his first one and he did redeem himself with Road to Perdition.I don't know what director Jan de Bont's problem was. he did a great job with Speed and Twister. he really fell down on the job here. Maybe he was still recovering from the disaster Speed 2: Cruise Control. He should thank his lucky stars for The Wild Wild West, else this would be the worst picture of 1999.Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Handsome house of horrors ruled by special effects...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whereas in the original B&amp;W version of THE HAUNTING directed by Robert Wise, too much of the material was understated and made it seem as though nothing ever really happened, here we have the opposite--too much is seen and shown and not enough left to the imagination.But the production itself is a handsome one, including a house to die for and some rather startling special effects that become a bit tiresome after awhile. And the cast is an impressive one--LIAM NEESON as the doctor in charge of a dangerous experiment, CATHERINE ZETA-JONES, LILI TAYLOR, BRUCE DERN and MARIAN SELDES.After a slow start introducing the characters, it gradually builds suspense--but the effect is not startling enough even with all the special effects that were missing in the original. Some things are better left to the imagination (as, for example, Val Lewton demonstrated in THE CAT PEOPLE).Horror fans seemed to prefer the original--or perhaps audiences just rejected all the emphasis on special effects rather than leaving things shadowy and undefined, which sometimes increases the horror. At any rate, a disappointing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lili Taylor, Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson, and Bruce Dern all co-star in this weird horror-thriller that pits all of them trying to survive spending the night in a haunted mansion. Zeta Jones fails horribly to capture the audience's attention as the sexy lesbian her character is supposed to be and Neeson just looks quite bored with the role of overseer of the project they all embark on. Taylor, whose character has a weird attachment and attraction to the supernatural occurrences in the house is probably the only person whom the director required to show some acting skills. As people begin to disappear into the night, the truth about the secrets that exist behind the ancient walls of this spooky mansion begin to make their way into the light of day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eleanor Lance is called to meet at Hill House for Dr. Marrow's sleeping disorder studies, along with three other people. The owners of the house tell them that no one will be around and that they won't be able to hear them. The first night they all sit around and talk. Eleanor tells them that her sleeping disorder is different because she can sleep it is just that she wakes up because she thinks her dead mom is still living with her. Well that isn't the case now because she is woken one night in the Hill House bedroom by talking children's voices asking her for her help. At first scared by the voice, she learns to avoid them. Later, the group finds out that Dr. Marrow is not using them for sleeping disorders but a test in fear. The fear is first thought to be fake but eventually turns real when loud noises are heard and objects start to move. Now they must try an escape the house before they are all killed. While the plot of this film is warn-out and virtually all the suspense of the original is lost, thie film is, technically speaking, stunning. The enormous sets and production values are among the best I've ever seen. The special effects are equally creative and impressive-looking (With the exception of a forgivably tacky close-up of a ghost's face near the end) and the performances and direction are solid. Catherine Zita Jone's facial hair can get pretty annoying at times and so can some of the characters. My rating for "The haunting"- 6.5/10.About the DVD: Dreamworks has given us an excellent DVD. The picture is crisp and void of any grain, the sound is excellent and the surround sound is effectively haunting. We have also been given a slew of extras, including- A "making of" featurette hosted by Catherine Zita Jones that covers everything from set design, to interviews, to behind the special effects, and even real ghost legends,which is an excellent featurette that extensively covers the production. We also get a commentary by the director and production designer which is decent as well as some deleted footage and theatricle trailers as well as wide-screen format. Nice! My rating for the DVD- 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown remake of a 60's horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no idea why producer/director Jan de Bont decided to remake this classic haunted house movie from the Sixties. The film seems to be designed to promote ILM's digital special effects wizards - the actors and the story are superfluous. And whereas Director Robert Wise made a good film with considerably fewer resources in the original, Jan de Bont wastes a lot of talent here to produce a film that borders on camp.The weakest link in this film is the lead actor, Lili Taylor. Her attempts at expressing horror and wonderment are just plain laughable. When you see such actors as Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Bruce Dern reduced to playing secondary roles, the blandness of Ms. Taylor's performance is only accented.The plot is similar to the original except the doctor in charge is conducting an experiment in people's reaction to fear, not an exploration of psychic phenomena. Anyone could have played the part as it was written, so why bring in Liam Neeson for a second-rate part? Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the worldly traveler to Lili Taylor's spinster, and again, while she's drop dead gorgeous and I love to see her in anything, she's wasted in this part.As noted, the special effects are the star of the film, and ILM does a masterful job. Nothing you haven't seen in other films, but the effects are pretty amazing nonetheless. That having been said, the plot is pretty weak - malevolent ghost and former master of the house tries to capture Eleanor (Taylor) and keep her there. It's not a scary movie because you can see everything coming before it happens. Other than drooling over Zeta-Jones, I didn't find much of interest here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like CGI...I think it has its place in movies. Some people say the Hulk will have too much CGI, but I say it is the type of movie that should. Horror, however, should not have too much...or any at all when possible. This one starts out promising enough as we are introduced to the characters...though the situation the one woman was in was a tad ridiculous (that kid, you know who). Then you get to look over the house then promptly two of the characters leave...leaving less fodder to be killed. Then again this is a haunted house movie so that is ok. Neeson, Wilson, Jones, and Taylor do all right at the beginning. Then the cgi nightmare begins as every scare is like a cgi statue that anyone who isn't blind can tell is not really there. Of course the scene with the fireplace with the skeleton is the only scene that made anyone scream out in the theater I was in, and the later scene with Owen Wilson and the fireplace was also pretty good. The conclusion, though, is one big cgi effect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll say this first and foremost. Jan De Bont must've never seen a horror movie in his life. This movie could've been something and it falls not "just short" but "real short". For one, it's not scary. At all. Sure there are moments that you'll say, "Oh, okay that was kinda cool,", but they only add up to about one or two separate moments. The house itself is incredible and besides some incredible sound design (thank you Gary Rydstrom, I bought the DTS dvd in your name and your name only), that's all this crock has to offer. The acting (and we're talking big stars here) is atrocious. Lily Taylor's ok but she's not given enough to work with. Liam Neeson looks like a whipped dog in this. Catherine Zeta-Jones probably hid under her seat during the premiere, she's that bad. Owen Wilson was probably thinking of his next project with Wes Anderson rather than concentrate on his performance (and that's not an insult, given the 1/2 dimensional character they gave him). You know what? I don't even want to talk about this anymore. I won't discuss the way-too-CGI effects. The overdone cherub thing. The lack of discomfort that a true "horror" movie gives. I'm sorry for wasting your time but just know that you're in for a big disappointment if you have any kind of expectations, be it high, low, whatever. I've actually heard that Spielberg let De Bont have it in the lobby of the theater that this tested at, giving him a verbal lashing. Watch it and tell me that you're surprised. And before I forget, watch The House on Haunted Hill remake for a decent haunted house flick. Rating: *1/2 out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting, or House on Haunted Hill 1, this film proved to be rather dull and occasionally interesting. First of all, this film relied too heavily on boffo CGI, and then it relied on the audience to suspend belief and expect Lili Taylor to carry the film (when she is really an indie star). Sure, it had Liam Neeson and the sensual Catherine Zeta-Jones (before she made Michael Douglas one of the luckiest men on earth). Jan De Bont's career definitely took a dive after this.

		<fullReview>Eh. That's basically what I felt like when I left The Haunting. I was glad that they decided to play it as a straight thriller with little comedy, but it just wasn't all that scary.Liam Neeson wants to do a study on fear. So he gets a group of people together under the guise of an insomnia study, in order to scare them and see how they react. The group starts off as 6, but within a few seconds, two of them leave and are never heard from again. Did anyone else find that odd? Introduce two characters, send them off, and then never speak of them again? How long does it take to get some stitches? Unless they were the ones that were supposed to do the scaring, but I don't remember that being mentioned either. Anyway... After a while one of the house guests (Lili Taylor) discovers a hidden secret within the walls and rooms of Hill House. And that secret isn't very happy about being found out. So the house attacks the guests and all hell breaks loose. Literally at one point.The movie moves along very slowly. It kind of reminded me of what I've seen of The Shining in that way. Of course this movie wasn't nearly as good. It just moved along slowly, trying to build the suspense. But to be honest, I didn't really care what happened to these people. I was actually hoping one would die to make things interesting. One did die, but it took way too long for it to happen (although the death was quite exciting). The story about why the house is upset was a little convoluted. A second wife? I must have missed something. I did love the sets though. The house itself was quite amazing. Just looking at it and trying to imagine myself living there was frightening. But there were way too many hallways. I never got a real feel about where the rooms were in relation to each other. The acting was ok. Taylor takes a leap from her indie roots to try and make it in the mainstream, and does a credible job. She was just held down by a few awful pieces of dialogue. Owen Wilson seemed out of place around these actors. He never really got into the feel of the film. Zeta-Jones played her role well, but if there was supposed to be a small lesbian sub-plot, it was very very small, too bad. And Liam Neeson has never been one of my favorites for some reason. And he lived up to those expectations.So overall, there were a few chills and thrills, but too few to make it very exciting. The special effects were somewhat different and done very well, but in this age, I need a little more than cool special effects. How about a coherent story and some real frights? If you're looking for a good scare, I'd put my money on the Blair Witch.</fullReview>

As a fan of horror films,I like to be scared and many films have scared me but this one didn't.There were some spooky looking things in the house such as pictures on the wall. Maybe if this had been filmed in black and white and tried to emulate the original it would have been better.

		<shortDescription>A dull film to say the least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear me, a rather underwhelming display of noise, inane visuals and non-drama that expects one to empathise with its endlessly open-mouthed stock "heroine". Liam Neeson, so impressive in, say, "Husbands and Wives" or "Schindler's List", is scarcely a presence here. His character may have had potential, that I expect was tapped more in the original film. A problem is that once the special effects start to dominate, about 1/2 of the way through, there is literally *no* characterization. The characterization there is is all too scant, and no proper context is given to the film's events. It is all set up very suddenly, and the motivations of the characters are barely touched upon. Lili Taylor is rather annoying in a thankless role, meant to be the film's center. The delectable Catherine Zeta Jones, irritates rather less, as she does indeed appeal to the eye, and importantly as her character is barely involved in anything at all. The makers' intent - Ms Jones to act as eye candy to drag in a certain audience - is all too clear, hardly a new gambit in such movies. Each character is plainly a stereotype - Neeson as the sombre scientist, Wilson as the supposed "everyman", Taylor as the sensitive "everywoman" and CZ Jones as the sexy society girl. Wilson, bizarrely co-writer of the excellent "Rushmore", is the worst of a cast that is emphatically keen to go through the motions. His character is appallingly written and played with no stature whatsoever by Wilson. The script is utterly nondescript, and is not helped by dull, telegraphed music and bland direction. For a supposed Horror film, this has to rank especially low. There is a tangible lack of atmosphere, even of an archetypal horror sort, and this begs the question - what were this film's makers thinking? Surely at least one would attempt a more low-key use of special effects, and music of a less bland kind so typical of modern Hollywood. The use of lighting is mediocre, and although I wouldn't go as far as to say monochrome is truly essential to horror films, it is usually a very safe bet for effective atmosphere. I save seen some of the original film, from 1963, and it didn't appear to be particularly great to me, but it certainly got the horror basics right, and seemed effectively suggestive and low-key. This remake is pretty awful in every regard; the special effects even being far from eyecatching, and the admittedly reasonable sets ill used. A very inconsequential, pointless film; as far from unsettling me as a particularly aimiable episode of "Bagpuss".Rating:- * 1/2/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Like Hammer Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie. I have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 Haunting as well as most of the Hammer films. This film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it. Yet many viewers can accept out of control films like Scream because slashers are more easy to believe than demons or ghosts. Actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great. I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense. The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring. Perhaps this film might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more of an tradtional plot structure. The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963. It was even more scary. See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela franklin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What made me want to see "The Haunting" was it's awesome trailer and basically what was in the trailer was the only real exciting parts in the film. The special effects were really good, yes, and I loved the house itself, I mean it was an incredibly beautiful house. Maybe that's one of the areas where they went wrong. The house should be creepy not beautiful. I guess in one sense it was kind of creepy, but it definitely could have been terrifying, even to watch, let alone if you had the chance to be put in that house yourself for a few nights. I also thought that the visual effects supervisors of the film shouldn't have used cartoon type child ghosts in it. That was just terrible. If they made the ghosts look even remotely human I might have been a little creeped out if that was what I saw swimming through the sheets of Lily Taylor's bed instead of a cartoonish type ghost. Another thing, the director (Jan de Bont) shouldn't have been afraid of getting an R-rating, which was what the MPAA was going to give them for the films' "intense horror sequences." But, Jan de Bont went back and toned the film down to get that PG-13 rating which was a terrible mistake. If he decided to go for the R-rating and not care about the MPAA, "The Haunting" might have been a *really* good movie and scary at that matter. The ending was quite a disappointment to say the least and I even read in Entertainment Weekly that Dreamworks, the production and distribution company, was terrified of the first ending...so why did they go back and redo it? The world may never know. Last, but not least, I was intrigued by the whole Hugh Crane story though. That was creepy and a plus on the films part.My verdict - 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The interior of the castle was done inside the old hanger for the Spruce-Goose in Long Beach, California. The artwork and detail of the interior is outstanding. The special effects are also very good. I have the original film and although they are similar, they are enough different that you can enjoy one and then the other. Everytime I watch the new version I concentrate on the detail present, it is mind boggling. The ending of the film I think could have been a bit better, perhaps, but the rest of the film was good enough that the ending was OK; which made it a bit like the original film. If you have never seen the original, you should. It was super and it never really shows a creature or demon. But, you are convinced they are there, just the same. I should say that I have the advantage of viewing the new movie on DVD and with a very good sound system. With a big screen and a good sound system the film really gets you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>--SPOILER ALERT--THE HAUNTING from 1963 holds my title for most frightening film ever made, and I figured to make a good remake the director should minimize the special effects to zero, and go for great suspense, mind-scares and some frightening production design.It makes no sense, the first hour tries to be a remake of the original, the second hour explodes to some kind of fun-house. The reason I hate this movie so much is a lot because I love the '63-version. Everything in it was right. I was scared to death, and it didn't have any effects, gore or action. From the start to finish it was a scare. I was afraid that this would be a step-by-step-remake like the Gus Van Sant-PSYCHO, but now I wish it at least was. Every reason why the original was scary has been wiped out and replaced by an anti-scare. The movie starts with Nell getting a phone call with a "tip" to look in the phone book to find an ad for insomnia-problem. Who this is, buy the way, never gets revealed, even though Dr.Marrow claims it wasn't him. In the first THE HAUNTING we quickly catch up sympathy with Nell, sharing her thoughts and memories from the past, and we are filled with horror when she aproach Hill House, the house stares at her and it feels as if she has been eaten by a monster when she is in it. In the remake it is the total opposite. We don't feel anything for her and since the house doesn't look scary at all she loves it, why? Because it is beautiful!!! Did the filmmakers notice that the house is supposed to be scary?Also Mrs.Dudley is a complete disaster. OK, so I might be a little too demanding but I think that she was the thing that told us in the first movie that "there is something wrong about this place". Her presense was cold and stiff and the way she says "in the dark... in the night" and suddenly smiles, when she's been totally numb in her face all along made me shiver. Here the way SHE says "in the dark... in the night" sounds like she's been studying the script a million times and is death tired of the line, not aware of that it is one of the most important lines in the movie.Casting Jones to play Theo was a pretty good choice, but the character is too annoying, jumping around like a schoolgirl, when she is supposed to be cool and ms.ESP as Luke so elegantly puts it in the original movie. The good thing about Luke in that classic is that he don't believe in the supernatural. Here we don't really know if he does, since Dr.Marrow don't care. He's not out to investigate the supernatural, he's out to investigate fear. Too dull to be true. Therefore the entire "Hugh Crain-story" is changed to a much more flat and un-interesting one. And as you might know the main rule about THE HAUNTING is broken. The movie is filled with over-the-top special effects, when the original's essence was that it didn't have any. Well, I guess it's the American Way.I guess they can't make a movie about a haunted house that won't contain greased effects and blood and gore, they simply just have to kill someone. I thought it was a good idea to set in two extra passangers to Hill House... until a harp-string flies off and wip her across the eye and she and the other guy drive back to the city. And Luke actually gets his head chopped off! Since when did ghosts start to kill people?Everything good about the '63 version is missing in this version. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At about the half hour mark I was thinking to myself "Ok, flimsy premise, but cool house and looks like Lili Taylor is going to anchor things with a touching, three dimensional characterization, and there are some interesting possibilities with the rest of the cast." I really was willing to give it a chance at that point. At about the 45 minute mark, I was getting a little restless, fidgeting in my seat thinking "Oookaaay, ready for some scares!" 15 minutes later, I was still waiting. 15 minutes after that, same story. 15 minutes after that I was too busy gagging at the increasingly banal dialogue and moronic situations to think much of anything. (Owen Wilson getting "trapped" in that economy car has to be one of the most hilariously suspense-LESS scenes ever filmed! Hey Owen, to get out you might want to try um, rolling the windows down?) Not too long after that, the closing credits started rolling and I vaguely recalled having sat through what must have been a motion picture of some sort. Only recently, with the aid of hypnosis have I been able to come to terms with the fact that I had just viewed something called "The Haunting", possibly the worst movie ever made - dollar for dollar.All that money, all that talent and this is the best they could come up with? A movie totally devoid of scares, chills or suspense of any kind? How ironic that much the way Liam Neeson's laughably conceived scientist character lures a group of people to a spooky mansion under the pretense of it being a study about insomnia; the folks who made this movie lured a group of people to see what was presumably supposed to be a horror movie when it was actually a cure for insomnia! Way to go Jan De Bont! He is like a failing student bluffing his way through an oral exam about a subject he knows nothing about! Because it is clear that this man has absolutely no feel for this genre, the mechanics of horror or the most basic fundamentals of story telling in general.His cast is marooned, stranded on a tiny raft swirling around in an ocean of incompetence and it's interesting, in a ghoulish sort of way, to see how each one of them deals. Lili Taylor DOES create a character and give her a soul - she's a wonderful actress and she has no choice, she can't help it, it's like a mothering instinct. But she finally goes under in the film's "climatic" moments - her stubborn professionalism capsized by a monsoon of stupidity. (Plus, her screams need a lot of work - she's like a patient opening her mouth and saying "AHHH" a little too loud.) Liam Neeson is in pain throughout - he's a good actor who's just very embarrassed. Owen Wilson is too much of a newcomer to truly understand how wretched the thing is. An offbeat presence, I think he had an inkling and spends most of his time on screen looking around for guidance that is not forthcoming. Given a paper thin character with absolutely nothing challenging to do and what could have been an interesting relationship with Taylor left totally unexplored, Catherine Zeta Jones just looks incredibly bored - like a high fashion model forced to babysit.The best word to describe this movie? HOLLOW. There's almost nothing to it. If you really want to be scared, check out the original. Now THAT was a creepy movie. There's simply no comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some scary material and an involving plot makes this one work only by a bare minimum. *** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE HAUNTING (1999) ***After viewing much of Jan de Bont 's screen credits I begin to notice a typical technique in his direction. His film's usually begin with a solid plot development and end with a spectacular denouement. Through the middle of his movies is where more of the problems come to mind. Most of the time, the characters just complicate the plot issues more, and mostly don't further the plot any. Remember "Twister" and "Speed 2?" All this holds true for most of Jan de Bont, including the new version of the Shirley Jackson horror novel, The Haunting of Hill House, called "The Haunting.""The Haunting" does work, and compared to most of the other summer horror flops out there today ("Lake Placid," "Deep Blue Sea," "The Mummy" etc.) it is a true, horror provoking gem. But the film only succeeds by a bare minimum. It is like someone passing high school with a 74% when a 74% is allowed. I liked the movie's overall production, and much of its scary material. I found myself studding the characters, trying to understand the message, struggling to figure out the plot before it is revealed to us--in other words I was very involved in Bont's storytelling, but only enough to marginally recommend.The film opens with an experimental study of sleep deprivation by the mysterious Dr. Marrow, who takes his four patients, including Theo, a bisexual, Eleanor, a woman going into debut and Luke, a comical jokester, to a massive, antique mansion in the middle of nowhere to observe. Secretly he is conduction a study of fear in which he will tell the patients scary stories only for them to fill in the rest. During one of the screenplay's bad moments, the fourth volunteer in injured by a piano string and his carried off to somewhere else, That woman as no idea how lucky she was.At night time, the patients hear things that are frightening. The gather up, and investigate, only to find nothing. The house, called Hill House, is enough to give the boldest of beings a chill, but what the characters see and hear will make you shiver.As it turns out, Hill House has a past to die for and is haunted by spirits of children who are pleading to escape from a demon who has wickedly fathered them for many, many years, and plans on doing it forever. Eleanor turns out to have more to do with this story, and discovers secrets that turn her to believe that she is a great relative of the late children's mother, who killed herself when her husband drove her crazy.Structurally, "The Haunting" is passable, but characteristically, it is greatly flawed. Movies like this the audience needs some action, beyond psychological terror, too keep them interested. The way to do this is to have a cast member be killed in the process. We like to know what were upagainst, here, and the way to do that is to see how and what is killing the it's victims. But "The Haunting" doesn't have enough characters to pick off one by one. For instance, the piano string incidence, the character hurt and taken away, before the story ever develops, going from six characters to four. And they all have big names and play important roles in the film. So, who is the house going to kill? See what we're up against, here. There aren't enough central characters for the film to have fun with, therefore all we receive is instance after instance of noises, threats and scary music.However, the film does take itself seriously and has a lot of thrills in its plot, after the first hour of plot development is over. One more thing, however. The film has earned a PG-13 rating, and while I have always made it a point never to judge a movie on it's content or rating, I have to complain about this one. I am reminded of the 1996 horror comedy called "The Frighteners" which earned an R rating for terror/violence, the same reason "The Haunting" got a PG-13. But this film is much more adult in its subject matter. Much more tense in its storytelling. And much more seriously violent than the other movie, which scored a higher rating. My point: the MPAA has goofed up again. Little kids do not need to be seeing movie about evil spirits and hell. So do not be fooled by the rating, this is not a film for the very young of age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Comparison To Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the latest version of the "Haunting" was released, all I have heard or read about is its comparison to the original Robert Wise 1963 film, and how much better the original was. I was so impressed with the current Jan De Bont remake, that I thought I would do myself a favor and rent the original.What a mistake that was! There is no comparison of the recent release of the "Haunting" to the original. While I may agree the current version could be "scarier", I have never sat through a more boring and uneventful movie than the 1963 Wise original. The interior sets looked as if they belonged in a 1950's sitcom rather than "Hill House", and the only thing frightening was that I actually wasted the money and time to watch this old and poorly made movie.The one good thing about Robert Wise's "Haunting", is that it proves that just because something is the "original" or old, doesn't mean that it's the best, and that remakes of old movies can be better than the original.</fullReview>

From the second scene the film has no flow. I don't know how anyone could have read this script and not seen how bad this film was. The main focus of the story is completely uninteresting and predictable. The story of the house and it's history is the only interesting element of the film but unfortunately we don't hear enough of that story to make it even remotely interesting. There are a few scenes with special effects which are somewhat interesting but they don't save the film. Thirty minutes before the film was to end I was ready to walk out. The plot had just completely disintegrated and the film had lost what little coherence it had.The next day we did get in to see the Blair Witch Project and it with it's tiny budget and zero special effects blow this movie away.

		<fullReview>Now, whoever thinks this hokey rubbish was "scary" musta been watching a different movie. You kidding me? Junk, junk, and more junk. Not an ounce of scare, but tons of laughs (including one that's HIGHLY unintentional). This film, in my view, is the worst of '99. I don't even have to see the other ones, cause it was SO BAD that I'm already thoroughly convinced. And what's with this script? Quite possibly the worst big budget Hollywood script ever produced. The characters are complete and utter morons. "What? Is the house really haunted?" Couldn't they have figured that out fifteen minutes into the movie? What morons. They just seem to keep ruling out the "strange events", which are stupid at best. And the only character this script even focuses on is that of Lili Taylor. The others are just a sideshow, who play no important role in moving the story along. Hell, one gets taken out of the picture in the first five minutes! What was that all about? What purpose was there for even having her there? And why the hell is Catherine Zeta-Jones's character bisexual? Totally pointless cause it holds no meaning and is just a paper-thin stereotype, which seems to be merely tacked on. And this story, boy this story, just bites the dust big time. First of all, what the hell WAS the freaking story? I don't even know cause I was too busy sleeping. Some crap about a father killing a bunch of kids or something. But that's beside the point in a "Hollywood horror film" of this caliber. You don't need plot to make moolah. Just throw in a bunch of stupid gags laid out to allegedly "scare" the audience and you got yourself a cash cow. What a horrible mess! About at the mid point, everything goes down the tubes and the script becomes uneven tripe, making no sense, managing to be extremely annoying and boring in the process. There literally IS NO POINT TO THIS STUPID MOVIE and never will be. It just wants to find an excuse to dabble in the computer animation field.And that's another thing. What the hell's so scary about computer animation? I dunno. Maybe I'll go to sleep tonight and have a nightmare about computer animated cherubs with stupid faces, saying stupid stuff that makes no sense. Yeah. Or maybe I'll have a nightmare of what Hollywood will sink to in ten years. Can it get any lower? I mean, it's already taken a moronic script and turned it into a stupid mega-budget movie that's allegedly "scary" and "entertaining", but in fact has no value whatsoever, in any field or category. I mean, come on folks! Who really talks to themselves? This Lili Taylor chick made a point to babble everything she was reading in an "eerie" way, which made me cringe, because I hate to see dialogue go to waste. Ditch it! We can freaking read already!So when you watch this, IF you watch this, make a point to laugh at Owen Wilson's "tragic" fate, and to fall asleep during the senseless dragging on of the climax, and to wonder what the hell has happen to the other three characters, and to figure out why they even bothered to attempt at a plot (the "Matrix" syndrome), and to figure out why they even made us think there was steam between two of the characters, and to try and not laugh at the computer-generated "scares", and also, the most important part, to figure out why this movie even got made. And why rubbish like this still gets made and makes money on a daily basis. I mean, if a script like this can get produced, ANYTHING can get produced. Don't say I didn't warn ya.* outta **** on my scale. Pretty high on my All Time Worst Films list. Possibly #1 on my "Listened-To-The-Audience-And-Heard-How-Many-People-Hated-It" scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the hell is wrong with these people?!?!?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the 1963 Robert Wise version of this film, which gets a lot of scares simply by having creepy noises and psychological depth. It really is a creepy, suspenseful film, and, like most good haunted house stories, you never know if there are really ghosts or if one of the characters is just cracking up. I even read the novel, of which the 1963 version is a good adaptation.As soon as I saw that Jan De Bont was doing a remake, I knew he would screw it up in the worst imaginable way. That man couldn't direct a rock to sit still. Everyone knows that. I know that. Why doesn't Dreamworks know that? I even forced my friend to watch the original so he would know how bad the new one was going to be. Jan didn't prove me wrong. The movie is just a collection of STOOOOOPID, pointless special effects (I'm sorry-- were faces in curtains EVER scary?) and even worse, they've taken a decent story and character dynamic and thrown it out, inventing their own, stupendously ridiculous story instead. It truly is incredible. And Jan De Bont has described it as a "character-driven piece." Is he PSYCHOTIC?In the original Nell is an isolated woman who has spent the past eleven years taking care of her dying mother. She is selected, along with everyone else, because they have demonstrated psychic ability. Then there's the beautiful and glamorous Theo. She and Nell develop a catty friendship, and there are all sorts of issues of jealously and attraction because Theo is so much better-looking than her. Nell is attracted to the Doctor, and seems to think she has a chance, but then his wife shows up, which totally sends her off the deep end. By the time the film ends tragically, you wonder if there were ghosts at all or Nell's inner demons finally overcame her.The new version recasts the characters PERFECTLY. I don't know if I could think of better modern equivilants to the original cast, and the characters they were supposed to be. I even had a moment of doubt, thinking this remake might actually be good. Unfortunately, the brilliant work of the casting director went totally to waste, because Jan and screenwriter (let him be named: David Self) decided that they're smarter than Shirley Jackson ever was and they'd just make up their OWN characters and story!It seems to me that if you want to remake a movie, you want to do it because you liked how it was done and think you could heighten that-- not toss it out the window. This movie replaces the suggestion of the first film with MINDLESS special effects, which are not scary for AN INSTANT. Okay, if you THINK you may have seen a face form in the curtains for an INSTANT, that MIGHT be a LITTLE BIT scary. If you THINK you may have seen a statue move, that MIGHT be scary. Not when the things are wigging out all over the place, not when every curtain has faces winking at you, not when every statue is like an Olympic gymnast. Does ANYONE (over the age of five) that that stuff is anything other than LUDICROUS?It's all kind of funny/pathetic, but there are a few prize moments (though the lines that made early screenings laugh have been taken out). 1-Nell walks into the most ornate house ever built, after spending eleven years in a two-room flat-- and DOESN'T BAT AN EYE. 2-Near the end there's a massive CG face coming down from the ceiling, with big gray arms reaching out, and Liam and Catherine walk in and pick Lili up as if absolutely nothing is happening. HaHa! There's also this unexplained steam rising in the halls. Why? Mostly the film is just sad. The actors will all move on, but I feel sorry for Jan De Bont and the screenwriter that they insist on humiliating themselves so thoroughly... and so publicly. Maybe I'll send them a card.Interestingly, this film becomes a thinly-veiled parable about... INCEST. Nell has lived alone with her mother, without a father around. She goes to the house, where there is a big, tyrannical father figure terrorizing all the kids. She finds out that he is her great-grandfather, and has a vision of herself pregnant by him. Then, in the end, she offers herself to the father figure, thus setting all of the other children free, who thank her quietly as they leave. It's not that I think the director or screenwriter had this subtext in mind, it's just that their work is so primal and base that an unconscious order happens to emerge.This movie will leave you amazed that the director and screenwriter can even dress themselves. If they can. I don't know.--- Check out my website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the scariest horror movies ever made. People to say this not a good just because it is a remake. People are narrow minded about remakes. People say the original 1963 version is better just because it is the original. The only good thing about the original this that it is a precursor to this movie. The original did have an interesting concept. A doctor takes people to an old house and tell him it is haunted as an experiment to see how they will react. And turns out the house real his haunted. It gets ruined by a week script. An awful ending. And mediocre acting. This one has the same concept and the same story line and characters. But a mush strange script and mush better acting. A mush better ending. Of course the special effects are better. Don't even bother with the 1963 original version that is just overrated cheesy and lame. Just see this one. This is of the scariest movie ever. See it. Do not lesson to people who say this is no good and the original is better. If you want to see a really scary movie you see this one. This a great movie. This movie is very intense. I do not get scared of what I do not see. I can always go for walk in the woods and not see ghosts. I jumped a few time the fist time I saw this movie in the theaters. That did not happen when I watched the lame original on TV. It happened when when I watch The original Psycho on TV. I like a good scary movie. That is way like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting Of Hill House is one of the finest ghost stories ever written. Subtle and brilliantly crafted by someone who understood the psychological underpinnings of horror, Robert Wise's original 1963 film is a largely faithful, extremely well-made and atmospheric version of the novel.And then there's this.Everything that made the novel claustrophobic, compelling, frightening, and darkly elegiac has gone, replaced by relentless Caspar The Friendly Ghost-style CGI, bad acting and an appalling screenplay which bears no resemblance to the book whatsoever, apart from using the names of the characters and the same basic situation.This awful melange of steaming horse dung is a wonderful example of the direness of a lot of modern film-making. Bereft of skillful story construction and suspense-building - in fact bereft of story construction and suspense of any kind - this is what you get when the audience gets lazy and will watch any pile of old tripe.I really can't relate how bad this film is - like Van Helsing it occupies a place all its own. The actors should be ashamed to have taken money to appear in it.Do yourself a favour, read Mrs. Jackson's book or see Robert Wise's film instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More is Less</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of both Shirley Jackson's novel and then the 1963 Robert Wise film. Whereas the Wise film subscribes to the "Less is More" school, the 1999 filming falls victim to the "More is Less" approach. Despite a promising cast, the film gives them nothing to do except wander about in absurdly grandiose CGI interiors. The CGI itself is often disappointing, caught in that lost decade when the technology was more ambitious than convincing. But worse, the terrific dialog that Jackson wrote into the book, and that Wise remained faithful to, is lost. Indeed, the story bears little resemblance to the novel, except the broad outline of the four investigators plus the Dudleys and the name of the house and its builder.While there are a couple of creepy scenes (think of the flip book), the film overall has the sensibility of a low-rent Monster House.</fullReview>

Whatever Liam Nielson was doing in this film I'll never know. Some how, this film tells the audience too much and delves into the original house owner's life. By the end of the film, the suspense caused by mystery and ignorance is completely lost, almost banished. The set itself is quite good and realistic, but I found the relationship between the characters was thin in comparison with the 1963 original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Wise's very creepy movie version of "The Haunting" was a very well done movie; watching it, you may feel like your blood is freezing. So how did Jan de Bont do remaking the movie? Ridiculous is the best word to describe it. If anything, the whole movie seems like it's trying to be funny (much of it is actually pretty laughable). Where they could play some neat tricks - or at least play with the audience - they stick in a bunch of special effects, namely the house's eyes.As for the cast, Lili Taylor, Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson are all dependable people, but they have nothing to work with here. In fact, the first two seem like the only ones suited to a horror flick. Overall, the movie looks more like an advertisement for what Catherine Zeta-Jones is wearing.So, just avoid this hunk of junk. A far better horror movie from 1999 was "The Blair Witch Project", and there are far superior movies about haunted houses. This one is laughable. Also starring Bruce Dern, Todd Field and Virginia Madsen (happy birthday!), and they probably don't wish to emphasize this flick when submitting their resumes.If I may add just one more thing, I'd say that it's an affront to all the people killed in the September 11 attacks that I have to review this crappy movie on the fifth anniversary of that fateful day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathetic Remake of a Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "The Haunting" of 1963 was a masterwork of suggestive 'Haunted House' Horror, which accomplished to deliver a creepy atmosphere and genuine scare moments without bloodshed or action, mainly through eerie settings, ingenious cinematography and sound, the psychological construction of terror, and the uncertainty of its cause. Persoonally, I am an enthusiastic fan of classic Horror, and I loathe the recent overload of superfluous Hollywood-remakes of Horror classics. "The Haunting" of 1999 is indeed one of the truly pathetic attempts of blockbuster remakes of Horror classics, which is a shame, since (as opposed to most other Horror classics) "The Haunting" could have been updated in a rewarding manner. The original is a great film, but the extremely fragile leading character (greatly played by Julie Harris) doesn't quite fit in today's picture of a female protagonist anymore. Though it could never have reached the greatness of the original, the remake could have picked up on its ingenuity and delivered a more modern, but equally haunting version of "The Haunting". Unfortunately it didn't.The mansion looks eerie and great, I'll give it that. That's about the only positive thing I can say about the remake though. And, then again, the house looked even way greater and eerier in the original, which was shot three and a half decades earlier and without CGI and other unnecessary crap. While the original ingeniously suggested terrors, the remake has to find 'causes'. In the original it was something about the mansion that was haunted and evil, in the remake they decided to simply make it an evil ghost. Instead of suggested terrors, and haunting sounds, the producers of this film just threw in a cast amount of superfluous computer effects, mainly redundant crap like moving objects or pieces of furniture that suddenly grow wooden tentacles, etc. The film has a good cast, but the modernized versions of the original characters are more than disappointing. Liam Neeson is a great actor, and I usually always appreciate Lily Tailor, who has the part of Elanor (originally played by Julie Harris) here. Catherine Zeta Jones is not a great actress, in my opinion, but one can't deny that she's hot. Her role of Theo (played by Claire Bloom in the original) is exaggerated to a seductive femme-fatale here, which is fine but doesn't really fit the story too well. I personally never liked Owen Wilson, and his moronic role here sure didn't change my mind. Not even the casting of Bruce Dern in a supporting role could save this. I found the film crappy when I saw it as a teenager in the theater in 1999, and when I recently saw it on TV again, I hated it even more. Overall, the only positive aspect is the film's decent look, but this is no excuse for ignoring everything that made the original great, and transforming its gloomy greatness into a superfluous jumble of silly CGI effects. My advice: Avoid this one and watch the great 1963 original or read the novel by Shirley Jackson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Remake Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most atmospheric and frightening films ever made was 'The Haunting', the black and white original film made in 1963. I am not easily scared by a film, and seldom twice by the same film, but the fear this one engenders is primal and eternal. I still wont watch it alone even now. It touches something deep and terrifying inside you. What a film.Then a crime was committed; it was re-made in 1999 and turned into a Hollywood joke of a film with Catherine Zita Jones and a ton of special effects. The result doesn't deserve to ever air. Its a dull self indulgent bore of a film that desecrates all that was brilliant, and everything that was scary, in the original. It's a familiar story. The Director doesn't have the skill to create narrative tension, but boy do they have a special effects budget so lets throw millions of dollars at it it and? yawn. Of course the problem with special effects is that they're not that special anymore, and the idea that you can prop up a badly made film with CGI surely doesn't apply to audiences over 18 years of age? Then there's the cast. Oh dear. This story assumes powerful and complex characterisations to develop and advance the narrative. Paper thin acting doesn't hack it no matter how glamorous or over-paid the performers may be. For my money there has to be a certain arrogance in thinking you can remake a brilliant film, so if you're going to, you'd better deliver. This is a catastrophe of ego and hubris unredeemed by vision, talent, or tension.The only frightening aspect of the film is wondering how many millions of dollars were squandered on this folly - putting the cash in a big pile in the street and setting fire to it so tramps could get warm on cold nights would have been a better use of the money. See the 1963 original, it's a fabulous and genuinely terrifying film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Idiotic Everywhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jan de Bont's puerile marijuana trip between reality and fantasy lies in a net where you can invent nonsense of "scientific experiments" and "tyrant landlords" just as an excuse to make a house come to life by moving statues in an idiotic routine. This movie also teaches a lot: 1) If you are trapped in a house where voices of children are heard, when paintings in blood are written, when doors are strangely closed: just stay a little bit more, some days more. If you die, you die. What's the problem? 2) You are doing a movie of "suspense" or "horror", just finish it by showing the credits with a merry go-round music! Anyway, children will like it. 3) If an iron statued-eagle goes crazy and decides to jump over you, fight it over with a stick. 4) When they take you a picture in the Medieval times, like the one showing Carolyne, take her kind of ten with her pointing to the fire place, even if she looks idiotic. It's a probable clue for your great grand daughter to free dead children: well that's a premise!! 5) Hugh Crain has the best haircut I've ever seen on a ghost.6) Jan de Bont has 12 years old and the writer is Rain Man. 7) Purgatory and Heaven are as easy to enter as in California. 8) If you have a companion that thinks her family is a group of dead children, take a step back.You may know; movies are not made for reality. But what is imaginary is Jan de Bont's intellectuality. The leading actress is so obnoxious in his Eleanor role that I would vote "yes" if someone proposes to exile her to Vanuatu. Catherine Zeta Jones? Owen Wilson? Acting touches rock bottom with their empty gestures. The movie gives a lot more importance to the visual stuff (like lion statues dancing) than to the importance of the script. It's an empty, very empty package. Recommendation: stay away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to say it, folks, but I've got to be honest with you...it's been six years, and I have yet to see a movie worse than this one.For the (fortunately) uninitiated, "The Haunting" is a pitiful remake of the classic 1963 horror flick. While it naturally fails to measure up to the original, the fact that it attempts to pass itself off as somehow "original" in itself lowers an otherwise typical remake to the level of utterly abysmal garbage. I had the pleasure of watching this stinker back when I was still in high school, and it has left me with a tarnished image of the horror genre ever since.I won't waste my time or yours outlining the details of the plot, but suffice to say, it's your typical haunted house story, only enhanced by a melee of "ethereal" 90's special effects. The actors, with a few notable exceptions, all deliver campy if not completely unbelievable performances, highly unmemorable whether viewed collectively or individually. The one major attempt at a "plot twist" of any kind (though "contrivance" would be more suitable) appears toward the very end, and it is laughably conveyed- presumably unintentionally- in what must surely be the cheesiest way possible.Obviously, I would advise against watching this movie under most circumstances (no, it's not even worth a rental) but if you're curious or even remotely masochistic, try to catch it on public television. It's a favorite of many broadcasters during the Halloween season, so this October, keep your eyes peeled...just make sure you don't gouge them out of their sockets in retribution.That might actually be scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unimpressive special effects extravaganza by director Jan de Bont, who once again, like "Twister," uses special effects and eerie use of sound to tell a story, while the actors engage themselves in a series of poorly constructed (and written) vignettes, which make the viewer beg for something to be scared of. Let's face it, this film had a lot to live up to. The 1963 original is regarded as a classic and one destined to be remade, with the technology used in today's films. You would think that a remake of a scary film would perhaps...be scarier than original. Me too! That's the tragedy about this film...there's nothing to be scared of. The interest and confidence in the film is lost when you have to wait over an hour for your first scare...and it is a long wait when you expect something to jump out at you, like I was expecting. The performances are okay; no one goes over the top with the little script they have to work with. Taylor is given the most screen time and does well although one may feel the acclaimed Indie actress an odd choice, for she is not a glamorous star by any means, but a damn fine actress and out of all the performances, hers is by far the most polished and impressive. Zeta-Jones is sexier than silk to look at, but the script had her doing nothing. Such a loss, for there is great talent wasted. Director DeBont did have an impressive team to work with on "The Haunting": Academy Award nominated cinematographer, Caleb Deschanel, best known for his stunning work on "The Natural," and "The Right Stuff," Three time Academy Award winning editor Michael Kahn, who was recently crowned with his third statuette for "Saving Private Ryan," and Shannon Mills and Juan Peralta for sound. The problem is, all the elements seem to be held back too much from us. We want the chills early, but sadly we have to wait and what we eventually get is still not enough. The film is nice to look at, with the house perfectly creating terror at every turn, but as for the entire film and my opinion of it, it really would have been a pleasure to have been truly scared out of my wits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is mainly lacking one essential part for an horror movie; scary moments. This movie never becomes close of being scary, mainly because the movie relies too much on its special effects rather than the story.Yes, the story really is the weakest part of the movie. I mean let's face it people, this movie is basically about nothing! The story doesn't seem to go anywhere as the movie progresses and in the ending the movie becomes more and more ridicules and implausible. The movie is truly lacking in scary moments also because the timing is just plain bad. Not once did this movie become scary or even tense.Still you have to give the movie credit for a few things. The actors are really superb. But why on Earth is the main character played by Lili Taylor, when you have a cast with Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson and even Bruce Dern? Lili Taylor is the least known actress of the cast but yet she plays the main part. Yes, I know she was kind of 'hot' in the '90's but noway near as 'hot' as Zeta-Jones at the time, who had just done "The Mask of Zorro" or Liam Neeson who just before this had done "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace" and "Rob Roy", "Michael Collins" and "Schindler's List" a few years before. Bruce Dern and also Virginia Madsen are terribly underused in this movie, I wouldn't describe their roles as anything more than just a cameo appearance.Also something that this movie deserves credit for is the look of it. Director Jan de Bont had always been inspired by Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining", also back in his days as director of cinematography. This is really notable especially in this movie. There is nothing wrong with the fine cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub, who used to be the director of cinematography of many Roland Emmerich movies and Caleb Deschanel who later dropped out due to creative differences. That's mildly put, Jan de Bont basically is a pain to work with for cinematographers because de Bont used to be a cinematographer himself for years. Cinematographer Don Burgess already also had left the set after 'differences' with de Bont during the filming of "Twister". The editing however is bad, I can't believe that it was Michael Kahn who worked on this movie!Persons who will be fairly entertained by this movie are the fans of special effects. There are some nicely made effects, which however are not scary and suitable for an horror movie of this type.It's not a completely unwatchable movie but still a weak and un-scary movie that most certainly is not recommendable. Not even to the fans of the genre.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

I don't know what he tried to make, but he must have failed miserably.Liam Neeson started out as charismatic as ever, but ends up as demotivated and lost as the rest of the movie and cast. Owen Wilson is always good, but not here. Nothing is good in this movie, except for some of the decorations in the "haunted" house. Which seems to be haunted more by an awful crew and some pretty misplaced SFX, than by something creepy. I didn't jump in my seat once. It didn't even startle me. Not even Catherine Zeta Jones managed to thrill me, and she was a blast in The Mask Of Zorro (and in Entrapment). I gave this movie one star, and it got that one star only because I couldn't give it any less. If you see this movie, you'll waste almost two hours of your life. You'll never get them back.

		<shortDescription>How to callously slaughter a great movie and an even greater novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the bits that work: the house, both externally and internally (where it is a miracle of pseudo-Gothic design). Now, the bits that don't work: every other aspect of the film.My only conclusion can be that Jan de Bont doesn't understand the first thing about horror. It's clearly a forlorn hope that he has even an inkling of the subtle psychological nuances that made the original novel and the very effective movie version of 1963 such benchmarks in the genre, but on this showing he doesn't even understand basic horror, preferring to plunge his viewers into the breathtaking but ultimately brief world of visual roller-coaster rides rather than exposing them to the sort of deep-rooted primal fears that will linger long after the projector has stopped running.I'm sad to say it, but almost every decision he made in this very unwise remake of a movie classic appears to have been the wrong one.Whereas in the original we wandered nervously through a shadowy world of eerie statues, patterns in paper, pounding doors and unhinged minds, here we watch bored as monsters emerge from fireplaces, big faces appear in ceilings and beds come to life in order to eat the people who are sleeping in them. Whereas in 1963 only one character was really haunted, and even then we weren't entirely sure that she wasn't responsible for it herself, in 1999 the entire cast are subjected to a procession of overblown CGI horrors, many of which border on the totally silly.This movie lacks any sense of mystery or suspense. Within a few minutes there's no question in our minds (even if there still is in the ultra-dumb characters' minds) that a malevolent and very real supernatural force is at work here. Instead of trying to work out whether we're dealing with psychological aberrations or something more sinister, we're very quickly trying to find out who the spirits are and why they're here, which while it might be diverting enough for a family audience watching a Disney ghost movie, is no challenge for hard-core adult viewers who are here to be spooked. I don't wish to keep harping on with this comparison, but despite the presence of accomplished actors, the performances here are a million miles from those tautly realised characters in the 1963 movie. Liam Neeson sleepwalks through his part, on occasion playing it for laughs, on others looking mildly tense and worried, but never even hinting at the depths of deviousness a person would require to entrap all these people in such a dangerous place. Catherine Zeta-Jones is slinky and sexy and pretty, and completely superficial and shallow ? a very pale imitation of Claire Bloom back in '63, whose ice-cool cat woman (and lesbian) was the last word in independent-minded womanhood. Owen Wilson, not yet a star at this stage, tries the hardest to give a 'real performance', but only succeeds in creating a twitching, irritating oddball, whose very presence is a distraction from the main story. As for Lili Taylor, who has the pivotal role of Eleanor Lance, suffice to say that it's not entirely her fault. The film's makers clearly decided beforehand that their Eleanor would be a self-sacrificing heroine, rather than the main victim (and possible cause) of the Hill House horrors. Therefore Taylor can't be blamed for making her character an innocent lamb, deeply abused and neglected, but then rising fearlessly to the challenge and eventually giving it everything she's got in the embarrassing finale, when all the tortured souls are rescued and go to Heaven ? which, to say the least, is missing the point of the entire story, though by this time of course, any semblance to either of the original two masterpieces is long forgotten, so it probably doesn't matter anyway.But these issues of movie taste aside, considering they spent $80 million on this, it's all such a porridge. In technical terms alone there are quirks galore. Two characters, one of whom never even speaks, arrive with the team early on and a very short while later leave again, having served no purpose whatsoever. By the same baffling token, the screenwriters would have us believe that eminent psychologist Neeson has deliberately lured a bunch of people with sleeping disorders to this house, where he confidently expects them to be terrified out of their wits and plans to study their reactions, and that he expects to get away with it (have these guys never heard of malpractice suits?). In another scene, utterly ludicrously, Neeson is grabbed by a gigantic bronze hand, which comes to life for no apparent reason, and dunked in a stagnant pond ? only to walk calmly away afterwards and get on with his weekend as if nothing has happened. To me, that latter incident underlines this movie's main weakness ? it treats its audience like a bunch of imbeciles. We queued up to watch it in order to be scared ? at least as much as we were by the original, if not more so given the larger budget this time around. We didn't come to be wowed by a plethora of special effects, which at the end of the day have become fairly routine in modern movies. A clunking travesty, which sums up so much of what's wrong in Hollywood these days: "Forget the vacuous script and dud performances. Just pack it with snazzy FX and the popcorn crowd will be satisfied."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is awful compared to the version from 1963. I don't have any other words for it.I saw the original movie on TV. The remake was some months later broad casted.In the original movie you do not see any ghost, no blood, no injuries, ... Nothing. The creepy feeling it gives you is physiological: is it really there or is it just imagination? The film is shot in such a way it overwhelms you. In many scenes (eg where Eleanore is running in the house) you always have the feeling that something scary is going to happen or pop up but nothing happens (except the scene where with the stair where Grace Markway opens a door - it scared me btw). Globally, there is not much physical "horror". But it is made so well it gives you the creeps. I went to bed afterwards and I could hardly sleep from all the noises I heard. (The noises are most probably always there at night, but you don't spend attention to it). It took me days before I could put the movie out of my head. What actually happens in that house. It does not give you an answer. To me, the movie has an open ending. The only negative is the slow start and the voice-overs (there are too many). I rate this version 9/10.This remake is the opposite. It is not much physiological, but all physical: you actually see the ghost, the things that happen do effectively happen. It does not give you the constant feeling something scary is going to happen. The scene with the stair is miserable. None of the horror-things in the movie (eg the bed that locks up Eleanore) gave me a creepy feeling. The film has no open ending (the ghost is chased off) except what's going to happen with the soul of Eleanore. This film must have it from the special effects. It does not scare you much during the movie nor afterwards.If you want to rent/buy "The haunting" please be sure you have the version from 1963 and not the waster from 1999.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on TV, and I thought it sucked. I've never saw the haunting that was made in 1963, but it has to be better than this. I did not like the actors in the movie at all. I'm glad I did not waste my money buying this movie, its not even worth renting. I would rent the shining(1980)instead, scary, worth your money, and a lot cheaper. If you really want to see it rent it but if I were you I would just want till it comes on TV again. I have to say the mansion looks amazing, thats the only good thing about this movie. And I did not find this movie scary, so if your'll looking for a good scary do not watch this, like I said I would watch the shining. I give the haunting 1 out of 10. Do not watch it, it sucks.</fullReview>

(i still insist that insidious's backing track is the best) ; a different cgi. the ghosts were lacking. the one in the bed? in that big Gothic house, they could have done much better i see what this film could have been. Though it is a okay movie to watch, there is always something lacking.i like all of the actors in this apart from Owen Wilson. there is always an actor i do not like. so i think that is why i stuck to it watch Mullholland drive and Edward scissor hands and see if you agree with me. think of Eleanor's (nells) character as being in a Betty(Mullholland drive) type story with the Gothic charm of Tim Burton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Simple Recommendation for this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolute abominable film. Shirley Jackson is surely turning in her grave. Nothing in this film saves it. The acting is wooden and even cheesy. Not even Lili Taylor can save it. Neeson and Zeta-Jones are both horrible. The characterizations are universally incorrect and contrary to the those in Jackson's novel. Likewise, the explicit violence and CGI ghosts, nothing of the likes of which occurs in either the book or the previous version of the film. Watching this film, I wanted to scream, not out of fear, but out of anger of how anybody could so thoroughly ruin what I consider one of the horror classics of all time.In more simple terms, "The Haunting (1999)" ought to be burned down and the ground sowed with salt. ;-)Instead, rent Robert Wise's intelligent, well-acted, and accurate 1963 version. Or, better yet, get Shirley Jackson's book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a travesty of the scary original. Here, the original story of Hill House is elaborated on, but not in a believable way. They thought they were improving on it? This film not so much remakes the original plot as rips it off. The big draw, they thought, were the special effects. At times, the special effects are so cartoon-like, I scoffed at them and was never scared by them. The haunted house in this question resembles a cathedral more than anything else, and the original owner is turned into an industrial magnate. There's added plots of his marriages and a bunch of trapped children, which is suppose to tug at our heart strings. Yeah, right. It's a surprise that some good actors were lured into starring in this, which did nothing to help their careers. Catherine Zeta-Jones is very well-cast, but was defeated by the lousy script and ridiculous visuals. I hope she and her co-stars were paid well for this waste of their time, not to mention the audiences. Hollywood needs to learn to leave well enough alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simplification of the original story, with overreaching special effects...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Handsome, but too-literal reworking of the 1963 thriller drains all the mystery from the haunted house scenario. Story about a group of insomniacs who are invited by a psychologist to a spooky, isolated castle for "sleep therapy" required a much tougher intrinsic approach; here, Jan de Bont is mostly interested in a visual showdown. His revision of the original Robert Wise-directed film, from Shirley Jackson's novel "The Haunting of Hill House", often borders on outlandish camp. There are so many swooping-crane camera shots of Lili Taylor standing in front of a wind machine, and so much rattling chains nonsense, the narrative about youthful spirits being held captive is rendered rather ridiculous. As a director, de Bont is terrific at making the characters colorful and relatable for a mass audience (something that Robert Wise had trouble with in 1963), yet everyone is a bit too perky--and the dialogue too comically jaded--for the scares to take hold. There are good sequences: Taylor finding peace in a hidden room, a book of eerie photographs that unlock a secret. But de Bont's infatuation with moving statuary becomes a running joke, and puzzling moments like a stairway collapsing or spirits moving about in Lili Taylor's hair are pointless and absurd. The actors do what they can, but with a project so overloaded with full-throttle effects, they're task is mostly in not looking silly; they succeed about half the time. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

It started intriguingly, and it was quite obvious she would be an important part to the film. The film slowly went down hill, with it's awful attempt to be 'sexy', the acting was not brilliant, which was surprising, which added to the uncomfortableness of the film. With the story in place i thought it would have a good ending, but it was one that i saw coming and was dull. I would not recommend this to anyone. I love all types of film, but this 'thriller' was dreadful. I'll give it a 2 due to the actors who i felt made the film more watchable, i would of turned it off if it was anyone else due to me being a fan of Liam Neeson. Not at their best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Visuals And Atmosphere, But Pretty Bad In Comparison With The Original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Haunting" is a so-so remake of the horror classic. The plot is the same as the original for the most part, a quiet woman named Eleanor (Lilli Taylor) goes to an old mansion called Hill House to take part of an insomnia study for those who suffer from the disorder. There she meets the flamboyant Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Luke (Owen Wilson), a quirky baseball player, whom are both insomniacs. And there is Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson), who is conducting the study. Eleanor seems to have a strange bond with the house and begins hearing voices and seeing small children in her bedroom at night while she is sleeping, and learns of the dark past of Hill House, involving the man who built the home, Hugh Crane. Things then begin to turn violent, and the house literally comes to life, trying to kill anyone who is inside.When you compare the 1963 film with this, this remake seems like mediocre trash, because the original film is a horror masterpiece. This film, while nowhere close to the original, is still a decent little horror movie anyway, but you have to dismiss knowledge of the original, otherwise you'll more than likely hate it. This remake relies more on special effects rather than the shadowy atmosphere that the original had, but it still has a pretty effective atmosphere. In this film, the house is much more menacing and has a unique and very macabre style. The doors throughout the entire house are about fifteen feet high, and each of the rooms are very large, with vaulted ceilings and a Gothic tone to them. The entire house itself is really amazing actually, they did a pretty good job at creating a one-of-a-kind home to set the story in. The CGI visuals are impressive and look pretty neat, but they add a feeling of cheapness to the movie that I felt could have been done without. I wish this film would have fashioned the style that made the original so scary - that menacing, subtle, and shadowy eeriness. But the filmmakers opted for the in-your-face computer animation to get some jolts out of the audience, and I wasn't all too happy with that. The acting isn't bad, everyone turned in good performances and I didn't feel anything was overplayed or underplayed. There are a few good shock scenes and some spooky things that occur, but the film isn't anything really too scary.While the original film is miles better than this, "The Haunting" remake is still a decent little haunted house movie that is entertaining and enjoyable enough to watch. Don't expect anything better or even close the original, because it would be nearly impossible to top Robert Wise's classic. If you don't mind some cheesy haunted house fun though, there's worse ways to waste a couple of hours. 5/10.</fullReview>

A guy who kills children and the children's souls become planted into the house is just stupid! Not to mention the fact that this movie wasn't scary at all. I hated it and I don't recommend it to anyone. It couldn't scare a retard. And if it did then wow the director actually achieved something! A pretty big step to me. But honestly folks if you want a better haunted house movie watch "Rose Red" which is much more scarier than this so called "horror" film.Hated it. It sucked. Don't watch it.</fullReview>

She always plays these off-the-wall characters so you never forget her; well, I don't anyway. She was awesome in "Say Anything" with John Cusack also. She played one of his best friends. The Haunting did have pretty good special effects but was not really what I would call an edge-of-your-seat flick. This wasn't the best performances by Neeson, Jones, or Wilson. In fact, I thought Wilson's character was pretty lame. Sorry Wilson fans...truth hurts. Marian Seldes who played Mrs. Dudley was exceptional! Even thought she did not have a huge part in the movie, I thought she really added to it. I'm going to be looking her up in other movies as she was fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the worst films I have ever seen. There's absolutely no hope for 'The Haunting.' The acting was ridiculous, the plot was a joke and the overdoing of the special effects made me less than satisfied with this so-called horror movie.Just one question: Where's the horror? Now I can see that a film may be bad if the plot is bad, but this film didn't even have a plot. The beginning was so slow that I almost fell asleep. The rest of the movie was terribly dull with the possibility of an interesting scene here and there but then the ending put the film right back into a deep hole. The movie wasn't scary. There wasn't a single scary second in the entire film. One thing that annoys me to no end is the use of special effects when they don't need to be used. What happened to the good old movies where creaks and loud noises would make the audience jump? Now it's all computerized scenes that are supposed to scare the movie goers. The animation used in 'The Haunting' made it look like a silly, cheap cartoon. You have big hands coming out of doors, creatures crawling around underneath the sheets and skeletons that start to move about. Why did they have to do any of this? The acting was beyond terrible. First, these roles seem to be designed for younger people, perhaps teenagers. Instead, they have grown men and women running around delivering lines that make no sense at all as well as men and women who can't act period. When casting, they must have been at the bottom of the barrel. Lily Taylor's acting is awful and her character is poorly designed. As much as she would like to, Taylor just can't perform drama. Owen Wilson wasn't all that bad but it seemed as if the movie would have been the same even without his character. His character really didn't have a point and he too just couldn't deliver the acting that was needed for a good movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones was laughable. Even she couldn't revive this garbage called a movie. Her acting was of the better but her character also didn't fit into the story line. She acted as if she were a little girl prancing around in all sorts of silly outfits. Compared to Michael, she may be young, but she's not as young as she tried to act. The ending was dumb and was over too quickly. The movie could have been edited down to half of the air time and would have covered the same amount of info. that was covered in the whole 112 minutes that was shown.'The Haunting' was nothing but a watery horror flick, scratch that out, an animated movie that wouldn't even hold the attention of a child. Bad acting, too many special effects and poor writing is what ruined this movie. The studio needed a...plot in order for this whole Thriller/Mystery thing to work out. The thing that really sickens me is that this film had an $80 million budget. Don't get suckered into watching this.</fullReview>

Given the choice between having my toenails pulled out with pliers, and watching "The Haunting," I'd have to flip a coin. It is badly written, badly acted, and horribly directed by a man who should really go back to dropping cars from the sky (Speed, Twister).This is a B-Movie not at all disguised as a high-budget piece of trash. I'm sure I've seen the exact same script, with a budget of fifty bucks, starring 2 ugly guys and 2 Playboy Playmates who walk around topless the entire movie. The premise makes no sense, the motivations of the characters make LESS sense, every character is present or absent from scenes at random, based on who showed up to work that day. The ending makes no sense either-- the characters who die, die for no reason at all, other than it makes for another stupid, extremely expensive special effect.This movie works on NO level and I fail to see how any sane human being could find a single enjoyable thing about it. "House on Haunted Hill" was scary. This is a skinflick with all the skin edited out, it's about as scary as a walk to your mailbox. 1/10, *ONLY* because this website won't let me vote any lower.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The saying "less is more" worked very well for the 1963 original film. If you want to see a good, genuinely scary ghost story, see the original. If you want to see how much FX stuff tinseltown can throw into a ghost movie, see this. Like STAR WARS I: THE PHANTOM MENACE, this film has lots of razzle-dazzle, but little story. The remake relies on every ghost story cliché (groaning doors, cold winds, phantom noises, visions) done with the all the latest FX. But the original bw film created mood, atmosphere, and suspense much more effectively with fewer, not greater, FX and with characters who actually developed a plot. Since TITANIC, the rule seems to be FX. Too bad that plot and character get buried. "Some houses are born bad" says the film's ad. I didn't know houses were born. But movies are -- and the ad could just as well say, "Some films are born bad." This one is an example. To pick up on a few lines in the film, I'd conclude that the movie can be described this way -- Charles Foster Kane meets Charles Addams in the FX department late at night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing a trailer to the original movie of this. I find this remake is insulting to the original and the great Robert Wise. The story is too Disneyish, that idiot Jan de Bont thinks he can do good but make things crap. The CGI is cartoon, Liam Neleson is really bad in this (and this goes as one of his worst performances next the Clash of the Titans remake), Owen Willson is so annoying that he makes you castrate yourself and this whole power of love thing is getting tired and makes me angry. And to make things bad, the great Steven Spielberg who was influenced by Robert Wise had involvement in it. But lucky after this abomination, he announced that he will never work with Jan de Bont forever and has the same thing as George Lucas has with the Star Wars Holiday Special which is prevented this film to be released on Blu-ray and it's a good thing Spielberg had his named uncredited in this awful movie. Which means that Steven Spielberg is the guy who said that The Lost World and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is okay, while this remake is the project is the thing that he is personally ashamed of. Let me repeat that again. The Lost World and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull: okay. The remake of The Haunting: Personally ashamed of. My advice see the original Haunting it is more better, it has a good ghost story, great Psychology horror, has better character development and has no cartoon CGI, annoying characters, and stupid Disney good vs evil story in which piece of garbage has and should never be on DVD or Blu- ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was unlucky enough to be curious enough to see this film. At first glance at the trailer, it appears to be a sort of supernatural horror thriller movie, only to be sorely disappointed.The general storyline. Woman gets a phone call suggesting she sign up for an experiment in an old house. She meets a couple of other people (who seem to randomly vanish from the plot later without word of explanation) to take part in the experiment. Shortly after, strange things happen in the house, and things go further downhill (for the unfortunate audience).I first started to get suspicious when I saw the figures appearing via bedsheets, and somehow the main character doesn't find this remotely odd or scary. Later on, the house ups the ante, and I can't be bothered to further illustrate other than that the so called 'scares' are brought about by special effects (and not remotely scary), acting from all the cast is poor beyond belief - especially Lilli whats-her-face shouting 'you shall not harm a child' for no understandable reason whatsoever, and the climax seems to occur via something that wouldn't look out of place on scooby doo. All in all, I found myself inexplicably wondering why I hadn't wasted by time with a far superiour pile of cr*p. Like Freddie Got Fingered.Go and see paranormal activity instead. It is far superior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They might as well have called this movie "The Crapping". That's pretty much what they did to Shirley Jackson's book. They took a great story, hacked it down to its bare bones, and rebuilt it Scotch tape and gum. It's just so flimsy. All the actors are capable of giving good performances, the problem is rotten material.The filmmakers clearly underestimated their audience. They took out the story and replaced it with meaningless special effects. I've never heard of a haunted house with moving woodwork. The only real similarities with the book are some character names, and the name of the house. They changed the reason these people are even at the house. They added extra characters (but took them out suddenly, then we never hear from them). They killed one character that shouldn't have died. But maybe that was a good thing. He was likable in the book, but not here. The list goes on and on. All of it pointless. Just watch the Robert Wise version. It's much better and it treats the book with respect.Bottom line: Hear that sound? It's the sound of Shirley Jackson turning in her grave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to say this is the worst movie ever because I haven't seen every movie in existence, but so far, I have never seen such a horrible movie. The acting is awful. Lili Taylor would not pass as a good actress in an elementary school play. I can't even believe somebody would pay her to act. The script is just plain terrible. All of the characters are completely cliché. The special effects are laughably cheesy. The plot is almost as bad as the acting (and no I have not read the book).In summary, do not watch this movie. Don't even think about watching it. It is slow torture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was this movie trying to achieve?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Haunting' is a very odd, unsatisfying movie. An action director tries to make a "personal discovery" story disguised as a horror movie(?). Or something like that. I really can't tell just what this movie was aiming for but as a spooky ghost tale it fails to chill and thrill, and as a "real" drama it doesn't hold your interest. Lili Taylor is a terrific actress who I have liked since 'Mystic Pizza' days, but I would put this in the gotta-pay-the-bills category (see also 'Ransom'), rather than her more interesting and substantial work in movies such as 'I Shot Andy Warhol', 'Dogfight', 'Short Cuts' and 'The Addiction'. I also have a lot of time for Owen Wilson ('Bottle Rocket', 'Permanent Midnight') but he's just doing a by-the-numbers performance here with little to recommend it. I've seen lots of movies that are much worse than 'The Haunting', but when that is the most positive thing I can come up with to say about a film you know you are watching mediocrity in action. Big budget mediocrity with silly special effects, a pointless Bruce Dern cameo and a weak ending to boot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Calling all suckers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the original "The Haunting", starring Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. It was a good movie but I don't exactly call it a horror classic. I don't get scared by haunted house stories too easily. I need more than that, like DeNiro attacking my houseboat or the Devil possessing my daughter.The actors had fun making it, I hope, cause I doubt anyone watching had much fun at all. Taylor must get special mention for saying all her silly dialogue at the end with a straight face. That is acting at its most challenging, if you ask me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I promised myself that the next time I wrote about a Dreamworks film I'd mention how much I loathe their logo. I now have the perfect opportunity. We all know, in this case, that the film following the logo is bad: you don't need me to tell you THAT.Jesus! how could they come up with something so awful? Universal's globe (it looked great in the 1960s), MGM's lion, Columbia's torch-bearing lady (especially the older version, with the prism effect), J. Arthur Rank's gong, the Archers' target (my personal favourite), the Twentieth Century Fox monolith, Disney's castle, RKO's radio tower, even, perhaps, Paramount's unremarkable mountain ... all of these had class, some of them had poetry, some a decent fanfare. Dreamworks gives us an ill-composed image of a small child (aw, how cute) fishing (aw, how cute) from a crescent moon (aw, how cute), surrounded by smudges of blue fairy-floss (aw, how cute - gag, choke), complete with tinkly music.The very name - "Dreamworks" - annoys me. Schoolteachers, after telling small children the difference between "its", the possessive, and "it's", the contraction, should caution them to NEVER use the word "dream" to refer to anything other than those odd things we experience when we're asleep. It's an insult to works of fiction to call them, or compare them to, dreams. (People also use the word "dream" as if it were synonymous with "desire", as if the word "desire" were too crude. I disapprove of this, too.) But I if Geffen, Katzenberg and Spielberg want to suggest that they're in the business of producing dull, slap-dash, rambling works of fiction - or perhaps by "dreams" they mean naked wish-fulfilment -, that's their affair.Anyway, about the film. To be honest, I don't care of a film, any film, if it scares me or not. ("Creepshow 2", of all things, frightened me, while "The Shining" didn't; I certainly shouldn't conclude that the former is a better film than the latter.) The problem with the cartoony, computer-generated ghosts is not that they're not frightening, nor even that they don't look real (what would real ghosts look like?); rather, they make one think, "If there WERE ghosts, and they DID look like that, what would be so great about them?" The story flops hither and yon in a confused daze, the group dynamics ditto (every so often you can hear Jan de Bont saying, "Ah, to hell with all this character stuff"), and Owen Wilson plays the kind of person who would try to repair a broken television set by pulling it and sticking his head in, while the power's on. Very bad, but at least it's not boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worn out plot with better special effects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many times have we seen a group of people lured into staying the night in the haunted Hill House? Liam Neeson plays a doctor seeking individuals with sleeping disorders. The participants have to deal with terror and the fear of dying. How can you sleep when visions come out of the drapes?Neeson alone can't save this one. Catherine Zeta-Jones is absolutely ravishing. Equally impressive is the visual and sound effects. This movie had the room and the chances to be real scary, but it just laid there. I was begging for something to make me jump. Not this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: may contain some spoilers.But this film has been spoiled. This film was terrible. I was so looking forward to The Haunting. But once again film makers forget what is so obvious to the rest of us, that it is disgusting and repulsive, and that is the fact that very few people know how to make a terrifying film. Very few people understand the craft and skill behind it. Because I can honestly count on two hands the films that scared me, or at least left me filled with tension. So in the history of film there has been about 1000 horror movies made and I have probably seen about 3/4 of them, how come only ten or so can truly scare? The reason is because most film makers know that a scary film has to have atmoshphere, tension, a good script, perhaps music, lighting or lack thereof ( Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Blair Witch Project ) and a director who knows how to use the camera so that it uses us. The Haunting has none of that. The Haunting is filled with lots of loud noises, a non scary entity that shows itself at the end of the film, possessed statues, sheets that move by themselves and every other trick that should make a film like this good. But what it needs it better camera work, even a little bit of tension and hey, how about a scare or two. The Haunting contains none of that. This is one of the biggest disappointments of the summer. So here is my advice to Jan DeBont. Whoever directed the trailer, get some pointers from them. And get Linda Hunt to do some voice over work for the film as well, she had me glued to my seat with anticipation in the trailer ( these are its eyes ). It's funny too, because Jan De Bont was a DP before he hit it big with Speed. And one of the films that he was DP for was Cujo. Now Cujo was a good horror film, not the best, but pretty good. It's too bad that he couldn't learn from someone even like Lewis Teague, because any effort besides this one would have been better. This is a disgrace to horror films and even as a film itself it is terrible. You want to be scared this summer? Go see Blair Witch and Sixth Sense. You want to waste two hours? Go see The Haunting!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy try but the effects wreck any atmosphere that it may have had</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the false pretence of doing a research study on insomnia, Dr Marrow invites a group to stay at Hill House with him. However he is actually planning to study their fear responses in a creepy situation. The group comes together but it is not long before the bumbs in the night are not attributable to Dr Marrow and one of the group, Nell, begins to act strangely and show a bit too much of an infinity with the house and hidden history is revealed.At the time, big worthy horror movies were all the rage ? Blair Witch had proved that there was money in films that went for creeps instead of relying on gore and effects. This film set out to `recapture the mood of the original story without resorting to effects'. However it doesn't manage to do that. The plot is the traditional `group in deserted house' set-up and does just what you expect it to do. It does do it very slowly mind you and the first hour is a bit of a drag. The second hour is a bit more pacey but it is based on effects shots that are not scary in any way.The cast is good on paper and works pretty well despite the lack of atmosphere. The effects really take away from any creepy mood that exists briefly in the early stages of the movie. Tomlin is pretty good in the lead and just manages to avoid being hammy. Neeson is very wooden and never really gets into the film. Wilson does, well, just what he does in every role and is amusing when he is allowed to be. Jones is quite good as a bi-sexual vamp (gets the male part of the audience in I guess) while Dern is a surprising cameo despite his low screen time.Overall this film is just about passable but it is really quite dull for the most part. The effects are quite impressive in a way but they completely suck the mood out of the film and leave it lacking any real creepy atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Big Tease</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There`s an old saying that you can fool all the people some of the time and THE HAUNTING proves this . You can just imagine the producers walking down to the marketing department and saying " Remember to publicise the fact that Miss Zeta - Jones plays a bisexual and she`s stuck in a haunted house with a man and a woman " . It`s no coincidence that when this was released that every reviewer made the point that Catherine Zeta - Jones plays a bisexual who`s stuck in a haunted house with a man and a woman . In fact there couldn`t be a single red blooded man who stood outside a cinema in the pouring rain waiting to see THE HAUNTING who wasn`t aware Miss Zeta - Jones plays a bisexual stuck in a haunted house with a man and a woman . Only problem is that the audience only finds out Miss Zeta - Jones character is bisexual is because she says so in one throwaway line and her sexuality is never followed up . She could be a celibate for all we know but no doubt a film where Catherine Zeta - Jones plays a celibate is a lot more difficult to market than one where she`s bisexual .That`s one good reason not to watch THE HAUNTING . Another good reason is the fact that becomes very obvious is the script was written around the tedious FX . The whole film degenerates into crap CGI and morphing effects which you`ve seen before in a hundred other - better - films.Note to Hollywood producers : Never EVER call bisexual or celibate characters Theo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>House &amp; Sound Highlight Otherwise-Horrible Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At least up to when this came out in 1999, this was the most awesome-looking inside of a house I've ever seen on film. The sets (the mansion), the powerful and dramatic bass noise and the great special special effects were all a lot of fun to watch and hear.That's the good news. The bad news is that the story is stupid, the picture too reddish at times, and Catherine Zeta-Jones' character saying "God" as an explanation over 20 times was very annoying, just to give one example.If I can mute out Jones and ignore some of the other characters, this might be a movie to re-consider purchasing because of that awesome house and room- rocking sound effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always wondered which haunted house film was spoofed in Scary Movie 2, and renamed Hell House, now I know, and I can definitely see why it should be spoofed. From the director of Speed, Jan De Bont, it is a remake of the 1963 film, where a bunch of people are placed in the isolated house to study sleep disorders and problems, and obviously it turns out to be to find ghosts. Basically Eleanor 'Nell' Vance (Ransom's Lili Taylor) is called to meet with Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) and three other people at Hill House for a research stay. The people that look after the house, Mr. Dudley (Bruce Dern, Laura Dern's Dad) and Mrs. Dudley (Home Alone 3's Marian Seldes) say that no-one will be around and no-one can hear them, duh! These other three people, Theo (not renamed in SM2, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones), Luke Sanderson (Owen Wilson) and that one that gets her eye slashed, obviously settle better, but as more and more bizarre and spooky things happen in the house, mostly to Nell, she finds out the secrets behind the previous people of the house, including Hugh Crane, his wife and their children they never had. I really liked all the sequences that are memorably spoofed in SM2, e.g. the door knocker, the ghost crawling in the bed, Crane on the stairs, and if you have the SM2 DVD, the deleted scene with more than just eye slashing. Okay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the really crappy movies out there like Suspira, Last House on the Left, the Last Man on Earth, and the Blair Witch Project, I just don't understand why everyone tore this movie apart so bad.I do understand that it was a remake of a widely admired classic, but to tell you the truth, I don't think I knew a single person who had even seen the original to this until this was released. Now, everyone I know has seen the original. So even the haters in the world should understand the power of this remake. There are horrible movies out there. Why dog this one? It was fun. It was scary in places. It had a good, tense feeling all the way through, and I completely enjoyed it. And yes. I saw the original, but I still like this one better. It was scary AND fun. Who cares about some stupid old black and white movie, anyway? The original is a 4/10. The remake (this movie) is a 9/10.</fullReview>
