		<fullReview>THE HAUNTING(1963) is an important horror film because it is one of a tiny handful of films within the tradition that genuinely unsettle the viewer. Are the events at Hill House for real, or are they happening on the inside of Eleanor Lance's head? The author of the novel upon which this movie was based, Shirley Jackson, left us to wonder at the end of her story. A constant theme in Jackson's work was the displacement and the destruction of the hopes of women (Most of her work was written in the 1940s and 1950s).  Jackson, in her own intriguingly artful manner, asks us in The Haunting of Hill House to contemplate the domestic prison that many women like Eleanor Lance found themselves in. Eleanor is a spinster, the slightly dotty older sister compelled by restrictive family relationships to care for an ailing mother. She's been nowhere, she has had no experiences, and she barely has social skills. Like anyone else, she wants love, intimacy, friendship, and she doesn't know how to seek them. Naturally, she operates from a place of low-key fury. Julie Harris conveys this so successfully in the film that she actually bounces the viewer between feelings of empathy and feelings of exhaustion. "Why doesn't she make up her mind to go or stay?", we ask ourselves. Eleanor isn't an attractive person, and Julie Harris plays this to the "t". THE HAUNTING explores Jackson's extended metaphor of feminine anger damn near as skillfully as the author presented it on the page. Certainly whatever "walks alone at Hill House" is not such a distant cousin from the Corn Goddess, or other archetypal representations of the understandable rage of women whose lives have been restricted by domestic roles. But how much of it genuinely resonates from that house with its "doors that stay sensibly shut", and how much of it is between the ears of Eleanor Lance, who, even in a crowd, is walking alone, just as is whatever is in Hill House? In creating this book, Shirley Jackson was able to breach the same territory the 19th century feminist Charlotte Perkins Gilman explored in her remarkable story The Yellow Wallpaper. And it is no small thing that the cast of The Haunting- Julie Harris and Claire Bloom foremost- were able to recreate on the screen and do this complex novel such justice. Director Robert Wise, who fifteen years before gave us the Val Lewton masterpiece THE BODYSNATCHER, labored diligently to establish the same stifling atmosphere found in that earlier film. Patterns in wallpaper that vibrate with voice, doors that breathe, and that steady, horrific hammering on the walls that chills as certainly as did Jackson's description in the book itself.  Certainly Rus Tamblyn and Richard Johnson do more than pull their weight in this piece, and it couldn't have been easy to play second line to talents like Harris and Bloom. The cast, the direction, the set, everything works in this movie, a remarkable work of harmonic convergence on celluloid. THE HAUNTING is an important film to see because it does what horror films rarely do, it freely explores the internal and takes us all along, and babies, we ain't laughing. But it works. And that's more than can be said for three quarters of the over-hyped movie offerings in the horror tradition. Among U.S. horror films of the 1960s, only PSYCHO and ROSEMARY'S BABY touch so boldly on the unspoken terror in the horror film:a common fear among our spieces that we may be unworthy of love. Are we talking frightening now?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only movie that truly frightened me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching "The Haunting" 1963, I slept with my hands under the covers for 3 weeks. I was alone in the house, very late at night. Every sound amplified.. I was a full grown woman. For Pete's sake, I have watched almost every monster movie made. Even the original "Wolfman." Hummm, I could handle this. Wrong! I have never been so frightened in my life. Who or What was holding her hand??... The door at the top of the spiral stair almost gave me a stroke. This movie made a believer out of me. The sound effects, the lighting, the "breathing door", plus the fact it was Black and White.. The house, well don't ask me to attend a dinner party there. You will be eating alone. Perfect movie for Halloween.I give this movie a "10", The "remake" ?? Was that from the same book?Nuff Said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forty one years after its release, this movie is still frightening.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ABC broadcast this film as a Sunday Night Movie in, I believe, 1965. I watched it with my best friend at his house, which happened to be next door. After the movie was over I was afraid to walk home. Thirty eight years later, this movie is still the scariest movie I've ever seen.It's hard to put into words why this movie triggers such an emotional response. There is no blood and gore, no creatures or monsters in plain sight. In fact, there is very little physical presence in this movie that should evoke such a fear reaction. True, there are multiple angle exterior shots of the mansion that make one feel as if the house is watching them all the time. And there are loud unexplained noises, bulging wall panels, and door knobs that turn by themselves. All-in-all, the physical evidence is pretty tame, especially by today's standards.The fear reaction lies not in the physical form, but in the psychological sense. For example, as Theo and Nell cling to one another as wall pounding draws closer to their room, only to stop and dead silence replaces the noise. Later in the movie, Nell and Theo are again in their room when Nell grabs hold of Theo's hand as noise begins to build outside their bedroom door. Finally, unable to stand the noise any longer, Nell begins to scream which awakens Theo, who happens to be halfway across the room, and thus not close enough to be holding Nell's hand. So the question is "who or what was Nell holding?". There are many scenes that are similar to the above.This film was directed by Robert Wise who made me believe there was something lurking around every corner, or there was something that was going to happen, but you just didn't know quite when. This is the type of directing that has given this movie the classic status it so richly deserves.So, if you are more into the physical style of a movie, go see "Texas Chain Saw Massacre", but if you are ready for a genuinely scary movie, go rent or buy the 1963 version of "The Haunting".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no blood, there is no slashing, today this would be rated "G." But, this is the scariest movie, ever. Every time I watch this masterpiece (and I have watched it over 50 times), I see or hear something new. The density of the black and white is incredible. The camera angles and reflection shots are unsettling. The score is appropriately terrifying, from the ringing of tiny bells to the cannon ball rocking down the hall.The cast is excellent. The direction superb. This is horror at the peak of perfection--it is in your mind. The only thing better is to read the book by Ms. Jackson on a dark night when you are all alone, and "far from town." As Stephen King said about Shirley Jackson, "She never had to shout." Mr. Wise is to be credited with bringing her whispers to the screen.Rent this for Halloween. Or, own it forever. I still have trouble getting to sleep after I watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caution: Must Possess Imagination To "Get It"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a genuine Hitchcock-esque classic. Predating modern special effects, this movie subtly maneuvers the viewer into a crescendo of paranoia. My mother introduced me to this movie when I was still very young (and since the terror is of the psychological variety, it is a strangely age-appropriate movie for youngsters who wish to see scary movies).I think that the casting, concept, and script are all brilliant. This movie does not need the glitz of Hollywood effects because there is enough cranial content to more than compensate for what most people nowadays consider necessary visual enhancements. The cast has an amazing chemistry and plausibility. I don't recommend this movie to effects-addicts. If you appreciate well-executed theatre, believable acting, using your OWN imagination, then... see for yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scary, masterfully crafted ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting is the best haunted house movie of all time. It is creepy as hell, packs a real sense of dread, and always leaves the shocks to the imagination. It starts with an extremely effective prologue detailing the sinister history of Hill House over it's 90 year presence, and this prologue includes some really excellently done scenes. Flash forward 90 years, and four guests are invited to stay the night at Hill House, and experience the house's hypnotic power. The main character is Eleanor (Julie Harris) who is starting to believe the house wants something from her.The Haunting is a teriffically crafted, genuinely creepy story from Robert Wise, and many elements have been used in recent films (The freezing breath in The Sixth Sense, and the ghosts only implied by strange sounds and giggles in The Blair Witch Project).Overall, this is an excellent horror movie proving you don't need special effects and gore blah blah blah... Just see the movie. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Who Walk Here Walk Alone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wise took the time between WEST SIDE STORY and THE SOUND OF MUSIC, two very different musicals, to direct this cult-ish film of a house gone bad which seems to have a will of its own and is looking to acquire another soul to inhabit its walls. The production is a homage to Val Lewton's less-is-more taken to the extreme. From the moment the house is introduced, there is only mounting dread and things that go bump in the night and three scenes are a standout of modern horror. The first sequence is of course, the first sequence with the relentless pounding that is slowly moving towards the rooms where Eleanor Vance and Theo -- two of the psychics chosen by Dr. Markway to assist him in his ghost hunting. All they, and we, can do is focus on that twisting, turning door knob. The second sequence is even more disturbing: Eleanor Vance is sleeping with Theo in her bedroom, and as Theo holds her hand, Eleanor spots a pattern on a wall which seems to be malevolently observing her as unintelligible rants and raves by what seems to be an old man and the whimpers of a frightened child are all she can hear. When she reacts she finds she's not even in Theo's room (or bed) anymore.The third and scariest sequence revolves around the events after the arrival of skeptical Mrs. Markway (Lois Maxwell from the JAMES BOND series) who could care less about his paranormal investigations and is staying in the nursery -- a room reputed to have a dank, cold spot. The crew huddle together, listening to the increasingly deafening pounding with a will of its own and then staring in mute horror as the door separating them from that unseen entity seems to bend inwards, in a breathing fashion. This is the most claustrophobic moment in the entire movie, full of the power to scare the wits out of anyone. (Stephen King adapted numerous elements from this movie to re-create them for his classic horror novel THE SHINING with incredible success; ergo the influence this film has on the appreciation of cerebral horror.)THE HAUNTING is excellent in establishing character instead of making its players behave like they were automated puppets meant to do the very thing that they're not supposed to. Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson) is a serious minded fellow who has a paternal approach to his assistants. Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn, well cast) is a playboy, arrogant young man whose very insouciant nature will be tested. The ambiguously named Theo (a silky voiced Claire Bloom) is icy cool, someone in touch with herself, who can't understand why Eleanor can't be. She has a predatory quality about her, although she genuinely likes Eleanor. Lastly, Eleanor Vance is a wounded individual full of baggage whose impressionable nature is just what Hill House is looking for: someone whom it can suck the will out of, using her own weaknesses and inner turmoil as a weapon against her.THE HAUNTING is also keen in its images: black and white make way to light and dark and smothering shadows. Robert Wise amps the suspense as the "presence" that is Hill House tightens its grip on the characters. While maybe the music is a little too shrill at times, seeing a door wide open when it shouldn't be is more unsettling than seeing a full-fledged ghost drenched in pallor, and the only thing remotely close to one is Mrs. Markway near the end. Lighted from below at a key scene, she might as well be one of the walking dead.Where this movie fails is in the casting of Julie Harris as Eleanor Vance. Her performance is the only weak link here: she's much too shrill, even when in repose. One gets the hint that her Eleanor is already unhinged as it is and may be causing these events to herself for attention. So needy is Eleanor that it seems she would want to put herself in danger as seen when she climbs the already wobbly staircase and as Dr. Markway reaches out towards her, she veers so far backward it's a miracle she didn't actually fall. And if that isn't enough, another flaw in the movie is Harris' intrusive voice-overs. A little is fine, too much, and coming from her as petty drones and moans, is almost like getting a molar wrenched out without Novocaine. It would have been best to have Harris approach her acting with subtlety and eliminate the voice-overs.A film that has become the haunted house to beat despite the stilted acting of Julie Harris, THE HAUNTING can still give the feeling one is not alone at home and will make people think twice before listening to the rustling noises that linger after everyone has gone to sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorite horror flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie the summer I got out of high school. I went with a date and he about dug a hole in the arm of my sweater, it scared him that much. What makes the movie really scary is the fact that it does not have any slashers, monsters, blood and/or gore. Robert Wise scared you with camera angles, the unknown "presences" that seemed to be always lurking behind every door, and the sound effects were very effective. Filming it in black and white also made it creepier. The audiences imaginations and their own personal fears make the movie very effective. We have all experienced a frightening event at some time in our lives (dark closets, what's under the bed, what's outside the window after dark, did you hear that?, etc.) This movie plays on those feelings as you watch it. The remake was disappointing at the least. It had a great cast, but the producers/directors were trying too hard. These days, it seems that special effects can sometimes ruin a movie. There's nothing to play on ones imagination. That's why the book is usually much better than the movie. I purchased this movie on VHS a few years ago and I watch it every once in awhile in the dark (of course) when my husband is here. I don't think I could watch it alone - in the dark - in the night....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing 'The Haunting' in the horror section, rated G, was the first surprise this movie offered. Even though the rating may seem tame, the film offers a lot more than many of the trashy 80's and 90's horror movies which always seem to make it into video stores and hang around like a bed smell. This small gem of a movie may not stand out on the shelf and probably wouldn't appeal to many horror fans scouring the shelves for the latest gore flick, but if their eyes were to look past these to 'The Haunting,' they would be in for a pleasant surprise. This film is what a supernatural story should be - forgoing the usual barrage of special effects and buckets of blood, and relying on excellent cinematography to achieve the scares. The black and white combined with unique camera angles give Hill House an eerie, almost mystical appearance. Even though some of the acting may be a little corny at times (amid some superb acting, it must be said), the film manages to build tension steadily without ever showing the 'ghost,' therefore leaving you on the edge of your seat throughout. The main character (Elenor Lance) does unfortunately grate on the nerves after a while, being an overly neurotic and paranoid character, but otherwise the cast acts creditably well...even though the house steals the show! If you want a movie that gets your heart racing, turn down the lights and pump up the sound. Hill House will have you on the edge of your seat and keep you there for almost 2 hours. I only hope the remake this year does this superb film justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting is directed by Robert Wise and adapted to screenplay by Nelson Gidding from the Shirley Jackson novel The Haunting of Hill House. It stars Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson, Russ Tamblyn and Lois Maxwell. Music is by Humphrey Searle and cinematography by David Boulton.Hill House has a troubled history, death, either by accident or by suicide, has occurred there over the years. Today, Dr. Markway, an anthropologist and investigator of paranormal activity, leads a team of four for a stay at Hill House, where they will stay for a period of time in the hope that Markway can prove something paranormal resides there?The haunted house premise has been a staple for horror film makers since forever. To place the viewer in a murky house, alongside some character unfortunates, and then scare the tar out of them has always been the aim. It hasn't often worked to great effect, in fact the number of genuine scary haunted house movies barely trouble the fingers of both hands. How strange, then, that the best of the bunch chose a simple formula that has never been replicated since with the same great effect.The Haunting thrives not on what it throws at you by way of jumps and peek-a-boo visceral shocks, it deals firmly in the realm of what you can't see scares you the most. Where we have to use our own fretful imaginations to fill in the blanks for us, which is never a good thing in psychological horror parlance. Robert Wise, a most gifted and versatile director, uses oblique camera angles, thundering sound effects and angled close ups of his actors to get the maximum amount of atmosphere from the premise.Distortion is very much a key component here. We are told the history of the house and some of its structural quirks, the camera angles heighten this for ethereal impact whilst simultaneously marrying up to the distortion of a key character's mental health. The story in essence sounds simple, yet there is much bubbling away in Hill House, both on the page and up there on the screen. This is not simply a case of a group of people being haunted by a spectre or otherwise, the mind is a key player here, very much so.Along the way are some truly breath holding scenes; a bending door, pounding in the corridor, a face on the wall (the lighting here genius), Nell's hand holding incident, a rickety spiral staircase that we fear from the off, and the ghostly finale as Hill House reveals its hand and what we thought was a simple and true narrative is actually more clever, more chilling than we first imagined. Suggestion is a very big thing in The Haunting, it's what drives it to greatness, but it also has scenes that really bring the gooseflesh jumping up on your arms.The acting is mostly great, with Tamblyn and Johnson correctly underplaying their roles to let the two girls take centre stage. Both Harris and Bloom are excellent. As Nell, Harris is nervous, introverted and caught up in the atmosphere of the house, it's the pivotal role and Harris instills a heart aching fragility into the character. Bloom as Theodora has mystical qualities, a sexiness and a devilishly playful disposition, things that play off of Harris' egg shell walking quite brilliantly. While the house itself (exterior is Ettington Park Hotel in Stratford-Upon-Avon) is an ominous character all of its own. As Nell first spies the monolithic frontage she muses that it's a monster waiting to swallow her, a small creature, whole; we know exactly how she feels.Still the template haunted house movie, accept no substitutes and ignore stupid claims of homophobia, this is intelligent, scary and crafted with great skill. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After finding this gem at the public library's VHS section, I finally received the chance to watch the 'better' version of The Haunting. With what I could recall from reading the original novel (after seeing the modern version), I found this cinematic version infinately better and denser in character exposition than the 1999 version. In this 1963 version, the ending stayed closer to what happened in the novel and that was the definitive moment of The Haunting. I can't say much for the modern version, other than it was an effects film.What I found original in this 1963 version is that there were some clever uses of lensing effects to heighten the strangeness of Hill House. By adjusting the props in the sets so that they are off by a few degrees, it helps to unsettle the viewer. I'm hoping for a dvd release so that I can own both versions of the film. In the meantime, read the novel. There were a few details left out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Haunting (1963) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Robert Wise as a director a good deal of the time (THE BODY SNATCHER; THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN). But only recently did I finally get around to seeing this so-called horror classic called THE HAUNTING, and it was quite underwhelming for me, unfortunately. I have always appreciated subtle and atmospheric horror flourishes and they're not typically lost on me; I really enjoyed the opening and the first half hour or so, where we are introduced to the quirky characters (particularly the neurotic Eleanor) and to the creepy Hill House, with all its spooky history and grandeur. And then the talk, talk, talk set in, with not much else to sustain my interest. This is considered possibly THE greatest "haunted house" film of them all, but that is a consensus of opinion I just can't share. For me, James Whale's THE OLD DARK HOUSE (1932) still takes that honor. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb adaptation of Jackson's novel is a masterpiece of terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much to admire about this this film, it's hard to limit my comments, but here are a few thoughts: The performances are all excellent, including the brief appearances of the old woman who owns the house, and the surly gatekeeper.The main characters grow more interesting in their complex relationships to each other as the story progresses.Many viewers have said that the characters are all unsympathetic, and they especially dislike Eleanor. I find that the characters in the original novel are much more disagreeable than the movie characters. The two women are both much bitchier than in the film. Claire Bloom shows a surprising vulnerability and capacity for tenderness in her otherwise brash and aggressive character, that is quite unexpected. The look of hurt on her face, and the way she physically withdraws ,and wraps her arms around herself, at the moment when the angry Eleanore describes her as being something unnatural, is unexpected and moving.Another tremendously moving moment occurs as Dr. Markway is leading Eleanor to safety from the balcony onto the spiral staircase, and she holds and kisses his hand with a sad smile, and he looks awkward and embarrassed. The fact of her hopeless infatuation with him could not be made any clearer, and his ambivalent attitude toward her remains one of the intriguing aspects of the film. Is his affection for her of an almost paternal nature, or has he discovered unexpected romantic feelings for her that he never suspected? The real mansion used for the exteriors could hardly be better at playing the role of Hill House. The cinematography and music, intelligent script and brilliant editing, all contribute to a truly involving and frightening movie. Seldom has any movie better demonstrated the idea that what is not seen can be far more terrifying than a visible monster.The sequence in which Eleanor realizes that some unknown entity was holding her hand is absolutely heart stopping in its implications.I think what makes the film work so powerfully at its core is the way we come to know all the main characters very well, and feel like they're real people. We don't like all of them all the time, but they all have unexpected virtues and flaws. The compelling power of the film resides in the intense emotions felt by these characters, and the way they relate to one another. It's hard to put into words, but there is intense and overwhelming feeling in this movie. Perhaps one could say that the four main characters bond with each other in a strange love/hate manner, intensified by their frightening experiences in the house. Again, look at the scene where Eleanor calls from the car to Theo, and Claire Bloom rushes up to her and says, with quiet emotion, " Oh Nell, I thought you weren't going to say goodbye." Beneath all the haunted house trappings is a story of lonely, vulnerable people, and their human need for love and acceptance, and this almost subliminal story idea is what gives The Haunting its greatest power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ninety years ago, Hugh Crain builds the mansion Hill House in a remote area of New England. When his wife is moving to the mansion, she has an accident and dies, leaving the bitter Hugh Crain and his daughter Abigail alone in Hill House. Hugh Crain marries again and his wife also dies in Hill House. He moves to England and dies, living Abigail alone. When she is an old and invalid woman, she hires a paid companion from the village, but the woman neglects her and she dies. The companion inherits Hill House but the mansion drives her crazy and she commits suicide.In the present days (1963), Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) rents the mansion from the inheritor Mrs. Sanderson (Fay Compton) to study the supernatural and prove the existence of ghosts. He invites the clairvoyant Theodora 'Theo' (Claire Bloom) and the unbalanced and needy psychic Eleanor 'Nell' Lance (Julie Harris) to spend vacation in Hill House, and he goes with the skeptical future inheritor Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn) to the mansion. During the nights, the quartet witness supernatural manifestation in the house and the sanity of Nell is affected by her ghosts."The Haunting" is a scary psychological horror film by the magnificent director Robert Wise. The ambiguous story does not have special effects, gore, ghosts, serial-killers or monster, but the viewer startles many times with the camera angles and sounds. The art direction is impressive despite the bad taste, creating an eerie environment. In 1999, this film was remade by Jan de Bont but without the quality of the original film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Desafio do Além" ("Challenge from Beyond")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A chilling investigation into the supernatural. Whether the investigation actually goes wrong or not is left up to the opinion of the viewer. The pace is slow but steady and the scare tactics are simple but horrifically effective. Even the shots of the house are cleverly designed to unnerve; most of the shots are very dark, yet when the sun comes out, the shadows just get darker and obscure the view. The soundtrack and audio effects are of the most effective I've ever heard in a film. The acting is understated with a hint of hysteria that makes you want to turn the light on and find a big teddy bear to cuddle. This film has scared me for years and watching about 100 times has not dulled it's impact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original movie adaptation of Shirley Jackson's very creepy novel is the best. And it's the very best horror film ever made, in my opinion. Nothing beats a well-acted (Julie Harris carried very few films, and she's a legend), smartly written, expertly directed haunted house movie. This one delivers the chills. I was terrified when I saw it as a child and was taken in by it as an adult. Oddly, this works best on a TV screen at home...Lights out, phone turned off, and alone. The B/W images add enormously to the tone and terror. Lately, Hollywood and Stephen King ripped off THE HAUNTING (in addition to the AWFUL remake) with Nicole Kidman's THE OTHERS and the horrible TV miniseries ROSE RED. Jack Clayton's THE INNOCENTS, recently released on DVD, comes in a close second for all-time best in horror--also in B/W, also with a legendary actress (Deborah Kerr), and with a top notch script (Truman Capote adapted Henry James' novel).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Haunted House Film Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Warning* Spoilers*  Today's modern horror fans have been allowed to view without thought for many years now. Recent films such as Jason X, Feardotcom, and The House on Haunted Hill have made sure of that. So when a modern viewer checks out The Haunting they feel they are allowed to make open comparisons to the 1999 remake or similar, modern films. Films that push the motivation, the horror, and the fear right in your face. Modern viewers must be shown what to be scared of, being told is not good enough. I would venture a guess that if you liked the original Haunting you may have also liked the Blair Witch Project which proves that a fertile imagination is the most frightening tool a filmmaker has. Robert Wise capitalized on this. In 1963 there were no acceptable special effects or C.G.I. so Wise had to do the best he could with what he had. The result? The best haunted house movie ever made. Why is it the best? On the surface this film seems like a standard ghost story. A malevolent house with a gruesome history involving death, neglect, jealousy and greed. But when a person digs below the surface of what this film is about they realize that the film is not a haunted house movie at all. That is the major difference between the remake and the original. The remake relied on C.G.I. and expensive special effects to make the house the lead character. The original uses a more subtle approach in every way. The house is a minor character to the lead character of Eleanor Vance, a woman who has nowhere to go. This film is actually a character study of Eleanor. A woman who has never experienced anything but her mother's care and, later in life, caring for her mother. In doing this she doesn't belong anywhere. After her mother dies she is unsure what to do with herself. Nobody wants her and everyone in her life refuses to understand how important it is to belong somewhere or with someone. Eleanor agrees to go to Hill House and finds so much more than a study of the ghostly residents; she finds herself. Eleanor finds a sense of belonging. The horror and fear presented in this film is based on the fact that apparently the house is after Eleanor. It wants her. But in retrograde the viewer is never told until the end that Eleanor wants the house. The culmination of the film ends with Eleanor finally finding a home, somewhere she belongs. The film is bookended with the words, "Those who walk there [Hill House] walk alone." Eleanor is still alone but she is alone in a place where she belongs. Watch this film and forget about what the modern trend in horror films has told you. Forget the shock value, the flashy special effects, and just rest assured that you are in the arms of nothing more than a great story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maltin give this 3 1/2 stars??? More evidence that he hasn't seen all the films listed under his comments.I expected a lot from this movie considering Maltin and many of the user comments, and I tried, I really did. However, this movie made my brief list of flicks I had to rewind before finishing because I was suffering too much.Narration is a dubious device in any movie; if the story can't be told by what you're seeing, write a book instead. The fact that the voice is Eleanor's (Julie Harris) only adds to the annoyance. This is one of the most unpleasant, whining, neurotic characters I've seen on film (Harris seems to excel in this sort of part). I found no interesting psychological quirks of character in her part to justify her sheer unpleasantness. Russ Tamblyn is miscast.The movie uses every haunted house cliche in the book; I found nothing remotely frightening about it. The plot device of Dr. Markham gathering these folks for a weekend in the house smacks of "Hey kids! I know what! Let's make a movie about a haunted house!" Look up "contrived" in the dictionary and you'll find a plot summary of this flick.The whole enterprise has the feeling of a mediocre made-for-tv movie, with all the attendant production values thereof.A colossal disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Very, very scary", "The scariest movie of all time", blah, blah... Mankind truly has a few screws loose! It's been a while since I saw this, and I must applaud the director for making one of the most forgettable films of all time; a film that apparently managed to get no less than an average 7.6! And this is a very important point to be made: The utter, and sadly few, that actually dares come out and say that this is NOT the "scariest film of all time", gets berated for doing so on the basis of them being "to young", "having no imagination", etc. Well, could the reason on the contrary be that this film is actually trite, melodramatic, and boring? YES IT IS INDEED!! I view myself as an intelligent and critical horror fan, and have been so for quite a while, and thats why I would rather enjoy a black and white, subtle, and psychological horror film, than any crappy "Scream" or "Friday the 13th" installment. My point is that a horror film can be as old as it wants to be, but when I bench down to see a haunted house film, I want chilly atmosphere,and not this garbage! For those of you kind enough to read this review, and haven't seen this film yet, you are left with two choices: 1. You can disregard everything I have said, go out and rent it, but be prepared for an amazing and melodramatic(Well it's from 1963, so....) borefest numero uno. 2. You will heed my advice, and instead watch " The Woman in Black"( A truly chilling ghost film, probably the best of the lot!) or the great "Rosemarys Baby"(Though not a ghost film, still great psychological horror!) Don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Minimalist Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few movies adapted from novels are as good as the original book. Even fewer are *better* than the original book. I feel that THE HAUNTING, adapted in 1963 by master director Robert Wise (also known for THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL in 1951, THE SOUND OF MUSIC in 1965, and WEST SIDE STORY in 1961), is one of those rare movies in the latter category. That's not to say that Shirley Jackson's original novel, THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE, is anything but groundbreaking. In fact her novel in 1959 launched the haunted house sub- genre as we know it today. Are you familiar with the theme in which a group of people spend the night in a haunted building in order to experience the paranormal? Shirley Jackson came up with that, and it's been re-used in many ways. But the novel is primarily a study on the character of Eleanor, and spends a great deal of time exploring her brooding and depressed thoughts. The haunted house is not the focal point of the novel, but the stage on which her psychosis would play itself out. When Eleanor heard strange sounds, Jackson felt compelled to explore her character's reactions rather than frighten the reader with them. The movie, however, bled the story for its horror potential. It did not abandon Eleanor's thoughts, we hear them in her narration throughout. But Robert Wise took advantage of the implicit horror that is brought about when you hear an unexplainable sound in a house that you "know" is empty. He magnified the tension exponentially, using sound and camera angles to frighten you. THE HAUNTING is one of the finest examples of minimalist horror. Minimalist horror is storytelling that creates fear with minimal direction. You will not see a single ghost in the entire movie. You will only imagine ghosts because you can hear them. Hauntings are also evidenced by doors. Doors play an important role in the movie. They open and close by themselves, their knobs jiggle, and in one powerful scene a shut door swells in and out as if something gigantic must be pressing against the other side. One suspects that the use of doors in THE HAUNTING symbolizes "the other side" of reality. Metaphor or not, a menacing and unexplainable sound on the other side of a closed, unlocked door is a powerful source of anxiety. But we never get to see what's behind it. That's what makes it minimalist. You will rarely hear music when there are hauntings about, because this would work against its goal. (Compare this movie with the embarrassing 1999 re-adaptation directed by Jan de Bont and you'll see what I mean. In the awful 1999 treatment, the music and sound effects just wouldn't stop, and the audience couldn't sort out what the characters were really hearing.) A modern horror movie overuses sound effects and music because the director thinks it will bring more anxiety. Most of the time it's actually distracting. The directors don't seem to trust the imagination of the audience. One trick of the trade is to strike a loud sound when something dashes by the camera. John Carpenter probably started that trend with HALLOWEEN) (1978), and he's one of the few directors who can work it really effectively. Fear brought about by a sudden, loud sound has been used countless times since THE EXORCIST (1973), but few directors are daring enough to repeat the subtle, minimalist formula of THE HAUNTING. However, there are two more recent and effective examples of minimalist ghost stories, which I also recommend. THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) directed by M. Night Shyamalan (himself well known as a minimalist director), and THE OTHERS (2001) directed by Alejandro Amenábar. Eleanor was played by Julie Harris, with whom I had the pleasure of working on THE FIRST OF MAY, and she told me that shooting THE HAUNTING was not a happy experience for her. In fact she felt as alone and depressed as her character, and did not consort with the other actors much. She was able to bring this to her role, and helped to create one of the greatest horror movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drector: Robert Wise, Script: Nelson Gidding, Novel: Shirley JacksonPeople are often asking on the various message boards about the most frighting movie of all time. Well folks, let me tell you-this is it! So many horror movies are just violent slasher or exploitation flicks and while that can be entertaining it is not necessarily scary. What makes the haunting so effective is the atmosphere that is set up throughout the film. This movie actually does not show anything at all, it is all power of suggestion.This movie, about a paranormal researcher who hires a small group of people to study a haunted house, is probably the best film ever made dealing with the paranormal and the unknown. It is the unknown that scares us humans the most. Watch this movie either by yourself or with another person with the lights off one of these nights and see what it does to your imagination! I might add that Julie Harris, the women that played "Eleanor" in the movie, suffered from depression during the filming of the movie and she would often isolate herself from the rest of the cast and crew. You can see this in her performance. Robert Wise has done films of many different genres. He directed the great si-fi films The Day the Earth Stood Still and The Andromeda Strain and the musicales West Side Story and The Sound of Music to name but a few.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic horror movie about temporary occupants of a strange mansion begin to face terrifying ordeals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Shirley Jackson's creepy tale titled ¨The haunting of Hill House¨, is a suspenseful and frightening terror movie by Robert Wise dealing with a haunted mansion and it was subsequently adapted (1999) by Jan De Bont . It's longly deemed one of the masterly crafted stories of terror ever brought to the screen ; ¨Haunting¨(1963) by Robert Wise , is a gripping film which still packs a punch . Hill House is a hundred-year-old haunted mansion , it is the setting for chosen group . The haunted house has an evil history with tragic accidents, suicide, and human misjudgement. It seems which the eerie mansion has been the place of several killing deaths . A psychologist scientist (Richard Johnson subsequently played by Liam Neeson) is a Pyschic researcher who assembles a group with histories linked to the paranormal . As three people are lured to a ghastly mansion deceived for fake pretenses realized by a psychological researcher . Nell (Julie Harris in posterior remake performed by Lili Taylor) was the subject of unexplained poltergeist activities as a child . She also is riddled with pain over her mother's death . Theo (Claire Bloom , ulterior role by Catherine Zeta Jones) is a clairvoyant who befriends Nell at Hill House . Furthermore , Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn , posterior character by Owen Wilson ) is a cynical scion and Bon Vivant sent to make sure that the property and not affected by other characters . Together the group explore scary Hill House and their own insecurities and finally face off the evil that inhabits with hair-raising results . Through the course of the night some will unravel , some will question , and all will fight for their lives as the house fights back. As the days and nights pass, the group slowly begins to learn the terrifying secret behind the house's former owner. They soon realize that the house is pure evil, and they must battle a terrifying spirit to escape the house of nightmares .This interesting terror movie is packed with thrills, intrigue, suspense, horror and lots of interminable screams . Acceptable budget , fine performance and exciting issues make for big scary scream-feast and frights . This is a chilling adaptation from Shirley Jackson's novel based on an assortment of ghouls and ghosts and gets a high rating . Splendid Julie Harris as a fragile , lovely youth who results to have unexpected ties to the creepy ghost , she's the mainly redeeming feature of this movie . Robert Wise had seen Julie Harris in a play and decided she was perfect for the leading role. She later confessed that shooting the picture had been very hard on her. She saw her character, Eleanor, in a different way than director Wise but didn't feel it was her place to disagree, so playing the part was a struggle for her . Strange and thrilling musical score by Searle and atmospheric cinematography by David Boulton . Director Robert Wise created a taut drama where the real question is who is haunted and who may be unstable . Robert Wise made the film as a dedication to the memory of his mentor, Val Lewton, who had died 12 years earlier . The picture is very well realized by Robert Wise , a successful director of all kind genres as musical as ¨West side story¨, ¨The sound of music¨ , Sci-fi as ¨The day the earth stood still¨, ¨Star Trek¨, ¨The Andromeda strain¨ and Terror as ¨The body snatchers¨ , ¨ Curse of the cat people¨, ¨Audrey Rose¨ and of course ¨The haunting¨ . It turns out to be a chiller , being well produced and compellingly directed . And followed by an inferiors sequel (1999) by Jan De Bont, a mindless and average film with all the FX budget can be created and contains several scenes without sense , no logic and in little common to the novel . This is an inferior version that relies heavily on the impressive special effects , however the classic version is the best and the greatest as acting as atmosphere .</fullReview>

It's all in your mind in what you see....or think you see. The scene where Nell and Cleo are in the bedroom together and the the rumbling and knocking gets louder and louder.....the the door knob turns and then starts pushing in and out....as if its breathing. Totally blew my mind. I had nightmares for weeks. The whole movie is really a play upon our minds. What's scarier......what you see.....or what you don't see. Yes Russ Tamberlain is a pill.....but isn't he supposed to be! Someone said that it's like the great master...HITCHCOCK. You never know what to expect.

		<fullReview>This ranks as my favorite ghost story of all time. The mood, lighting, and (lack of ) special effects all make the "it's what you don't see that scares you" premise work great. To highlight this movie, watch it on Halloween night with the lights out and then try it again with the ( ugh ) remake and see how you feel. Robert Wise was a great director and this is probably his hidden gem. I purchased it a few years back on DVD and my wife and I watch it every year on Halloween and it never, ever ceases to give her or myself the chills, especially the scenes toward the end in the library, the "cold spot", and the "hold my hand" sequence. Julie Harris is perfect for her part. Skittish and susceptible to all things that "go bump in the night".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend and I watched this on Halloween night when I was 24. I was terrified to turn out the light for the next three weeks. Part of me wonders why I should have been so scared, after all in "The Haunting" you never see a ghost, there is no blood and gore, no demons lurk waiting to scare you. And that's precisely why the movie is so scary. Robert Wise uses camera angles, sound effects and music to create one of the most terrifying movies of all time. The actors are all great. Julie Harris turns in a great performance as the narcissistic Eleanor, who feels the house is talking to her. Claire Bloom is radiant as the charismatic Theo, and Russ Tamblyn is fun as the token skeptic in the group.One of the most terrifying scenes in the film is the infamous scene when Eleanor and Theo are trapped in their rooms listening to the loud knocking at the door and are too terrified to move. It's a very frightening scene and one that will make you lock your door every night.Watch this one alone, in the dark if you want a truly nightmarish time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film which seems to get much critical praise, and in years since the public have followed of course, although somewhat mystifyingly. There is no suspense, atmosphere, tension, developments and then it grinds to a complete halt. I first viewed this movie in the '70's and suffice to say it is the biggest let down i have ever had cinematically bar none and subsequent viewings are actually worse. You wait and wait for the build up to increase and reach some sort of crescendo but it literally goes nowhere at all and nothing happens whatsoever.One of the top 3 most overrated films i have ever seen and 4 viewings makes it harder to sit through each time. Check out the vastly superior The Legend of Hell House to see how it should have been done.If you would like to know why this film had such critical praise then check out the directors other works especially before. The critics do not want us horror/thriller fans to like something different and always mark way higher when it's on occasion a director usually successful in another genre but they can't and wont fool me. Dull, dreadful, dormant. A must miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In The Haunting Russ Tamblyn has bought himself a genuine haunted house and rather than just move in, he's hired an occult expert Richard Johnson who in turn has brought two women with him who are experts in some way in the paranormal. Before moving in, the four of them conduct an experiment to try and contact the alleged spirits which involves them staying there for 48 hours. There were to be four others, but they for one reason or other didn't choose to complete the experiment.Maybe out of concern and some jealousy that her husband was going to be spending time with two women, Johnson's wife Lois Maxwell also joins the group. Maxwell of course is best known as being the love struck Ms. Moneypenny in the James Bond series.The film really belongs to Julie Harris and Claire Bloom as the psychically enhanced women staying at Tamblyn's house. The Haunting is an unusual horror film in that you will see not one monster, will see no dismembered body parts, all you will hear is some rather unearthly noises, yet The Haunting will frighten you out of a decade of living. It all has to do with the skill of a remarkably talented cast. They convey a sense of fright that is passed on to the audience that will not leave you for weeks.Cinematically, The Haunting seems to be influenced by Henry James's The Turn Of The Screw and also by Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night. In the latter the entire play is set in the Tyrone house and like The Haunting the house itself becomes a character.The Haunting is not for blood and guts fright fans. It's a thinking person's horror film and a tribute to a talented cast that puts it over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr. Markaway (Richard Johnson) studies ghosts and wants to investigate Hill House which is reportedly haunted. Along with him is Theo (Claire Bloom) who has ESP and Nell (Julie Harris) who has had poltergeist activity. Tagging along is Luke (Russ Tamblyn) who doesn't believe. Soon things are banging on the wall, voices are heard, someTHING grabs Harris' hand and then there's the infamous "breathing" door sequence. Something is in there...and it seems to want Nell.Excellent ghost story beautifully photographed in black and white and directed by Robert Wise. You NEVER once see the ghosts...you just hear them and your mind basically really works on you. The sounds are terrifying, the images are frightening (the "breathing" door won't leave me and there's a terrifying bit on a spiral staircase) and there are superb performances by the entire cast. This is an example of subtle horror. It also has a downright chilling ending. The house itself LOOKS horrifying--it's big and monstrous inside and out. They shot it in England---I'd love to know where. The opening prologue telling you the history of Hill House is pretty strong stuff.This only gets a 9 for a few reasons. Some of the dialogue was awkward (especially Harris' lines) and everyone is basically unlikable. Dr. Markway is ALWAYS babbling on about ghosts and such (although some of it is interesting); Theo is pretty callous and cruel; Luke is just a jerk and Nell is constantly whining or breaking down in hysterics. Seriously you don't care about any of them. Still the movie worked. Also Bloom plays a lesbian in a matter of fact manner--a rarity in that day.This is 100 times better than the pathetic 1999 remake (which will have you in stitches). Well worth catching. Wide-screening viewing is essential but seeing it alone late at night is NOT a good idea--I had to sleep with my bedside light on all night! Most chilling line comes at the end--"...we who walk here walk alone." Gives me goosebumps just typing it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent and highly effective psychological supernatural chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting / 1963 / Directed by: Robert Wise / Based on the book: "The Haunting of Hill House", by Shirley JacksonThis was my first ever viewing of this film, which was released the year I was born. How I wish I had seen this film earlier. Well, better late, than never. As an intelligent, mature, film enthusiast, this film is a masterpiece of it's unfortunately and often under appreciated and confused genre. No, it's not really a horror film, in the truest sense of the word. There is a difference between horror and terror. Something most filmmakers to this day don't seem to understand or appreciate. Terror is the apprehension of something bad or frightening about to happen, horror is the actual realization of that imagined horror. Alfred Hitchcock understood this and used it very effectively throughout his long film career.This exceptionally effective chiller relies on mystery, suspense and audience imagination. Bravo! Cheers! Kudos! How I wish this film making style could return. I'm not easily frightened nor easy to impress. This film had me tense and absorbed all the way through. There's definitely a feeling of tension lingering, after the end of the film. Since I know I'm hard to impress or frighten, I viewed this film for the first time, in a very suitable setting: home alone and late at night, for maximum effect.It's quite an intelligent and psychologically interesting movie for its genre, one of the best I've ever seen. Haunted houses are a big part of folklore, all over the world for centuries, but not such a common genre for movies.Four supernatural investigators spend several nights in a feared famous old haunted house with a bad history.The unusual and long prologue effectively sets up the bad history of the house. One supernatural visitor has a personal connection to Hill House.Style, technique and writing are excellent (cinematography and art direction). The dominant character of this film is Hill House itself, secondly, Eleanor (one of the ghost hunters) and thirdly, the leader of the supernatural group. The impressive and convincing effects of the film are entirely physical and optical. This film had me impressed from beginning to end. Compared to most other chillers or haunted house movies, "The Haunting" is definitely superior. Wise directs in the classic style of Hitchcock. Upon one viewing, I consider this film to be one of the best ever of it's genre.The puzzle of this story is: were the prior residents of Hill House mentally ill, as well as Eleanor? The character of Eleanor is most interesting, as she is certainly a sympathetic, lonely and lost soul. She is often the narrator of the story, we often hear her thoughts. In a film with good, solid acting performances all around, the performance of Eleanor's character is most impressive. She certainly did her "homework" for the role and was very well cast.The brilliance and power of "The Haunting", is that it explores the very nature of fear and relies on the audience to actively use their own imagination, experiencing the film. We humans fear the darkness. We fear the unknown. Fear what we don't understand. What's supernatural now may be explained in future generations and become the accepted normal, most people later will take for granted. This imaginative, intelligent and suspenseful style of film making has sadly almost completely disappeared. Most horror/chiller/thriller films now rely heavily on graphically depicted violence, with little or nothing left to the imagination. Shock and repulsiveness have largely replaced true horror, mystery and suspense. The great power of all storytelling is having the audience use its own imagination. Everyone has their own individual perception and meaning taken from the film. The art of mystery and suspense has mostly been lost since the 1960's. This film is a good example of what was lost.</fullReview>

Along with The Innocents and The Uninvited, as good as it gets for ghost tales.Very well done, the photography is excellently moody. The real star of the film is the house and the way it's shot in shadow.The scariest part for me back in 1963 was that face in the wall pattern that keeps giving its wry grin as Eleanor hears the house talking to her.The weakest part is Dr Marquay himself and his lame jokes and sensationalism.

		<fullReview>"Don't see this one alone!", says Mr. Maltin. You know, he may be right --- you'll need a friend to poke you on the shoulder every now and then, to keep you awake. This is by no means a "3 1/2 Star" film in my book.Not that the movie is terrible; in fact, it starts out with a very intriguing and shocking introduction. A brisk montage shows us the horrible fates of the early inhabitants of the house, including a jolting suicide by hanging, in which the victim jumps off an indoor balcony and sends her shoe falling three stories. This turns out to be the best five minutes of the whole movie??because things take a turn for the worse immediately after that. We're subjected to two poorly-drawn characters in an inexplicable argument with a whiny old drip about borrowing the car. Underlying family troubles are suggested, but never made clear, and the scene ultimately comes off as unconvincing, with awkward dialogue, and the dramatic power left over from the film's intro is deflated. It also turns out that this scene pretty much sets the tone of the movie, unfortunately.When that scene ended, I kept up my high spirits, only to learn that the whiny old drip would be the character given the most attention. As a supporting character, she could have been an interesting personality to visit periodically, but as the main character she is a grating, disagreeable presence throughout. She even expresses her thoughts through a droning voiceover while she drives, making us dislike her even quicker. As I found out, the film would use the clumsy, irritating voiceovers a LOT with this lady. Another early scene with Dr. Markway in his office checking off names of guests leads us to expect a bevy of eclectic characters at the mansion. What disappointment, then, to learn that most of those names "dropped out", leaving only three rather boring guests to watch for the duration of the movie: the neurotic woman from the beginning, a smart-mouthed psychic, and a tepid playboy. And the interaction of the characters, and their reactions to each other and to the ghostly goings-on, don't make sense. One night they're terrorized by frightening noises and bulging doors, and the next day they stroll around the house like it never happened. It's also strange how none of them try to explain the cause of the weird events except to attribute it to the house! A normal person would demand a logical explanation if they walked down to breakfast and saw a threatening message hand-written on the wallpaper in giant letters. It may be no coincidence that both "The Haunting" and "The Blair Witch Project", another overrated "scary" film, have disappointing character development. The characters are exasperating creatures that get on our nerves and spark little concern or even interest. And like the Blair Witch Project, "The Haunting" turns out to be almost devoid of both scares and suspense. Except for a couple, the scenes are mostly dull, mundane episodes to sit through, and not on the edge of your seat, to say the least. It's really surprising how the film never follows through on those nice opening scenes.The film, especially the scene with Ms. Lance driving to the house for the first time, only reminded me of how superior Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" was. Now there's a film with convincing writing and drama, perfect cinematography and direction, and plenty of thrills and chills. And for a better "invitation to a haunted house" film, check out the original "House on Haunted Hill" from 1958, or "Clue", which isn't a horror film but features a spooky old house with a lot more character than "The Haunting"'s house. What really shocks me about "The Haunting" is the overstatement made on this board by the film's supporters. Some of those comment titles would have you believe that "The Haunting" won Best Picture at the Oscars for ten straight years. I would recommend that those individuals tone down their hype and stop raising people's expectations up so high, thus preventing disappointment with the film afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An instant classic for anyone who loves ghost stories.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are no shortage of movies in the world with nothing more to offer than a bland and mild look into the minds of their characters. But in the Haunting that is exactly the opposite. Based on the book "The Haunting Of Hill House" by Shirly Jackson, it is more than just a ghost story. It is a journey through the damaged and saddened mind of its main character. The story surrounds the life of Elenore Vance, a dried up excuse ridden woman who has barley left the house for groceries, in four years, on the count of taking care of her sick mother. After years of putting her own life on hold so she could take care of the mother she deeply resented, her mother passes away in a manner which leaves Elenore feeling guilty and full of doubt over the anger she had toward her mother. These feelings though are forgotten when she is given an invitation to go to Hill House for a week long retreat to find scientific evidence that another, supernatural world really exists, headed up by the charming Dr. Markway. Elenore is deeply moved by her experiences at Hill House and slowly begins to slip into madness. The most interesting thing about the book as well as the movie is that it makes the suggestion that there is no ghosts in the house but that in fact it is Elenore who is slowly going insane. But that is the real kicker there are ghosts and they are slowly driving her mad. Each new incident, each new encounter with something strange in the house floods back memories of her mother and her guilt of her death. It drives her to the breaking point until the end is almost inevitable. All in all I give this movie 9 stars there are times it moves slowly but there are great characters who interact with one another and each other very well. Never watch it in the dark though you will never trust your house again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A supernatural chiller of merit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're after blood, hideous spectres, chainsaws and gore this is not the film for you. If, on the other hand, you want creeping fear and psychological discomfort, do watch. The beauty of this film is that it is never overstated, you use your imagination, and unless you are severely withdrawn, this works. Harris gives a superb performance as a lonely spinster embarking on a study into terror, and unlike Lili Taylor's performance in the 1999 version, strays well away from 'camp'. Bloom is excellent as the ambiguous Theodora, and Richard Johnson exudes rumpled class as Dr Markway. Pulsating doors never seemed so scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly creepy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>((SPOILERS AHEAD)) Four people spend a few nights in a haunted mansion in this excellent black-and-white thriller based on a classic tale by Shirley Jackson. The cast of this classic horror film never comes face to face with an actual ghost, but it's infinitely more terrifying than the 1999 re-make. The big scares (and there are many) are never mounted on big effects or cheap surprises (precisely where the 1999 version went wrong), instead, director Robert Wise demonstrates a remarkable sense of atmosphere. He creates a formidable tension in the estate using an eerie soundtrack and ghostly camera angles, and little else. The haunted-house premise is obviously very familiar, but the atmosphere is truly chilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Halfway through this, I realized I had seen it before, and forgot. Although some of it is creepy and effective, overall it just didn't "do it" for me.It could have been a really great chiller, if it had been done with more depth. I don't need all scary movies to be deep, but if you're going to have someone go mad as a central feature of the story, you'd better get it right...The house is great, a really creepy character. I like the actors in it, especially the one playing the central character, but the script itself disappoints. I found the other (human) characters rather glib. This undermined the seriousness of what the central character was going through.More deeply, I just had trouble believing the authenticity of her mental problems. There was little consistency to her thoughts (even a conflicted person has consistent thoughts about their conflict), while at the same time there was no clarification of exactly what her fundamental conflict was. Was she covering up a murder she'd committed? Was she masochistically looking for the nasty house to replace her nasty mother? Was she simply dealing with the passing instability caused by sudden change and death? Or had she always been messed up, abused by everyone in her family even before her mother's illness? None of this is made clear. It felt like her mental state was written in a shallow manner, as if it was being made up willy-nilly to follow the demands of the plot. As a result, I wasn't able to suspend my disbelief enough to feel the house "pulling" her in.I love old scary movies, but not this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the very best horror film ever made, based on the best horror novel ever written. The truly amazing thing, though, is that the makers of this film actually read the book, and followed it. Sexist remark. Women very rarely write effective horror. Women write great scifi and fantasy, but rarely horror. However, when you find a woman who does write great horror, it is better than anything a man does. Shirley Jackson wrote great horror, and The Haunting of Hill House is her very best. The makers of this movie followed the book nearly word for word. There is no vomiting peasoup, no spewing entrails, no heads lopped off and no ghost, monster or creature on stage. It's all in the mind. Wonderful stuff, though. Please, if you love good horror, see this movie and read this novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pulling for "The Haunting" for the duration of its 112-minute run time...I kept thinking all the proper elements were in place for a good scary movie, but something just didn't click. The film is well-acted by a group of familiar faces (Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson, and Russ Tamblyn), Robert Wise ("West Side Story")'s experienced direction is top-notch, and the subtle manipulation of light and shadow produces ample chills. Why, then, was I so disappointed in the end? Like the haunting of Hill House, there might be no rational explanation. However, there are some noticeable flaws that keep the film from potential greatness: the dialog is poorly recorded and often difficult to make out (even on the current Warner DVD); the acting, while good, is in service to characters that are generally unlikable, thus axing the human element of the story (Julie Harris' neurotic voice-over narration is incredibly annoying); and on the whole, the film is just too talky for its own good, to the point where the scattered scare scenes are undermined by the relentless, silly blather. Overall, "The Haunting" is worth seeing at least once, as it is not a "bad" film by any stretch of the imagination...but it really could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Don't see this one alone!" - Leonard Maltin's 2008 Movie Guide.Leonard, be a man!Better advice: "Don't see this movie - period."Believe me, the other reviewers here who comment on how soapy and downright boring "The Haunting" is, are telling you the truth. Films - of ANY genre - don't get much more dull than this, for the first hour-and-a-half. Considering the praise this movie receives, this is one of the most disappointing two hours I've spent in front of a screen.It's hard to believe any adult actually was frightened by this "hair-raising" (Maltin, again) horror film, which would bore most five-to-85-year-old people. Oh, it might get your attention the last 25 minutes but, unfortunately, you have to stay awake for the first 95 minutes to get to any point in which something might scare you, or at least keep your interest. For the first hour-and-a-half, only the sets and some of the cinematography were worth watching.The characters, led by an extremely annoying one played by Julie Harris, do not include anyone who you will care about. Most of them are stereotypes from classic films from the decades of the '40s and '50s. For a film in 1963, this surprised me in that it had such dated dialog and feel to it. This is a movie for soap queens, not fans of horror movies. Character-wise, you have the mousy woman ("Eleanor Lance") who has a million fears and mental problems and whimpers most of the two hours; the psychic professor type who believes in all the hooey as if it is all fact; the skeptical types who laugh off everything from the start and are arrogant...and most off, you have nothing much that ever happens. If it weren't for some dramatic music, you'd all fall asleep watching this and waiting something to happen. Almost this entire movie consists of the four people, usually in pairs, sitting around yakking about their personal problems or philosophies. Most of the time, we have to listen to the pathetic "Eleanor" (Harris) simper about her troubles, past and present. It really, really gets annoying.This is "scary?" This is "suspenseful?" Give me a break!The shots of "Hill House," outside and inside, are about the only really good thing about this frightfully-overrated film. It was also interesting, to me, to see "Miss Moneypenny" of James Bond screen fame, playing another role although only mainly in the last half hour. Sadly, Maxwell just died last fall at the age of 80.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the movie is visually quite inventive, overall it is a big disappointment. I'm really shocked by the gushing of virtually all reviewers, most of whom I'm assuming saw it at a young age, possibly when it first came out.To start, the weakest aspect is Julie Harris' character, who I would agree stands as one of the most irritating leads of all time. This is compounded by the unfortunate choice of making her thoughts audible, which rarely do more than repeat the obvious, in the "wow, I'm really scared and what am I doing here" mode--hey, thanks for filling us in on that! Lastly, absolutely nothing happens for the entire movie! I enjoy slow build-ups, but that is all this movie has to offer. Visually creative, but stick with Psycho or Rosemary's Baby for good examples of '60's horror films...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting tells the tale an experiment designed to discover the mysteries of Hill House, a sprawling Gothic mansion believed to be haunted because of its colourful history of death, suicide, and insanity. Dr. Markway (ably played by Richard Johnson) invites a group of people he believes to be sensitive to supernatural occurrences in order to monitor their responses to the house, and indeed, the houses responses to them.We're introduced to Eleanor (well played by Julie Harris) as she attempts to escape her stifling home environment. After caring for her recently deceased mother for 11 years, she has grown sick of servitude, and longs to escape the confines of the home she shares with her sister and her husband. Despite being denied access to a car she half owns, she sneaks out of the house, and sets off to take part in Markway's experiment.While ostensibly a film detailing the supernatural vigil held by Markway and his fellow guests, The Haunting is really a film about Eleanor's tragic quest to find her place in the world. 11 years of tending to her dying mother have stunted her emotionally, something which comes across in her interactions with Hill House's other guests (especially Theo) as well as Hill House itself. She quickly falls under the spell of Hill House, identifying with the stories of its past, and also falls under the spell of the charming Markway, mistaking his pleasantries for romantic advances. It soon all goes wrong for Eleanor however. The sudden exposure to such a different environment from what she's used to begins to take its toll on her sanity, and the audience are invited to share her thoughts via Harris' voice-over.This is where the film began to lose its grip on me. While I'm capable of appreciating her plight, I couldn't really identify with her or her somewhat flighty thought processes. Her interior monologue puts her across as an unhinged character, which she clearly is, but one that's far removed from a typical modern existence. Although the camera-work and lighting all remains very good, complete with Hitchcockian angles and heavy use of obscuring shadow, without an sympathetic main character it's not really much use. It seems as though there is a good horror story in the source material somewhere, and that this was probably the right way to tell it at the time, but for me it has lost most of its effectiveness as it has aged. While the staircase set-piece is tense and well-paced, the terror lacks a physical immediacy that would make the film genuinely threatening. The internalisation of the house's effects exclude us, as we only really receive the events through Eleanor's maladjusted eyes.I can appreciate the merits of the storytelling, I just couldn't connect to the lead character, which means I was left more than a little disappointed by this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fail to understand how anyone can say that this is one of the best horror films ever made. The mood was weak. The characters, except for Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson), were idiotic. And the story was slow-paced and bland, just like Shirley Jackson's novel.Richard Johnson's cold narrative at the beginning did manage send chills down my spine, but it was the only thing that did. The rest was just a waste. After I finished watching it the first time, I was unsatisfied. I thought it was just me. Then I rented it again and watched it all the way through and again I still was unsatisfied. With that in mind, I knew it was not me. The movie was, simply put, weak. I imagine if Alfred Hitchcock directed this movie instead of Robert Wise, it would have been a lot better. But don't misunderstand me, I like Robert Wise. I thought he did fine on "Star Trek: The Motion Picture". That film, I think, was more spooky than "The Haunting".Claire Bloom's presence was the only other aspect of the movie that was good. That woman could grace just about anything. I could watch her read the phone book and still be aroused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>finally managed to watch this yesterday. (not sure i have spoilers, but to be on the safe side).i usually don't enjoy retro movies, unless they are exceptionally realistic. i find it really hard to enjoy retro acting, and directing. in this film it was decent, but still it felt a bit outdated for my taste.that brings me to the most important change i would have made in this film:as some reviewers wrote, it would have been a better film if Hitchcock directed it. maybe. but again, i am shocked no one addresses the MUSIC SOUNDTRACK!! i personally found it VERY outdated, annoying, and too cliché like many other horror films done at the time. i hated that.the sound fx and atmosphere were done pretty well and original for the time, so the musical choice was pretty much a big let down IMO. i'm not sure Hitckcock would have made this film better, however, i think i can say very certainly that if Bernard Herrmann would have written the soundtrack, this film was way way better.besides that, the camera-work was very good. saved the film IMO. i must say it wasn't THAT frightening. i just liked the atmosphere of "being" there with the characters. it was fun. the story was OK. maybe it was original at the time, but now it's a bit predictable plot. also, some of the characters motivations were not very realistic.i think it deserves a 7.5, for the camera-work, directing, originality at the time. P.S - about Sam Raimi: i am 100% certain that he borrowed some of the camera tricks used here on the "ghost dog outside the door" scene, when it sniffs. the lens used, the movement, it's all there. even the sound fx. Raimi just took it to a different comical horror angle in Evil Dead II.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four characters set the tone of this movie. Richard Johnson plays Dr John Markway, paranormal investigator. Claire Bloom is Theo, his young 'psychic' female assistant. Julie Harris is Eleanor, who also answered his advertisement. Russ Tamblyn is Luke Sanderson, the imminent owner of Hill House, who has invited the good doctor to investigate.Almost two stories are blended into one, here. Eleanor is a repressed and sensitive young naivete. She is gauche, self-conscious and vulnerable. Although still comparatively young, she has spent all of her adult life attending to her possessive mother until she has died, something for which she - Eleanor - harbours a crippling guilt. Now she has neither home nor family and desperately wants to belong - somewhere and to someone. She is, as they say, damaged goods.Beyond her, the others are comparatively normal. The good doctor is himself married. He brings a professional, almost clinical, detachment to his work, and to his fellow investigators. Infidelity is the last thing on his mind, though he is the first 'man' to engage with Eleanor's empty life.Theo is young, attractive, experienced and rather bitchy.Luke - in the form of Russ Tamblyn - is there to provide a mix of youthful and dismissive scepticism with a little light comedy thrown in. Tamblyn has neither the appearance nor the persona for a 'serious' role.These four gather at the huge old mansion that is Hill House. The place was, it seems, 'built bad', with many of its angles deliberately out of kilter. What we would now call 'modern' architecture. It's almost a hundred years old - which is considered a long time, in America - rambling, spacious, obscure, and luxuriously gloomy: Gothic perfection for imaginary ghosts.Except these don't need to be imagined. The full disclosure of the haunting plays between what is manifest to the collective members and what discloses to the tortured vulnerability of Eleanor's mind. It is almost 'her' movie, inasmuch as she provides a regular narrative of her spoken thoughts outlining a gradual descent towards instability. There are voices and sounds which only she can here, whilst the others also glimpse isolated imagery. The high point of things going bump in the night features the entire group together in one of the main reception rooms, listening, as a thunderous booming traverses the manifold interior. Louder and louder it gets, stopping right outside the doors. They themselves belly inwards, as if impressed by some colossal force. It's a simple, but quite heart-stopping moment. The recent remake with all its CGI overdrive fails to replicate such shocking and threatening perplexity.Eleanor dies as a consequence of an accident. But her final voice-over leaves us in little doubt that she has at last found somewhere to belong.This is a largely character-driven movie that demonstrates how believable acting along with an intelligent script, solid set-pieces and just a little ingenuity, are all that is needed for a good scare. Check-out the preposterous remake with star Liam Neeson if you doubt it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Dramatic Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "The Haunting" last year and was happily amazed. This chilling and intriguing ghost story features four characters in a house to prove the existence of the paranormal ? or the uncanny. Directed by Robert Wise and based on Shirley Jackson's novel, "The Haunting of Hill House", we are taken on a special ride through a 1963 feature with special effects, and an element of creepiness, that still holds up.In the tale, Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson) investigates Hill House because it has a history of bearing witness to violent death, rage and insanity. Accompanying the good doctor in his quest to prove the house is actually haunted are Luke (Russ Tamblyn), who has inherited the place, wry psychic Theodora (Claire Bloom) and insecure Nell (Julie Harris). Nell is Markway's ace, not so much because of her ESP capabilities, but because the uncanny has shown itself to her since she was a child. All four characters have to face the uncanny, whether collectively or individually, but must survive the isolation and hidden terrors of Hill House in order to tell the tale.The four actors did a wonderful job in bringing the tale to life, especially since there are many layers to the story. While Dr. Markway is trying to prove his point, his male counterpart, Luke is a skeptic. Theodora likes woman and is drawn to Nell, who wants little to do with her ? after all, the mother she cared for just past away. Nevertheless, the spirits do come alive and are seemingly attracted to Nell thanks to her guilt-ridden energy and dark secret. This dramatic horror works because most often audio effects are used in lieu of the visual to get scares out of the audience. The special visual effects that are used, however, especially the expanding door, are well crafted. This is one of the reasons "Paranormal Activity" (2009) worked so well. Like "The Haunting", the horror was often suggested via audio cues and nothing more. (Many people I know who despised "Paranormal" said so because "nothing happened" in the movie. I can only imagine what they would say about "The Haunting" and other dramatic horrors.)Though the house is large, claustrophobia abounds thanks in part to the lack of an open floor plan. Each room has a door, which is significant. Opening a closed door and walking through it is akin to entering that mysterious grotto, where no one knows what is inside until one takes that first step. Furthermore, there are few things more enticing for an audience than a closed door they know a character must open. The suspense, as the character approaches the door and turns the knob, does well to keep an audience on edge. This is why the bulging door scene is so important. Audiences were most likely waiting for something to come through the door and never expected it to take on a life of its own."The Haunted" is one of my favorites because of its atmosphere, use of light, shadow and sound, and its strong narrative. Moreover, the end scene with the car, the dark woods and the damsel in distress is very eerie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1963 adaptation of Shirley Jacksons celebrated horror novel was considered one of the scariest films of all time at the time of it's release.It's a testament to all involved that it still works well today. The film is directed by Robert Wise and stars Richard Johnson, Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Lois Maxwell, Rosalie Crutchley and Russ Tamblyn.Paranormal expert Dr.John Markway(Richard Johnson)picks a team of six people to assist him in an experiment seeking proof of the paranormal.The site for all of this is the notorious Hill House built in the 1800's by the embittered Mr Crane.Over the years four women have died there in frightening circumstances,Cranes two wives,his daughter Abigail and her companion/nurse.After two of the group drop out only four remain.The other three are the nephew of the houses current owner Luke Sanderson(Russ Tamblyn),psychic (and it is strongly hinted lesbian) Theodora(Claire Bloom)and emotionally fragile Eleanor 'Nell' Lance(Julie Harris).As the days past the horror of the house begins to manifest itself,loud noises,cold spots,voices and writing on the walls.At first sceptical the others soon become convinced the house is indeed haunted.There is more here though than just a simple haunted house story.Nell's internal monologue growing more and more hysterical as she heads towards a nervous breakdown leads us instead into the territory of The Innocents dealing with psychological problems.Problems also arise when Nell realises she is falling in love with Markway. The film works so well because it plays on our fear of what we cannot see, sometimes less can be more especially in a horror film. The Hauting is a prime example of this.Is Nell somehow responsible for the haunting?is she the focus of the terror or is that just coincidence?,these are just a few of the questions raised which all add to the suspense and horror.There's fine support from Rosalie Crutchley as the terrified housekeeper of Hill House and Lois Maxwell as Markways non believer wife Grace.Still shocking and creepy today this again proves that you don't have to be awash with blood and violence to have an effective horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic adaptation of an equally classic novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when I was about eleven, and really didn't pay enough attention to it, for which I could have kicked myself. What I did see made such a big impression on me that I actually dreamt about it. But I never could seem to catch it when it came on TV. I finally did this past weekend, and it was worth the wait.The story concerns the efforts of Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) to capture paranormal activity at Hill House, an empty mansion off by itself in the country. Markway has gotten permission to stay at the house for a few weeks, and conduct experiments. Joining him are the heir to the house, Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn); Theodora (Claire Bloom), who exhibits a sense of ESP that almost amounts to mind reading; and Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris), a recluse who cared for her recently deceased mother, and through whose eyes most of the story is told. Eleanor's first impression of Hill House is that it is vile, and the more time she passes there, the more right she seems to be, and yet she is drawn to it, and unwilling to leave, even after the others see the danger she is in and try to make her go. Can she get away, or will Hill House have her? The idea of certain places being evil certainly isn't new, but Jackson's approach is quite fresh, and the film adaptation is fairly faithful to the novel. What license it takes doesn't harm the overall story. The film continually keeps you off balance, much like the characters within the story feel that they are also off balance. The end result is quite unsettling, which fits quite well with the atmosphere Jackson created in her book.The acting was outstanding, particularly from Harris, who carries the film with ease. Bloom's Theo is equally well done, coming out with remarks that unsettle the listener and the audience in a needling kind of way, and yet equally sweet in some of her scenes alone with Eleanor. Tamblyn's young playboy is well done. And Johnson's well intentioned, but ultimately inept doctor is also skillfully done.Atmospherically, this film is perfect, the brooding house, which is almost unnaturally quiet, creates an air of tension that never lets up throughout the film. And the sudden appearance and disappearance of Mrs. Markway (Lois Maxwell) helps to increase the tension, and propel the film to its inevitable conclusion.All in all, an excellent adaptation, and worth the wait of many years to finally see it without distraction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful adaptation of the Shirley Jackson book "The Haunting of Hill House". Admittedly, this is not the film for those who want blood and guts and special effects. The are few (some would say "no") special effects. This movie relies on the acting talents of Julie Harris and Claire Bloom, sound effects, odd camera angles and stark lighting to unnerve the viewer and provide suspense. Too often in newer movies, special effects are used in place of a good script and good acting. The scene where Julie Harris asks "Whose hand was I holding?" is scary because of her acting and what happens in our own imagination while we view the movie. For those interested in another good haunted house movie, I highly recommend "The Uninvited" with Ray Milland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Haunting" of 1963 is a true classic of the 'Haunted House' sub-genre of Horror, and especially amazing as it accomplishes to create a spine-chilling atmosphere and extreme creepiness without a single moment of bloodshed and hardly any action. The film which is terrifically set in a huge remote mansion, a 'House that was born bad' and that 'has stood for 90 years and may stand for 90 more', as the haunting opening sequence, in which the history of the house is narrated, proclaims.Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) who is dedicated to the exploration of the supernatural has chosen this mansion as the ideal location in order to research whether phenomena such as a 'haunting' do in fact exist. He therefore has invited a variety of people who seem to possess certain psychic abilities. Only two of the invited subjects, the cynical Theodora (Claire Bloom) and the fragile, hysterical Elanor (Julie Harris) show up, as does the heir and future owner of the mansion (Russ Tamblyn). After a short while in the house, the two women soon have to find out that the mansion has a life of its own..."The Haunting" is brilliant in its mainly psychological construction of terror. The film is perfectly photographed and Hill House must be one of the eeriest settings ever. The mansion, and particularly some of its parts such as the gloomy greenhouse or the long corridors or the equally haunting exterior parts of the house, are a true masterwork of beautifully haunting and genuinely scary set pieces. The film builds up an enormous tension, mainly by the gloomy setting, masterly cinematography and eerie sounds, as well as the clever use of silence. The cast members all do a great job, Julie Harris being the center of attention as Elanor. A character like Elanor, truly fragile, hysterical and anxious in an almost psychotic manner, may seem dated and sometimes even annoying today, but, overall, her frail temper and lots of inner monologues makes the atmosphere even more intense. Valentine Dyall and Rosaline Crutchley are very good in their small parts as the housekeepers Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, and the supporting cast includes Lois 'Miss Moneypenny' Maxwell as Dr. Markway's wife. The one negative aspect about "The Haunting" is that it sometimes drags a little throughout the middle, with some superfluously long scenes. This small flaw is easily made up for by the truly intense scare moments and genuinely creepy atmosphere in this film that keeps what the title promises: "The Haunting" truly is Haunting! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect 10.0 On The Creepometer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the scariest novel I have ever read, Shirley Jackson's 1959 classic "The Haunting of Hill House," producer/director Robert Wise &amp; Co. were able to create, four years later and to their eternal credit, the most chilling film I have ever seen: "The Haunting." This picture has been sending ice water down my spinal cord for many decades now, and last night, as I watched it for at least the dozenth time with undiminished chills, I tried to figure out just why. The film, in which a quartet of researchers spends a few nights at the famously haunted New England pile known as Hill House, features nothing per se that is frightening; no visible ghosts, no materializations, no violence or murders. Rather, through sheer power of suggestion and use of the cinematic arts, viewers are made to feel the eeriness and evil of this abode. Or ARE we? The picture is oh-so cleverly ambiguous, as was Jackson's novel, and it IS just possible that all the strange manifestations in the house (the bangings, the whisperings, the bulging doors) are rather being caused by one of the four researchers, spinster Eleanor Lance (Vance in the book...why the change?), supremely well played by Julie Harris. (Harris' interior monologues are perhaps the picture's single scariest element.) Richard Johnson as head researcher Dr. Markway (Montague in the book...again, why the change?), Claire Bloom as the (subtly inferred lesbian) ESP practitioner, and Russ Tamblyn as the house's brash young owner, all excel in their roles here; Wise's direction is masterful and impeccable; Nelson Gidding's screenplay is both ingenious and witty; and Humphrey Searle's score gives me goosebumps every time I think of it. Filmed in gorgeously creepy B&amp;W and featuring Oscar-worthy art/set decoration, the picture is truly brilliant in every department. As the original trailer so correctly put it, "You may not believe in ghosts, but you can't deny terror." Like the book on which it is based, "The Haunting" is a genuine work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Robert Wise lets our imaginations slide into overdrive. This is an eerie adaptation of Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House". Dark shadows, noisy doors and loud sounds from who-knows-where. Perfect lighting and atmosphere for a genuine horror tale. 'Nell' Lance(Julie Harris)is the skeptical heir of a reputed haunted mansion that will share her first weekend there on the hill with a parapsychologist Dr. John Markway(Richard Johnson)and other guests. It seems there are ghosts in the mansion that does not appreciate visitors. All-the-while, Nell's sanity is very questionable.Bloodless, no gore; but subtle horror exudes. Other cast members: Claire Bloom, Russ Tamblyn, Fay Compton, Valentine Dyall and Lois Maxwell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must be in top five creepiest movies EVER! It's an excellent adaptation of Shirley Jackson's novel 'The Haunting of Hill House', which is also great. The frightening, crisp black and white photography just adds to the overwhelming sense of unease which surrounds this gem. And not only is this horror, this is horror from a very psychological point of view - Julie Harris deserves an Oscar for her performance as the disturbed psychic who turns up at the house, only to be overwhelmed by its power, and dragged into its legacy of terror.A doctor who deals with the supernatural rents and old house from an equally old woman, believing it to be 'haunted' (a grave understatement), and sees it as a the ideal place to set up an experiment of his. He invites psychics Eleanor - Julie Harris - and Theo, as well as a sceptical lad to participate in this 'experiment'. And, of course, he, and the rest of the party, get a LOT more than they bargained for.Unmissable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly frightening Haunted House Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the popular short story by Shirley Jackson "The Haunting of Hill House," this movie is one of if not the finest Haunted House films made. While I, like a lot of people like films in color more than those in black and white this film works in that medium well. Award winning actress Julie Harris carries the film well as the mousy Elanore while Clair Bloom is excellent as the catty "Theo". Richard Johnson, Russ Tamblyn and the rest of the supporting cast also add to the spookiness of the moment, while the wild camera angles and truly murky set design, along with the well used but minimal special effects add up to a very successful endeavor in achieving it's goal. It is a must that you watch this one at night with the lights turned off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most frightening movies ever made. There are no "monsters", no blood, no special effects (except the door), but in your mind you conjure up even more horrific things than could ever be shown on film. The tension just keeps building. This film scared the bejeebers out of me. This is a classic horror film--one that should be watched with the lights off and a big bowl of popcorn, if you don't mind the bowl to go flying across the room when you go flying out of your chair. The remake was hollow and trite; it did not even come close to the original, regardless of special effects--it didn't even seem like the same story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychologically, The Scariest Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this movie when I was about six years old. It still, to this day, raises the hair on the back of my neck. No horror movie I have seen since evokes the same terror and stomach-tightening fear. I was particularly frightened by the scene that focused on the wallpaper in one of the bedrooms; where I saw the faces, and heard the baby crying...There is a certain fatalistic feeling that follows this movie due to the plot. I'm not sure exactly why this movie scares me so much, but much of it is the way the producer carefully crafted and built up the suspense. Nowadays they rely so much more on pyrotechnics. Back then, it was pure acting.Very good movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Ghost Story That Has Aged Very Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Haunting", an adaptation of a Shirley Jackson novel, was first shown in 1963, therefore is over 40 years old. As a horror fan for years it is interesting to view a classic film that either you haven't seen before, or to revisit it and see if it still has the impact years later. The Haunting has a classic haunted house plot, Hill House has a terrible history of murders and suicides and is being investigated as part of a scientific study into the paranormal. Four people makeup the study party and we are told the story through the eyes of Eleanor Lance, perfectly played by Julie Harris. The other members are the leader Dr. Markway, the ESP specialist and possible lesbian Theodora, and the playboy relation who hopes to inherit Hill House and rent it out, but soon discovers that this may not work very well.... The atmosphere is built up steadily, in the way a great story should be, we are introduced to all the characters although there is little character development apart from Eleanor. Once the scares begin the atmosphere of dread and something being very wrong is laid on thickly, although we are never quite sure if it is really happening or part of Eleanor's imagination. There are some really good scares which I won't mention so as to not spoil them, the acting is great all round and Robert Wise direction is spot on. The actual house looks really menacing and the interiors are shot with lot of imagination. So, a great ghost story, perfectly directed and acted, lots of suspense and some good scares. There is no gore, no blood, only one person dies (apart from in the introduction), so it may not appeal to everyone. I personally really enjoyed it and would thoroughly recommend "The Haunting" to all film fans, not just horror buffs. Like they say, they don't make 'em like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful morality play of sorts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wise's well-crafted film about a paranormal psychologist who leads a team of apt volunteers into an ornate, possibly haunted mansion to chart their reactions doesn't feature a monster and never makes tangible the presence of a supernatural element. Nevertheless, it works as an exploration of inner horror because of our forced perspective with a troubled protagonist (Julie Harris) with demons in her past. Her ubiquitous interior dialogue effectively conveys the narrative's themes regarding the terror of lineage and the inability to escape one's past. It is never certain whether the phantasms in the manse are real or simply a product of Nell's madness, but the pervasive sense of her guilt and its conjuring of a feared, but perhaps secretly desired, reckoning render this a powerful, memorable morality play of sorts.</fullReview>

The character played by Julie Harris, being so meek,and wide open to the influence of the house,fits like hand in glove to the controlling need of the house. The eeriness of the sound effects,(loud banging, moaning and an inaudible sound of talking), and the bowing of the bedroom door make the hair on your neck stand up. The best,most chilling scene was when Eleanor thought her room mate was holding her hand, while they were lying in bed..in the dark..as the sounds were doing their thing! ...NOT!!

		<fullReview>I've seen The Haunting about a dozen times since my first time in 1971 - repeated viewing of movies doesn't normally bother me. Unfortunately every time I trot this out it gets more and more contrived and pointlessly effusive to my eyes and ears - not necessarily bad in a throwaway comedy, but we're talking Deadly Serious here. It was a Woman's story turned into a horror picture for Women - and feminine foibles are not my forte!An experiment into the paranormal is arranged at the rather eerie Hill House, where the 4 experimentees bring along all their emotional skeletons for the invisible ghosts to taunt them with. Many histrionics, sudden startled glimpses in mirrors and jerky zooms later the situation gradually resolves itself into a tour of Eleanor's fraught psyche. I've always liked TH, which was masterfully directed by Robert Wise but who never quite made up for butchering The Magnificent Ambersons, even with this. Favourite bits: the moaning wallpaper in the dark, and of course the thumping monster outside the bedroom door. The production values were high, the house is perhaps worth a few repeated viewings simply to gawp at the furniture and fittings. But think how much better the atmosphere would have been if it could have been filmed on b&amp;w nitrate stock instead of the sharply defined b&amp;w of acetate safety film.Overall despite the hokiness still a marvellous film, in its field miles ahead of the rest - was a remake ever made?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see a gore, erotic horror movie don't watch this movie!!! "The Haunting" is an intelligent horror story with no blood or sex, that's the real kind of film that I prefer... Films that make us scared, but sometimes there are no need for blood to be scary. Other example of a film like this one is "The Innocents" with Deborah Kerr. The story begins with a narration by Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) that bring us back into the past, Hugh Crain chose the most remote part of New England he could find to build Hill House, an eerie, victorian castle. The house was a gift to his wife and daughter. When his wife first set eyes on the house, the horses of her carriage bolted, crashing the carriage against a big tree, from then on lots of unbloodied murders happen on the palace. Years later, Markway goes after the heir (Fay Compton) and asks her to lead him the house for a few days to an investigation of the paranormal. Together with him comes the future heir - Luke, telephatic Theodora and young and sensitive Eleanor, who's been more and more possessed by the house. This is the example of a big horror film with great direction, and great acting! If you're fan of intelligent horror films watch this one, and for those who thinks this kind of movie is boring, then rent Freddy Kruger.</fullReview>

Is it real or is it in the mind of Elenor? Is the house really evil? Does isolation do something to people? The film is gorgeous to watch, the sets and the dressing are a spectacular feast for the eyes. The acting is superb and Wise said that this is one of his best movies.

		<shortDescription>A Good Old-Fashioned Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wise was never an especially artistic director. You never sensed that he was really trying to push the limits of film as an art form with the movies he made. Yet he had a knack for creating especially well-made films. They weren't fancy, but they were far beyond merely competent.With "The Haunting," Wise gives us a truly creepy ghost story, about four characters spending time in a notorious haunted house, trying to uncover its secrets. It's reminiscent of Jack Clayton's "The Innocents" (1961)-- though it's inferior to that film -- in that the movie revolves around one emotionally unstable female, played by Julie Harris here. Because our perspective of what's happening is filtered through her mind, we can never be totally sure that we're receiving a reliable version of events. Julie Harris does well with a role that Sandy Dennis would have been cast in had this movie been made ten years later. Voice over narration giving us a constant stream of her thoughts seems overused and silly at first, but becomes more and more effective as her mental stability begins to reach its breaking point. There are overt lesbian overtones between her and the other female character (played by Claire Bloom), and Russ Tamblyn, who played Riff in Wise's 1961 film version of "West Side Story," makes an appearance as the lone skeptic of the bunch."The Haunting" is yet one more example of how bad today's horror movies are. Any director now would have filled this film with any number of cheesy CGI effects (and probably did--I haven't seen the 1999 remake), but Wise creates an incredibly scary film using some sound effects and fancy camera angles. Tension builds so effectively that the only true "effect" in the film (a breathing door) becomes more frightening than any CGI effect could have been.The film is marred by a clunky, ham-fisted ending, but the rest of the film is so exquisitely creepy that by the time it comes the movie has had its effect on you, regardless of how it ends.A great film to watch during the Halloween season. This and "The Innocents" would actually make a terrific double feature.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film undoubtedly belongs to the fabulous actress Ms. Julie Harris! Probably her greatest screen performance ever, she leads the movie from start to finish.It is difficult to highlight the highs to this film, as there are so many, and nigh on impossible to name the lows, since it doesn't really have any.Gripping from the opening flashbacks to this creepy place called 'Hill House' to the closing scenes of the car crash.Unknown to many, this film was made and shot in the United Kingdom, though many believe mistakenly that it is American in origin. This is probably due to the very convincing American accents used by two Great British actresses; Claire Bloom and Diane Clare.The absolute highest point of the movie for me, is the unmerciful 'banging' that can be heard faintly to begin with, in the dead of night, growing louder and louder, until it starts to make the ornaments vibrate on the top of your TV set!Much of this is lost unfortunately, when it is viewed on a shop-bought Video release copy. This film is best watched as it is aired on TV. Much of the film's magic and creepiness, sadly, is also lost in the wide screen format, which is the only format that was used when releasing the Video.There is an added bonus to this movie, in that even the character roles such as the late, great Rosalie Crutchley's 'Mrs. Dudley' and the ageing 'Abigail' played by Amy Dalby (undeservedly uncredited) are so important to the general success of this great movie. Nobody's contribution is too small or unimportant. Diane Clare gives a super performance as the spiteful 'Carrie Fredricks', the married sister of Eleaner Lance.If you ever get the opportunity to visit the house, or indeed the location (i.e. outdoor shots, and roads used) where this film was made, then it's an unforgettable experience!Unmissable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scientist, Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) decides to investigate reports of ghosts at Hill House, a 90-year old New England mansion, in the 1963 thriller The Haunting. Derived from Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, the film opens with a long voice-over narration describing the dark history of Hill House in great detail, then fast-forwards to the present.Dr. Markway comes to investigate Hill House with the disbelieving prospective owner Luke (Russ Tamblyn) and two woman researchers, Eleanor (Julie Harris), a fragile loner who has been living by herself after her mother's death, and Theodora (Claire Bloom), a brazen lesbian clairvoyant. Hill House gives them more than they bargained for, much more.When Eleanor starts to hear banging, she recalls her mother's knocks on her wall that she failed to respond to and is wracked with guilt. She comes to believe Hill House wants something from her, something that she seems ready to give. The house feels almost alive with its brooding presence, it's dark winding staircases, and creaky doors ready to fly open or bang shut.Shot in black and white, the film is very stylish and the use of long shadows and darkened windows create an eerie and forbidding mood. Of course, like in all good horror films, what you don't see of course is scarier than what you do. Though there is a lot of screaming, crying, banging, and doorknob turning, the ghosts just taunt the occupants and get into their heads but hide their creepy presence.One of the scariest scenes is where Eleanor lies in bed at night, terrified by the noises. In fear, she holds onto what she thinks is Theo's hand, but realizes in the morning that Theo was in the room next door all night. `Oh my God, whose hand was I holding?", she wonders.Though I found The Haunting to be a well made film and very atmospheric with some scary moments, the melodramatic characters are so insufferable that I didn't care much about their fate. I also found Eleanor's incessant voice-over narration to be quite irritating and the dialogue pretty silly. For example, when Dr. Markway's wife Grace visits Hill House, she sleeps in the nursery. When the foursome go to see how she's doing, Grace is nowhere to be found. Theo says to Markway, "Is this your idea of a joke?" This after the guests had spent three nights of unspeakable terror.I know that The Haunting is considered to be one of the best horror films of all time but, for me, it just did not add up to the classic I expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the finest horror films ever made, in both story and style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Robert Wise constructs a well-told lesson in how what you cannot see is truly more terrifying than what you can. The film, based upon Shirley Jackson's novel, takes the best of Jackson's words and puts them to use on the screen. The use of sound, often the source of the terror, is uncanny and is more frightening than most modern day special FX extravaganzas. The key to "The Haunting" is its subtlety. A shadow here, an open door there, and a little banging on the wall are all that's needed to make a truly horrifying film. The film's style is what makes the story scary. Throughout the entire film "Hill House" (the haunted house Markway and his associates Nell, Theo, and Luke investigate) fails to produce one visual clue as to what causes the haunting. Yet the film dictates to the audience what should terrify them with the use of dramatic lighting. Long shadows and black windows that seem to reach hell within a few inches of air keep the visual platform on which the film is based unsteady and thus when a simple out-of-place sound is heard it is frightening beyond belief.A word to those horror film buffs out there: if you have not seen this film, do so right NOW! Recent films, such as "Event Horizon," and the indie super-hit "The Blair Witch Project," have used many of the same techniques to terrify audiences. Overall, "The Haunting" may not be the best film ever made. I will admit that Nell's narration throughout the film does get old and at some times annoying. But the acting, while sometimes campy, is amazingly fit for the picture. The Haunting is a visually perfect film, ripe with strange camera angles, beautiful sets, and dramatic lighting that would make most noirs blush. The haunting is a must for any horror film admirer.I would also recommend:Event HorizonThe ShiningThe Blair Witch Project</fullReview>

Everything is suggested; Theo may be a lesbian, Markway may love Eleanor, but we are never actually told this. The action is spread nicely too, with my favourite scene being the "Face on the wall" which inspired many childhood nightmares! It is a masterpiece, and certainly my No 1 horror movie of all time.

		<fullReview>The Haunting is a somber, moody, stylish haunted house film, adapted from the marvelous Shirley Jackson story "The Haunting of Hill House". This film is another forgotten gem in a genre full of coal, proving yet again that spine-tingling horror does not need mad slashers, buckets of blood, or nubile teenagers. This is old school horror, where things really do go BUMP in the night; where you begin to suspiciously eye the walls around you while you watch. This moovie will make you walk quickly past every dark closet, every shadowed room, every black corner of your own house. Scientific studies at MooCow University have shown that electric bills increase following every viewing of this film, as lights in dark houses are switched on in terror! ;=8) Ok, enough hyperbole; the fact is The Haunting is first-rate, from the beautifully shot interiors to the palpable atmosphere and tension. Some of the actors do tend to ham it up a bit, particularly Clair Bloom, who's edgy, too-quirky performance borders on irritation. Overall, a very fine effort that all horror fans should see - especially late at night, alone in the house, with all the lights out, heehehehheheheheheheee!!!! ;=8)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once upon a time in the history of Horror movies, some movies were actually frightening. The 80'ies changed most of that, but some masterpieces from days long gone still remains. One of those is The Haunting (1963).Everything in this movie has been done the way it should be done, an excellent intro with a narrator telling the somber history of Hill House complete with very artistic photography, the building phase in the movie where their arrival at Hill House is imminent, and the actual movie so to say when the House begins to breathe and live again. From there it's full of beautiful scenes and absolutely horrific moments. The four very mismatched characters in the movie do their best to withstand Hill House, and the result is in the movie.The main character, excellently portraied by Julie Harris, suffers the most, and its upon her development in the movie where the focus is. The technique used to follow it mostly consists of us 'hearing her thoughts', as she ponders upon the mystery of Hill House.The movie presents a big contrast to the effect seeking likes of Scream(1/2/and 3 I suspect), Urban Legend etc where no actual horror can be found. In those movies someone kills some guys, and the way to make it scary is to make it 'sudden' so you jump in your seat (at the VERY best), but The Haunting uses a lot more subtle technique... A slow, creeping atmosphere that you can almost touch, full of horror and promise of the most terrible fate imaginable, impossible sounds of no human origin comming from anywhere. Also worth mentioning is the setting of the movie, the house where the movie takes place is nothing less than fantastic, it features very heavy furnishing, gothic statues and the works. It definately makes the superb photography even more enjoyable.I can only rate this movie 10/10, a horror classic, which is a must see for everyone, and not just horror-fans for which it must be rated see-or-die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An EXTREMELY creepy film! What I like best about the film is that you never really SEE any of the ghosts....everything is done with sound effects (and, in one scene, the door moving in).The scene where Julie Harris is "holding her friend's hand" in bed (&amp; the "door scene") gives me the creeps every time I see it!!!The only (possible) fault of this film is that the beginning (showing Harris' character's "home life") is a bit long, but is necessary to the plot.This film, to me, marks the "End of the Last Great Horror Films"....after this, the gore/slasher films took over, &amp; the TRUE horror film has never returned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most frightening movies in cinema in my book...is still "The Exorcist" (1973). "The Haunting", however, does rank up there as well. If you're looking for a movie that's similar to "Poltergeist" (1982)...then don't rent this movie. There isn't a lot of blood and gore here. But, what does work about this movie...something that "Poltergeist" did have in bits and pieces are the different things that could make us cringe in a haunted house. Remember the scene in "Poltergeist" with the young boy's clown on the chair??? (I remember the audiences' reaction!!!!) This film has the same formula...only in larger proportions. The door that suddenly blows open...the voices that speak in the night...the walls that move...the invisible mass of weight that comes to sit on the edge of your bed at night...but when you go to look...nothing is there. It is these things in this movie that really do the trick for me. The acting, pace, tone, black and white cinematography, set design, music, and direction are superb. I found these characteristics to be the most chilling parts of the movie. I hope the remake isn't going to try and ruin the original or try to be like "Poltergeist". I think what really worked about "The Exorcist" over all the rest is that it had a religious theme, shocking head-spinner sequences, acting, and special effects. Want to do something scary with a group of people on Halloween night???? Then, you should watch "The Exorcist" and "The Haunting" back-to-back...and shut the lights off. You WILL go to sleep with the lights on...I guarantee it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like blood and guts, there are plenty of "SLICE AND DICE" movies available elsewhere (vomit bag at extra charge). However, if you prefer a HORROR classic in which the supernatural is inferred instead of "gushed" -- this one is for you. Nothing is actually seen, yet the effects are all too apparent, leaving the viewer at liberty to conjure in his own mind the substance and nature of the "monster(s)". Of course, this IS the most effective and savvy method to use. Excellent, SERIOUS performances by all actors leave absolutely no room for any levity -- compels your rapt attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful haunted house movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on a television late show and even with the commercial interruptions I was almost in shock. The story line is a scientific investigation of a haunted house by an anthropologist and a team that includes two psychics. Like most good films of this type the viewer can never be sure if the house is really haunted or if it is imagination of the characters. There are no gruesome killings and hardly any blood but the mood of the piece and the excellent acting of the cast brings more goose bumps than any slasher film ever can.I am tempted to compare this film to THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE but there is little to compare. While Hell House has much the same premise it lacks the craftsmanship that went into THE HAUNTING. I have often listed this as probably the best haunted house movie ever made and nothing has come along to make me change my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A master class in how to make a great haunted house movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the cannon of haunted house movies, The Haunting works because it is more interested in characters than throwing special effects around. It involves an experiment by the gung-ho Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson, who bears an odd resemblance to Clark Gable) to capture and record any supernatural activity in a 90-year old mansion called Hill House. In the opening narration, Markway spins a yarn about Hugh Crain, an old miser who built the house for his bride who died in an accident only moments before laying eyes on the place. Crain, despite the tragedy, moved himself and his daughter Abigail into the house where they both lived a considerably miserable existence for the rest of their lives. The house, which we are led to believe was simply "born bad," seemed to have an effect on several people who have occupied it's space, not the least of which were Crain's second wife who died from a nasty tumble down the stairs and Abigail's caretaker who went mad and hanged herself.Markway, who approaches his experiment with all the gusto of a game hunter planning an African safari, carefully selects three people to spend the weekend in the old Gothic manor with him. They include: Eleanor (Julie Harris), a troubled young woman who witnessed a poltergeist disturbance as a child and has led a haunted life ever since. Theodora (Claire Bloom), a clairvoyant socialite who is secretly in love with Eleanor but keeps it bottled up, and Luke (Russ Tamblyn), a non-believer who stands to inherit the house and is happy to make wisecracks about all this supernatural hoo-ha.The character dynamics are set in place pretty early on but most of the focus is on Eleanor, who has spent several years waiting hand and foot for her sick, demanding mother. Now that her mother is gone, Eleanor wishes to break free and find a life of her own. She's too troubled, really, to inhabit a place like Hill House which has a history of working a sort of psychological torment the emotionally fragile. We spend a great deal of the film hearing her internal monologue as her sense of self-preservation, at first, tells her not to go to the house and keeps telling her this all through the film. She is convinced that the entire house is evil, that it will consume her but somehow she cannot turn away.The personal drama in Eleanor's head is well-written, helping us understand the massive toll that the house has on someone with a troubled mind. We can see that in the architecture of the house both outside and in. Driving up to the place, Eleanor's inner monologue tells her that the house is "staring at me" and indeed we see two veranda windows that look like big ugly eyes. Added to the effect are dark clouds that seems to always hang over the place (Wise's cinematographer took the image of a clear sky and reversed the negative so that clouds would appear black).The exterior of the house shows us a wide, forbidding old manor that defies anyone to approach. While it seems well-made it seems like a fortress, a place designed carefully but not exactly welcoming. The interior of the house seems to have no specific plan, every inch of the place is over-decorated. There are rooms that are expansive but seem strangely abstract. Markway explains that Crain "designed the place to suit his mind". Looking at the blind corners and confusing layouts, the place seems to have been designed to trap the inhabitants because with so many twisty hallways and empty dead ends it seems very easy to get lost. Even Eleanor's bed looks like a cage with a canopy like a net ready to drop on her.There are specific details to the house that are brilliant, like the strange angelic statuaries, silent, ghastly and ghost white, not the least of which is a bizarre statue of a saint out the conservatory that seems to be a symbol of Crain's obsessions. There is a spiral staircase that isn't firmly mounted to the wall and seems designed to be a booby trap. At the top is a dizzying upper landing that seems designed to pull someone back down the hard way.Using the web of architectural confusion in the house, Wise is able to mount the scary scenes simply by observing the house's strange layout. The first disturbance take place in Eleanor's bedroom as she and Theo hear a bizarre, rhythmic pounding that moves toward their door, then over their heads, then back down to the door where there is a bone-jangling smashing sound. It is all done with light and shadow and sound. We never see any ghosts, but we feel their presence outside the door. Later there are voices that seem to come from the room next door and we, the viewer, strain to hear what is being said (closed captions don't help). Most unnerving is that this male voice sounds like a strange incantation followed by a small child crying. What's going on? Our minds fill in the blanks.The fact that we never see the ghosts in The Haunting is a plus, we hear the pounding and the voices when we are in Eleanor's room and so when she leaves the room and we see those white statues, we somehow expect that one of them will be a ghost. The black and white photography and the choice to shoot at odd angles work on our minds, we see things in the shadows and in the corners and we aren't sure if we're seeing something supernatural or not. The use of light and shadow here is brilliant feeding on those expectations even when they come to nothing. This is an example, like Polanski's Repulsion, (my favorite film of 1965) of a film that achieves mood and tone. Here is a movie that creates fear out of our expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Scariest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After many years and limited titles, I have finally discovered a new film to go with the ones that actually get the hairs on the back of my neck to shoot up on end. The Haunting is a masterpiece from director Robert Wise, the kind that comes rarely in a distinguished career. There is hardly anything I can find in this film that is remotely lacking. I rarely say this... this movie genuinely made me afraid.The story thank goodness is actually very solid. A professor's keen interest in the supernatural leads him to create a group of "established" parapsychologists and ESP experts and observe the goings on of a aged property called Hill House. One of the invited, Nell (played by Julie Harris), is a mentally unstable woman who harbors deep fears and insecurities about herself and her place in the oppressive world around her. Eventually the house-guests begin to experience paranormal activity and hear sounds that send them into absolute terror. Nell however believes that this haunting may be for a reason that the others can't understand like she can.The execution of this seemingly simple story actually becomes very complicated, and keeps you guessing at every turn. As a viewer, we aren't exactly sure if the sounds are coming from the house itself or the minds of the house-guests, more specifically Nell's own tortured mind. Much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, this particular story is made all the more suspenseful and scary in what we do not see, and what our subconscious presents to us. Some of the images become so disturbing and creepy that we actually begin to doubt what is real, which is the sign of ingenuity in storytelling.In what initially annoyed me in the acting, eventually changed to empathy and wanting to help these characters. Initially, Julie Harris' Nell is a very mousy character who grated. But as the film progresses and the haunting becomes more intense, her insecurities and delusions about her lack of respect from the others begin to consume her, much like her romantic notions about the house when she arrives. The other actors, including Claire Bloom (Charly) and Russ Tamblyn (West Side Story) and Richard Johnson as the surprisingly honest Professor Markway do good jobs trying to portray flawed people thrown into an uncomfortable situation.The atmosphere of this movie is immense and breathtaking. The old unchanged look of the house gives off the impression of the Gothic, and the cinematography and lighting emphasizes this. I think this is the first film from the 60s that I've seen that uses very odd techniques and pan shots to convey a sense of mind bending terror and confusion very effectively and stunningly. The sets and statues in this movie gives off a very menacing presence adding to the chilling atmosphere.While it may not be the scariest movie ever, and believe me there are very few movies that are truly scary, this one really got me cold and shivering as we went from one encounter to the next. Practically every aspect of this production works very well. This visit to Hill House is definitely worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie I believe a Saturday night in 1965. My mother loved scary movies and I stayed up with her to watch this one. I still remember jumping in the beginning from all the horrible deaths that starts the movie out. Each scene builds horrors up in your own mind as they play out .There was no millions of dollars on special effects ,it didn't need them. Robert wise and the cast did a great job of putting the horror in your head ,the booming sounds the door breathing in and out door knobs turning all were enough for me to hide under a blanket next to mom peering out only when I thought it was safe! I bought the blue ray version and watched it again on a big screen TV. It was awesome still made me jump and not afraid to say I had a hard time sleeping that night! Defiantly a movie to watch at Halloween time you wont regret it. I wish modern day directors could make movies like this but sadly they rely on special effects and in my opinion you're mind is the best maker of chilling effects you will ever need!! please watch the movie and see for you're self !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie when it was a remake with Roddy McDowell and Catherine Zeta-Jones. It was good then and the original is even better because they had less special effects than the remake. Julie Harris seems to be the main character. She is a sensitive, at least that is what I believe they are called now. The doctor who gets the people together for this escapade is trying to prove that the metaphysical exists (ghosts, evil spirits, etc) and learns he is more correct than he would ever have liked to know. This original film is a bit different than the remake. Julie Harris is killed and her spirit becomes part of the house. In the remake she just becomes the house's caretaker and frees all the children's soul from their entrapment in the woodwork. I actually liked the remake better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*May contain spoilers* The first time I saw this movie was in 1965 when I was 8 years old. It was shown on TV, and I remember watching it with my siblings absolutely spellbound, glued to the tube. For many years afterwards, I would not fall asleep with a hand outside the covers, thanks to Eleanor's terrifying experience.Seeing it again recently was a vivid reminder of just how scary this movie is -- it is deeply and satisfyingly creepy. And of course, it's a brilliant testimonial to the fact that one needs no (or few) special effects to create very real terror.There are two things I want to talk about: 1) Robert Wise's direction and 2) Eleanor's character and Julie Harris' Oscar-worthy performance of her.1. Everybody loves Robert Wise cuz of The Sound of Music and The Day The Earth Stood Still. Not to take away anything from those movies, but if I was teaching a film class, I'd make my students do a shot-by-shot, scene-by-scene deconstruction of this film to teach them how to make every shot count. There is not one single frame of this movie that's careless. You can dress up the best sets, you can prop up the best actors with a nifty story, but that won't guarantee diddly. Silly shooting diffuses energy. Deliberate direction can, step-by-step, stretch and strain the viewer's nerves with careful precision. Wise made this movie with all the care of a mosaic artist. The camera conspires with the music to push in, pull out, tilt, back off, show us the house gloating in the moonlight, bring us inside poor Eleanor's head, til we don't know what's real and what's not.I can't say enough, too, about the wonderfully effective music in this movie by a guy named Humphrey Searle.2. The scariest part of the show isn't the house, it's the character of Eleanor Lance. She is a plain woman who has been taking care of her invalid mother all her adult life. She has no friends and nowhere to go when her mother dies, no money, no means of supporting herself. She lives with her snotty sister, sleeping on their couch, feeling in the way, being condescended to, treated as a fifth wheel. She's overjoyed when she is invited to participate in the study at Hill House. Someone *wants* her.Eleanor's need to be liked and to be included is heartbreaking. She warms and purrs under Dr. Markway's praise. She blooms as her new pal Theo teases her into little girly bonding rituals like toenail-painting or a new hair-doo. You can see her thinking as she sits at the dinner table, making witty remarks, included in the lighthearted banter, "Look at me, I have friends, I can do this. I am included." Eleanor may not be the brightest or shiniest, but she has the benefit of self-knowledge. She's not afraid of a haunted house, she tells us; she's always been more afraid of things like being left alone or left out. How chilling. She sleeps on her left side because she read somewhere it weakens the heart. For some reason, this line stayed with me as much as any of the others in this movie in the years to come. The haunting image of a woman who deliberately chooses to shorten her own life. Why? Julie Harris' face is a mirror of all the naked emotion inside Eleanor. Her trembling desire for romance with Markway, her disdain for Luke's roughness, her attraction to Theo... She is little by little seduced by the house as it singles her out. This is what makes me special, then. I am wanted by the house. How quickly she seizes on this: I am needed. Someone or something wants me. When Markway's wife arrives, we share her anguish as her little romantic fantasy evaporates -- but it's not just that. Mrs. Markway usurps her place not only as the focus of the doctor's attention, but also that of the house.We never know whether the house kills Eleanor or not. The stubborn ambiguities remain. Is it a murderous house intent on adding to the roll call of the dead? Or is is an unhappy place that preys upon susceptible minds, drives them past reason with isolation, doubt, fear? As I grew up, I can see now, I carried Eleanor Lance inside me. I recognized her. I too was afraid of being left out, of being abandoned, far more than I feared the dark corner behind the furnace. This was what I feared most: being insignificant, invisible, having no one, no connections, nothing to tie me to others. Being plain, the object of scorn, pity. Nameless regrets. Being dull, having nothing of value to offer.Eleanor's desperate loneliness is far more terrifying than the haunting of Hill House.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Growing up I wasn't the biggest fan of the older horror movies. You know, the ones from the 60s and back. It wasn't that I thought they were bad films, just boring. But people change and so do their tastes, and that's why I've learned to appreciate the classics from back in the day. Unfortunately, I saw the remake of this film, The Haunting, before seeing the original. Don't make the same mistake I did.Pros: Beautifully directed and the cinematography is equally gorgeous. The house itself is also a great piece of eye candy due to it's architecture. Excellent performances by the small cast. A nice and effectively creepy score. Moves at a slow, but steady pace that never drags. The emphasis is more on atmosphere and subtle scares than special effects. Plus, unlike most modern horror films, the viewer is allowed to use their imagination.Cons: No real explanation for why the house is haunted. The ending's a bit drawn out.Final thoughts: It's interesting to see how things have changed in the haunted house subgenre since this film. While the modern ones usually have a lot of special effects to scare viewers, the ones of yesteryear were more subtle and depended more ons suspense and atmosphere to get as reaction. Nowaday's this film isn't isn't really that terrifying, but it has held up well because of how well made it is, how good the acting is, and so on. If you're looking for something different in a ghost story after seeing newer classics like 'Poltergeist' and 'The Amityville Horror,' then check this one out.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that, nowadays, a vast majority of horror directors simply don't understand the prime rule of the genre: the less the audience sees, the scarier it is for us. In nine scenarios out of ten (there are, of course, exceptions), there is simply nothing more terrifying than the unknown; of what could be lurking in the dark, a force that we can't see and couldn't possibly comprehend. Fortunately, this rule is obviously something that multi-talented director Robert Wise ('The Day the Earth Stood Still,' 'The Sound of Music') understood diligently, and I was pleased to discover that the 'The Haunting' is one of the most frightening horror films ever made, a masterpiece of paranoia, suspense and near-surrealism.The character of Eleanor "Nell" Lance (Julie Harris) sits at the very heart of the film. Having been confined to her home for the past twelve years to nurse her ailing mother, Nell has a rather peculiar personality, possessing ill-developed social skills, low self-esteem and lacking a chosen direction for her life. After the death of her mother, she privately blames herself, at once both mournful and relieved that her great burden has been lifted. Throughout the film, an always-nervy Nell narrates her character's thoughts, perhaps a slightly intrusive and distracting film technique at first, but it later becomes imperative to the narrative, as we slowly realise the importance of her character, and how Nell's mind is gradually becoming unwound amid the mystery and paranoia.The "haunted" house in question is known as Hill House, an ominous-looking mansion with a sinister 90-year past. During a gripping prologue, we are escorted through the disturbing history of Hill House, which involved numerous horrific "accidents," a possible murder and a suicide. From the opening seconds, Wise has already captured the attention of the audience, and he continues to hold it until the devastating final frames. The film is the work of an incredibly assured director; of one who is confident that what we don't see is usually more important than what we do. For most of the part, 'The Haunting' is smoothly and glossily shot. However, cinematographer Davis Boulton knows exactly when to start moving the camera about, the frame unexpectedly becoming unstable and distorted when the threat of danger begins to approach. Masterful use of lighting and mirrors serve to intensify the horror of the inexplicable events taking place all about us, and there is an ever-present element of menace and, indeed, sentience whenever we are inside the suspect building.A strong supporting cast assists in making the film so very memorable. Richard Johnson plays Dr. John Markway, the kind and intelligent anthropologist who has taken a keen interest in investigating the paranormal, and who heads the group's expedition to explore the infamous Hill House. Russ Tamblyn is wryly amusing as Luke Sanderson, the skeptical nephew of the current landlords, whose only thought is to become wealthy trough inheriting the old mansion. Claire Bloom is a long way from her innocent cinematic debut in Chaplin's 'Limelight (1952),' as Theodora, the cynical clairvoyant who (very possibly) feels an attraction to Nell.All in all, 'The Haunting' is among the finest horror films ever produced, the levels of suspense rivaling that produced by even the greatest of Alfred Hitchcock's works (notably, the excellent 'The Birds' was reduced in the same year). My only regret is that I watched 'The Haunting' on the small screen, from an old VHS with much left to be desired in the way of picture and sound quality. My instincts tell me that here is a film that would be absolutely magnificent on the big screen, and I can only hope that the opportunity comes along at one point or another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a movie about the horrors of loneliness and repression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i kept thinking while watching this movie that it could have been made without any special effects as a psychological thriller about insanity rather than a horror film. Julie Harris' character has lived an unfulfilled life of repression and loneliness and sees Hill house as an escape. she is desperate to connect with the people she meets at Hill house, she needs them because she doesn't want to have to go back to the empty horror that is her life of repression under her domineering sister. when she finds that her host Mr. Markway is married the real world is cut off to her and so in some sense she weds herself to the house itself, because the house is the only thing in her life that gave her a chance to be someone and not finding life anywhere else, ultimately she stays the only way she knows how, she hurls her car into the tree that brought an end to the first mistress of the house. her character's desperation is far more frightening than mere horror, because it is far more real and something all of us know something about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the silly remake; this "Haunting" is the real one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wise's recent passing brings "The Haunting" to mind. Less of a horror movie than a psychological thriller, it has Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris) coming to old house with several other people invited by Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson). This is no ordinary house; it has a very disturbing history. And the answers to the creepy incidents that have taken place may be closer than anyone realizes.What makes this movie so good is that it relies on camera angle (rather than gore and special effects, as usually seems to happen now) to create the horror. You literally can't tell when something is going to happen. The only thing that gives the movie a slightly silly feeling is the presence of Lois Maxwell (aka Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond movies) as Dr. Markway's wife Grace. Still, it's a horror classic. The 1999 remake, as far as I could tell, was deliberately trying to be silly; if so, then they sure succeeded, because that was a poor excuse for a movie. This one is the real "Haunting".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are certain films that are what we might call "by the book." This is to say they are made in a standard way was is typical of it's genre and sub-genres. This isn't always a bad thing, as it provides a good structure to begin with and a good director will add some to those bones and do something original."The Haunting" wrote the book. This is how haunted house films should be. The use of the camera, the clever set pieces, the sound all perfect for suggesting terrors rather than shoving them in your face. There are moments in this movie that are so unnerving it's unreal, truly one of the greatest horror movies of all time. Why is that you might ask? Because they implied and used the power of suggestion rather than shoved gore and monsters in your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A psychological horror film without equal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film way back in 1968 and although I was in my late twenties and had seen other horror movies before, this film scared the pants off me. Its a psychological horror and without all the usual blood and gore. Since then I have watched this film at least a dozen times and it still continues to scare me especially the music which is well suited to this type of film. I rate this as the best horror film, second only to "The Spiral Staircase". I tried to introduce my son, who was 16 at the time to watch The Haunting, but halfway through he and a friend thought it too spooky and stopped. For anybody who watches this film for the first time, watch it at night to get the full effect and have the smelling salts at hand (haha). Another aspect of this film which makes it real spooky is "Hill House" and when you see Eleanor Lance driving up to the house and she remarks " the house is watching me" and the camera takes you to the turrets and spires of the house that scene alone is scary. All credit goes to the author of the novel and the director. By coincidence this film is being shown tonight ie 5th September 2005 on TCM at 2325 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't know if Ghosts exist, or if Houses are really Haunted.But from time to time strange things happen. We live in a House in which we occasionally hear noises perhaps a sigh or whisper. Or for example someone using the stairs when we know we are alone. Not really scary stuff, with time you just get used to it and laugh it off.But when your alone and late at night you don't watch ghost films just in case.So that's really the reason why I consider The Haunting to be just about the best supernatural film made. Perhaps extreme in places but the fact is you never see anything just noises and that uneasy feeling that your not alone.The remake is disappointing, a typical Hollywood movie that relies on special effects and frankly loses all credibility.so enjoy the film for what it is, a study of the unknown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful ghost story delving into the human psyche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film a few times and although the intimations of paranormal activity are incredibly chilling, providing the requisite shivers, it seems to me that this film is less a `ghost story,' in the supernatural sense, and more a meditation on the personal ghosts and/or demons each human stores within their memory.Our heroine, Eleanor Lance, has only just realized an identity separate from that of nurse to her invalid mother, who has died only two months prior to the beginning of the film, after eleven years of Eleanor's constant care. When we first meet her, she is incredibly desperate, begging her family to allow her a `vacation' -- Dr. Markaway's invitation to participate in the experiments at Hill House.She admits constantly, in both her mind's voice &amp; to her fellow paranormal investigators, that she has been waiting all her life for something to happen to her - after eleven years of sleeping on her sister's couch &amp; tending to her mother's every need, functioning basically as a servant, and possibly considered little more than a nuisance by her immediate family - it is no surprise that she should seem addled with mediocrity.As the film progresses, we meet her demons, rooted in a childhood experience with a poltergeist (a subject about which she is incredibly reticent to speak and, when she does, can only parrot the pitiful explanation her mother afforded her as a child,) and her own guilt regarding her mother's death - that perhaps she allowed her mother to die because of her own sheer exhaustion.One can never truly determine whether or not her experiences at Hill House are nothing more than delusions - her overpowering, palpable desire to be wanted/needed/considered something unique &amp; special - and that her abject willingness to give herself over to Hill House seems to be a direct result of her underlying terror of returning to a world wherein she has been so easily overlooked in the past.From my perspective, the most fascinating aspect of the film is Eleanor's need - it gives dimension to the atmosphere and could certainly be the cause for all the house's disturbances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hill House had stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paranormal researcher Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson) gathers three people to stay with him at Hill House, an old mansion with a deadly history. He hopes the reputedly haunted house can provide evidence of the paranormal. The three others in his group are Luke (Russ Tamblyn), an heir of the woman who owns the house, psychic Theodora (Claire Bloom), and Eleanor (Julie Harris), a troubled woman who experienced poltergeist activity as a child. It doesn't take long before strange things start to happen in the house and it seems to affect Eleanor most of all.Robert Wise's adaptation of Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House" is a bona fide horror classic that's influenced countless movies over the years. Wise was a director who proved he could excel at any genre he tackled. His first horror movies were when he worked with Val Lewton on some of his wonderful films from the '40s. Lewton's approach to horror was to leave a lot to the viewer's imagination. Show them just enough to get their wheels spinning but never enough to say definitively that the horrors were real and not just in the mind. This ambiguous approach that focused heavily on the psychological clearly influenced Wise's direction here. So many of the scares here are suggested rather than overt.The film benefits from a small cast. Richard Johnson is a solid actor who gives what could easily be a stuffy character some personality. His opening narration sends chills down your spine. Russ Tamblyn is the flippant young man foisted upon Johnson's team. He has a memorable final line. Claire Bloom is terrific as the spiciest character in the film, subtext-laden Theodora. Julie Harris is the one that seems to divide viewers most. Some, like myself, find her performance as the nervous, frightened, and unbalanced Eleanor very authentic and deserving of praise. Others have said she's over the top, unrelatable, and hard to like. You'll have to see it and judge for yourself. The real star of the film is the house itself. The exteriors were shot at Ettington Hall and the interiors were very believable sets created by Elliott Scott. After skimming through the reviews here, I was disappointed to see so many negatives. Most of which were the same: too boring, too slow, etc. I hate to generalize and I hate to play the "what's wrong with today's generation" card...but man it depresses me a little. I guess that's what happens when kids grow up plopped down in front of a TV or computer screen from an early age. Everything has to be shocking and violent. Like all the great horror films (not just cheap slasher dreck), it's best watched late at night. There's much to appreciate about this (pardon the pun) haunting classic. The script, acting, score, cinematography, and direction are all superb. It's a truly frightening film at times with an uneasy atmosphere throughout. A film that everybody should see at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest ghost movie ever made... period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a die-hard fan of the supernatural, in all of its many forms. But after fifty-years of watching nearly every film of the genre, "The Haunting" remains my all-time favorite, dare I say, a "perfect" movie. For any film to be considered great, it must contain all of the elements required for this rare honor, and this one succeeds in spades, in every, single category. First, the cast. Remarkable. But perhaps this film belongs to the often underrated Julie Harris, ideal for the role of the tortured victim of the house, and the wonderfully conflicted, temporary roommate to Ms. Harris, Claire Bloom. The male lead of Dr. Markway was played to perfection by another British stage actor, Richard Johnson, who interestingly had just turned down the seminal role of James Bond, relinquishing the plum role to a young Sean Connery. The fourth member of the terrific ensemble was a young Russ Tamblyn, whose exuberance and disbelief in the supernatural lent an youthful note of sarcasm to the superb cast. The script by Nelson Gidding, based upon the book "The Haunting of Hill House" by Shirley Jackson, was of equal quality, and the cinematography, in my opinion, was nothing less than masterful, utilizing lighting techniques and camera angles that still surpasses everything else in memory. But any great film requires the steady hand of an equally capable director, which they found in Robert Wise, one of the greatest directors in movie history. It was his concept to shoot the entire film in black-and-white, the touch of genius that brought an eerie, stark quality to the entire production that truly makes this movie stand out from all the others. But 'The Haunting's' true emotional impact rests in its total command of PSYCHOLOGICAL terror, in lieu of the typical blood and gore of its many, many predecessors. In fact, during the entire 2-hours, you never see a single ghost! Yet between the exquisite filming, taut acting, and simple sound effects, this remarkable film caused more wholesale screaming in its debut than any other "ghost movie" in memory. So grab your popcorn, turn up the volume, and prepare yourself to be scared out of your wits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tribute to Robert Wise's talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched "The Haunting" recently on TCM -- some 25 years after I first saw it -- and my reaction was how much director Robert Wise was influenced by Orson Welles and "Citizen Kane." Then I looked up Wise's bio and realized it may have been just the opposite. Wise was the editor of "Citizen Kane" and clearly contributed to its riveting style. As acclaimed as Wise was for big musicals like "Sound of Music" and "West Side Story," he also directed two 'horror' movies which, like "The Haunting," relied on psychological terror rather than explicit imagery -- "The Body Snatchers" and "The Curse of the Cat People." As for Wise's adroit use of sound effects in "The Haunting" (from the pounding that echoes through the halls of Hill House to the click of a spectral doorknob,) that's no surprise. Wise's early career was as a sound editor on films as disparate as "Top Hat" and "The Informer."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I don't care for horror movies as I don't care for the blood and gore. But a few horror movies are more a psychological horror movie, and encourage you to use your imagination, and this is one of them. Sometimes you wonder if the events are real or in one of the character's mind.Modern audiences accustomed to today's gorefests and special effects may be bored by the movie as it conveys the horror through lighting, shadows, sound, camera angles, the odd and creepy house, and the character's reactions. I think it works. I enjoyed the movie.Also interesting was the character subplot where Luke liked Theodora, who liked Eleanor, who liked Dr. Markway, who had a wife who shows up later in the movie to drive the story forward. These interactions usually were understated and complemented the haunted house spookiness. But one could pick up on the characters' interests towards one another from the dialogue; and once the characters realized who-liked-who in the movie their actions towards one another changed slightly.Sometimes Dr. Markway's dialogue was heavy on the explaining of the supernatural. Still, I did not have one of those moments watching the movie where I thought, "Don't be an idiot, don't do that, or go in that room."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Elite Haunted House Movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Haunting" is a superior haunted house film, somewhat similar to the 1961 chiller "The Innocents", but possibly a bit better. The film revolves around Eleanor (Julie Harris), a troubled woman who goes to the supposedly haunted Hill House for a research experiment for the paranormal. The house has a grim and dark history of deaths and suicides, which sets an eerie tone to the entire place. While more and more time is spent in the old darkened mansion, the group of people in the "experiment" find themselves terrorized by a malevolent force within the house that refuses to stop until it gets what it wants.The most remarkable thing about "The Haunting" is what it doesn't show you. We never see any ghosts, we never see any monsters or ghouls, no violence or bloodshed whatsoever. All we see is furniture moving, doors slamming shut, and we hear odd whispers and sounds - mainly what enthusiasts of supernatural phenomena would call "poltergeist activity". Yet this has no effect on the film's shock factor, because it is equally scary. It leaves the majority of the terrifying images to our imagination, which is a lot scarier than displaying to us a bunch of moaning translucent ghouls walking around darkened hallways. Rather then show us the ghosts, everything is implicated, and these implications are probably scarier than the ghosts themselves. From that standpoint alone, this film is brilliant.Complimenting that is the spooky, classic-style story, based on Shirley Jackon's equally creepy novel. The acting was all very polished, Julie Harris was excellent in the lead and played her character perfectly, and the camera-work was all very well done. The film is also in black and white, which also gives it the vintage haunted-house feel. I love old black and white films like this, there's something about the absence of color that adds a certain texture. One of my favorite scenes from this movie would have to be where the group is huddled in the bedroom, when the door begins to cave in under the pressure of the force outside. It was truly frightening, and likely one of the scariest moments in the film.Overall, "The Haunting" is a superior horror movie, and is definitely among the best haunted house films of all time. It's pretty amazing when a film can relentlessly scare you without hardly showing you anything at all. This and "The Innocents" are both the best haunted house films I've seen - I can't decide which is better, but they both have great things to offer. Recommended to fans of contemporary, old fashioned horror, because most of today's audiences will probably find it too "boring". 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear comes not from what we see but what we can't. And it is this that makes "The Haunting" into the finest of frightening films. Is it real? You can't prove it isn't! Watch this movie, and never again feel quite so safe in the dark or when you go to sleep. The movie was shot in black and white. At first, this gives the film an aged feeling, but when you arrive at Hugh Crane's house of the sinister, the black and white visuals have a starker effect and the eeriness creeps into your skin. In these days, too, of slick productions, watching "The Haunting" and then the remake, makes you realize how easy it is for film-makers to forget about what works and what doesn't. If you rent or buy the DVD, make sure 1) you're watching it at night, 2) you won't be disturbed, and 3) do NOT watch this movie alone, because this is one occasion when hanging onto a sofa cushion for courage ain't enough.</fullReview>

This film has no special effects,you don't see anything but this film is the ultimate study in psychological and unseen terror. Filming it in black and white gives the film an edge and makes you feel terror and a sense that something nasty and very unpleasant is just about to leap on you from the dark.At certain points in the film you are sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to see something that never appears, which helps to build on your sense of impending doom and belief that there is no escape from the nightmare of Hill House.

		<fullReview>I love a good haunted-house movie that eschews violence and gore for psychological terror ("The Changeling," I think, is an excellent example of the genre) but "The Haunting" falls short in this respect. It is a well-crafted film, especially with regard to the Caligari-like camera-work, but I found myself more involved in the richly appointed sets and imaginative score than I did in the story and its characters. Nell's constant inner-monologue voice-overs not only grew tiresome as the movie wore on, but also looked like a substitute for good screen writing and character development. It was as though she were providing footnotes to the audience so they knew what she was thinking. This may have been OK in the early sixties but now simply seems dated and quaint. The same can be said for the entire Freudian/Elektra-complex/lesbian subplot, which now provokes knowing titters the same way similar themes do in Hitchcock's "Psycho" and "Marnie" (which, however, remain far better and more watchable films). The few scares there were in the movie fell far short of compensating for these defects. Overall the film makes for quite a boring two hours, though it does have an undeniable historical interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the type of movie where distraught characters watch the edges of the frame in pantomimed fright as unexplained noises come off from behind a door, from the floor above, where a doorknob slowly begins to turn then stop as mysteriously as it started, where doors close of their own volition, where cold drafts could be cold drafts or something else. But the movie shoots its own foot. It wants to be ambiguous but forgets to be.The movie gives us the point of view of a mentally fragile female protagonist, it lets us inhabit her insecurities in annoying voice-over that lets nothing be too unclear, then allows the supernatural to be observed outside of that point of view. It's not all in her head, although Robert Wise would have us believe so. It brushes aside rational explanations (underground waters, sunspots, earth tremors!) of unexplained phenomena as outrageous, the movie is geared towards 'malevolent spiritual presence', but when unexplained phenomena take place, it wants to be able to claim that they could have been caused by any one of those outrageous rational theories. We don't see spectres covered in white linen bedsheets dragging shackles on the floor, but the movie is just short of that.Between the grating voice-over and the annoying habit of characters to quip humorous stupidities to break tension, a lot of what is mysterious in The Haunting begins to evaporate. The only thing I really liked about this is Robert Wise's choice of expressive camera-work, fast tracking shots across wooden floors and that amazing shot of an off-kilter camera going up a spiral staircase in dutch angle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeking to prove the existence of ghosts, Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) investigates creepy mansion Hill House, a supposed hub of paranormal activity due to a particularly tragic history. Joining him in his research are the heir to Hill House, Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn), clairvoyant Theo (Claire Bloom), and repressed, guilt ridden and mentally fragile spinster Eleanor (Julie Harris), whose past supernatural experience suggests that she may have telekinetic powers.On their first night in the house, the foursome are bombarded by terrifying noises and inexplicable phenomena, and nerves are soon frayed; but it is Eleanor who is most severely affected by the spooky goings on, coming to believe that she belongs in the house and that, somehow, the building actually wants her to stay there... forever!The Haunting is often cited by horror fans as one of the scariest ghost movies of all time, but I'm afraid I am going to have to disagree: what might have seemed original and unbelievably scary in 1963?unseen things that go bump in the night?now seem rather clichéd and predictable, and the film's overly sober tone only goes to undermine any atmosphere that director Robert Wise manages to conjure up through the use of his impressive, ominous building. In addition, the use of an annoying inner monologue from his introspective lead character only serves to lessen the tension even further.The script, based on the novel The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson, is rather ambiguous, leaving the viewer to ponder whether the strange occurrences are actually being caused by the house or by Eleanor's troubled mind, but neither this intriguing theme, nor Theo's suggested lesbian attraction to Eleanor, are explored in a manner that really does them justice. Where Wise does succeed, however, is in delivering plenty of stunning imagery through careful framing of his widescreen picture: unusual angles and inventive camera movements mean that the film is always great to look at and a cinematic haunted house has rarely looked as sinister.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting is a masterpiece of horror cinema, it's one of those ghost stories that go on forever because of it's originality and taste. My sister is absolutely in love with this movie, I hadn't seen it in a while, so her and I watched it together the other day and I have to say that surprisingly it still sends chills down my spine when I watch it. The remake was just horrible, it was over done and in some ways just plain annoying. But that's why I would recommend sticking to the original, the classic just never dies.Hill House hasn't exactly had a clean history of former owners, murders and suicides, people screaming to get out, no one wishes to stay there, but for Dr. Markway, he would like to see what it's about. He invites 3 individuals who all have had some sort of supernatural experiences: Theo, Luke, and Elenore. They all together must find a way to survive a night in Hill House when things start going horribly wrong and attack Elenore.The Haunting is a great horror story that has true originality and is perfectly made, I don't see how this movie could have been made better. I give such credit to Robert Wise since this movie is still talked about to this day. If you want a true horror masterpiece, I would definitely recommend this movie to you, watch it in the dark, you'll get the true effect of the movie. Not to mention a good scare.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie almost surpasses any other one in the horror genre.I find that the less computer generated special effects a film has, the better the content and the better the experience.This film has absolutely no computerized special effects at all. It all relies on the story. No effects necessary! I can't say the same for the remake of this one - I got about a quarter of the way through it and I had to turn it off. Never went back! Shirley Jackson is praised, and rightfully so, for her novel of the same name. Robert Wise in the first film is also praised for his work in transforming this eerie tale into a very disturbing cinematic experience. Some of the best horror comes through your own brain, and not so much from what the movie is showing you. "The Haunting" merely guides you into and through what you may already have sensed in the back of your head somewhere. Imagination takes you to heights that modern special effects can only hint at! I suppose moviegoers are afraid to go that far into their heads these days.I suspect that moviegoers have become a bit lazy these days, mainly with having all their horror presented to them on the screen with the computer taking care of the experience. It's all right out there in front of you, and fake! These older horror films take you through the whole story, and when it's over you get disconcerted for sometimes days on end thinking about what you just saw. That's when you know you've been scared almost out of your wits!To me, this movie strikes horror right into my heart, insidiously!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than 1999's version but pales in comparison to a film like the Changeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: may contain spoilersI have to admit that I was one of those people that saw Jan DeBont's version before Robert Wise's. I was laughably disappointed with that one. And then I naturally heard that the 1963 version was much better. So I rented it and although I have to concur, I also have to say that this is an over rated film. There is really nothing that happens in the film and the most it ever does to scare you is bang on the walls a few times. It tries to draw parallels between Elenor and Abigail but it again cuts that short. More on that later.  This is an utter disappointment.To bring terror into a film there has to be some sort of element called fear ( just a theory that I happen to agree with ). There has to be something there that is going to make you afraid of what is on screen. The house was supposed to be bad. It was supposed to be evil. But where was that feeling? Where was that aura of terror? A few loud noises on the wall and a loose staircase is not enough to make most people nervous. The two best scenes in the film weren't even of the supernatural, they were a runaway wife doing things that she shouldn't have been doing.If you want a truly scary haunted house film, watch The Changeling. It has a story, a myth, a mystery, darkly lit hallways, loud noises and of course the bouncing ball. Perhaps what this film lacked was a truly scary mythology to get it going. All that was said at the beginning was that the house was born bad. That's it. A few people died there and that is all it says about it. You know, even the 1999 version of The Haunting at least gave it a better story. And a more plausible one. There is no explanation as to why evil spirits lurk in this house. But look at any good or even average horror film and they will give you a reason as to why things are the way the way they are. Friday the 13th, Jason Voorhees was retarded and then grew up in the woods to kill. Freddy was a child molester that was burned alive only to swear revenge. The Changeling's haunted house was so because it wanted George C. Scott to solve a mystery. Poltergiest's house was built on a Indian burial site. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Leatherface and family were people that worked in a slaughterhouse where killing was an everyday occurrence, they just graduated from animals to humans. In this film, no rhyme, no reason, no justification for the silly spirits that choose to haunt the house and that makes it very prosaic. Without a modicum of chills in a film that is supposed to illicit true terror, you become apathetic to it in a hurry.The film started out in a great fashion by giving us a glimpse of what Mr. Crane looked like. He was evil. His angered face, his huge hands and his dolls like eyes would have been a great villain. Why didn't he haunt the house? Why didn't they expand on Elenor's striking similarities to the live in lady that worked there? They touched on it when she climbed the stairs, the same stairs that she climbed to hang herself. Maybe a great way to climax the film would be to have Elenor be a reincarnation of that lady and now the house, haunted by Mr. Crane is after her. I'm not sure if that is reasonable enough but it sure would have given the film some more oomph to it. As it stands now, the film is about as scary as West Side Story.This films diametric approach to what a haunted house film is supposed to be leaves the viewer wondering, "Is that it?" I have a hard time understanding how anyone could get frightened by this film. 5 out of 10- a true disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talky and soap-operatic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good news for fans of The Haunting is that my rating has gone up since I last watched this film in 1999. The bad news is that it hasn't gone up much. I still think this is a low 5, or a low "C".The Haunting is largely about Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris), a bizarre, troubled woman who has been contacted by Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson), an anthropologist studying the supernatural and particular individuals' correlation to it. Dr. Markway has devised an elaborate experiment at a famed New England home, "Hill House", that is wrapped up with a history of human tragedy and supposedly haunted. Although the majority of candidates selected for the experiment rapidly dwindle, Eleanor still participates--partially because she can't wait to get out of the home she shares with her sister and her bother-in-law, as does Theodora (Claire Bloom) and Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn).Once again I know I will sound like contrarianism is my primary goal, but that's really not the case. I'm just giving my honest reactions. Most horror fans (well, at least those who are likely to watch this film) seem to love The Haunting. For me, it just doesn't work except for some of the visual aspects. Although I haven't seen the remake since 1999 (I'll be watching it again soon, though), I much preferred it at the time, and can't imagine that I would think the remake is a 7 or less now, either. And it's not that I do not like older films, that I do not like "slower" films, that I do not like black &amp; white films, and so on. Just look at my other reviews.Maybe part of it is that I find no film scary, and I never have. A lot of Haunting fans think this is a very scary film. On the other hand, my wife finds the vast majority of horror films from all eras scary, but she doesn't think The Haunting is scary, either. To me, The Haunting is instead just talky to the point of detriment and the film is mostly a big dysfunctional soap opera (okay, maybe "dysfunctional" is redundant there). Whether they admit it or not, and whether they watch "official" ones or not, most people like soap operas, and I think that's a large part of what attracts people to this film.At least 90 percent of The Haunting consists of the four principal characters standing (or sitting) around and talking. They talk about the supernatural, they talk about the supposedly eerie events that happened and they talk about each other, including their pasts and their rapidly evolving present relationships while at Hill House. A lot of this violates the "show, don't tell" rule of writing, but of course, I'm all for violating rules. However, in this case, it's just a bit too much talking. Worse is the narration. While the narration doesn't quite annoy me as much as it used to, it's still annoying. The only bit that works, and one of the best parts of the film, is the narrated history of Hill House at the beginning of the film. But most of the narration could simply be muted, with the film otherwise remaining as it is, and it would work much better. The stuff that the narration is explaining we can figure out from visual cues, including performances. Fans praise the film for leaving the "horrific" events to one's imagination--well, how about leaving some of the exposition/context/meaning of the film to the imagination, too? It's difficult to create an eerie atmosphere when the lead character just won't stop talking--mostly griping/whining. Harris tends to overact.The bulk of the events in the film are soap-operatic relationship material between the characters. Theo is a lesbian who is pining for Eleanor. Eleanor, who seems manic-depressive, has the hots for Dr. Markham. Dr. Markham is married and mostly tries to ignore that Eleanor has the hots for him and that Theo is getting jealous and nasty. Luke has the hots for Theo, but she brushes him off with such fervor that he lackadaisically focuses on drinking and being sarcastic instead, which is his natural inclination anyway. It's a love quadrangle film, and something of a love quintangle film once Markham's wife arises and begins a series of plot contrivances. And it's a soap opera where none of the characters can quite talk about their feelings, making them more dysfunctional than the normal soap characters, and subjecting the audience to tortured attempts at avoiding the expression of their respective lusts while they pretend that they're in a horror film for a brief moment every 10 minutes or so. I know this is why my wife didn't find the film at all scary--she's not routinely scared by Days of Our Lives, either (and they even had a serial killer there, and I think a ghost at one point).But what about that horror stuff? Well, it's a bit like the horror in The Blair Witch Project (1999), only with a bit less yelling and runny noses. The Haunting gives you some sounds, some talking about things you don't see but the characters say they do, a couple phantom tactile sensations, and a lot of character reaction to this stuff. If you found the bundled sticks, piles of rocks and character freak-outs at stuff you couldn't see scary in The Blair Witch Project, you'll probably pee your pants here, too.Before I run out of room, I mentioned that I did find some of the visual aspects of the film pleasing. The film is full of crisp black and white cinematography with regularly complex, aesthetically pleasing staging of characters and interesting angles. The external shots of Hill House are fabulous, the production design of the interior is great, and the "bending" door is a superb effect. That's about it. Not enough to recommend the film, though, unless you like soap operas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not effective as a 'horror' movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like 'The Haunting' because I am a sucker for horror movies with a slow buildup and I had read good things about this one beforehand, but it honestly didn't do anything for me and I'm very surprised about that myself considering its status as one of the greats of the genre.This movie feels dated and I'd be surprised if it could really scare a modern-day viewer in any way at all. There is nothing ghostly going on here except for some late night banging on doors and walls plus some freaky noises. That's about it and that's not enough for a 'horror' movie that runs for almost two hours. Well, maybe if the acting were exceptionally inspired, but it isn't. While the acting from the whole cast is not all bad, it also doesn't stand out, and the dialogues between the characters are mostly bland.I didn't care for any of the characters at all. They are all so unappealing and they act so weirdly, especially the main character, Eleanor Lance, who is one of the most annoying and psychotic persons I have ever seen on screen, and I don't mean that in a good way. She's just distracting and kept me from fully appreciating the good things about this movie that are certainly there.You see, from a technical standpoint, the movie is very well-made. There are many shots to be marveled at, such as a tracking shot up a spiral staircase or inventive shots of doors getting pushed in and such. I can certainly see that 'The Haunting' inspired many movies that followed and I appreciate it for that, but it's just not an effective horror movie for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, yet not as good as I was expecting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We had a stormy weekend here so we decided to watch some films from my favorite genre...classic horror. I had picked up a TCM collection on DVD that includes a very nice sharp print of 'The Haunting' (1963). It was an okay film, I hadn't seen it in decades. Overall I was disappointed. I remembered it as being much better than it seemed to me now. Perhaps the buildup from all the positive things I've heard and read about it over the years since that last viewing had my expectations too high. I'm not saying it was a bad film, just that I didn't feel it was a great horror film.Here are some reasons I was disappointed. I usually like Julie Harris and I can see what she was trying to do here depicting a damaged, overly sheltered, woman, yet I found her character irritating and unsympathetic. I really didn't care what became of her. She acted too me much like she did as the immature young girl she played in 'The Member of the Wedding' (1952). I felt this part called for something more. I believe a more versatile actress like Deborah Kerr could have taken the character and film to a higher level. Also, there were long stretches of unnecessary and to me boring dialog between the scarce scary moments a horror film calls for. On the plus side when it was scary it did it the way I like, with atmosphere and by forcing the viewers to use their imaginations...not seeing just what is beyond that door making all the noise. I prefer this to the in-your-face gore and senseless violence of many more current horror films.For me 'The Uninvited' (1944), The Innocents (1961), 'Lady in White (1988), 'The Changeling' (1980) and 'Ghost Story' (1981) continue to be my favorite films of this type. I even liked 'The Others' from 2001 better. I realize this movie has many fans, these are simply my thoughts on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good shudder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie in quite a while, but do remember the shudder I got in the "hand" sequence. It is though a mixture of subtle and shock. The "hand" sequence is a shudder, wheras the attic door scene. Was it an attic door, I forget, was more of a sudden jolt. But I certainly don't think it's the best horror/supernatural movie ever made. Off the top of my head, two of my favs in those genre's would be Rosemary's Baby, and The Sixth sense. I also really liked The Others. I haven't seen the remake and from I have heard about it, have no desire to. I wish I could say more, but that's all I have, So I'm just stretching this out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hill House wont let her leave!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was intrigued by the small details of the house. I think the movies creators did a great job of letting the statues and old architecture of the house do some of the haunting. The old staircase, interesting enough on its own, to conjure up a Haunting. I think the best cinematography was her ascent up the rickety staircase! Although the "Scientific Researchers" didn't do so much researching, the story set the stage for a ghostly experience. The old Abigail dying in the house, uncared for, and the sinister dealings of her long dead Father, somehow scared me enough to keep watching. Eleanor's somewhat reclusive history, and the death of her own Mother, makes you cheer for her progress, just because her connection to Hill House is very strong and her character calls for your sympathy. "It's the only time, something has ever happened to me" ~ Eleanor LanceTheodora, (Claire Bloom) plays a psychic, whose timing in her predictions makes the dialog interesting. Russ Tamblyn, plays Luke Sanderson, quite a perky fellow himself (the first time I had heard of him and on looking at his Movie List WOW! still going! ) "Sorry honey but your not the type I keep" Luke SandersonI recommend the movie highly. The AMC host mentioned, the remake with such a big budget, does nothing for the "Imaginative" horror you feel when watching the story of Hill House. Something touched her hand! What was the banging? Who wrote "Eleanor Come Home?!!" Great Movie! 10 stars and will think of that staircase for a while!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An elegant frightener</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An elegant ghost story beautifully shot in wide-screen monochrome and well directed by Robert Wise. It's like something of a large-scale version of the kind of film Wise would have made for Val Lewton when finding his feet as a director and while it's tosh, he knows how to pull a frightener on us. (For starters, what you don't see is more frightening than what you do; Wise leaves it to our imagination).It's a haunted house movie but in this case it's the house itself that is malevolent. Consequently, we don't see any luminous spooks floating about but Wise still suggests there is something monstrous behind the door. How do we know? Well, if we never see anything we certainly hear it. (This is one of the best scary movies that scares us with its soundtrack).The ghost hunters are an insipid Richard Johnson, a somewhat wasted Russ Tamblyn, a slightly kooky Claire Bloom and Julie Harris, whose nervy, hysterical performance is almost as scary as the house itself. Harris keeps telling us that the house wants her so we know she's the catalyst for anything that's going to happen. No points, then, for guessing the ending. If the film is never as good as its reputation suggests, it's still a cut above most in the field.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie as a kid, it scared the hell out of me. I saw it again as an adult, it still scared the hell out of me. With all of the special effects, gore, and gratuitous violence in most horror films today; 90% of these films aren't half as scary as this supernatural thriller. I hear that a remake is in the works? Frankly, I shudder to think of it, unless Roman Polanski directs it.Also, I disagree with the previous comment regarding the performance by Elenor Lance. Elenor Lance is an excellent actor,she was perfectly cast in this role. The strength of her performance; along with a fantastic script, eerie cinematography, and strong supporting cast, is why this psychological horror film stands up today. Light a candle, get out the popcorn; then make sure that you're sitting next to someone who's hand you can squeeze really tight.

		<shortDescription>Jolly good (horror) show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a good scary movie, watch this one. It's really awesome. A lot of modern classics take influence from this movie but can't quite get up to its level.You know the plot: a handful of young people (20-30 somethings) come to stay in a purportedly haunted mansion for a week as part of a "scientific experiment". The pacing here is pretty solid, the gradation into the horror is smooth. I think this is because the supporting characters and the movie sets are already macabre and eerie in their own right before the real horror-show begins.Amazing that anyone would try to remake this film. This one is freaky biznizz despite the lack of magical special effects. I mean, good god, just the introduction is scarier than most movies! Although the ending is a bit abrupt, this is one of the greats. Gives you something to chew on afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Haunting when it came out in 1963. My younger brother Bill and I went to the movie together, and I sat there with my hands over my eyes most of the movie. No special effects back in 1963, all of the sounds and sights were in one's mind. The scene in the movie when Julie Harris and Clare Bloom were in the bedroom and the "booms" were coming down the hall. Goosebumps, I still have goosebumps from that scene. The book by the genius Shirley Jackson was just as scary and the movie is true to the book. And what did my brother Bill do after we got home and went to bed. He thought he was so cute, he started banging on all the doors in the house! And it is very interesting to see that the exterior shots of "Hill House" were filmed at the Ellington Park Hotel, in Stratford-Upon-Avon in England. I wondered whether or not the exterior scenes of Hill House were real, until I saw it was filmed at the Hotel. So Hill House does exist! A great movie, and the DVD is perfect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror is one of my favorite genres, or rather it used to be. Most films today lack the predictable, but enjoyable content and stars of the Corman movies. They also tend to use gore, the big startle, and computer animation as a substitute for plot and tension.Who can enjoy the Sci-Fi channel's monster of the week movies with the monster surviving the film and the actors seemingly in some sort of bad actor competition? The slasher moves I find tiresome as well. Gruesome is no substitute for the genuinely creepy or weird.Unfortunately, there are a lot of movies that have "moments". Hard to forget Kim Darby being dragged down the chimney by gnomes, or the creepy basement in the remake of House On Haunted Hill. But the original Haunting is one of the very few truly scary movies ever made, and one that is complete, rather like a movie length "DO" of one of the darker Twilight Zone episodes.Okay, if you're the sort of person that needs a monster, or someone with a chainsaw you're going to be disappointed. But, if you're the kind of person who has ever encountered real hauntings, feels any paranoia or claustrophobia, or has an active imagination, watch this film, but don't watch it by yourself.</fullReview>

In spite of the overly rigid censorship of its era, this still has the ability to scare an audience. The excellent sets, photography, lighting, and sound effects create a truly memorable film. And the acting is good, although the characters become annoying at times. Julie Harris truly makes her character memorable, but Claire Bloom's performance is what really grabs the attention. The "breathing door" scene is one of the great suspense set pieces of all time. The only real complaints I have is that it's too long and the ending leaves too many loose ends.By the way, avoid the worthless remake.</fullReview>

I won't waste time here duplicating the comments that many have raised about the quality of the production. I agree with all of them.The one thing that struck me as the most horrifying part of the film was the final line of dialogue that is heard. (I have not seen a review that comments on this, but I have not read all of them.)SPOILER What is the one thing that frightens Eleanor more than anything else? It's her fear of being "left behind". This is absolutely terrifying to her. So, when we hear her last line of dialogue, "...and we who walk here walk alone.", imagine what that means. Perhaps the hell of her eternal existence is to remain alone -- not even to commune with the other spirits of the house, but to be alone forever.That's pretty frightening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't help thinking that people who don't find "The Haunting" very scary are simply people with little imagination. It's definitely a film that requires some thought to become involved in as well as a certain suspension of disbelief about ghosts. It's also a film that relies more on a person's own creation of horror than on fancy special effects, since "The Haunting" has very few effects at all, except the house itself. For a younger generation used to "seeing" everything happen on screen in vivid detail, rather than imagining it, this 1963 haunted-house story may seem a bit too slow. So much the sadder for them.In addition, I wouldn't say "The Haunting" is so much a horror story as it is a psychological tale of terror and possession. If you go into it expecting Jason or Freddy or Michael Myers with their multitude of bloody knives, you'll be sorely disappointed. "The Haunting" is about real people and their real reactions to a very spooky old house and the house's inhabitants. It scared me in 1963, and it continues to scare me today. My only regret is that the film is only available in a pan-and-scan VHS tape that cuts out much of the widescreen visuals. Eventually, I guess it will show up on DVD. I can always hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1963's The Haunting has got to be one the best of this genre of films made. I truly appreciate the spooky cinematography used throughout. At times its better to look at the sets around the characters than at what the movie wants you to focus on. The build of horror beginning with the introduction to Hill House and on through the final tree scene (which ties back to the intro) is fantastic without having to resort to the "slasher" techniques used in films today. A must see!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe THE cinematic ghost story of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This excellent cinematic version of the great Shirley Jackson novel still retains its power to chill, thanks to the eerie, subtle approach of director Robert Wise, the evocative B&amp;W cinematography of David Bolton (check out the unnerving "face in the wall" sequence") and the fine performances all around; Julie Harris in particular shines as the sensitive, fragile Eleanor. This film is of the less-is-more school of horror, in contrast to the ridiculous let's-throw-in-everything-but-the-kitchen-sink Jan DeBont remake from 1999. As of this writing that version is widely available in DVD and VHS everywhere and the original is still only available on video (and even then it's rather hard to find): another little Hollywood injustice still waiting to be corrected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those few defenders of the 1999 remake who found this movie to be boring---go away! This movie's influence can be seen in later movies including Legend of Hell House, Night of the Living Dead (with its camera angles and grainy cinematography), The Shining (with its foreboding and haunted setting), The Changeling (ditto) The Blair Witch Project, and The Sixth Sense. This movie still has the ability to keep me up at night, all the more impressive since it does this without the use of violence or special effects. The movie works on the imagination like no other horror movie I've seen. What I don't understand is why the U.K. rating system gave this an "X" and the U.S. system gave this a "G." I tried showing this to my nieces and they ran away screaming after 30 minutes--the G rating is very deceptive. As for U.K.'s "X" rating, my only guess is the fact that Claire Bloom seems to be a lesbian--unless, of course, Great Britain banned Shirley Jackson's original novel. One of the all-time great horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellence in black and white and widescreen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Between "West Side Story" and the "Sound of Music" Robert Wise made "The Haunting" based on Shirley Jackson's witty novel "The Haunting of Hill House." Wise chose black and white wide-screen to best reflect the claustrophobic atmosphere of Jackson's novel. He remained true to the spirit of her work while editing the story to an acceptable screen playing time. The work was so chilling that Ettington Park Hotel declined a screen credit as the location for the exteriors. Wise created suspense with atmosphere rather than special effects. There is a pervading atmosphere of doubt throughout the move--is the house haunted, or are the visitors merely neurotic. The performances and the production hold up after nearly 40 years. The wide-screen laser version is a commendable video transfer.</fullReview>

I was the child in my neighborhood who was always asked to tell the "ghost story" because mine were the best. But nothing I ever came up with has matched what was written in the book about Hill House or the movie. It was my prototype. Others of the genre, such as "The Uninvited", were close in feeling but I have never seen a movie that matched the eery, gothic feel of this movie. This one's a classic. I recommend it for anyone who is serious about writing a horror novel or making a horror movie. This is psychological horror at it's best!</fullReview>

I find it hard to believe that the AFI didn't even nominate it for one of the 100 best thrillers of the 20th Century.Unfortunately, there was a remake done recently which changed the story and relied con special effects.

		<shortDescription>Scary, scary movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was made in 1962, released in 1963. Julie Harris and Claire Bloom are the only two "names;" Richard Johnson (who?) was a Brit whom no one ever heard of and Russ Tamblyn, in spite of being in the Academy Award winning West Side Story was on his way to becoming a has-been. The book, the Haunting of Hell House, upon which Robert Wise made this film was written by Shirley Jackson, a kind of female Stephan King based in New York instead of Maine. The plot of this movie centers around a bunch of dysfunctional psychics who are invited by anthropologist (ugh), Richard Johnson. Chemistry starts to flow between the two ladies and the handsome Englishman-- but then, his wife shows up...and you get the point. The effects are eerie with no anthropomorphic manifestations. Wise has shown us how strong is the power of suggestion in the hands of a master. Tension grates on the viewer from start to finish in this dark, gothic film. The ending, if you can call it that, poses no resolution-- only an unanswered question, yet is not unsatisfying. In sum, this is perhaps the single best ghost, spirit or haunting film I've ever seen, surpassing even The Exorcist in tension. The acting is competent and pleasing. The scene where Harris and Bloom are lying in beds next to each other, extending their hands for support from the other in the face of the terror, is particularly gripping (no pun intended). This is an excellent movie. One of the best made on a theme too often polluted by Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Ghost Stories Ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw the haunting I was just five, maybe six back in 1965 or 66. I will never forget the oak door bending. The movie scared the crap out of me. I hid behind my parents as I watched it with terror filled joy. Scary and terrifying, yet subtle and suggestive in its horror. Take note Hollywood, sometimes and in most cases, less is more.The imagination can play many games with you. As I got older we watched the Haunting in film class. Let's face it black and white films make much better use of the shadows and lighting. They create a different kind of atmosphere. As a writer of a ghost story novel myself the haunting for its subtle, yet beautiful horror was what I drew from to write my book. You don't need decapitated heads and to gross out people to make horror. It's the squeaky door that you hear opening by itself, the footsteps you thought you heard, the thing you thought yopu saw but is not there. That is the haunting. A smart, subtle and terrifying movie that is truly a classic. The Haunting gets place in with The Innocents,and The Changeling for effective, subtle Horror at its absolute best. To a lesser degree The Fog could be included as a good ghost story.Don't rent the haunting buy it!!! Save The Haunting for a Halloween Night you won't be disappointed. It is truly a great ghost story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the best horror film I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film back in '63-'64 when it first appeared in the English cinemas. It scared the pants off me. Since then then I must have seen it on TV around a dozen times. And every time, it still scares the pants off me. To really appreciate the beautiful black and white photography it needs to be seen in widescreen format. The exteriors were filmed at Ettington Park - does anyone know where the interiors were filmed, or were they done in the studio? I voted for this film and considered only giving it a 9 because of the hammy acting of the house's retainer. She's only in it for a few minutes, so I voted it a 10. Everything else about this film is perfect. Think about all that swearing and vomit in The Exorcist and all the films it influenced; all the special effects in the new version of The Haunting; all the blood, axe-wielding in the countless college-kids-locked-in-a-house/locked-in-a-nightmare/locked-in-endless-seque ls we have to endure like a family curse. Compare these with a film that not only looks good, sounds good, has good acting, has suspense, makes your hair stand on end and with no special effects - apart from the bending door!Can't wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best parts of a horror movie is watching how people self-destruct under pressure. The original of The Haunting is probably one of the best horror movies ever made, it does quite a bit more with less and pulls off a truely creepy film.The plot is familiar if you've seen the remake. Dr. Markway rents Hill House, a house with a 90 year history of horrifying events and madness. Dr. Markway intends to live in the house with a selected group of certified psychics and mediums. Of the half-dozen psychics he invites, only two, Elanor Lance, and Theodora ("just Theodora") show up at the house.The cinematography (filmed in glorious black and white) does an excellent job of demonstrating the claustrophobic insane atmosphere of the house. While the remake attempts to make the point with 3D modeled effects, the original does an excellent job with simple variations in film stock, camera angles and lighting. Many of my early childhood night terrors involved faces that appeared in the furniture when the lights went out. The original captures the same creepy sense that there are faces in the victorian scroll-work and gothic towers. The actors are frequently shot at odd angles, from the floor, or from above completing the sense that the view is skiewed.The set design complements the cinematography. Unlike the remake where the set design was overdone with cherubic faces, the original looks like a victorian house until its heart and soul is revealed.One of the key points that makes the original work so much better than the remake is that the original knows exactly how much information to tease out to the viewer and how much is left to speculation. (This is a technique that made the original Blair Witch Project successful.) The movie provides us with tantilizing peeks at the secret life of the former inhabitants but lets the viewer fill in the gaps.The ghost story is highlighted by the romantic and character tensions between the investigators. All of the characters have their flaws, Dr. Markway is more concerned about his investigation than the people he works with, Theodora knows what everyone is thinking and tends to be tactless, Elanor is the romantic clinger seeking approval, and Luke can't see past the material value of the house. The contrast between the four characters is very well played and the love triangle in the film merges with the supernatural climax.Overall, this is one of my favorite horror films. If you liked this you would probably also like The Exorcist and The Innocents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror movie ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the more psychological type of horror movie, I was looking forwards to seeing The Haunting. When I finally got hold of a copy, I wasn't disappointed. The Haunting is scary, very, very scary. Like recent smash The Blair Witch Project, all is left to the viewers imagination, the ghosts presence is only ever heard, not seen. This is a million times more effective than glossy CGI (like in the remake), and makes you wonder what that noise was when you're lying in bed at night. What makes The Haunting such as masterpiece, though, are not the horror elements, but the more dramatic scenes. Lead character Eleanor is one of the best-scripted female characters I've ever seen in a movie, closely followed by Theodora, The Haunting's other woman. Add to this the fantastic dialogue, acting and cinematography, and you have a film that everyone should see. Better than a million post-modern teen slasher films any time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget computer imaging, blood, gore and monsters popping out of closets,YOU WON"T NEED THEM. Robert Wise's 1963 The Haunting is without a doubt not only the best Haunted House film of all time, but, one of the finest horror films ever made. The excellent cast and story do however, take second place to the house itself. " The house, it's alive" as the character Elenor so perfectly stated, early on in the film, is the reason why The Haunting brings out our most basic reasons for fear. Evil, faceless relentless, forboding evil. The house is not filled with spider webs and dust. There are no dungons nor anything that would turn this film into the usual horror flick. Your own imagination is the key. Yes, your own mind is the key to Hill House. Robert Wise knew this when making this film back in 1963. Believe me what people have said over the years is true. Don't see this film alone, that is unless your not afraid of the dark! I wasn't till I saw this masterpiece. Now my night light is my bed time friend.</fullReview>

When it finished, I went around the house putting all the lights back on and didn't get to sleep for quite some time. Robert Wise - a remarkably versatile director (The Sound of Music, Star Trek - the Motion Picture) - has brought Shirley Jackson's acclaimed novel brilliantly to the big screen with chilling effects.

		<fullReview>Many people will want you believe that this is the best of the haunted house movies, but while this movie may be up there, I can't consider it the best. That prestige in my mind belongs to "Legend of Hell House" with Pamela Franklin. "Haunting" does have a vivid plot and great characters and the surrealism does place you in the movie to experience the scares right with the house's visitors. The effects are quite good; we never see the ghosts, but we are still afraid of them as we are of the house and it's strange history. Julie Harris gives a wonderful performance as the harried but likeable Eleanore put off by the house and exotic Claire Bloom lends a bit of herself into the worldly psychic. Richard Johnson is very amiable as the novel's stuffy parapsychologist, but I have to say I like this Luke, played by Russ Tamblyn, better than the one in the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the 1999 version I was very interested in seeing this one. And it did not disappoint me. I'm not an avid scary movie watcher as they do not really scare me at all. This is an exception. I love the way Eleanor's thoughts are vocalised. I also found that the longer you watch the more the tension builds up until you are on the edge of your seat. Very good acting makes this a must for any scary movie fan. The only sad point is I feel the ending could have been done better but it has the other side advantage of keeping you guessing. I think having seen the later version might have made this movie better. To be honest the newer special effects is a bit of a laugh and the use of sound in THIS movie accomplishes a lot more. Excellent!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am totally enthralled with this movie. I love sitting in the dark watching its every thrilling,wicked,and fiendish scene leap out at me,and surround me in horror. I enjoy the feelings,and mood this movies sets for you. Its being shot in 1963 in black&amp;white definitely adds credence to the film.I saw the 1999 remake, and was sadly disappointed. It lacked the sentiment,and mood the book gives to us and the (1963)version was able to accomplish.If you ever have a chance buy the audio version of the book.(Called books on tape)Its cover shows the 1999 version but follows Shirley Jacksons book very well.Try sitting in a dimly candle lit room with a nice glass of wine, relax and get scared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Unknowned, that's the keyword, Unknowned. When we become involved in the supernational event, we're scared out of our wits just because it's unknowned. The night, cry of a child, face on the wall, knockings, bangings, what is that to be afraid of? You weren't threatened. It was harmless, like a joke that doesn't come out, it was no child, remember, Just a voice."I couldn't have said it better myself. People who don't like this movie, must have somehow missed this line, since they keep complaining. Even though, I have to confess, that is not the only reason I find THE HAUNTING ten times scarier than THE EXCORCIST, HALLOWEEN, THE SHINING, TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE, and all those Italian and Romero-horror-gore-movies. The main reason is TERROR AND SUSPENSE (that's not a movie title). I have to say, THE HAUNTING is frightening from the start to finish. The opening is horrifying (she never saw Hill House) and the end is more terror than any other movie in the genre. And daytime it's suspense, harps playing etc, etc...Well, the complaints are often things like "oh, it's no graphic violence" and "I knew nothing was going to harm them". Of course you knew! The point isn't something harming, the horror is in the mind. I mean, after all, extreme bangings on your door in the middle of the night. You be there and tell me how scary it was! Didn't think so. To like this movie you have got to go a little deeper than "here is a movie. I will watch it". You have to get involved. Personally, I can't imagine how anybody found HALLOWEEN scarier. Michael Myers is chasing Jamie Lee Curtis. You see exactly everything that happens, you are totaly aware of the situation nothing is hidden. If I would have made that movie, I would make Myers never to be shown at all. Not one single micro seconds, with none of his body parts. Just like in THE HAUNTING. What we don't see is what frightens us. Something is holding her hand. Are you telling me, this scene would have been more scary if we actually saw what it was holding her hand? No way. No special effects, no gore, no violence, no nothing. Except for fear. FEAR is what horror is all about. Fear and terror. Not images of chased girls or eyes popping out.To anybody who gets frightened in the right way, I recommend THE HAUNTING warm. It's without a doubt the scariest film I've ever seen. And I'm not following any hype, by the way. If the hype wouldn't exist, the people who like this movie would have keep liking it, trust me. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the scariest movie, but much better than the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely hated Jan De Bont's remake of this movie. It was PG 13 for crying out loud. Unfortunately I saw that one first and it ruined the basic premise for me which is shared by both films. The plot, about four characters who stay in a haunted mansion, is simple enough. It's not particularly scary like one might hope, however there are some good points to the story. The main character, Elanor, has a terrible life. Once inside the mansion she feels at home. The mansion plays a number of psychological gags on her, probably because she is the most attached to it, or the one who is mentally the weakest. These are the elements of the story that are interesting. It's not so much about a haunted house, but about a troubled character and her reaction to the house in her current state of mind. These are the reasons that the movie is good and without them it would just be about a house that makes noises. As is, it is a psychological movie that doesn't move very fast, and isn't really scary, but is certainly interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the true horror classics of all time. I first watched it on a cold,windy, rainswept night, alone in the house. Only one other film (The Exorcist), has made me so jittery after. Julie Harris` jitters are contagious, and Claire Bloom`s predator is magnetic. The tension between the two really add a new dimension to the horror that is unfolding around them. The real reason for the excellence of "The Haunting" lie in the lack of effects; all is in the imagination. The cinematogrophy really indicates that the object of evil is the house itself. There is a palpable sense of evil throughout the film.One final recommendation...please see this before you see Jan De Bonts joke remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it that really frightens you? When you see the ghost/monster in a film don't you breath a sigh of relief that it's not as bad as you'd imagined? The Haunting plays of that fear; what we don't see is far more frightening than what we do. There isn't a white sheet anywhere to be seen in this darkly scary film, only sound and suggestion. Harris is marvelous as the disturbed Elanor Lance (interestingly the characters name was Vance in the book!), throughout the film we are unsure if the haunting is real or a part of her unsteady mind. Anyone who has seen the film will know that the "Who's hand was I holding?" scene is terrifying AND disturbing.The Haunting is the cinematic equivelant of someone telling you a scary story in a quiet voice; whispering, drawing you in, until....!!By the way, if you get the chance read Shirley Jackson's excellent novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have for as many years as my age permits enjoyed horror movies, and it's doubtless my favorite genre. Since I was 13, Omen has been my favorite horror film, until I saw Robert Wise's "The Haunting". First of all, it's in B/W which makes all a little bit more creepy, second of all it scares you senseless with it's claustrophobic aura. Many people I have discussed the film with, claims that hearing the thinking of Eleanor, and the dramatic lines ruins the film, I dare to say that those elements is just what makes the film so creepy.Forget about the remake and see the original version instead, it's probably the 20th century's best horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the scariest thing ever committed to celluloid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Running through all the comments about "The Haunting", I saw one thing recurring for most viewers: They were never able to forget the first time they saw this horror masterpiece. And it is also true for me. My first viewing of it was 7-8 years ago. It was a classic films zone aired once a week on public television in Turkey and although mentioning that it was considered pretty effective at the time of its release, the presenter of the show did not give enough hints or warnings as to the true nature of this film. And so my sister and I sat down to watch another low budget thriller from the '60s. However, once the film started, we were completely enthralled. Even at that time, I was an experienced film buff and had seen enough horror films to the end that they had lost their ability to scare me. What a lesson I learned! By the infamous hand-holding sequence, I was a complete wreck. My heart was beating as fast as it could, all my senses were on full alert, yet I could not stop watching that hypnotizing piece of celluloid. But towards the end, I was not able to stand it anymore, so I declared to my sister that I had to go to sleep right then if I wanted to retain my ability to sleep for the rest of my life, stuck myself into bed, drew the blanket way over my head and tried to calm myself. Of course it was a vain attempt and that night turned out to be the worst sleeping (or more correctly, non-sleeping experience) of my whole life.The film was never shown again here in Turkey and the final ten minutes or so remain unwatched to me. Yet it is as vivid in my mind as it could be and whenever a new so-called horror film is released that turns out to be a complete mess, I start raving about "The Haunting" to my friends none of which have seen the film. So I beg you, MGM Home Video, to finally release this on DVD in the best Collectors Edition version you could manage and make it possible for fans all over the world to introduce new people to the pleasures of THE horror film to end all discussions on horror films, period. As another user correctly stated, if I was able to give this one a higher rating than 10, I would give it. I dare anyone to watch it on an ordinary night with the lights turned off, or even during daytime, alone. You will find out new things about your primary fears. A masterpiece, no less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very creepy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wise used a very old trick. He let the power of imagination and some suggestive camera work to relay the message that Hill House is indeed, haunted. The result is a film that benefits from what you don't see. If you see this in a pan and scan format, the effect is somewhat diminished. If you happen to catch a wide screen presentation of The Haunting, watch it. The way the film is shot, you have this uneasy feeling with all the empty spaces that surround the characters. You'll almost swear that there are ghosts running around, and even though you can't see them, that's where your mind will fill in the blanks. The best sequence is where Nell is laying in bed and she hears children's voices in the walls. The climax of this scene will give you goosebumps. Watch this one with at least one light on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First-rate Ghost Story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, based upon a tale by Shirley Jackson, reminds me a lot ofthe classic novella by Henry James entitled "The Turn of the Screw." All the great elements of the spooky ghost story are there. You havethe same reputed yet unsubstantiated existence of ghosts in bothJames' book and in this film. As in "The Turn of the Screw," this movie lets its audience decide if there are really any ghosts. Much of what happens in "The Haunting" is, as in James, psycho- logical in nature. With conflicting psychological motivations, theaudience doesn't know who or what to trust. We are left in a state ofuneasy agnosticism about the supposed malevolent nature of thehouse or beings inside it. Praise to Robert Wise for deciding to film "The Haunting" in England instead of in the studio in Hollywood. As soon as I saw the exterior ofthat mansion, I knew without being told that they had filmed this movie in England. I have never been "across the pond," let alone to England, but I have read enough Gothic novels to know about the superior distinction of the English mansion as a haunted house. When I sawthe exterior of Hill House, it matched everything I've ever read aboutthese houses. There is a solemn isolation to the English country estate--sometimes hundreds of miles from civilization--that adds a feeling of extraordinary eerieness and helplessness when humans are pitted against deter- mined, possibly malevolent ghosts. Wise's decision to film in England may have been dictated by budget restrictions. Filming in England, however, gives "The Haunting" superior character: it gives the film that extra touch of eccentricity and madness that would likely havebeen unavailable anyplace else. "The Haunting" merits three andone-half stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ok, i´m scared !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again a movie from the past proves that true scary stuff can be produced without using special effects. Watching this movie always makes me wonder why does Hollywood spends millions of dolars in flashy special effects for horror films, when all it takes to truly scare people is just a good direction, a great camera work, and some creepy sound effects. Why spend all that money, just to make us jump on our seats, while Hollywood could be scaring us for much less money ?!!THE HAUNTING is a chilling movie. The "holding hands" scene in the dark is enough to make anyone sleep with the lights on for a year ! Simply brilliant. And not a single visual effect on sight ! The whole movie it´s even shot in black and white, wich adds even more to that misterious haunted atmosphere in wich this magnificent ghost story is played.The characters, the situations, and the scares are all very classic, but films like this are the reason why they turned into classic stuff in the first place.So everybody watch this movie! But watch it alone at night and in the dark for a major horrific impact.Watching it with friends isn´t fair. Alone ! If you dare.THE HAUNTING along with THE CHANGELLING (1978), is one of the most scary movies ever made and a million times better than any recent so called horror movie, wich normaly is just about a bunch of teenagers getting butchered performing illogical and idiotic actions all the time.THE HAUNTING has no knifes, no visible ghosts, no buckets of blood, not even a single Gore scene, but´watch it alone and you won´t ever forget it.It´s that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest horror film I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on late night TV in Britain one Saturday night, alone. I was 27 at the time, and I've seen a lot of so-called horror movies, as well as seeing some pretty horrible things in real life. I'm 6'3", broad shouldered, fit: I have very little fear of anyone or anything.That night, I slept with the light on for the first time since I was a child. The eerie, creepy style of the film had freaked me out. It wasn't that I thought there was anything 'out there' that would 'get me': it was the fact that The Haunting had alerted me to the possibility that not all was as it seemed, and that maybe, just maybe, that little noise downstairs WASN'T just something I could ignore...Brilliant.Two weeks ago I saw it again (with people this time) and again it had the same effect, a rarity in any film. My girlfriend works in film, and is therefore highly critical of every film we watch. She declared it a masterpiece.The very process of filming this movie was done with a mastery of cinematography that is absent, probably wholly gone, in our modern film world. Camera angles, set design, lighting, mirroring, tight focuses, complex shots, prop arrangements and continuity all add to the creeping, eerie feeling that all is not well in the world of this film.Adding to that the fine, perfectly executed acting, as well as the literate and very intelligent script makes for a truly rewarding viewing. Several subplots are explored, as would be in real life, and then discarded as we observe the descent of... well, that'd be giving it away, wouldn't it?The key to this film is it's subtlety, and that is what makes it such rewarding viewing again and again. Everything from the sounds and visuals to the smallest, almost intangible detail, goes into making the experience truly unsettling.My advice to anyone with an interest in horror films, cinematography, acting, the psychological effects of media, or just for sheer twisted entertainment, is to watch this film; intently. It will stay with me for my whole life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Scary After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie on television recently, and let me just say, when the ghost (?) started pounding on the walls, I was almost forced to change the channel.For those of you that like the kind of crap horror movie where Jason or Freddie kill kids with blood gushing out all over the place, this movie is not for you. The Haunting is a psychological horror movie, brilliantly directed by Robert Wise who brought us such musicals as West Side Story and The Sound of Music. Never let it be said that he specialized in musicals; he can scare the s**t out of you too.Throughout the film, you never doubt that something is going on in the house. What is in doubt is the extent of the hauntings. The film's protagonist is a woman who is not quite mentally stable. As we see the action through her perspective, we can never be sure if the occurrences are clouded by her psychoses. Therein lies the film's brilliance. We are scared because we see things through her eyes; we have her subjectivity, and SHE is terrified.The ending is slightly disappointing, but it does make sense within the context of the rest of the film so I can't really fault it.I can't figure out why anyone would want to remake this film, especially as a special effects laden blockbuster-wannabe. This movie is so simple, your imagination manipulates it in ways special effects can't. It's absolutely brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought the original version of The Haunting last week and I can say I was very impressed and very scared too. The performances were great, especially by Claire Bloom and Julie Harris as Theo and Eleanor. I can say that Hill House in this film wasn't as creepy as the one in the new version, but the things that happen to the 4 visitors in the house is something to really cringe about. Some of the film is slow moving, but when night falls it's hell for the people in that house. They experience loud, rapping noises outside their door by something, and the "hand holding" scene with Eleanor and Theo gave me the creeps, especially when hearing noises of children and people coming from the other side of the wall, but I think the scariest part of the whole movie is the "buldging door", where the force inside the house literally pushes the door off it's hinges to get at the people on the other side. Take my advice for anyone that reads this review and has never seen the movie before, go out and rent it, you will be surprised how scary it is, even if it is a 26 year old film in black and white. Director Robert Wise puts all the emphasis on loud sound effects and weird camera angles, which is what makes this film great, along with the performances from all involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are few films that can conjure up in the viewer's mind such dark dread. The "face in the wall" scene is a major example. No blood, no gore, not even much movement, but what a chilling moment. Don't except imitations--demand the original!! And if you can see it in it's widescreen glory, by all means do--so much is lost when it's panned and scanned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most interesting uses of subtlety in a movie I've ever seen. From the main character's desire of the doctor, to the other woman's lesbianism, there's so many things to discover about this film, if one pays attention. Genuinely creepy, with a good use of a tone of dread, the film is like no other. And the scene with the woman popping out of the attic and the 5 second pause of blackness following, has to be the most chilling screen shot I've seen!

		<fullReview>I know...I know...I've already reviewed this film...but I have seen it several times since the previous review...and every time the performances shine even brighter! The real star of this movie is the sound effects. You hear the poundings, the voices, etc. but nothing is there. The most horrifying part of the movie occurs at night when Nell (Julie Harris) starts to hear voices coming from the room next door and tells Theo (Claire Bloom...who was supposedly in bed with her) to hold her hand. However, when 'something' squeezes her hand very tightly...she screams...and Theo is on the other side of the bedroom! This film was far better than Hitchcock's "The Birds" (1963) which was released that same year. It could even be put into the same realm as Psycho (1960) as best horror film of the 1960's. I loved Claire Bloom in this movie...she was SO HOT!!! (Well, she could surely make a black sweater look beyond gorgeous...and I don't care if her character was a lesbian...I would have done cartwheels at the opportunity of having her as a bedroom mate!!) Tamblyn (Luke) and Johnson (Markway) are along for the ride as the male counter types. Although Luke prefers Theo, who prefers Nell, and Nell prefers Markway, who is married, is a bit of a distraction...the film is still a Hollywood horror classic of the 1960's!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Haunting" is a dated horror film. However, don't hold that against it. This film is truly a chiller. A suspension of one's disbelief is in order, of course, but a forgiving nature is also required to look past the "dated" camera tricks and sometimes silly melodrama. However, a fistful of scenes are genuinely amazing to behold. For instance, the scene in which all four of the "observers" are trapped in the library with the "entity" pushing the oak door inwards against its hinges is pure hair-raising entertainment.The "bump in the night" technique used by Director Robert Wise is fully effective and makes for an astoundingly imaginative experience. It is neither exploitative or excessive. Instead, it is creepy, frightful and suspenseful. I would give this one an eight (for the number of times you'll be looking behind you after the movie's done). A great viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a movie that has no computerized effects and could be that scary has got to be good! Some of the scariest scenes (as you might've already read about) was the "hand-holding" scene and the door banging scene(s). I probably never watched a movie that was older than 20 years old, but for a movie that's 26 years old, it still is very good! I can't wait for the remake (if you can call it a remake) with Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones (although they may appear to be the leads, Lili Taylor's character in the new movie is the star in this movie). I don't know if the new movie is going to follow the old movie's path, because of all of the special effects...I hope it doesn't wreck the movie. Also, one more note, I got to see it on the Turner Classic Movies on cable, in all of it's widescreen splendor, so I got a good late-night treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying genre film delivers plenty of chills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some will argue that Robert Wise's adaptation of Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House suffers from mannered performances across the board (although Julie Harris is often singled out), but the modest film succeeds more often than it fails -- especially in its spine-tingling suggestions of horrors just on the other side of the door. Wise's sound choice of keeping the frights under wraps rather than literalizing them is the film's greatest strength, as no amount of prop ghoulies can approach the inside of one's imagination. Claire Bloom relishes her role as the cunning, psychically-tuned lesbian foil to Harris' meek bag of nerves, and Richard Johnson and Russ Tamblyn aren't bad at all. The true star of the film, though, is the prowling, predatory camera -- Wise always uses it to great effect in showing off the cavernous rooms and labyrinthine hallways that harbor our worst nightmares.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on TV while eating popcorn and drinking soda on the couch with my girlfriend Abbie (we were in our early teens). We never finished the popcorn, and the sodas went untouched. We never got up to go to the bathroom, and we hardly breathed during the commercials. We were in over our heads, and we knew it. The bulging door, holding that hand in the bed....it was all truly terrifying.What makes this night even more memorable was Abbie's older sister and her boyfriend, knowing we always liked to watch scary movies, decided to play a trick on us as they arrived home from their date. They crept around the outside of the house and leapt out in front of the sliding glass door that led into the downstairs TV room. It was the wrong movie to do that during! We screamed and dove under the blanket we had been clutching under our chins for the past hour!I have NEVER seen the movie since, but it has made an indelible impression on me. It is definitely one of my all-time favorites! I'm thrilled to see so many others share my zeal for this very, very scary flick! It is a thriller, rather than a horror film. And the suspense can only be compared to Hitchcock's best! And to hear that they're making a remake! For shame! I can't imagine doing better. But if they try, don't use color. Stick to the original with a passion! ...and I'll be the first in line to see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At Risk of Sounding Repetitive - The Greatest Ghost Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I was a little kid, I loved the supernatural. There is something genuinely frightening and fascinating about things of which we know so little. When I was about thirteen, I read The Haunting of Hill House, and I can say it was a truly terrifying experience. Note that I use terror, not horror, to describe this. There are no corpses that walk, no elevators filled to the brim with blood, no hooked killer in the mirrors. Yet the novel was gripping, compelling, and utterly chilling. The film The Haunting, made out of Shirley Jackson's incredible, book is about the only time I have ever seen a film compare to its written predecessor. The technicality is superior, and all of the parts (all what, ten or so of them?) are perfectly cast and acted. More than any single sight or scene in the film, it is the ambience, the very house itself if you will, that causes the inexorable fright. There is something fundamentally unnerving about places of death and bad omen, and The Haunting plays right to those fears. Even though you never really see a ghost, you know they are there. Think about that. Hitchcock said that it's better to wait for a payoff than see one, and The Haunting takes this to heart. So if you feel like some good, old-fashioned frightening the way it should be done, try out The Haunting. It offers a great reward in being one of the most terrifying things you can experience without actually being in danger.As a final note, I am both excited and nervous about the upcoming remake/update. I hope that it will stick to the flavor of the original, and be a new trendsetter among the superfluous amount of "Scream" rip-offs and Gen-x slasher flicks that are flooding the horror market these days. We need some good terror, no more repulsive horror, to bring us back to the halcyon days of Hitchcock and his contemporaries. Time will tell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm old enough to have seen this film on the big screen and in glorious black and white which only enhanced the horror. Julie Harris, of course, played her usual role as the slightly nutty and easily frightened heroine. In this film she was perfectly cast. Only "The Exorcist" has frightened me since. It is the kind of fright that gets under your skin and burrows deep into your mind. The fright that keeps you awake for years and you NEVER forget it. Maybe it was the surreal quality of black and white, maybe it was that soundtrack, maybe it was the sight of that three inch thick oak door bending inward ever so slowly and quietly. Whatever IT was we'll never know. I see where there's a remake in production. How can you improve a perfect 10? Shoot it in color with blood running under the doorway and a lot more of those tired computer generated images?

		<shortDescription>A Word Of Warning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been brought up on a diet of horror films, I saw The Haunting for the first time as a teenager. What bowled me over about it was that it was the first film to genuinely frighten me. What equally amazes me is that it is the only film since to do so, and I've seen a fair few!From the soundtrack to Robert Wise's camera angles, like the house, everything is crooked, distorted and not what it seems. This makes for uncomfortable yet compelling viewing. Check out the scene where Eleanor is asking her sister to lend her the car with the raucous brass-band music being played in the room. Unlike today's so-called horror films, the discomfort and dread we feel in The Haunting is mostly on a subliminal level, yet this is where it is most effective.The word of warning goes, not to those of a nervous disposition, but to those filming the remake. In spite of its flaws, it (the 1963 version) is a film I, as well as many others do, hold dear to my heart. It was a brave film to make as it does not go for cheap scares and blinding special effects that are rife in so many of todays movies. To go for the cheap option in the remake would result in serving a sincere disrespect to Robert Wise, Shirley Jackson and especially the faithful audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie one Christmas Eve, long ago, when by chance I happened to be busy wrapping presents, paying little attention to the TV screen. The Haunting is a compelling film, one which will engage your attention no matter what you are doing. Inevitably it will also scare the pants off you too. Like The Exorcist and maybe Night of the Living Dead, the film gets under your skin and induces the kind of panic that makes you attentive to every little bump you may hear in the dark (I decided that sleeping with the fairy lights on was the only morally decent thing to do).Yet, underneath its shocking persona lies a very intelligent little film that presents us with a number of complex characters. Eleanor, the psychotic innocent, who in her desperation to break away from the memory of her mother, (who she may, or may not have killed); seeks sanctuary in Hill House. Theodore, the sexy ESP expert who is (if you concentrate on the sexual undertones) perhaps a strange, enigmatic lesbian boffin. Dr. Markway, a normal enough psychic investigator who for some reason finds more at home with spooks than at home with the missus. And shameful Luke, the young capitalist who epitomises the antithesis of the 60's free-loving ethos by progressively calculating the value of his ancestral residence.What ensues is a strange brew of narrative blends, which presents the spectator with a series of conclusions. Is the ghost a real entity that lurks in the shadows of the house? or is it all in Eleanor's head? I mean come on, this bird talks to her self in a rather unstable way. She is perhaps more frightening than the spooks who run wild in Hill House. It could be argued that it is Eleanor who possesses the strange powers that make doors spill out and cannonballs blast against the wall. Or maybe none of it happened and as Eleanor claims "maybe I'm imagining you all and none of you are real."The Haunting is one of the greatest films I've seen. Perhaps not as terrifying as The Exorcist, but not too far off. To be honest with you most people who've seen the film think it's got more going for it than Friedkin's masterpiece. The cool thing is that Wise has ensured that The Haunting will remain timeless movie. In fact there are no stupid monsters or spectral superimposition's; everything is done through expressionistic lighting and sound, much like German Wiemar horror texts such as The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and Nosferatu. All you see are pulsating lights against the wall and thudding sounds to suggest the ghost is near. It takes the gothic into a new dimension. I think that if you like quality films, you cannot help but admire this blinder of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my many years of watching horror films, I have yet to find one that comes close to the terror that I experienced when I saw "The Haunting." This is the quintessential haunted house movie of all time.The plot runs like this. A scientific researcher is interested in researching a house which has had a miserable history of driving its inhabitants crazy to determine whether or not it is actually haunted. He gathers a team of two other researchers and the nephew of the old lady who owns the house. One of the scientific researchers, played by Claire Bloom, is somewhat crazy herself. She often hears voices in her head, which of course, the movie audience gets the pleasure of witnessing. The owner's nephew is a non-believer in the supernatural and refuses to accept the fact that the house is haunted. Thus, the stage is set for this unusual group to spend the week-end inside the house to prove whether or not there is a ghost in the house.The house is creepy at first glance. There's a locked wrought iron fence that surrounds the property. Nothing has gone in or out for 7 years with the exception of the caretakers, who are very creepy in their own right. Once inside the house, you get the feeling that the group is locked in. As the doors shut with a loud thud, the group begins to explore. It is dark inside and there are many rooms to explore. They are all warned not to wander for it is easy to get lost inside the many passageways that wind through the long corridors. From this point on, the four researchers learn that there is a presence in the house. It is not a presence that you can see, but one you can hear and even feel. As the guests sleep at night with their bedroom doors locked, they all hear a loud rhythmic thumping sound outside their rooms. The walls move inward as if a giant force is trying to push them down. Other scary events are hallucinations which Claire Bloom experiences. On the first night, she slept the entire night while holding hands with her female roommate. The queer thing is, the next morning her roommate has no recollection of even sleeping in the same bed with Claire. This leaves you to wonder who she was actually holding hands with.As the story unfolds, each of the guests has their own individual experience that no one else remembers. The climax is intense, not for the faint of heart.Horror film buffs will love this movie. Rent it some night, if you dare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every film student or would-be producer who thinks that scaring the pants off an audience requires $40M in digital effects (or even $400,000 in fake blood and viscera) should see this film. The only special effect I can find is a rubber door that flexes as 'something' pushes from the other side. Everything else is just lively editing, dutch tilts (yes, they pre-date MTV), lighting, and acting. But the result is remarkably frightening.Like Oscar_26, I, too, first saw the film as a child, on TV. I finally was too terrified to watch the screen and instead stood out in the hall, where I could watch my mom's face -- and ask her what was happening every few seconds. I never forgot it and was thrilled to find it on video a year or so ago. And unlike other films from childhood that have lost their ability to terrify (~The Crawling Eye~ comes to mind), ~The Haunting~ still can make me anxious and jumpy for days. I don't see how next year's remake can possibly expect to compare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a child of about seven or eight, I remember sitting on the floor of my living room alone one Saturday afternoon watching a scary movie. I already had a deep fear of ghosts, planted in me by my four older brothers and sisters. I sat in rapt and horrified attention. I remember that when at last a commercial came on (in those days you could actually watch TV without a commercial breaking in every ten minutes), I ran down the street to where one of my brothers was playing with his friends. "There's the scariest movie ever on TV right now--you have to come see it!" They knew I was a TV freak, however, and I guessed correctly that my words wouldn't carry much weight with them. I begged them to come and see it, for I didn't want to watch any more of it alone. But I seemed drawn back to it despite their dismissal. I ran back to join the show and sat through it alone till the end. Afterward, I knew it wasn't a movie for children to see and I felt guilty for watching it all.That movie has haunted my dreams ever since. I never knew what the title of the movie was, or if I had just blown it out of proportion, and often wondered what it was I saw--some cheap "B" movie scary enough only for a child? But no, I thought, the scene of the pounding on the door, and the girl saying something was holding her hand, and the statues changing positions were truly terrifying.It wasn't until I read recently of the re-make in production that I finally knew I had found the film again. I knew instantly that this was the movie that was responsible for so much terror for me. Even now I hesitate to watch it because of the memories it raises. It is truly my most frightening movie experience ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My dad was a big fan of scary movies, and he and I watched a ton of them when I was growing up--probably more slasher flicks than an adolescent should be allowed to see. But I always remember him talking about how his favorite was "The Haunting". He had a recorded copy of it on VHS, and he loved to go on about how it was the best scary movie ever made, but for some reason we never watched it together--though I did remember bits and pieces that I must have caught along the way at some point.That said, I caught it on Turner Classic this week, and I have to say it was a bit of a let down. This is a film that was made in 1963, a good fifteen years before the advent of the 80's slasher films and the more grotesque genre of horror film that has come to dominate the genre ever since. When this film was made, there were two kinds of horror movies: monster movies in the style of Dracula, The Mummy, and various 50's B-rate flicks; and Alfred Hitchcock-inspired films in the style of Psycho and Rebecca. "The Haunting" fits into the latter category. Indeed, having seen the whole thing, I'm very surprised that it's not in fact a Hitchcock film, as it follows the Hitchcock formula closely. The movie is made in black and white, and the acting is rigid like a "classic film". The script could carry over well into a theatre production, and for the style of film that it is the movie is extremely well made--well shot, well produced, etc.Still, I just found it hard to get into. Perhaps that's because of my age, as a Gen-Xer. I enjoy classic film, but horror is probably my least favorite genre of the classics, since the style is so different--and so less scary--than a modern day horror vibe. And so, while I found this film to be exceptional in terms of style and production quality, I can't help but mark it down in terms of likability. 5/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe all the fawning reviews. Not scary at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting has been on my "to watch" list for many Octobers, due to all the incredibly positive reviews. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. This movie is not scary, suspenseful, spooky, moody or any other adjective you've read in other reviews. There is an incessant overload of expository dialogue from wooden characters. There is no buildup of tension. There is a main character who seems a bit psychologically unhinged, and being in the house might be making it worse. But there is very little here to scare any viewers. Unless of course you fear you might be going a bit crazy yourself. The entire movie should have been compressed to a 30-minute prologue to an actual ghost story or haunted house movie. I'm all for moody, atmospheric, subtle horror. This film has none of that. Skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this as a pre-teen about 47 years ago, and while I'm not easily 'led', this film has been imprinted in my mind ever since - as a classic. The audience was fifty school kids on a Saturday night, running on 16mm film... Far more worthy than the more recent slasher genre, or the remake with Catherine Zeta Jones (but she's nice to look at!). Don't go in expecting CGI or effects. Have dinner, a glass of wine then watch it in a darkened room without distractions. A great example to show film students how script, acting and direction are far more important than colour, zombies or other 'horror' affectations. Just good solid filmmaking and will keep you up all night - if you 'get it' unlike some earlier reviews!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Haunting Lingers in Memory Eternally</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting (1963). Adapted from "The Haunting of Hill House" by Shirley Jackson. Hollywood legend Robert Wise directs this disturbing tale of a fragile spinster who joins a paranormal researcher's on-site investigation of a notoriously haunted house. Julie Harris radiates naivete and terror in equal measure. 60s stalwarts Richard Johnson, Russ Tamblyn, and Claire Bloom are her de facto family in a harrowing weekend of closing doors and phantom noises. This film is extremely unsettling and brilliantly filmed. The relationship between Eleanor (Harris) and Theo (Bloom) in The Haunting provides an opportunity for camp to leak in, but Wise keeps everything strictly business. There is not a single frame in The Haunting that does not somehow either enhance the atmosphere or advance the plot. If you watch closely, you will see that they inverted some of the exterior shots from B&amp;W to W&amp;B just to create a more alien feel. The movie is rife with innuendo, but never crosses the line to self-parody.Eleanor is a very tragic figure. Her lone attempt to control her own destiny results in unexpected acceptance and kinship that slowly gives way to fear. Julie Harris plays her as if she stopped maturing at age 10, when the poltergeist experience occurred. Her celibate status is due more to her childish attitude that sex is 'icky' (inferred from her relationships with Theo and Luke), than any lack of sex appeal.The Haunting is set in the early 1960s, but the picture is timeless. The cinematography by Davis Boulton, editing by Ernest Walter, production design by Elliot Scott, and especially the music by Humphrey Searle are all top-quality. Its treatment of ghostly goings-on may not be to everyone's liking, but the synergy of technical elements with casting and script creates a thrilling, memorable experience for the audience.

		<shortDescription>The Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so the title of my review is an outright attempt to troll, but it got your attention, didn't it? I'm going to start this review out with a big qualification on my opinion. First, I am obsessed with horror films. I'm that geek that's seen hundreds of them and talks about obscure trivia that no one really cares about in the first place. However, as much as I love horror, I have always found ghost stories to be my least favorite subject in that genre. Even more so, I prefer to ghost stories to have some actual action going one, things flying through the air, etc, and generally don't like movies where the scariest thing occurring is some banging noises. Thirdly, I'm even less a fan of the sort of ghost story where it may have all been in the head of some crazy person and not ghostly phenomena at all.So, having said all of that, this movie is destined to be the kind of movie that I just don't find all that entertaining. Take that for what you will and I'm sure many now think I'm an idiot, but reviews are just our opinions right? So, my opinion is just as valid as anyone else's.Director Robert Wise was a disciple of Val Lewton, who firmly believed in the "less is more" principle and that a viewer's imagination is far more terrifying than anything shown on screen. His movies often left the action in the shadows and Wise employs this same tactic in his adaptation of Shirley Jackson's famous novel. The directing is the one saving grace, for me, in this movie. It's magnificently filmed and shot. Each angle is perfectly chosen. The use of a wideshot lense that was still in development and not yet ready for use gives many shots a distortion that really adds to the feel. In the story, we're told that the house was built with odd angles and the whole movie carries this feel. Nothing feels quite normal and, as a result, the viewer is left with the same unsettling feel as the characters in the house.The acting is, also, top notch here (for the most part). The two male leads play their roles well. Richard Johnson, in particular, plays different sides of his personality well, from the intellectual looking for an experiment, to the human concerned for Nell's well- being, to the annoyed husband upset at his wife's presence, he plays all these angles well. Claire Bloom is excellent as Theo. Her chiding veneer hiding the sensitive, frightened psychic underneath. Then, there's Julie Harris. I'm not going to knock her acting. She does a fantastic job with the role given to her and plays it well. It's the role itself. Nell is the sort of annoying lead character that you'd rather just slap in the face by the end of the movie. Clearly unhinged from the beginning, the entire movie revolves around her gradual mental decline and her reactions to the events going on. I understand that I'm giving some shallow criticism here, but again, it's my opinion, right? I can't stand her and she's a big reason I don't enjoy this movie.I'm not going to bash this movie a lot. There are a whole lot of people out there that would tell you this is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and I can understand and respect that opinion. There is a lot of great film making here to enjoy. For me, personally, it's just not my cup of tea. I'll tell you another person that felt very much the same -- Richard Matheson. He, too, wanted more action and wanted a movie that clearly showed you supernatural phenomena rather than leaving vague questions over whether anything was real or in someone's head, so he created what, to me, is a superior movie, THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE. Go watch it instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is There Anything Scarier?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie scared the living daylights out of me. I first saw this movie in the 70's (even then it was an old flick). My hands shot up over my eyes long before the bolt was thrown, locking our ghost hunting guests behind the heavy doors of, 'Hill House.' If there was ever a story that kept a person scared without showing anything?this was it. What a masterpiece. From beginning to end, my, 'Scared-Out-of-My-Mind Meter' was continuously pegged. Afterward ? were there nightmares?HA! Of course there were ? way too many. As a glutton for punishment, when I finished watching this movie, I just needed more. I had to read the book?which I did. Then I went looking for more stuff by Shirley Jackson. I found it and read the rest of her stuff, what can I say, I became addicted. It took me a little while to complete the task, but I finally read everything I could find. I have to say, whatever was lurking around her brain, keep it away from me, I don't want anything to do with it. This movie is a brilliant adaptation of a brilliant writer's work. I have never been a big Julie Harris fan, but she did an awesome job in her part. This is really some scary and worthy stuff.</fullReview>

Far, far far below...The Robert Wise's film still terrifies me, when I watch it at night, alone in my room, doors closed. The sequence of the bedroom door distending whilst the sound effect would would give diarrhoea to a constipated person. Believe me, young folks who ONLY believe in modern ghost stories, watch this master piece and tell me what you felt during the viewing, and afterwards.

She put me on edge talking to the parking attendant! Her brittleness and barely contained explosive rage wears on me and kind of softened me up for when the real fun starts.I thought there were a few abrupt changes in tone, MINOR SPOILER when Harris and Bloom first explore the house and get lost they go from giddy to terrified in a single cut -- we don't see them get lost really.

		<shortDescription>"Help Eleanor Come Home"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an owner of a DVD copy, I will nonetheless be first in line if and when "The Haunting" receives a local big screen showing. This is a film definitely meant to be seen in the dark! As one can discern from the 33 pages of user reviews thus far, you will either be scared out of your wits, or you won't. Like everything, it all comes down to the viewer's own expectations.While I find the film to be wonderfully creepy and atmospheric, I tend to admire it more as a psychological fright-fest. Both director Wise and screenwriter Nelson Gidding both came to view the story as not one about a haunted house, but instead the tale of the central character's (Julie Harris as Eleanor) descent into a nervous breakdown. They ran their idea by Shriley Jackson, who's novel the film is based on, and although she didn't support their interpretation, she nonetheless said it was "A damn good idea!" In later interviews Harris admits to having been going through a bout of depression while making the film, and it helped to add more dimension to her character. Eleanor is an angry repressed young woman who's not had any real life to speak of, having been saddled with caring for her ill disagreeable mother for the last eleven years. Many reviewers regard her character as being unsympathetically annoying and self-absorbed, but I find her bitterness and lashings-out to be in character, considering her life so lacking in joy or romantic companionship.This is what makes the story work; Eleanor's vulnerability makes her receptive to the weird goings-on around her. The house, "evil, patient, waiting", finds Eleanor to be a kindred spirit, and she gradually falls under its spell as she develops a sense of belonging for probably the first time in her life. Initially invited to the house to be one of four observers of psychic phenomenon, she becomes increasingly at risk of losing her very sanity, an essay on the madness of loneliness.The small cast is good in their respective roles. Of particular interest is Claire Bloom who's character "Theo" is portrayed as a lesbian. This aspect is interesting mostly because of how the subject is handled (for 1963), barely a year after "The Children's Hour" made it the central theme of a motion picture. The film was initially supposed to include an early scene showing Theo breaking up with her female partner as she heads out for Hill House. The directors discarded it, deciding instead to let her sexuality become more gradually apparent to viewers.The film ends predictably but its explanation as understood by the other characters does a nice job of wrapping it up in a most eerie fashion. "The Haunting" is a must-see for all horror fans, if only to see how a multi-layered nightmare is supposed to look and feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of, if not the, best ghost movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie was with a friend, who was staying over for the night.We'd stopped it listed in the newspaper and thought it would be laugh to watch an old ghost film. We watched it and, needless to say, neither of us slept then night! The atmosphere in the film is almost palatable. You never see anything but it is all there in the atmosphere. Creaks, bangs, thumps and voices, but nothing is ever see on screen. The 'voice through the wall' while Nell listened, has got to be one of the 'spookiest' scenes ever filmed. and while some of the special effects are unconvincing it does not detract from the quality of the film.The use of infra red film in some of the outside shots are particularly effective and only add to the sense of the 'unreal' and atmosphere.A 'must see' for any fan of a good ghost story. (unlike the '99 remake, which is best avoided!) Incidentally years after first seeing this film I was given the change to investigate the real building used for the film in a 'paranormal investigation. (I kid you not!) While inside the building looks nothing like the interior used in the film, which was a set. Standing outside and looking at the building was amazing! I also realised that Wise had used cleaver and imaginative camera angles to make the building look much larger than it really was. Nevertheless it looked amazing.we didn't find any ghosts in the house, now a hotel (Ettington Park Hotel) we did investigate the family crypt at the back of the house. This was very spooky and we seemed to have captured a voice on audio, which was impressive. During the audio commentary included with the DVD Russ Tamblyn (who played Luke Sanderson) recounted how he encountered 'something' close to the crypt while filming. I didn't hear the audio commentary until years after our investigation! maybe it was the same thing Tamblyn encountered??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creeped Me Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an unmistakable creepiness about Robert Wise's film. The horror genre which goes back to the '20's and before has always had an element of the psychological. This element began to be highlighted in the the horror films of the 50's and 60's, and is exquisitely represented in The Haunting.The Haunting is a psychological study of a woman losing her mind under the influence of a charming older man who has convinced her of the reality of ghosts. It is a very similar theme to the Henry James novelette, A Turn of the Screw, in which a young governess begins to become unhinged after coming to believe through a series of accidents that her young charges are making contact with the ghost world.In both instances, their gullibility leads them to doubt their own senses, and to ultimately reveal a disturbing death wish at the center of all their clamoring. It was James' genius that he was able to compose such a story at the opening of the century, before Freud.There is a lot of sexual tension in the movie. There is the flirtatious dalliance between Theo and the young male skeptic/companion. There is the crush that Julie Harris character has on the character of the paranormal investigator. Lastly, there is the unspoken attraction between the two female leads.All of this sexual energy is linked to the dark sexual secrets of the house's doomed forebears, which makes the 'haunting' a personal self-revealing as well as a force which proves just enough to drive the Harris character over the edge.All this psychological terror is heightened by the stifling, ornate design of the sets, long shadows and low lighting to achieve a kind of claustrophobic psychological space. Julie Harris' character is coming apart under the strain, just as the house seems to be physically coming apart around her at the end of the film, as she runs frantically from room to room.This is a film to watch at night, preferably after a couple or three brandies or substance of your choice. Then sit back, and let the movie get into your head. You will never forget it! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie "THE HAUNTING " for the very first time. It's from 1963 and I'm surprised it's actually rated G?! The movie is much more scary than others you see more recent. There is hardly any blood or splatter. You just hear scary sounds. There are demented things like a door breathing. For that matter there's barely special effects, at least not in the sense that we understand them today. It's all done with strong storytelling ability. It uses imagination rather than showing all the time. The Hill House is creepy/scary much more than Amityville or anything like that. The acting is all top notch especially Julie harris and Claire Bloom. The black and white, if you like that, is nicely done. For supernatural stories, I'd say this is near tops.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most important horror movies of the 1960's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most haunted house horror films and you expect to see; a ghost wandering the corridor, a group of people in peril, blood, gore and the like. While these are important elements of haunted house horror movies, 'The Haunting' have very little of these. Yet, is one of the most important and brilliant haunted house movies of all time.In 'The Haunting' you don't have ghost running around, or beautiful women constantly cowering in the corner, in fact, the viewer sees very little, yet this movie still contains an eerie presence and still manages to keep interest alive and still grabs attentionThe main character in this film is Eleanor Lance - played by Julie Harris - who is shy, insecure young woman with very little to live for; she has spent most of her adult life caring for her now late mother and being bullied and belittled by her older sister. As a result, it is hardly surprising that an offer by Dr. John Markway - played by Richard Johnson - to take part in an experiment in the supernatural in a supposedly haunted house grabs her attention, offering her the somewhat form of escapism she so desperately needs. What makes this film so gripping is the fact that, even when there is only dialogue on the screen, it is still interesting and watchable. Also, even with the absence of any visible scares an eerie feeling is still present; the long corridors, the long periods of silence,and the many shadows seen.]The character of Eleanor has not had a good life, and coming to Hill House helps her to escape and try something new. The forces in the house however want her, and at first she battles then eventually gives in. She experiences fear from the house yet at the same time enjoys the attention it offers.This film is a drama as well as a horror, as we follow the emotional and social well being on Eleanor. Her giving into the desires of the house could be read as a symbol of her finally finding what she 'wants' and desires.Not many other films have the power, and story to grip a viewer the way this film does, particularly through long periods of simply dialogue. The Haunting is without a doubt one of the most important horror movies of all time and should be watched by many.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Things that go bump in the night"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The early 1960s saw the rise of the splatter horror. These were by and large cheap, gaudy, blood-and-guts shockers made to cash in on the recent success of Psycho. In a valiant effort to turn the tide, producer-director Robert Wise strove to make a horror that relied upon atmospheric suggestion than explicit gruesomeness. Wise was in a good position, having cut his directorial teeth at Val Lewton's B-unit at RKO, which produced some of the most subtly effective horror movies ever committed to celluloid. The Haunting is his tribute to those Lewton classics, as well as his showcase of the things he learnt working on them.More than any other genre, good horror tends to rely upon cinematic technique than upon compelling story lines and strong acting performances. There are many tricks in framing and pacing which, if done correctly, can seriously unnerve the viewer, and Wise employs just about all of them. Notice how virtually all the shots within the house have some distant vanishing point ? an open door at the back of the set, often with some shape as if a person is standing there. Mirrors hidden amongst the bric-a-brac produce surprise bits of movement as a character passes them. The numerous busts and figurines about the house are used to trick the viewer into thinking for a second that there is an extra person on the set, most effectively after a cut in the scene where Fay Compton is in her room alone. Another method is to have the camera wheeling round whilst keeping Compton in the centre of the frame, so the décor of the house moves while she is still. But it's not all in the power of suggestion; The Haunting does have its directly macabre moments, such as the arm of a dead woman flopping across the frame in the opening scene. Wise's handling of pace and rhythm is crucial too, with slow moments and long takes suddenly interrupted by a burst of rapid editing.Wise also benefits from the support of collaborators, with a production crew on the same disturbing wavelength. The production design of Eliot Scott and John Jarvis, with all its overbearing clutter and things that look like faces, is a tremendous aid to the atmospherics. The sharp cinematography by Davis Boulton reveals ever crack and crease in the busy set decoration, and yet this is not high-contrast lighting; there is still overwhelmingly more dark than light. The well-timed editing of Ernest Walter produces some of the most jarring moments. And finally there is the sound design, with some eerily devilish noises that are indistinct enough to be suggestive of all sorts of unseen terrors. On the acting side of things the finest performance is that of the very naturalistic Claire Bloom. Julie Harris is perhaps a little overwrought but she is perfect for her character's frailty and flightiness. This also marks one of the last significant film roles for Russ Tamblyn before he went into a severe career decline, as well as a rare chance to see the lovely Rosalie Crutchley (once the voice of The Children's Hour radio slot).For all its technical prowess, The Haunting is not without some serious flaws. While character and narrative are somewhat secondary concerns in a picture like this, some semblance of good writing is certainly of benefit, since exceptionally bad plotting can be a real distraction. In this case the characters are disappointingly one-dimensional, especially Tamblyn's immature sceptic, whose dialogue goes through every corny cliché you can think of. The inner monologue voice-over for Compton's character is an annoying and superfluous device. Above all though there is the fact that all the cunning creepiness technique is frankly a little overdone. There are just a few too many obtrusive manoeuvres like zooms and Dutch angles, which actually break the build-up of atmosphere because they make us very aware that we are watching something artificial. The business with the face seeming to appear in the wallpaper is clever but is made far too obvious, and as the movie wears on, its scariness becomes less and less. The Haunting is at many times crafted with genius, almost like a manual of horror movie method, and yet in itself it falls short of being the perfect horror it aspires to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I should start by saying that I'm not generally into this sub-genre. It needs to be impeccable for me to even consider it, because the majority of them do not appeal to me. When I found this on sale, I nearly immediately purchased it. I haven't read the novel, though I understand that this is an excellent adaptation. Also, I fell asleep watching the remake, but that may have been on account of being tired(with that said, it's apparently poor). If I had to say something negative about this, gun to my head, I guess one could claim that the narration is, as is often the case, a little bit of a crutch; then again, it really doesn't feel excessive, and it was arguably necessary. I swear I am being objective and not merely fawning. Well, trying my best to, anyway. The atmosphere is carefully built up; it's largely the sound aspect and the way they used the camera. This uses unconventional angles, albeit without them resulting in distancing the audience from the film. The mansion is quite creepy and eerie. It being in black and white helps(and was intentional). This is suspenseful and genuinely terrifying. What makes it so effective is that, like Hitchcock did, this uses our imagination, hinting as opposed to showing. It's rather minimalistic. The FX are marvelous and never empty. Every character(the female ones get to have moments where they display strong wills, and there is little sexism in this) is well-developed, credible(the psychological accuracy is remarkable) and distinguished, and this is at least as much(if not more) about them as the house and the haunting. I suppose that is what you should notice, in order to determine if this is for you or not. The acting is spot-on. Backstory and plot are great. The writing is well-done, and dialog is memorable and delivered nicely. There is suggestive material(mild enough that few children would perceive it, and certainly not comprehend it) in this, and other than being scary, that's the only potentially offensive content. The DVD comes with an interesting and informational commentary(by the director(R.I.P., you knew your craft) and the four stars), a 5 min stills gallery and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to anyone who can see themselves enjoying this. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Haunting Defines What Ghost Stories Are All About!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the deliciously frightening novel "The Haunting of Hill House" by Shirley Jackson, "The Haunting" was directed by film genius Robert Wise, director of such amazing films as "West Side Story" and "The Sound of Music." Coming from such a jubilant genre, you wouldn't think that Wise would step up to direct a horror film. Well, our prayers for a perfect horror movie have been answered. "The Haunting" is a perfect 10 and brings chills to the spine each time you watch it, especially at night.Eleanor "Nell" Lance, Theodora, and Luke Sanderson have been invited to join Dr. John Markway in an investigation of paranormal activity. Where? The infamous Hill House, the home of the ill-fated Crain family. Hill House is described as "a house that was born bad." And the group is there to find out if it really is a haunted house. Out of all four people, Eleanor is the one that feels that she belongs in Hill House, as if the mansion was calling her name all along. Soon, the group's questions will be answered...in traumatizing ways! "The Haunting" works so well because it's what great ghost stories are all about. First off, there's atmosphere. When we first see Hill House, we are immediately creeped out and thrown into a nightmare from which there is no escape. Next up, you got a perfect psychological horror movie formula: What you don't see is scarier than what you do see. And Wise aims to keep that formula throughout the film. You never see any ghosts, and there is very little on-screen violence. The movie is done through shadow, and noises, including the infamous "bedroom" scene which still freaks me out every time, and there is the "breathing door" sequence that is enough to give you nightmares for weeks. Finally, there's suspense. The movie unfolds slowly as each supernatural event gets more bizarre and terrifying each time, and that is how you do a great psychological horror film.The cast give jobs well-done. Julie Harris is remarkable as Eleanor. You're not quite sure if the character is descending into madness or if she really is experiencing this supernatural phenomena. Claire Bloom is also very entertaining as the feisty and sexy Theodora. Russ Tamblyn is fine as Luke, and the same goes for Richard Johnson as Markway."The Haunting" proves that you don't need special effects to scare the hell out of the viewer. Just put them in a dark place, start them off with a few strange noises, and you've got them frightened for life. Avoid the monstrosity of a remake, and stick with this wonderfully old-fashioned ghost story that is sure to stick with you. I'll close it off with a classic quote from the film.Dr. John Markway: "Hill House stood for 90 years, and might stand for 90 more...and whatever walked there walked alone."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest horror film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When horror movie directors are asked which film scares them the most, most refer to Michael Powell's Peeping Tom ? along with this little number from the director of The Sound Of Music. The Haunting is terrifying. This writer has personally known hardened squaddies who've insisted on sleeping with the lights on after a single viewing, convinced the very film stock had been 'tinkered with' by witches. Impressively, there's not a ounce of gore in this haunted house classic (don't bother with the terrible remake), the film relying on camera tricks, sound effects and some well-timed shocks to do its dirty work. It also stars Claire Bloom as a well-rounded lesbian, and you can't say fairer than that. Anyway, consider yourself warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solid ghost story involves a group of disparate people invited to spend the weekend in an old New England mansion reputed to be haunted. Producer-director Robert Wise's justly celebrated movie-version of Shirley Jackson's book "The Haunting of Hill House" has a good amount of shocks and a fabulous set, though he and screenwriter Nelson Gidding have trouble with the characters, particularly Eleanor, played by Julie Harris. The atmosphere and minutiae have been given so much attention that the humans of the story seem to get the short-shrift, and Harris' hysteria becomes repetitious and nerve-wracking (though maybe not in the way intended). Lots of banging doors and bumps in the night, but if you're attuned to Wise's mounting of the plot, it isn't difficult to become thoroughly absorbed. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best ghost film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that deserves the description of spine-chiller. It is one of the few ghost films that actually chills the blood and scares. This is because Robert Wise is very careful to establish a second dimension to the plot. We inhabit the mind of the Julie Harris just as we explore the dark corridors of the old house. She is sympathetic without being wishy-washy. Everyone entering the house has another reason for being there beside the investigation of ghosts. Tension is developed through suggestion, a method completely lost on the makers of the dire sequel. I saw this film as a child but found that seeing it afresh did not disappoint. It has an amazing atmosphere of evil and foreboding. Great direction and a fantastic cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most unsettling films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghost stories can work and do work quite often in literature, depending on the talent of the writer. When it comes to ghost stories on film, there must be a complete combination of all the necessary elements for a film about ghosts to be anything more than mildly entertaining nonsense. The design must be good, the direction must be just about faultless, the acting must be convincing, the sound work must also be of a high quality. This combination is undoubtedly and understandably rare.I have seen countless horror films, among them many ghost stories, and none have made something as simple as walking in the dark as trying a task as "The Haunting", where master director Robert Wise crafts an elegant, intelligent horror film, one which displays what is basically technical perfection when it comes to the way the film is edited (particularly the sound; there is absolutely nothing like watching this film in a dark and silent room late at night), photographed, and directed. It is so easy for even skilled directors to make choices that make hauntings seems silly rather than unsettling, but Robert Wise makes all the right choices here and no wrong ones. There are few better examples of suspense than certain scenes in "The Haunting", particularly one sequence toward the end of the film, which features one of the most unsettling and heart-stopping 'jump moments' ever recorded on film, and we all know how hard it is for a horror movie to actually pull one of those off.The plot, taken from a novel by Shirley Jackson, is nothing to write home about. Take a bunch of characters and have them spend a couple of nights in a house with a dark history (haunted or not, Hill House doesn't sound like a pleasant place), and proceed to put the characters in 'scary' situations. What makes Oscar nominee Nelson Gidding's screenplay work is the complexity of the psychological profiles given to the characters. As a fan of "The Haunting" I have read many analyses of the characters in the film, especially the lead character Eleanor and the possibly clairvoyant Theo, and as different as many of them are, they are all still rooted in what is indisputably present in the film, and not in wild speculation. It is pointless to attempt to cover certain aspects of the film, or even just one of them, say the (arguably) implied lesbianism, in the body of this review as it would not only take too much space but also since there are many other resources available where the film is discussed in much greater detail than I can go into without discussing particular aspects of the film which someone who has not seen it would not want to know prior to doing so.Beyond the psychologically complex characters and their interesting interactions the film is just marvelous to look at. Having already commented on the technical quality of the film-making here, that still might not have been enough for this film to become the resounding success it is, as there was certainly the need for quality performances as well, and the acting here is superb from basically every cast member. Making a genuinely unsettling horror film is extremely hard in the first place, but making one about ghosts which manages to be completely unsettling basically from start to finish is a near impossible task. Robert Wise may not fit the auteur label, which is probably why he is not discussed as much as other great directors by film buffs and critics, but he is one of the most talented directors there were, and it is his "The Haunting" that remains the most unsettling ghost story ever put on film, and one of the five or so best horror films ever made. A genuinely spooky classic. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is the right way to make a film about a haunted house. Please, if you value the hours of your life, do not ever watch Jan de Bont's bowdlerised 1999 remake of this classic. This version, made by the late, great Robert Wise, is all about atmosphere, and what atmosphere - a sense of mounting oppression and dread that will remain with any imaginative viewer long after the film is over. There is one particular scene which remains imprinted on my memory from my first viewing of The Haunting when I was a child. It's the scene where the camera focuses on the wallpaper. Doesn't sound scary, does it? Well, watch it and see.The cinematography, by Davis Boulton, is an essential factor in what makes this movie work, and he makes the most of the house's dark corridors and omnipresent shadows. Add to this impressive and striking camera work and subtle but terrifying sound and visual effects and you have an unforgettable cinematic experience. The screenplay, by Nelson Gidding, is faithful to Shirley Jackson's novel, and the cast is an unusual but effective mixture of character actors, one musical star and great actresses such as Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. Enjoy Valentine Dyall's amusingly surly and monosyllabic turn as Mr. Dudley, the caretaker, not forgetting Rosalie Crutchley's entertainingly ghoulish performance as his wife, the housekeeper who takes a perverse pleasure out of trying to give Julie Harris's character the willies.You might have been told by some people not to watch this film alone. Don't listen to them. The best circumstances for viewing The Haunting are to watch it at night, completely alone, with all the lights off. If it also happens to be a stormy night with the wind howling down the chimney, so much the better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best House Haunted Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the perfect Haunted House movie, and a big influence on later film makers. The tale, based on a classic Shirley Jackson story, begins with a brilliant, quick montage of the house's haunted history.Enter four psychic researchers, two of whom are endowed with psychic powers themselves. Julie Harris portrays one, an adult runaway seeking adventure and escape. Claire Bloom is the other, a sexy woman with secrets of her own. A cat and mouse game between the two ensues, even as Julie Harris' Eleanor slowly succumbs to the evil of the house.The scares are provided by sound effects, not by the cheesy CGI of horror flicks today. The scene when they are all down stairs, locked in the study, and they hear the frightening "thump thump," is about as spooky as it gets. When the walls start to bend, and Russ Tamblyn drops his drink, its pure white-knuckle cinema. Sam Raimi was taking notes, as were many others.</fullReview>

I'm unfamiliar with her work so I don't know if this was an exceptional film for her nor why she didn't have more starring roles but here she clearly makes the film and is the primary reason I scored the film as high as I did. Ultimately the film is not scary, a death knell to a horror film.

		<fullReview>A professor (Johnson) goes to investigate reports of haunting at a house with a Gothic history, aided by a neurotic, repressed spinster (Harris), a self-confident, clairvoyant lesbian (Bloom) and the sleazy wise-guy heir to the house (Tamblyn.) I saw this as a kid in the theater and it really scared the heck out of me. Today I found it fun to watch, but draggy, repetitive and talky in some parts, and thus not especially chilling. It might have worked better if it had been about 20-30 minutes shorter.I'm a huge fan of Harris, Bloom and Tamblyn and thought they were all very good here. Though compelled to be over the top at times, I found Harris' hysteria and loneliness very human and sad. Bloom's shifting between snippiness and seductive kindness helped keep things interesting. Tamblyn was such a cute guy and provided the right elements of comic relief and common sense. Johnson, stuck with the least compelling role, neither detracted from nor added much to the film.The camera work was truly outstanding but didn't come across as dramatically on TV, especially with those confounded black strips that wide-screen movies have.To be fair, over the years I've seen many a haunted house flick, making the film fairly predictable for me. I would say this movie is probably a must-see for fans of the genre, a fun experience for admirers of Harris and Bloom and a take-it-or-leave-it proposition for the rest of you movie lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Haunting" (1963). Talk about terror...this version makes the 1999 film feel tame, quiet, mediocre.It didn't take fantastic exploding special effects, blood or body parts to make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Several well place mirrors, loud noises, talking walls and moans and groans did the trick. Then there are the long halls and camera angles. Director Robert Wise didn't waste any of his talents or the actors.Dr. Markway (Robert Johnson) gains permission from the owner of Hill House to gather with others who are sensitive to the paranormal. Part of the agreement includes the presence of her nephew Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn).The 1st to arrive at Hill House is Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris) who has psychic abilities. She gets to meet the Dudley's, the cook and caretaker (Rosalie Crutchley &amp; Valentine Dyall). They're pretty scary without ghosts. Then 'clairvoyant' Theodora (Clare Bloom) is shown to her room. Eleanor discovers they're rooms are separated by a shared bath. 'Nell' and 'Theo', as they call each other, become instant friends.When Dr. Markway and Luke arrive the 4 agree stay there to experience the ghostly atmosphere. Of course, Luke believes in none of it BUT he mixes a great martini. There are scenes that introduce the ghosts but everything is explained away. Then Mrs. Markway shows up and there are some sudden changes.I suppose "The Haunting" can seem a bit drawn out in some scenes. IMO it's a lively little film that delivers what horror/thriller fans really want, goosebumps and entertainment. If you haven't seen it you must. I don't think I took a breath from the time the movie started 'til it ended.I had never seen this movie from beginning to end before. I think that's because I wasn't allowed to stay up and watch it. I wonder if that had anything to do with the sexual content and the mid-1960's?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the beginning of civilization, stories involving ghosts and spirits have existed in many cultures worldwide, as the fascination with death and what comes after it is definitely a part of our nature. This fascination found itself at home in the horror genre, and became a trademark of the Gothic and romantic literature of the 18th century, as it was a natural source of inspiration for many different kinds of nightmarish stories. Of course, ghost stories would also make the transition to cinema and soon became staple of the horror film genre as a major source of macabre movies. As an important sub-genre within horror, many movies about ghosts have been made through the years, however, if there is a movie that has captured perfectly the essence of what a good ghost story is, and elevated the genre to the level of masterpiece, is definitely Robert Wise's "The Haunting"."The Haunting" is the story of a house, "Hill House", an old mansion named after the hills that surround it. But Hill House is not a common house, as for over a century it has been known as one of the most sinister haunted houses with a past filled with death and madness. Dr. Markway, a famous scientist obsessed with the supernatural, decides to carry an experiment in Hill House in his desire to prove that the supernatural exists and that the haunting of Hill House is real. He invites a group of selected people whom he thinks are able to help him in his quest, but only two answer the call: the clairvoyant Theo (Claire Bloom) and Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris), a shy woman with a mysterious past. Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn), heir of the house, joins the group as a skeptical with an interest in his inheritance. However, what they'll discover at Hill House, will change their lives forever.Written by Nelson Gidding, "The Haunting" is an adaptation of Shirley Jackson's 1959 novel, "The Haunting of Hill House", probably the most famous ghost story published in modern times. Despite some changes to the characters, the movie is relatively faithful to its source, although Gidding removes the slight comic relief the novel has and completely focuses on the psychological horror of the story. This is best exemplified in the way the script deals with Eleanor, who while arguably the "main character" of the story, is also the most psychologically vulnerable, and this is reflected in the way Hill House reacts to her. The script is remarkably effective in the way it develops its assortment of characters and their relationships, as well as in the subtle ambiguity in which the supernatural events of the haunting take place. This subtle ambiguity that impregnates the script is superbly made to come alive by director Robert Wise, who in a masterful exercise of the power of suggestion, manages to create an ominous and very powerful atmosphere of dread using only the effects of light and sound. With an excellent camera-work and the wonderful black-and-white cinematography by Davis Boulton, Wise literally transforms Hill House into a full fledged character on its own. Having started his directing career at RKO Studios under the guidance of legendary producer Val Lewton, Wise knew exactly how to make atmospheric horror with minimal resources, and in "The Haunting", he returns to that subtle, minimalist style to exploit the psychological drama of the story. However, "The Haunting" is not only a very good looking film, as Wise's skills at directing actors are also fundamental part of the success of the movie.As expected, the cast performances are of enormous importance as well, as while the film is heavy on the visual style to create atmosphere, most of the film's strength is in the development of the characters. Leading the cast is Julie Harris as Eleanor Lance, and she delivers an amazing performance (probably her best) as the shy and troubled woman. Many have criticized her performance as excessively whining, or irritating, but that criticism fails to see that it was natural for her character to come up that way. It is that way because she is meant to contrast with the uninhibited Theo, played superbly by the beautiful Claire Bloom, who adds a strong sexuality to her character. Richard Johnson plays Dr. Markway, and he is very effective in his role, as he adds a lot of charm to his character. Finally, Russ Tamblyn is pitch perfect as the skeptical rich kid Luke.While "The Haunting" is definitely among the best horror movies ever made, it is relatively easy to see why modern audiences may face a challenge to like it. The main problem is definitely the slow pacing the movie has to build up the story, as while it's essential for the development of the events surrounding its grand finale, those used to the fast paced action of modern horror movies will definitely be disappointed. However, this is not to say that the movie has lost its edge, on the contrary, the failed 1999 remake, which essentially worked the opposite way than this movie (by having a fast pace and an extensive use of special effects), ultimately proved that such changes weren't necessarily for the best. Still, modern viewers should approach this film in the right mood to fully appreciate the beauty of its craftsmanship.Considered among the best horror movies ever made, Robert Wise's "The Haunting" is without a doubt a classic of the genre that every horror fan should give a try. Unsettling and atmospheric, "The Haunting" took the ghost story on film and elevated it to an art-form, becoming the epitome of the genre. 18 years after making "The Body Snatcher", Wise made another masterpiece of horror in the shape of "The Haunting", and ghost stories never were the same after it. 10/10</fullReview>

From the house which is stunningly dark, mysterious and creepy, to the story line of the visitors which come to investigate the paranormal for a weekend. This movie I promise you will not only keep you on the edge of your seat, but will also have you asking for more. Superbly done great film for Halloween viewing.

		<fullReview>The Haunting is a very good psychological paranormal drama from 1963 and is very ahead of its time,when most horrors of the time relied on daft special effects which don't hold up well today,The Haunting relies on atmosphere .Robert Wise decided to shoot the film in black and white to give added atmosphere,and it works,i don't think colour would have worked as well.I was watching The Haunting the other night and felt really cold as if the atmosphere came into my living room {spooky}ive never felt that before,i wondered if anyone else has felt this way.What also makes this film powerful is that the mansion house you see is real and has a graveyard nearby,the mansion stands in Stratford upon Avon just outside of London so everything you see in this film is real which i think makes it more authentic,i would imagine the house did feel cold and damp inside. The Haunting is a very well written intelligent thriller its slow paced most of the time and not a film you can afford to miss any of as you may find it hard to get back into and follow the story,so you need to watch it from the beginning all the way through to get the best out of it.There is no blood guts or gore no real violence just suspense and a few jumpy moments. The acting between the four actors is excellent and convincing. On the DVD i have there is added commentary from the four actors and the director and screen writer,talking about their experiences while filming The Haunting which is at times very interesting. I give this film a 10 because as a paranormal drama i don't think they get much better than this,and this one in particular was the first of its kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting is a 1963 horror film directed by Robert Wise and adapted by Nelson Gidding from the novel The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. It stars Julie Harris as Eleanor, Richard Johnson as Dr. Markway, Russ Tamblyn as Luke, Claire Bloom as Theo, Valentine Dyall and Rosalie Crutchley as Mr and Mrs Dudley, and Lois Maxwell as Mrs Markway. The film centers around the conflict between a team of paranormal investigators and the house they spend the night in. Generally considered to be the finest "ghost movie" in filmdom, a picture relying on light and shadow and suggestion instead of gore and overt physicality, this first, 1963 filming of The Haunting remains as one of the most respected and influential entries in the annals of macabre cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things That Go Bump in the Night...and the House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting is an interesting, unique film that banks most of its reputation on what you do not see rather than what you do indeed see. It is, in many ways, the ultimate old, dark house picture as a group of people led by a parapsychologist make camp in this house with a long history and reputation of grisly deaths and haunted occurrences. All the stops are pulled out here: bending walls and doorways, strange, weird noises from everywhere and yet nowhere, a pair of caretakers that don't stay at night, flashback sequences detailing the long line of horrors attributed to the house, chaotic, harmful energies, and so on. Director Robert Wise does a more than workmanlike job with the material and rightly makes the house the star of the film. It is grand in scope both outside and within. Wise ably gives some depth of characterization to this normally inanimate object. The living components of the film are all quality actors with Julie Harris standing out as one of the weaker links trying to make sense of a tragic personal history and what she sees/experience upon entering the house. Richard Johnson as Dr, Markway does a credible job as the professor putting the whole thing together, and lovely Claire Bloom makes good as a psychic with an alternative yet subtly explored lifestyle. Some may not like The Haunting terribly too much, because there is very little action rather a plethora of suggestion. The ending, though strangely poetic, suits the film very much I think.</fullReview>

The use of the camera angles and shadow in this black and white classic should be required viewing for anyone attempting to make a "ghost story" movie. The movie's chilling effect is derived at least as much from what is implied as from what occurs on screen.Unlike anything that is currently being made, subtlety and understatement are used make you reassess your own surroundings. I have never been able to forget the scene with Claire Bloom and Julie Harris, as Harris views the shadows on the bedroom wall.

		<fullReview>i saw this film once, when i was 10, and 42 years later, i still haven't gotten over it. to this day, i can't go to sleep with my hand outside the bed covers....... in case someone (or something) squeezes it during the night. i think that why it scared me so much is because the ghosts or spirits in the haunted house, symbolize our unconscious repressed split-off aspects, which appear to our conscious mind as interfering evil harmful malicious energies - when in fact, all they are doing is trying to gain acceptance by our conscious mind and become re-integrated into our conscious life and personality. all my life after seeing this movie, i have had dreams from time to time about going inside haunted houses with various unseen hostile denizens. i had a recurring one for years, about an invisible but palpable hostile female ghost, that wanted to kill me and drink my blood, in a run-down mansion. i thought it was an image of my mother's hostility toward me. but one day, it dawned on me that it was a representation of MY hostility towards my mother! until then, this had been an inadmissible thought! i went about for a day telling my friends, Sometimes i feel i hate my mother and i wish she was dead, but i can say that and the sky does not fall, i don't get struck by lightning! so then that energy re-integrated into my personality and conscious life, and took up its rightful place, which is that i feel that way about 1% of the time, and the rest of the time, i love my mother or at least like her, as a fellow adult, and am glad she is still in this life. i never had that nightmare again. but when i saw this film aged 10, such feelings and thoughts were "not safe to have", so ghosts became my chief fear and nightmare. i don't really think it's suitable for kids - exactly BECAUSE the scary things are never seen, and hence can take on the charge of the child's unconscious fears, which are actually being actively repressed and taking energy from the maturing personality, by compartmentalizing it and creating walls within it. those walls take up some of our mental energy and hinder us from becoming whole, self-accepting and other-people-accepting, understanding, loving and forgiving. if you are able to integrate your own bad side, it turns out to be weaker than your good side anyway, and not a huge problem. it's just a lost lonely split-off energy in your mind, that wants to be let in and come home. for adults, this is a frightening but very good film, and i would like to see it again.</fullReview>

The central chasracter is Elanor, who seems to have some affinity toward the house.However, the film concentrates on Eleanor to the point that when she disappears, the remaining folk stop looking for someone else who also had gone missing and drop everything to go after Eleanor. They get so obsessed in that the discovery of the other lady, who doesn't really explain what happened to her, comes as a surprise.The film is well done, but the characters all lack a shred of practicality.

Never saw a ghost or monster but it was that unseen "something's out there" that got to me. The scene where the door "breathes" and the final scenes where poor Eleanor sees the good doctor's wife thru the trap door in the ceiling. Took 10 years off my life. I have a very good friend named Jim Maloney. He was actually my high school English teacher. He told me he saw this movie and it "scared the bejesus" out of him. "I should know better" he said. But it was that kind of film. Eerie, shadowy, expressionistic. Reminded me of the old German cinema in many ways, ie: Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu.

		<fullReview>The only way you can`t find this a great movie is if you have a problem with black and white, expect too much (the chills are subtle), or need a steady dose of computer-generated effects to keep you excited. Robert Wise perfects what he learned from Val Lewton: the unseen is far more frightening than seen. The wall image/sound of crying child gives me goose bumps every time where a hundred other horror films don`t. I like the cast OK in this one. I`ve read complaints of Claire Bloom`s character, but she is at least believable. I`ve come to appreciate Russ Tamblyn`s glib, disbelieving character which sort of gives the film a center of balance among the other eccentric characters. My favorite supernatural movie. Along with West Side Story and The Set-Up (recommended) definately in my top 20. Looking at Robert Wise`s IMDB list makes me want to check out Blood On The Moon. I saw parts of Sand Pebbles and I Want To Live when I was a kid. This guy has to be one of the best. I could rave on about this movie but with the many good reviews already there don`t feel the need to as apparently I don`t walk the halls of Hill House alone. ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of the supernatural.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Haunting" is one of the finest films made,and certainly the best in the "haunted house" field.To my mind this really is a unique movie,there has been nothing like it,before or since.Why do I find "The Haunting" so frightening and disturbing? For all the reasons others have mentioned(so I won't cover ground already heavily trodden),this is a superbly made film.I think what Wise succeeds in portraying something chillingly strange and threatening which is deeply connected with primary emotional needs-thus lonely Eleanor is drawn to the haven Hill House offers.Is the haunting a manifestation of Eleanor's mind?In a way it is,and at the same time its something which has its own "reality"-a supernatural entity,seemingly created from the an unholy melding of "sick" "deranged" architecture,and the tragic emotional legacy of those who have inhabited Hill House. This is also a real rarity in being a film that actually improves on a good novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the haunting movie by which all others are measured, and if you watch it late at night with the lights out you will see what I mean....children who grew up on special effects will not appreciate how this black-and-white film uses lighting, music, and camera angles (and camera motion) to create possibly the best "haunted house" movie ever fimed.....roughly, it's about a ghost researcher renting a known "evil" house and gathering a small group of people known to have some psychic abilities or involvement in their pasts, and seeing what happens while they stay in the house...I won't go into details because it really is such a good movie, I don't want to spoil any surprises(even now, some 20 years after first seeing it, it still "works", so to speak)....one teaser: watch the statues.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BEST HAUNTED HOUSE MOVIE EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best HAUNTED HOUSE movie of all time. The Robert Wise production had all the elements necessary (a great novel by Shirley Jackson, great screen play and the excellent actress Julie Harris). This film is truly frightening without resorting to the haunted house carnival ride of its remake. I judge all truely frightening films by this classic and few if any measure up. The HOUSE was without doubt the star with its aged looks and dark soul. It could have been shot in nothing but black &amp; white. I saw the so-called remake, should I say more!!! As far as "The Haunting"(1963) goes, I thank The late Shirley Jackson for her creation and Robert Wise for its screen realization.</fullReview>

It was a reading, and the play had closed and I was tired from driving, so I thought I would just go home.This major old theater, now long gone was showing "The Haunting as a matinee. Well I went in to see it because there was JULIE HARRIS! I would never have suspected then that we would end up years later in Los Angeles in Melvin Bernhart's direction of "Ms. Rearden Drink's a little."There was one other person in the enormous theater,. He was about five rows ahead of me, and by the end of the film we were friends for life. We also were truly frightened and loved it. This is the ultimate Halloween film.20 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of understatement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hill House has stood for ninety years and might stand ninety more. Silence laid steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and, whatever walked there, walked alone....Between those words from the opening voice over to the chilling recapitulation 110 minutes later lies the best ghost story ever filmed. The film, based on the novel by Shirley Jackson, is a masterpiece of understatement which eschews blood and gore for atmosphere, character and a palatable sense of dread.University professor, Dr. John Markway, played by Richard Johnson, goes to Hill House, an eerie New England mansion with a dark history, to prove the existence of the supernatural. He stacks the deck by bringing two women, Eleanor Lance, Julie Harris, and Theodora, Claire Bloom, both of whom have had proven supernatural experiences, to act as a catalyst. They are accompanied by Luke Sanderson, Russ Tamblyn, the skeptical nephew of the owner, who will one day own Hill House. In the end, the catalysts work too well and Markway's experiment ends in tragedy.Like all the best horror films, "The Haunting" delves deeper than the monsters. While the men provide overview and analysis, the film is essentially about the two women, both of whom are misfits in the society of their day. While outerly-confident and worldly, Theodora's subtle lesbianism places her outside of society's norms. Eleanor, who spent almost her life caring for an invalid mother, finds herself in a hopeless position. With no husband and no meaningful job skills, she finds herself reduced to sleeping on the sofa in her younger sister's living room. She needs an escape."The Haunting" is ultimately the story of Eleanor's slow disintegration and eventual escape. Her sister and brother-in-law treat her like a child, and, in many ways, Eleanor is a child; emotionally-arrested at age she started caring for her mother. Like a child she wears her feelings on her sleeve, flying from one emotional extreme to another. One moment, Theodora is the girlhood friend she never had, the next moment, she lashes out at her hateful bitterness. She mistakes Markway's kindness for romantic interest, and when Markway's wife arrives, Eleanor strikes back cruelly by sending her to the cold, dark heart of the house with ultimately tragic results.Eleanor, who desperately seeks love and acceptance, quickly becomes the focus of the attention of the entity lurking in the house. She responds in equal parts terror and desire. She knows the force in the house is evil, but she so needs to be needed, that she can't leave at any cost. This battle drives her to the brink of madness. All she needs is someone, or something, to give her a little push over the edge.But what is that thing? Hard to say. The film makers never show it, almost leaving open the interpretation that the haunting isn't real -- or at least only a projection of Eleanor's troubled mind. All we see are doors opening, slamming and bending, but what really chills the inhabitants of Hill House are the sounds: the banging, the footsteps, and the low voices.This approach could have backfired in the hands of less skilled film makers, but Robert Wise and his first-rate team knew their business. The writing, cinematography, production design and editing are flawless. The score, although somewhat dated and heavy-handed in places, is usually very effective as well. Wise gave this story, which normally would have been considered B- movie material, the same consideration and dignity he gave to his more prestigious projects like "West Side Story" and "The Sound of Music." Bravo."The Haunting" was ripped-off in 1973 by the Richard Matheson-penned opus "The Legend of Hell House." That film, with an almost identical plot, gives the audience all the thrills one normally expects in a haunted house film. It is an entertaining horror film, although not quite in the same league as this film. "The Haunting" was officially remade in 1999 with Jan De Bont at the helm. That monstrosity should be avoided at all costs. Stick with the original. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my all-time favorite ghost stories, The Haunting is a masterpiece of subtlety. Never once do you see a death-shroud draped ghost or a single drop of blood. This film frightens you with what you cannot see and is all the more powerful for this fact.Shy and repressed Eleanor Lance has spent all of her adult life caring for her invalid mother. Now the demanding old bint is dead and she has received an invitation to join an investigative party at Hill House, a dilapidated 90 year old mansion that may or may not be haunted. She's not sure why she's been invited and she doesn't care. In a rare act of rebellion, she makes off with her bitchy sisters car (which is half hers) and goes speeding off to Hill House, where she is expected. This, and not the haunted house itself, is the main plot. Eleanor is a fragile, haunted person, just as Hill House is a haunted place. She is so desperate to belong to someone or something, anyone or anything, that she is swallowed whole by the house before she realizes that this may not necessarily be a good thing. The other three characters - outspoken Theo, brash Luke and sensible Dr. Markaway - are mere game pieces as far as the House is concerned. Eleanor is it's main focus, and as she falls apart, so the haunting of Hill House becomes more volatile and more intense. But are there really ghosts in Hill House? Or is it all Eleanor's doing? Poor, unbalanced Eleanor, who once brought rains of stones from the sky as a child?Based on the novel "The Haunting of Hill House" by Shirley Jackson, this film version remains mostly faithful to that novel and captures all of the subtlety and menace that Jackson intended. This is an exhilarating, devastating story of a broken person and the ruined house that finds her. The ending in particular is stunning and left me open-mouthed in shock and sorrow the first time I ever saw it.Whatever you do, avoid the remake. The original is the masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young Eleanor Vance, troubled by her family members after the death of her invalid mother, wants to escape from her sad life. She takes part in an unusual experiment of a certain Dr. Markway, who wants to find evidence about the existence of ghosts. In order to achieve this, four people including Eleanor and the Doctor himself spend the nights in the dark Hill House that is widely believed to be haunted. It doesn't take long time for them to wish they never came to this place...This is one of the best "ghost" films ever, hair-rising and spooky as they only were made in the sixties. Once again, the lack of blood and special effects prove to be all the more effective when it comes to creating stunning and eerie atmosphere. After viewing this, i was - against knowing better - shocked at how weak and often downright stupid modern horror movies with all their bombastic CGI special effects and gore really are when compared to a real horror classic like this. This includes the 1999 remake of "The Haunting" which lands in every possible trap despite having some good scenes as well. As for the original, Robert Wise once more proved to be one of the best genre directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>POLTERGEIST IN BLACK AND WHITE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The kind of horrorfilm that is made in times in where there was no talk of special effects (the remake from 1999 is completely the opposite, but that's a different story). The story is all about a house (even if it's more a castle but good...) that is build with the meaning to kill its inhabitants, or at least that's what the legend says. Doctor John Markway, an anthropologist, is so curious about it that he wants to find out that it are just logical natural events or that there are indeed poltergeists at there. He invites two women, Theodora (a brilliant role from Claire Bloom) and Eleanor (Julie Harris, who plays the role of a psychotic girl who thinks she killed her mother by not carrying enough for her when she was terminally ill). Against his will he also has the company of Luke (Russ Tamblyn) whose sole purpose is to sell the house as quick as possible so he can have some extra dollars. Does it need to be said that soon the group will have to face the existence of the non-explainable? Poltergeists and all signs of paranormal existence are there (especially with Eleanor) and what started as a curiosity ends in horror. The whole film is very sober, not once you see a monster or ghost as all horrorcomponents are created with atmospheric views (done in brilliant cinematographic scenes), and that's what makes the film both a bit dated (you have seen it a bit too much, just thin k of Polanski's "Repulsion" and timeless at the same time. I know it sounds a bit like I cant make up my mind and that's exactly my problem....somewhere I would like to give it the title of timeless classic masterpiece, but I just keep it to good picture that you must have seen nontheless.... Star of the movie without any doubt is Claire Bloom and yeah, two years later Robert Wise made himself immortal with directing The Sound Of Music (therefore he did West Side Story) and for the Trekkies he is the man who made the first film from Star Trek.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps today's film makers think that audiences are too sophisticated to appreciate classic black-and-white horror films, and have replaced real psychological terror with gore and special effects. Case in point: the creaking staircase. I was far more mesmerized with the way the screws in the staircase were unscrewed in the 1963 version, with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom, than I was with the special effects in the 1999 version. Furthermore, the Lesbianism which was hinted at in the original version was exploited in the remake in an effort to satisfy the collegiate males whom the filmmakers hoped to lure in the 1999 re-release. Justice will soon be served: The original version will be available on DVD August 5, with commentary by Ms. Harris and Ms. Bloom. After that time, fans of real psychological terror will no longer be forced to be satisfied with viewing a much-underrated classic on mere VHS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richly atmospheric haunted house thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is sad that the younger generation is jaded by the current wave of special effects films. Movie fans who laugh at or are bored by great thrillers of the past such as The Haunting and Psycho are truly to be pitied. Before special effects ran wild, movie goers were required to do some thinking and use their imagination. Further, classic movies such as the above two films and the original In Cold Blood are most atmospheric and effective when presented in black and white. Unfortunately, a black and white thriller today without many special effects would be a kiss of death at the box office, which is a shame. The 1999 version of The Haunting is OK but predictable, with the obligatory orgy of special effects. The Liam Neeson version does explain the ending better, but I would rather be left with some mystery.The Haunting presents a great character study of the Julie Harris character. The scenes when the two female characters are alone are not to be forgotten! Further, the shots which show the house are frightening themselves and very effective. This is only to be watched on a dark and stormy night! Fortunately, this classic is coming out on DVD on 8/5/03 which is great news for classic movie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was in sixth-or-seventh grade, on a Halloween that fell on a weekend. My mother allowed myself and my two younger brothers to stay up and watch it with her. *I think it was delayed to the ten-to-midnight slot for parental discretion.* MAN! WERE WE SCARED! I'm surprised none of us pee'd in our pants!! Especially, towards the end. *Possible spoiler* Russ Tamblyn looks at the breathing door, then looks at the parapsychologist: "Hey, Doc. I'll sell you the house...CHEAP!" That's why I regard the Liam Neeson version as disappointing. I wouldn't have minded the CGI so much, if only they hadn't altered the background story on the house! And, provided a little more comic relief. If none of you reading this believes that sometimes, what you _don't_ see is scarier than what you do see, just look at the greater commercial success of FINAL DESTINATION I as compared to the Liam Neeson remake. *Not to mention, the main female character in the former is named for the Hollywood director who first coined that little piece of horror-flick philosophy.* In summary, then, I give this original version four stars, as opposed to two-and-one-eighth for the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is an enjoyable romp, but it has to be admitted that it doesn't really 'deliver'. 'Psycho', made three years before 'The Haunting', is a much more terrifying film, and even today it packs a lot of punch, while 'The Haunting' has started to look comfortably corny.'The Haunting' displays many of the genre elements of the classic ghost story. For example, the house is large, opulent, and fascinating. Nobody has ever set a good ghost story in a trailer home. And the food is excellent - the best ghost stories invariably feature first class cuisine.Even though 'The Haunting' does not really frighten you, it has many magnificent images, more so than the very similar 'The Legend of Hell House' (Richard Matheson seems to have ripped off the Shirley Jackson novel when he wrote this), and is certainly a film that I can watch over and over again. Here are a few of my favourites:1) The nocturnal long shots of the house itself. I wish I had a print of this shot; the house is superbly spooky in the moonlight. Can anyone tell me where it is? (I know it's in England)2) A repeated image of a piece of the pattern of some wallpaper, the shadowing of which resembles a twisted face with its mouth open, screaming, like something from the work of Edvard Munch. I am surprised that no writings about the film mention this - the image recurs again and again.3) The breath-condensing 'cold spot' outside the nursery, with the visible breath of the investigators standing out against the black corridor.4) The extraordinarily ugly and unsettling 'St Francis Healing the Lepers' statue.5) Hugh Crain's daughter living her whole life in the Hill House nursery, and the shots of her ageing face, from girlhood to bitter old maid.The film is vastly superior to the remake, and does have a few scary moments, such as the violently banging, inbending door, especially when the knob begins to turn (what would they see if they opened it?) There is a brief shock towards the end that makes you jump as well.A classic of its kind, very much a black and white film (whoever mooted colourising 'The Haunting' should be hanged from the iron staircase in the library - the idea was stopped, thank God). But not the most terrifying film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"An Evil Old House, the kind some people call haunted, is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored. Hill House had stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more. Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House and whatever walked there, walked alone." Here begins the ride into Robert Wise's supernatural realm of The Haunting.We begin with a brief history into what has happened at Hill House which is scary enough as told brilliantly by anthropologist Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson). A man called Hugh Crane built Hill House in New England for his wife and daughter Abigail. However, the house has gained a reputation as being 'born bad'. After the mysterious deaths of both Crane's first and second wife and later losing his own life in a drowning accident, Hill House passed on to his daughter Abigail. She stayed there for the rest of her life until she grew old staying in the nursery she grew up in. She also took on a companion but Abigail died while calling for help. The companion inherited the house but committed suicide after whatever was in the house drove her slowly mad. Hill House was then passed on to a relative, Mrs. Sannerson, who Markway persuaded to let him lease out the house so he could find out if the house is really haunted. He is also joined by a select few people to help him in his experiment. There's Eleanor (Julie Harris), Theodora (Claire Bloom) and Luke (Russ Tamblyn), a nephew of Mrs. Sannerson who also happens to be sceptical of the supernatural. What follows for the four inhabitants of Hill House is an experience that no-one will forget for a long, long time.As a horror movie, The Haunting works where so many have failed and thats by not showing anything and letting the imagination of the viewer run rampant. It's so easy these days to throw in a few CGI ghosts for the film for it to fall flat on it's face (Jan deBont's remake is a prime example). Instead, Wise opts to use vivid camerawork, lighting and getting the best performances from his actors possible to get the best effect.Performance wise, the acting is top notch from all concerned. Most notably is Claire Bloom as Theodora who has the ability of ESP, Extra Sensory Perception. What is also notable about her character is the fact she is a lesbian which is not actually stated in the film but can be easily seen through her obvious attention towards Eleanor.For some people, The Haunting may be a little bit slow as it is dialogue heavy and there may not be enough of the supernatural element to keep some viewers' attention. Having said that, it adds to the film as it keeps the hardened horror fan wanting to wait for the next paranormal experience as they are well worth the wait when they arrive.The Haunting is a definite two thumbs up and it's only a shame that the film has not been given DVD release as it should be in any self respecting horror movie fan's collection.</fullReview>

Wise, who had worked alongside giants like Orson Welles and Val Lewton, brought to the film the look and feel of a true epic: there are echoes of CITIZEN KANE throughout, and the psychological approach to much of the horror would've made Lewton himself proud; watch the two films back to back and you'll see whereof I speak.

		<fullReview>Anyone who has seen the recent Jan de Bonte remake of this classic has, hopefully, gained an all new appreciation for this wonderful, chilling movie. While the Liam Neeson-Catherine Zeta Jones spectacle was only horrifying in the sense of how much money it must have cost to make and thus waste, the original thriller is captivating, spooky and a glowing example of how all a movie really needs in the end is an excellent script, excellent performances, and an attentive cinematic eye on the part of the camera. While de Bonte's glitzy and extremely not scary movie tried to win its audience over with a billion special affects that all ended up looking like a bus plowing through a house, this creepy classic capitalizes off the power of suggestion, using shadows and sound effects, never resorting to gore or cheap shots, like having someone's head bit off, or an incredibely fake looking ghost chasing someone. Here's something else exciting too: the original makes sense, as opposed to the new one, where you find yourself asking questions like, if I was an evil child murderer whose spirit was trapped in the house, why would I have a gateway to purgatory built where I could easily be tricked into getting sucked into it shortly after some bad actress gives me a worthless and trite speach on family values? Good script, good camera work, awesome sound affects and performances (especially from Claire Bloom and Russ Tamblyn)... if you're looking for a good horror movie, check this one out (and read the book too- I promise you'll be up the rest of the night, wondering why you never noticed how clanky the kitchen pipes are).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beautiful, but rather dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1963 ghost-movie is pretty overrated. It is traditional and elegant, and plays rather on psychological fear, compared to most of todays movies (and the remake). The script has the usual simple and classical situation: four people (with different approach to the phenomenon - curiosity, fear, scepticism), are gathered in an enormous, sinister-looking mansion - a visually stunning Victorian gothic castle. The build-up is slow and suggestive, there are few violent effects or graphic shocks. Mysterious things happens, they talk and discuss, they become influenced by the supernatural powers - the usual stuff. The arrival is promising, but Robert Wise's direction is not clever enough to make us scared in the crucial scenes. The film is a warm-up with no main course or dessert. It is a psychological film, that means that we are never actually seeing the ghosts, and Wise should have played with more ideas and challenged our imagination. THE HAUNTING has a visual beauty, though - Wise shows talent for dark, atmospheric photography, the house is full of crooked decorations and long, sinister shadows. But there is too much talk, discussion, and inner thoughts expressed on voice-over - the exaggerated literacy eventually becomes annoying. The movie also relies too much on just sound-effects, there are a couple of nights with knocking and whispering on the bedroom-door, and that's it. The characters almost die of fear, while the audience remains pretty unaffected - you feel empty and disconnected. The film lacks a true nerve - in fact, it lacks terror. Stephen King has described THE HAUNTING as a radio-movie, and that is a pretty apt remark. The cast is great, though, and especially Julie Harris, who gives a vibrating, unstable performance as the jumpy Eleanor. Claire Bloom is equally impressive as the creepy-looking, probably-lesbian roommate. The men's roles seem to be less worked out. Also with Lois "Moneypenny" Maxwell.</fullReview>

There is no real plot, no real characters. This movie is not a horror movie at all, but a love story between a neurotic girl and an old house. Yet I find myself liking it despite, and even because of its shortcomings. I have a soft spot for houses myself. As to ghosts: we have nothing to fear from them. Did you ever hear of anyone being harmed by them? Significantly, haunted houses are invariably huge. There's no such thing as a haunted mobile home. A movie that did scare me as an adult: "Carnival of Souls".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, if you don't like this movie then you can't appreciate a good horror film. This IS the best haunted house film ever made and it will probably continue to be. It was way ahead of its time when it was made, and no haunted house movie can compare to this. You have to wonder if it's really a ghost or all in their minds. I took a look at the ratings teens gave this movie and I was shocked. This movie is a 10 it's the best and if you haven't seen it, you haven't seen haunted house film history yet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More on the Haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have already written my thoughts on the Haunting (1963!--one of my favorite movies) below, but having read many more reviews from others, I have a litte more to add.It seems that the main problem for those who were disappointed in the movie is that it is "not that scary", and "slow". I think this may be due to somewhat inaccurate expectations. While I am not going to dispute anyone's personal feelings of the movie being "terrifying", I don't think that is what the movie is totally about. You must keep in mind that Robert Wise's film is a very accurate realization of the Shirley Jackson novella. (My only disappointment is that it leaves out some material that could have been effectively incorporated.) So the criticisms against the movie might as well be leveled against the book.Jackson's novel is primarily a psychological tale of a sad neurotic woman, Eleanor, who is taken advantage of by the house. The book is full of her thoughts, and is rich in detail. Along the way we are subjected to some very spooky and weird goings on. The book is all about subtlety and psychology. While there are scenes I definitely would not want to watch alone in a dark room, I agree, it is far from the most terrifying movie I've even seen. Yet I rate this movie about a 9, at least. It is a film, which like the book, casts a mood and spell over you. Not everyone is going to take to this kind of approach.I think that those who have not seen The Haunting, should go into it with these understandings in mind, and you will be less likely to be disappointed. The thing I love most is the brilliant camera work, which so effectively reveals the essence of the house. So, the movie IS as ruminative as the book, Eleanor IS annoying, Theo IS icy, and the book doesn't reveal the motivation of Hill House any more than the movie does. (a possible flaw). The two actresses were truly born to play these roles. Also, I do not think at all that Eleanor is imagining everything. It is clear that the House is evil, and too, the manifestations are experienced by everyone, not just Eleanor.I hope this is of some use to new viewers of the film.If you are wondering about the new "version", it has very little to do with the original story, and is terrible in its own right.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmmm, Somewhat Over-repped?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i guess I wasn't that impressed with it. It would be nice to say that the slow build-up is a directorial conceit, but it looks like Wise does a lot of his movies (Star Trek I, Andromeda Strain) that way. Sometimes this works (Andromeda), sometimes it doesn't (ST I), and sometimes the result is somewhere in-between. The main problem I have with the movie is motivation: even Eleanor seems to be more nuts than anything else. What motivates the house? What drives it? Is it just evil, or selfish (wanting Eleanor to stay with it?), or what?As such, the House lacks the personality of, say, The Shining's hotel, and giving it such could have boosted the movie a bit. Richard Johnson doesn't do much for me as the narrator (he kinda reminds me of Vincent Price here), and there's too much focus on Eleanor, which never really becomes a sympathetic character.On the other hand, yes, Haunting is a terrifying movie. The "horror" moments are well done. You can see where Sam Raimi got some of his inspiration for the Evil Dead movies. But ultimately, I found that the movie just dragged a bit too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is full of a brooding tense atmosphere that lasts for the entirety of the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A scientist doing research on the paranormal invites two women to a haunted mansion. One of the participants soon starts losing her mind. Dr. Markway, doing research to prove the existence of ghosts, investigates Hill House, a large, eerie mansion with a lurid history of violent death and insanity. With him are the skeptical young Luke, who stands to inherit the house, the mysterious and clairvoyant Theodora and the insecure Eleanor, whose psychic abilities make her feel somehow attuned to whatever spirits inhabit the old mansion. As time goes by it becomes obvious that they have gotten more than they bargained for as the ghostly presence in the house manifests itself in horrific and deadly ways. Roger Ebert wrote "The special effects are original and effective, evoking a haunted house in unexpected ways. A floor-level gliding camera is insinuating. Scenes set in a huge old conservatory are creepy in the way they use dead vegetation, and there's a nice scene on a shaky spiral staircase. To enter these rooms, to move among them, to feel their weight and personality, is an experience. I am reminded of the abandoned subway station in "The Mimic" (1997), another space with a personality of its own. The movie often edges so close to being truly scary that you wonder why they didn't try just a little harder to write more dimensional characters and add the edge of almost plausible realism that distinguished Shirley Jackson's original novel. The movie does not, alas, succeed as a horror film. But it succeeds as a film worth watching anyway, and that is no small achievement." The Haunting in my opinion is one of the best atmospheric horror movies in cinematic history. It is full of a brooding tense atmosphere that lasts for the entirety of the movie. I personally love this type of movies because the leave you on the edge of your seat. This film is a masterpiece of atmosphere and tension and still has the power to disturb today as it ever had back when it was first released. I would highly recommend it to fans of atmospheric tense horror movies. In my opinion it is one of a few horror movies that genuinely scares me and that is truly a sign of a good horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I happened to see this film mentioned in a review of another movie as one that was really scary, as opposed to the other movie which the reviewer didn't find scary at all, and I gave it a try on that basis as well as high ratings on the streaming site. The person wrote to make sure to watch the original from 1963, not the remake, so I know I saw the right one. But I really, really don't see what's so scary about it.I don't have any prejudice towards or problem with black and white movies; I try to appreciate each film I see on its own merits no matter when it was made and not compare apples to oranges, and I don't need blood and gore to be scared. But I do need something. This movie just didn't seem to have anything of that nature. A couple of late-night thumps and a few words scrawled on a wall don't do the trick. I thought the scariest thing in the film was Russ Tamblyn; I've always found him exceedingly creepy.If you're looking for something scary from the 1960's, I recommend "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?". A friend of mine would recommend "The Shuttered Room", and we've had many a debate about which one of those is the scariest. "The Haunting" isn't even on the board.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most unsettling films of its time that has managed to hold up astonishingly well after all these years &amp; still retains enough strength to surprise the newcomers, The Haunting is an incredibly tense, highly effective &amp; intensely moody psychological horror that makes excellent use of its eerie atmosphere to instantly grab the viewer's attention &amp; keeps them guessing from start to finish.The Haunting tells the story of a small team of paranormal investigators who, in order to prove the existence of ghosts, decide to carry out their next research at Hill House; a notorious mansion having a lurid history of violent deaths &amp; insanity. Although initially elated to capture many supernatural phenomenas around the house, trouble begins when one of the participants starts losing her mind.Superbly directed, wonderfully adapted &amp; splendidly performed, the best thing about The Haunting is the dreaded sense of impending doom &amp; unrelenting terror which encapsulates the entire picture from the moment our characters step into that cursed mansion. And it makes excellent use of its claustrophobic atmosphere to escalate the tension &amp; delivers the chills in a genuinely effective manner.Exquisitely captured in crisp of black-n-white, the camera movements are dynamic, the interior n exterior of the house is beautifully photographed &amp; the zooms plus close-ups only end up adding more nervousness to the whole premise. And thanks to its clever use of sound effects, the cinematic experience gets all the more amplified. Performances by its cast is no slouch &amp; Julie Harris does a very impressive job in her given role.On an overall scale, The Haunting balances the elements of supernatural &amp; psychological horror with remarkable finesse and is one of the best offerings of its genre that simply refuses to age. Making ingenious use of its sinister plot, eerie mood, mysterious characters, smart photography, patient editing &amp; terrific sound, The Haunting is one fright classic no horror fan should miss out. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest haunted house films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's now 50 years later, and this superb adaptation of the Shirley Jackson novel still has the power to chill, largely because it depends on the power of suggestion. It fires our imagination, and keeps us on our toes. And even in the lighter moments when the intent is not to horrify, we keep watching because we can get invested in the characters. The dialogue is intelligent and the house itself is remarkably effective. Filmed in England by the versatile Robert Wise (because the MGM studios in London were willing to provide a slightly larger budget), it's got the kind of atmosphere you can only get in these classic black &amp; white thrillers.Charismatic Richard Johnson plays Dr. John Markway, an anthropologist eager to obtain some sort of verification that the supernatural exists. He believes that the ancient Hill House, constructed in the previous century, is likely to provide him with evidence, given its sad and sordid history. Death has always occurred in or near the house. He gathers two people, lonely and pathetic Eleanor (Julie Harris) and sassy Theo (Claire Bloom), to the house, convinced that Eleanor's history and Theo's abilities make them receptive to supernatural phenomena. Also tagging along is Luke (Russ Tamblyn), a young skeptic motivated by profit and hoping to inherit the place.Before long, the group does have strange experiences. There are loud banging noises in the night. Eerie whispering voices. A door that bulges inward. And *something* or *someone* holds the terrified Eleanor's hand during the night. And that's the beauty of something like this, although of course some horror fans might not see it that way. We don't have to see any actual ghosts to get the chills. Wise manipulates us with skill, and it's the little things that make us squirm in our seats, like doorknobs turning. Excellent cinematography by Davis Boulton and spooky music by Humphrey Searle also help matters a lot.Harris delivers a true tour-de-force performance as the unstable Eleanor. We hear a lot of her inner monologues and realize just how tormented she is, and how desperate she is to escape from the reality of her life outside this house. Bloom is a delight as she eggs on Eleanor and ever so subtly comes on to her. Johnson is fun to watch; his fascination with his subject matter and his experiment is infectious. Tamblyn isn't as good as the others, but he does provide a more "practical" attitude to contrast the open-minded Johnson. Some solid character players - Fay Compton, Rosalie Crutchley, Lois "Miss Moneypenny" Maxwell, and Valentine Dyall - round out this fine cast.Granted, something like this wouldn't be for all tastes but for some it's quite simply as good as it gets. It does stick with you after it's over.Followed by a crummy remake in 1999.Nine out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Haunted House Flick That Will Leave You Thinking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting is another of those ghost tales that keeps you on the fence concerning whether there's an actual haunting, or whether it's just one of the character's psychological experiences- in this case Elanor. Up until the end at least. Otherwise, it's of the haunted mansion persuasion, and considered a Classic of the ghost story sub-genre.It tells the story of a group of people that have been specifically selected by a Professor, who desires to study the paranormal, by having them stay in an old mansion called Hill House, which is known to have a dark past, and to be haunted by the ghost of the daughter of it's original owners.The group members have been specifically selected because of particular traits they possess. Traits the Professor has deemed desirable for the purposes of his study. Elanor is a medium- who has the ability to connect with and feel the presence of the dead- evident from the experiences documented from her past. While Theo, on the other hand, is a psychic who possesses the ability to read minds. She was chosen by the Professor for the purpose of reading Elanor's mind- so that she cannot keep her thoughts and experiences hidden away. Hence why she is trying to form (what seems almost like a veiled lesbian) relationship with Elanor, throughout the film. The Professor is a seemingly legit scientist, who is sincerely interested in discovering more about the ghost phenomenon. Considering this, he has resorted to using the only effective instruments he knows of- paranormally inclined humans. Luke, the young heir to the mansion, typically thinks he knows everything, and thus plays the role of the skeptic. The value of his presence is derived from the fact that he works to keep the professor grounded in reality. His presence was requested by the current owner of the house, who insisted he get in on the experience, so that he can get an idea about what he'll be getting into in the future, when he inherits Hill House for himself.The plot starts off kind of like all of those shitty ghost hunter type shows, with each of the members of the group playing their respective roles. Even though there is pretty definitive evidence that there is actually a ghost, at times early on, Wise cleverly includes certain elements that lead to reasonable doubt.Sh*t starts to hit the fan when the Professor's wife shows up unexpectedly; invading the house and demanding to experience a ghost. After discovering that the "sealed" nursery is the center of activity in the house, that's, of course, where she wants to go. The group was careful to leave that room alone, but when they approach it...the doors are wide open, just waiting for the wife to enter.Prior to this, the ghost had been specifically targeting Elanor. It's clear that Elanor is trying to escape her past, as she is constantly calling this her vacation, and stating that she'd prefer to stay in the old mansion forever.Everything culminates when the Professor's Wife becomes possessed by the spirit of the house, and starts sleepwalking outside, at the very instant that Elanor (herself possessed? or fleeing in fear, perhaps?) gets in her car and starts to drive away...leading to a collision that would take Elanor's life- trapping her soul in the house forever. Like she wanted one would suppose. To bring things to a circular close, the Professor notes how she died at the same tree that the Original Owner's Wife had tragically died at- right before she got a chance to step into the place.Earlier on, a ghostly note is scribbled on the wall telling Elanor to, "Come Home". Does this imply that she was, in fact, the reincarnated soul of the Original Owner's Wife? Was Abigail (their daughter, and the ghost that was known to haunt Hill House) responsible for trying to unite with her dead and reincarnated mother's spirit? Or were there always multiple ghosts in the house? You are left to answer these questions for yourself.The Haunting is an interesting horror classic, that provides just enough reasonable doubt to keep you thinking, and second guessing your notions...which is fun. The ghost activity is subtle, and the film is slow and dialogue based, so it's more of a thinking-man's horror. What makes it so great is that it ties up all the loose ends, but leaves things open-ended enough to allow for different readings about what you think happened, depending on where you are coming from (think, which character in the film did you most relate to?). It's certainly one of the top 20 ghost films of all time, and an all-around solid psychological horror.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"No one lives any nearer than town. No one will come any nearer than that. In the night. In the dark."- Mrs. Dudley, the housekeeper in THE HAUNTING. THE HAUNTING is that welcome kind of rarity, a film adaptation that improves on the original source. Shirley Jackson's novel doesn't put the emphasis on whatever supernatural vibes may be lurking. Her real focus is the chills and shocks that are derived from the clash of personalities and wills of the characters, notably Eleanor, an embittered and repressed woman who has experienced paranormal phenomena, and Theodora, a somewhat worldly but also quite wary psychic. In the book the people are more frightening than the house. The film's director Robert Wise maintains the painful human interactions but smoothly and intelligently sharpens the presence of that dreadful something enveloping the house and its inhabitants. In the film the house becomes a fifth and menacing character. There are odd little changes from book to film. Dr. Montague, the scholar who spearheads the paranormal project in the book, becomes Dr. Markway in the movie. Markway's wife, an disruptive, imperious shrew in the book, is softened and humanized considerably in the movie (and Mrs. Markway is played by James Bond's Miss Moneypenny, Lois Maxwell). With the exception of Russ Tamblyn (a bit out of his league here) the cast is excellent. Julie Harris, seen in too few films, plays the long suffering Eleanor to perfection. The dark, understated beauty and sexual vibrancy of Claire Bloom, expressing the fragility and viciousness of Theodora, is in ideal contrast to Harris' neurotic primness. The tension between the two women sets in motion a subtle undercurrent of desire. Then there is the house. Photographed by Davis Boulton in chilling black and white, in harsh daylight, at odd angles and throughout its forbidding interior, it is most unsettling to gaze upon. One scene may actually haunt you: the door to the study is probed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three investigators of the paranormal seclude themselves in a gloomy old mansion with a notorious past.Director Wise is a graduate of horror meister Val Lewton's school of psychological horror, The Curse of the Cat People (1944), The Body Snatcher (1945), for example. So you would think he would know the judicious use of effects inside an evolving plot. Here, however, he piles on the effects inside what amounts to a static plot. Now, he can't be blamed for an essentially repetitive script, but the constant cameos of the dark mansion soon exhaust the effect; along with a string of loud sound effects, more annoying than frightening. Stretch these out over a 100-minute span, and you've got a slow, tiresome movie, despite critic's raptures to the contrary.Now, the plot has a potentially intriguing theme?is the house actually haunted or just a figment of the neurotic Nell's (Harris) fevered brain. We get a constant voice-over of Nell's thoughts that raise the intriguing possibility of an ambiguous origin. But then director Wise uses a number of objective camera shots that suggest the objective nature of the haunting. So that engaging element is undercut.Now, I'm not saying there aren't creepy moments or the got'cha of Grace's (Maxwell) haggard face suddenly appearing in the trap door. Then too, the sets are appropriately gloomy, but since all the action takes place inside the mansion, there's no contrast to the gloom. To me, at least, the best horror is the kind that includes a contrast with the normal. In short, there is no effective sense of movie evil without a contrastive sense of good. In this movie, it's that constant repetition of gloom that eventually becomes empty and tiresome.In short, the film's overrated despite the overall acclaim, a name cast, and a promising premise.(In passing?I get the impression Theo (Bloom) is supposed to be a lesbian at a time when the movies couldn't dare be explicit about such things. But notice, for example, how her affectionate attitude changes toward Nell once Nell fixates on John (Johnson). Of course, nothing substantive hangs on this conjecture.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish Leonard Maltin had been writing in 1963 to warn me not to see this movie alone. I did. I was a lonely, geeky 13-year-old when I first saw it on a Thursday night during its first release. The theater was the old State Theater in Eau Claire, WI, nearly as spooky as the house itself and all the spookier for being nearly empty. I sat close to the front, engulfed by the huge screen and the sound of those huge, old Voice of America speakers, slowly being drawn into the web of plausibility being spun. The tension built steadily, until at Mrs. Markway's appearance at the climax of the stair sequence I gave out the only involuntary scream I have ever uttered at the movies. Walking home in the dark with the fall leaves whirling about was a study in controlled terror. I have never quite gotten over the that night and still consider it the most upsetting movie I have ever seen. And that was before I realized that the closing voice-over was not the professor's, but Eleanor's, and with it the suggestion that she is now doomed to be alone for eternity--a hell that only the lonely can fully appreciate. Movies come and go, but this one lingers on the mind well beyond what is comfortable. And if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend viewing it for the first time sitting up close to the biggest screen you can find, turning the volume up on the home theater system, and never, ever, viewing it alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scared me to the marrow when I was a kid, a classic horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an empty mansion in old New England. The reason is? Because its haunted, that's why. It was built by a cranky or worse old Puritan man and he constructed it so doors open and shut at a whim, on their own. Also, there are curious hallways and staircases. Rumor is that things began to happen there almost at once. Folks just kept turning up deceased, from falls or fright, its not really clear. Now, it has no occupants, at least not the living kind. This has attracted the curiosity of a Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson). He has vowed to stay in the house until its secrets are uncovered. Posting ads, he also convinces Nell (Julie Harris), a shy spinster to the join the party as well as a he-man type (Russ Tamblyn). Not even the doctor's wife, Theodora (Claire Bloom) wants him to be part of this experiment! Nevertheless, the small party shows up at the place. On the afternoon of their arrival, things seem placid enough, although the doors start to work their magic. But, wait until dark, folks! Yes, lights start flickering on and off and the group, who wanted to stay together, gets separated almost at once. Messages start to appear on the hallway walls, especially for Nell. Theodora arrives late, concerned about her husband, who hasn't rung the telephone. Before many minutes, she gets placed on her own, too, and can't find her way back. What is going on? Will the skeptical scientist and his crew make it out alive and together? This film scared me to the marrow when I was in junior high school and I've never watched it again. Its one of the reasons the horror genre remains my least favorite kind of movie, for I take everything to heart and can't shake memories. The cast is great, especially Harris as the woman lacking friends and confidence. As for the mansion, ugh, what a labyrinth of creepiness, with a special trap door that made me jump off the couch when it was opened. Costumes, photography, the spooky direction and the terrific script taken from the Shirley Jackson novel completes this flick's journey to one of the top ten Horror films ever. Watch it if you dare, film fans!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seldom have I seen a classic so disappointing. Yeah, sure, I've ranked dozens of lesser-known, lesser-pedigreed, less-expensively made films higher than "5," but THEY were entertaining, even if somewhat predictable and genre-driven. On the other hand, THE HAUNTING probably has spawned more bad movies than it has inspired good ones.Robert Wise had a very uneven directing career. While few can question the achievement of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951) or THE SOUND OF MUSIC (1965), I think many others--including THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN (1971), THE HINDENBERG (1975), AUDREY ROSE (1977), and STAR TREK: THE MOVIE (1979)--are vastly over-rated, as is THE HAUNTING (1963), simply because he directed them.The same can be said for the work of Shirley Jackson. Though she proved herself a master of the short story with THE LOTTERY, and, to a lesser extent, with THE LADY OR THE TIGER (to which one character clumsily alludes about 29 minutes into the movie), she falls short in the estimation of most as a novelist. Unfortunately for us, THE HAUNTING is based on a Jackson novel entitled THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE.*** SPOILERS ***When Wise optioned Jackson's novel for a movie, it clearly was a case of the lesser talents of each individual connecting. Let's examine the the subplots crammed into this flick's 112-minute running time. A haunted tree murders Hugh Crain's first wife. A haunted staircase does in his second. He goes to England and drowns in a haunted river. His only child lies in a haunted bed until she is 90, when a neglectful nurse kills her. The house is now 90-years-old, and two people have died inside of it (that's about one every 45 years). Somehow, that makes it the deadliest house in America. An anthropologist gets permission from the current owner to try to harness the power of the presumed ghosts of Hill House for the betterment of mankind (an illogical idea made even less likely by the misanthropic character of the two ladies who presumably became the ghosts of Hill House).The owner of Hill House forces the anthropologist to take her mercenary nephew on his ghost-hunting expedition. He also invites along two young single women (both just as much total strangers to him as the nephew). One of these women cannot remember being notorious for a few rocks "raining" on her house when she was a 10-year-old; the other, with minimal "ESP" skills, is a lesbian who has just broken up with her lover in the English release of this made-in-England film, but is a mystery whack-job in the heavily-edited American version of THE HAUNTING.Things go bump in the night. The anthropologist suggests the house is "alive." Some stage hands push on a molded-rubber door to make it "breathe." The first young woman (call her "Rocky") suddenly remembers she MAY have killed her own mother in the exact same fashion the nurse killed the last live-in resident of Hill House. She also makes a play for the anthropologist, and generally goes nutso. Meanwhile, the nephew is making eyes at the second woman (call her "Leslie"), who is using every excuse to get into bed with "Rocky." The stuff really hits the fan with the arrival of the anthropologist's wife. She disappears (a perfectly logical explanation is offered later). Her husband decides the best way to look for her is to have the nephew drive "Rocky" away in the middle of the night (which would leave him alone with "Leslie"). "Rocky" wants to become a permanent squatter in the house (it's as big as a castle, and being a hotel in "real life," certainly it has plenty of room), so she creates an opportunity to drive into the same haunted tree that killed the first mistress of Hill House. If you're keeping score, that makes it Tree 2, House 2 (which is a tie, in my book). No doubt the producers shortened the title of this mishmash to simply THE HAUNTING, after someone pointed out that it was just as much about a haunted tree as a spooky home! If you need any more proof as to how lame this project was, check out the DVD slide show extra. The distributors were so desperate for anything that might create "buzz," they suggested theater owners borrow old furniture from local second-hand shops to attract antique lovers to the theater to see the "glorious" old props used in this movie (most of the ones highlighted in the publicity release barely are visible in the picture). The PR folks also recommended having the audience play with the "ESP" testing symbol cards (at which "Leslie" supposedly was such a whiz) while waiting for the show to start (and, no doubt, they intended to use the card tricks later to mollify all the walk-outs they anticipated).The renown, if not respect, and scandalously high rating this film has garnered seems mostly to be due to what I call THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES SYNDROME. Simply because it has been remade a few times, and may be hard to puzzle out for the type of person who would try to, almost no one is willing to shout out, "there's nothing here!" If you're a student of horror films or self-styled psychological thrillers, check out THE HAUNTING. But if you feel like being entertained rather than bamboozled, get your hands on DRAG ME TO HELL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what an epic! Now I understand why fans of this movie hate both the remake, and Stephen King's Rose Red. Instead of using insomniacs as a ruse, as in the remake, clairvoyants are used, as in Rose Red. Both are obvious rip offs to this classic demonstration of suspense.Interesting. And here, I thought Rose Red was an original story. In my opinion, it should have a "based on" by line on it, it is that much like this work.Julie Harris is Nell. I remember her best as Reggie, the pipe-smoking medium from Stephen King's The Dark Half. Interesting, that King would feature her in one of his works, while another of his works features so many similarities with one of her best.This movie has atmosphere. Loads of it. It delivers what it promises, seduces with its ambiguity and then thrills with its delivery. I, for one, love this original. But I also highly enjoy the much despised remake, for all the beautiful CGI and other physical effects. EYE CANDY!But this one delivers some pretty fancy effects for 1963. Very nicely done. The dialog in Nell's mind was translated a bit over to Nell's character in the remake, but the atmosphere relied a lot on the effects there. Here, the atmosphere is built through suspense; dialog and story building and building. I love this movie. I still love the remake, but I have a new-found respect for the original work.This house is grand, but not as grand as that in the remake, which, to me, played a large part in making the remake as much fun as it was to watch. The musical score gets a little crazy sometimes, but for the most part, it adds a lot to the atmospheric properties which make this such a good movie. It is not scary, by my standards, but it is suspenseful in a slow, building way which does not lend to boredom or give a tired or tedious story. I still prefer the remake for the great effects, but the original is where the story is.I do have to say this, though. The remake made me JUMP several times. It suckered me in and actually startled me a couple of times. This original did not.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reluctantly reported: A Letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chiefly, I am disappointed by two things about this film.One is that the wisecracking young smart aleck (a stock character in this kind of film who, I think, is supposed to beat the audience to an expression of their own most dismissive thoughts about the action being portrayed, thus providing a kind of anti-camp insurance for the film) takes too long to come around and feel the awe and fear of the supernatural here. To be blunt, Russ Tamblyn is very irritating and distracting here. You want to stick a sock in his mouth after the first 15 minutes. The second complaint is similar. Clair Bloom is simply too obnoxious by half as the preppie, wordly wannabe who taunts the sheltered Julie Harris character almost to death.I hadn't seen this film in many years, but remembered it as very somber, atmospheric and well photographed. It is well photographed. I was surprised, though, and disappointed to find on seeing it again that the problem characters --like the most obnoxious tribe members on an episode of Survival-- do a lot to whisk you away from all the experience could have been. They inevitably demand, and get, too much of your attention. They do this by introducing a level of petty bickering and office politics to the proceedings that really damages the mood the makers try to build.Five stars. Indeed, it seems now to me that too little happens here, and that what little does is seriously undercut by Bloom and Tamblyn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I sometimes think this original adaptation of Shirley Jackson's famous novel THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE is a mite overrated, it still makes for a scary treat for ghost fans. The always excellent Julie Harris was indeed an inspired choice for the part of Eleanor, the drab, timid, schizoid child-woman who becomes entangled within the secrets held within the walls of Hill House. Theodora is played with cheeky zest by the lovely but icey Claire Bloom: the character would have benefitted from a more light-hearted, humourous touch. Luke is played adequately by Russ Tamblyn and Dr. Markway (Montague in the book) is portrayed engagingly by the handsome, gentlemanly Richard Johnson. The plot simply revolves around the experiences of these four individuals - while researching under Markway's wing - the possiblility of psychic phenomena within the creepy New England pile known as Hill House. The black and white photography is eloquent and the film must be commended for letting the viewer's imagination take hold: what is NOT seen is what lingers in the viewer's mind: a brilliantly ingenious psychological ghost story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling, Wise going back to what he does best. (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever anyone tells you that a ghost story isn't scary, don't believe them. More than any other type of film, its success depends on the receptivity of the viewer, on the existence of a certain set of circumstances so precise that it is almost impossible to achieve them. For instance, last year, certain personal problems helped 'The Blair Witch Project' scare me senseless, while my friends' reaction was generally ho-hum. Other 'classic' ghost stories have left me indifferent.Last night I watched 'The Haunting'. I was exhausted after a shift day at work, so I wasn't strong enough to be cynical. The evenings have begun to get longer, and the local kids are throwing bangers which frighten my whimpering dogs. As I watch the movie, and get sucked into its mood, I prayed that my sleeping spouse wouldn't wake up and break it (don't tell him!), making me unusually tense. When a ghostly, 'Blair Witch'-like flash of white confronts Eleanor in her speeding car, I had to stifle a scream. Oh, as Kramer might have said, it's scary.'The Haunting' is very much a product of its times, and this is a good thing. Sometimes, confronted with the gorgeous, evocative, scary sets, the Chinese box that is House Hill, you might wish the film was directed by Resnais, or even Jack Clayton, someone who might properly exploit its distortions, angles, labyrinths, spaces, holes, ellipses, doors, turrets, balconies, halls. But Wise learned a trick or two while butchering 'The Magnificent Ambersons', and he acquits himself atypically well, shooting in piercingly lucid monochrome, the precision of the images somehow conveying the enigmatic horrors they conceal. He evokes an atmosphere of magic and fairy tale reminiscent of his masterpiece 'Curse of the Cat People', while scenes dissolve, leaving traces like ghosts. His editing and compositions, as he manipulates his characters through a malevolent space trying to suck them in, is masterly, if a little too controlled.The film at first seems like a rather obvious (and homophobic) Freudian bag of tricks, but the script's secret is to offer a number of explanations that don't quite fit. For instance, the house can be a projection of the mind, carrying the debilitating weight of its inhabitants' repressions - Eleanor's feelings of blame for letting her mother die, and her hungry, unexplored sexuality; Theo's guilty lesbianism; the doctor's loveless marriage etc. The house's terrors seem to centre on Eleanor and so does the film, as it charts her ironical growth as an exploited mouse whose independence means erasing herself from life.The study of women, from the novel by Shirley Jackson, is more complex than it seems, rarely flattering, but more profound than the brittle men. There is a rather obvious dichotomy set up between the women, whose psychic experiences are linked to sexual anxieties, and the men who either disbelieve the supernatural, or seek to contain it. In the end, it seems the men have won, with Eleanor dead. The opening narration is offered by an absurdly over-confident Dr Markway, but it is finished by Eleanor, as her ghost takes over the house and expels the others. This is a very bitter sort of victory.The film alludes at least three times to Hitchcock - characters called Crain (pronounced Crane); Eleanor driving away in a 'stolen' car, like Marion in 'Psycho'; her entrancement at the phallic turret and near-fall like Scottie in 'Vertigo' - these remind us that the house was actually built by a bitter, religiously zealous man to contain women, and who probably killed his wife. The theme of women's suppression in men's dark world is very Hitchcockian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere between the musical gang fights and dancing of 'West Side Story' and the colorful sing-song innocence belying Nazi Germany in 'The Sound of Music' lives the black and white psychological creepiness of "The Haunting". The Haunting is not a movie that will scare many people under the age of ten. However, it should effectively creep out anyone over the age of ten. Whether it's the house playing tricks on its house guests or if it's the house guests playing mind games amongst one another, the viewer is never more than two or three minutes away from a wall thumping, a door expanding, an anal retentive house servant, some nervous narrative inner thoughts or a loose woman....eh....I mean a woman on the loose. Don't expect to be shaking in your shoes, but rather hoping that Eleanor can become an expectant wall thumper for future tenants.The performances were fine(Russ Tamblyn excluded) and most of the camera angles worked for a chilling effect, some were just tilted, I guess.Just remember this.....when you bet against the house....eventually the house wins.8/10.</fullReview>

But being old Hollywood, they just HAD to concentrate on the most boring, annoying, repetitive and overacted character. Big mistake. Another thing is that the script is uneven.

		<fullReview>I was 7 when I first saw this in the 60's and the scares it evoked stayed with me for years. Some very memorable scares. I didn't see it again until I was in my 20s. What a fine film this is! Good for the whole family because it doesn't have a disgusting bone in it. It definitely puts you on a psychological edge and leaves you there through the whole film. The sense of dread is beautifully conjured and maintained. The sound effects folks seem to have tapped into some collective consciousness. They are chilling and unnerving. This is a well-written and thoughtful film. I feel it is the best haunted house movie ever. And the best thing of all is that nothing ever really happens....or does it? It's all in your mind. Today's attention-deficit generation may be impatient for overwhelming computer visuals and will be disappointed here. There aren't any! Great and unusual camera angles. Appropriately focused acting. This is a great film for a Halloween night party with the kids. Turn off the lights! Every time I sleep in a shadowy dark room with ornate wallpaper I hear things and see faces in the patterns. I can't help it! This film is in my library!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Wise has created a film that experiments with our deepest fears.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jan de Bont's 1999 remake of 'The Haunting' provided audiences with the over exaggerated CGI that would usually be associated with modern sci-fi epics such as 'The Matrix' (1999) and 'Star Wars Episode 1' (1999). Sadly, CGI in the horror genre just didn't work and instead made the intended 'creepy' film seem more like an action comedy.So after seeing 'The Haunting' remake I decided that the original would have the same comedic undertones and melodramatic scenes as its predecessor, only without the CGI. Boy, was I wrong. Robert Wise's 'The Haunting' (1963) is actually rather scary. The eerie black and white frames give the viewer a chance to escape from most of the trashy horror's of today and be immersed in the creepy, isolated mansion in-which the film is set. What makes the film generally scary to watch is that Wise uses a fear that we can all relate to - a mysterious, unknown knocking. Combine this common fear with a dramatic series of camera angles and music and you've got a horror movies worth peeing your pants to. I'll ignore the abrupt ending and focus on the brilliance of the film. It's a film you've got to see. Not only is it a masterpiece of classic horror, it has also managed to stand the test of time - continuing to scare the average modern audience with its bleak depths. I'd give it **** out of ***** Go and see it...now!</fullReview>

In any case, it's disappointing to see how many simply find it a waste of time.I saw this under special circumstances. I was about 12 years old and my parents were out for the evening when it came on TV. I didn't know anything about it but considered myself quite the connoisseur of horror and sci-fi shown at the small local theater. I figured it would be along the line of Universal monsters and Roger Corman fare, nothing particularly notable.It scared the absolute daylights out of me. Sitting alone the in house at night with the creepy sounds and images emanating from that little B&amp;W screen got to me badly. Even after my parents were home and I went to bed I found myself looking for faces in the plaster walls of my room and imagining every creak as an approaching but invisible malevolent force.I still get it out every couple of years on a dark dreary night, and though the lines of dialog sound more stilted to my now elderly mind I can still remember the effect it had on me so many decades ago.I had an even more intense reaction from Hitchcock's "The Birds" and I've noticed the commentary about that film to be similar to this.

		<shortDescription>A Great Haunted House Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eleanor is a broken women. She spent most of her adult life taking care of her sick mother, with little help from her sister. Her mother has passed away, and now Eleanor doesn't know what to do with her life. She receives no support from her sister, who argues with her, and even her niece calls her names. When Eleanor is invited by Dr. John Markway to stay in a mansion, she readily agrees. Dr. Markway studies the paranormal, and he believes Hill House to be haunted, so he invites Eleanor, along with Theodora and Luke, the current owner's nephew, to be witnesses. Eleanor, desperately wanting a friend, takes a liking to Theo. They act close at the beginning of the film, likening their relationship to that of sisters. Theo, however, is implied to be lesbian, so there may be more to their relationship than just sisterly bond. Eleanor also takes a liking to Dr. Markway because he is the only one not to make fun of her.As the film progresses, Hill House lives up to its reputation. Loud noises sound off in different rooms, there are cold spots in impossible places, and something keeps on banging on the doors. Eleanor starts to see things, but is she losing her mind, or is she being influenced by something otherworldly? Theo and Luke make fun of her, which is why Dr. Markway is nice to her.The scares are effective, the tension is constant, and there is never a moment of boredom. The acting is good, and the direction and cinematography are astounding. While watching this movie, I was amazed at Robert Wise's diversity. The only other movies I've seen of his are Born To Kill (1947), a dark and violent noir, and the Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), an intelligent science-fiction movie. My only real complaint is the ending. It's too abrupt. After Eleanor crashes her car into a tree, the others find her, and then it ends. Still, The Haunting was a great movie, and I could see my score going up upon a rewatch.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arriving at a supposedly haunted mansion for an experiment on fear study, a group of strangers and their over-seer are witness to an extraordinary amount of physical evidence that forces them to believe the house to be haunted and must find a way of getting out of the building alive.While this one does have some great work here there's some troubling parts as well. There's a lot here that works with this one in dealing with the theory of the supernatural that runs through the film, as this one preys upon the concept of the victim's own imagination to play tricks on what's going on. The emphasis on her guilt and sensitivity, buoyed by the history of the house itself, makes this such a fun time with how the early supernatural scenes from the odd creaks and groans and disembodied voices heard throughout here but also in all the teasing and joking around that soon turn into actual haunting sequences as they explore the house all manage to give this one quite a healthy sense of fear here, while it's big haunting scenes are the main focus. The bedroom scenes here are absolutely chilling as the utterly pounding footsteps echoing throughout the hallways into the room next-door where they begin scratching on the walls to an absolutely fevered pitch that then dies down just as quickly as it appeared, and a second scene where the girls are alone in the room overhearing the echoing footsteps return into the next-door room again and the muffled conversations to the frightened girl prompt their own individual response to the situation before the truly classic hand-holding gag that makes this quite fun. As well, the big centerpiece sequence here is the encounter in the parlor where the pounding footsteps appear leading into the door to the hallway outside which leads to it pushing against the door from outside with enough force to push the wooden door in with quite a powerful display all in front of everyone which gives this as much as it does. That this is the lone haunting done in front of others and is such a thrilling and creative moment makes for quite a powerful scene as a whole. The other big plus here is the actual house itself, which is quite spooky and appropriate setting here for the type of action portrayed which is quite an impressive task, and uses its setting to great effect. These are good enough to make this hold off the few minor flaws here, which comes from the rather bland and drawn-out pace here as while this one isn't boring its' way too long for how little action is present. The encounters are spaced out throughout here in such a big amount of time that it never really settles into a groove about how to play off the dreariness of the pace here. as well, there's also the fact that the films' psychological issues here are considerably downplayed into appearing so clumsy here that the inclusion is really troubling. Otherwise, this one works rather well overall.Today's Rating-PG: Mild Violence.</fullReview>

In fact, a short time into the movie whenever the camera moved quickly the whole audience would scream en masse. I distinctly remember feeling like my heart was going to pound right out of my chest.There are very few "nasty bits" in this film, but the Cinematographer Davis Boulton did such a wonderful job that he had all of us terrified in anticipation - SO much more effective and tasteful than "horror" films today. The Haunting was filmed in black and white and I don't think we see one drop of blood in it. Yet it was SO powerful. Even watching it fairly recently as a much older adult I had to marvel at the skill: how sinister something TAME could appear by virtue of the camera work alone. In addition, the special effects and the acting added to the overall creepiness of the atmosphere.Highly recommended. In latter years I haven't been inclined to watch scary movies. But I so admired the way this film was done that I had to see it again just to see if the effects held up with time. I think they do.</fullReview>

They start as skeptics and become believers! Every night they are to log what happens to them so it can be studied to prove the supernatural does exist.This film obviously inspired "Rose Red" the Stephen King book and film.

		<shortDescription>Once Upon a Scary Spinster...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you can get past the theatrical acting and the melodrama and the distracting voice-over, THE HAUNTING is a reasonably good horror movie. Scary? In places. Silly? In more places.Still, this may be one of the first True Horror movies, utilizing the audience's imagination to create its scares. Director Robert Wise (THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL 1951) uses skewed camera angles, eerie noises, chilling unseen presences to create the life force of the haunted Hill House - a veritable castle where four people will spend a few nights in an experiment to discover supernatural phenomena.Smug Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson, wishing he was Clark Gable) invites the other three: Eleanor (Julie Harris), a plain spinster living in her married sister's lounge room, aching for adventure; Theo (Claire Bloom), ambiguously lesbian and disarmingly hot, even for black and white standards; and Luke (Russ Tamblyn, looking like he has just breezed by from a Frankie Avalon beach movie).The scares in THE HAUNTING are admittedly effective - if you don't think about the logic behind them. For example, Eleanor and Theo cower together in a bed, listening to gargantuan banging noises, which echo through the house, sounds of feet running around, wailing noises, watching the locked bedroom door in anxiety. Do they believe something is trying to get in? (At least, that's the notion they whimper to Clark Gable as he smugly dismisses them as Scared Dames because he didn't hear any sounds.) But why would something supernatural "bang" on the door if it wanted to get in? What's the point in being supernatural if you can't get through a door with your spirit self? Other genuinely chilling sequences involve Eleanor lying in the dark, hearing voices, laughing, babies crying - oh no! Not babies crying! - and thinking she is holding fast the hand of Theo. When the lights come on, Theo is far across the room - whose hand was she holding?The script creates much of the anxiety: "Everything seems to move when you turn your head away"; "There's not a straight angle in Hill House"; ominous statues in the courtyard, a rickety spiral staircase where people hanged themselves; showing nothing, implying everything - but the script is also responsible for acres of backstory and montage that will either scare you to death or put you into a coma.The hook in THE HAUNTING (Never Show The Monsters - but Make Lotsa Banging Noises) would inform modern films like THE CHANGELING (1980, starring George C. Scott) and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, 2009.Watching people in black and white movies flirt is always good for a laugh; back in the day when being a 40-year-old spinster was scarier than any ghost was. Dr. Markway's manly advances toward plain Eleanor involve telling her that her hair is lovely. Until his wife turns up unexpectedly.Then there is the black and white version of raunchy lesbian sex, as Theo and Eleanor get drunk in the same bed with their long thick woolen nighties on, wocka-chicka just moments away. Fat chance! It'd take a jackhammer to cleave those nighties.Markway is "looking for proof of supernatural phenomena" - well, things keep happening and Markway never comes close to writing anything down! No research, no documenting, no experimentation. When he finds the freezing "heart of Hill House," they all stand there talking about it, doing nothing to verify it. And he "guarantees it won't register on any thermometer!" That guarantee would hold more weight, Doc, if you actually tried to measure it with a thermometer! A corridor is freezing so it MUST be haunted, because other people say it's freezing as well. No measurements, or examining for hidden passageways or air ducts; if a door closes by itself, it MUST be haunted, no examination of the door hinges, or its cant or jambs.These are exactly the types of dills that are affected by curious phenomena - people prone to be terrified because they're not in the least trying to discover what is behind the phenomena. (By the way, that pathetic TV show GHOST HUNTERS is not "scientific" just because they use night vision cameras to show those fairyboy "ghost hunters" peeing themselves over every little noise.) When the other three try to oust Eleanor from the house because of her escalating battiness, she refuses, maintaining she is happy to remain in the house forever; that she feels a kinship with it. I guess cowering in the darkness and feeling as if you're being watched is what a 40-year-old spinster calls fun. It is hinted at by the others that the house phenomena may merely be a product of Eleanor's spinster imagination; that her fluids are out of control for being 40 and not having a man. I hesitate to guess. I didn't take any notes.You get that lazy when Dr. Markway is your MD. I went to him with a high temperature the other day and he felt my forehead, didn't look at the thermometer, and diagnosed, "You either have a fever - or you're possessed by demons. By the way, your hair is lovely..." --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too academic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite beautiful sets and sympathetic characters like fragile, tragic female lead Eleanor, this movie, based on Shirley Jackson's novel about group of people investigating the haunted house, is too academic and without atmosphere. It is also frustratingly clear, that poor Eleanor was doomed from the start: you can't let plain, neurotic spinsters to live. Still, nice sets of living, insane (!) house and complete lack of exploitative gore/torture/filth fantasies- this is attempt at spine-chilling suspense - are plus points in my eyes. Better than anything what sleazy, overrated Stephen King - self-confessed admirer of Jackson's work - has ever written.</fullReview>

This film is a pleasure for fans of Shirley Jackson as well as those who appreciate fine acting and directing. There is never the sense that the filmmakers felt a need to insult the intelligence of the viewer by "filling in the blanks" of the story with unnecessary gore and violence (as seen in the "remake").It's amazing to find that a movie I so clearly recall from my childhood as terrifying can still elicit a fair number of goosebumps!The viewer is left to judge whether this is a psychological thriller, a taste of the supernatural, or both.

		<fullReview>It's next to impossible to believe that between making colorful, energetic musicals like WEST SIDE STORY and THE SOUND OF MUSIC, Robert Wise came up with this black and white low key horror classic with industrial strength chills. Just watching the first few minutes of THE HAUNTING, you know your sleep is going to be disturbed. Wise opens the film with a grisly montage tracing the troubled past of a New England estate. Quickly cut images of a carriage accident, a depressed woman wasting her whole life in this gloomy place, a murder and a suicide quickly hit us, mostly photographed with a spooky wide angle lens. The rest of the film follows a mismatched group of psychic researchers spending a few days in the house. Julie Harris is the unpleasant Eleanor, a neurotic so withdrawn and uptight, she makes Candice Hilligoss in CARNIVAL OF SOULS seem like Pam Anderson. Claire Bloom plays a hip lesbian whose actually more friendly with Russ Tamblyn's womanizing character than she is with the nervy Eleanor. Richard Johnson plays Professor Markway, the leader of this pack, in a manner recalling Wise's old friend, Orson Welles. His appearance and vocal delivery resembles Orson quite a deal. In fact, THE HAUNTING is amazingly Wellesian. The low camera angles, the crooked camera angles, the frantic cutting, and the way conversing actors overlap their dialog makes this film seem like a horror film version of CITIZEN KANE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable psychosexual chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wise's reasonably faithful adaptation of Shirley Jackson's elegant little spookbook 'The Haunting of Hill House' has stood the test of time rather well, ranking with 'Psycho' (which seems to have influenced its style) as one of the best pre-modern horror films. Wise zeroes in on the psychosexual aspects of the novel, but like Jackson he is for the most part content to leave things shrouded in an eerie ambiguity, and only in an unfortunate summing-up conversation following the film's climax does he really over-explain anything. Ever the chameleon, the director exercises his gifts most gracefully, borrowing here and there from Hitchcock and Welles (not to mention Val Lewton and Robert Wiene), but the movie's real anchor is the ideally cast Julie Harris, who squirms and hand-wrings her way through her central role as poor Eleanor. Harris is wonderfully manic throughout, and yet there's something about her portrayal that doesn't push the viewer away, but rather draws us in to care about, or at least pity, this character. Claire Bloom has a lot of fun with the same sort of purring lesbian part Suzanne Pleshette played in 'The Birds' that same year. Richard Johnson is a bit stagy as the doctor, perhaps, but he's functional enough, and if Russ Tamblyn seems a bit out of his depth he at least manages not to annoy us most of the time. Of course, 'The Haunting' is the textbook example of the never-show-anything school of horror, but it's interesting how effective and scary the movie still manages to be, even when you're fully aware nothing is ever going to be shown. The film now seems occasionally talky, and we do wonder why Wise chose such a metallic sound effect for the pounding on the wooden door, but overall it remains an intensely enjoyable chiller. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

The novel, by Shirley Jackson, is considered an American classic. What a shame that it was remade in such a horrible fashion fairly recently. If you are not familiar with Ms. Jackson's novels and short stories, please check them out. Her style is quite unique, with her work alternating between Erma Bombeck-ish accounts of everyday life, to disturbing studies of mental disorders meshed with the supernatural.

		<fullReview>This movie terrified me in the theater and still manages to send a chill down my spine after 40 years. Without resorting to clownish and over-powering special effects, director Wise manages to convey the fear of helpless humans when their minds and lives are manipulated by an unseen and unknown presence. There is doubt, then confusion, and finally terror.The absence of any overt appearance of the spirit infesting Hill House places the viewer into an uncertain frame of mind.Through the powerful performances of Claire Bloom and Julie Harris, the audience is made to experience the confusion resulting from situations where the mind is uncertain of the reality as conveyed by the senses.Further anxiety is stimulated by the inability to defend against the unseen. The audience, along with the characters, is thrust into the abyss of terror.A great story by a great writer brought to the screen by a great director who inspires great performances from his actors... in short, a great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite horror movie....ever (SPOILERS!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting is my favorite horror movie, bar none. The reason I feel so strongly about it is that it achieves its scares without showing any blood, monsters, or madmen. It's purely through masterfully mounting suspense, unexplained noises, and odd camera angles that it creates the desired effect.I also like the way the film works on several levels. First, the fact that the house is, indeed haunted, But there is also the psychological aspect: Eleanor has a seemingly fragile psyche, and needs desperately to belong. She not only falls under the spell of the house, but also that of Dr. Markway, who (seemingly) unintentionally leads her on.The character of Theo, the psychic, is also an interesting one. I have always wondered how much of the way in which her lesbianism is subtly introduced was the idea of the director to begin with, and how much of it was due to the convention of the times. It's very entertaining to watch Theo come on pretty strongly to Eleanor, only to be rebuffed, and then watch her reaction when Eleanor displays her obvious attraction to Dr. Markway.Russ Tamblyn is perfect as the devout skeptic who, by the end of the movie, becomes an equally devout believer in the supernatural.The unusual camera angles and lenses used throughout the movie also lend an air of things not being quite right. In many parts of the film, we're not quite sure how much of Eleanor's disorientation is due to the house, and how much is due to her own imagination gone wild. But there is no doubt that something is in the house: the pounding on the walls and the doors of some unseen force, the whispers and cries in the night, and of course, the great oak door bending inwards as though made of rubber. No, something is certainly there.In the end, Eleanor succumbs, and as she is forced to drive away from the house, unseen hands take control of the steering wheel and force the car into a tree, killing her instantly. Or were they unseen hands? Perhaps it was Eleanor's own tortured mind taking control and refusing to let her leave. After all, in dying she had finally found a place where she belongs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in the theatre when it was new and found it to be delightfully spooky very much like another favorite of mine, "The Uninvited". The movie version does not exactly follow Shirley Jackson's novel but with the excellent performance by Julie Harris, the beautiful cinematography, the superb sets and perfectly adapted music, the dark psychological and eerie story that Jackson wrote is well played out on the screen. I read Jackson's book after I had seen the movie and wish that some of the story parts that are in the novel would have been put in the movie such as the picnic that Elenore and Theo have out on the grounds of Hill House. I also think the movie would have been much more fun if Dr. Markway's wife's character or motivational role would have been as it is in the novel. None the less I still enjoy this movie for the great work of art that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE HAUNTING, an inspiration for Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD films, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and a really, really crappy 1999 remake, is a moderately entertaining horror flick with some suspenseful set pieces and some really interesting characters. There are some good scares relying on sound and lighting which are excellent, and a surreal scene with a breathing wall (a great effect). But the house in this film never registers as an evil force, we just hear people talk about how it is an evil force.We're forced to spend most of the running time watching the unlikable lead Eleanor (Julie Harris). Nell is a twisty-faced, mother-obsessed whiner who worries on and on in endless voiceovers. The most likable character is sexy, fashionable, and wry Theo (Claire Bloom), a psychic whose lesbianism is handled in a sly, intelligent, and funny manner- definitely not what I expected from a horror movie in 1963. The double-entendre-laden dialog is squirmingly droll. The rest of the wry cast contains a bland doctor (Dick Johnson) and the eternally wise-cracking Luke (Russ Tamblyn, who has one weird filmography), who has some good lines but seems to be in the movie for no reason. Ms. Moneypenny also shows up in an annoying role.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This not scary movie at all. The only thing good I can say about this movie is that if it had not been made and ended being the unbelievable success that it was the remake would which is one of the best horror movies ever made would never have been made. Other then that this is badly written and has an awful ending. The acting was mediocre. I think people say that it is scary are to easy to scary. They probably not like the remake because they got to scared. Because it is one of the scariest movies ever made. It is not that I do think the old horror movies are scary. I think a lot of horror movies are scary. And this is not one of them. I think people are narrow minded about remakes and sequels and prequels. The reason people don't like the 1999 remake is because it is a remake. The remake was mush stronger story line. The story line in this one is just week. The acting is mush stronger in the remake. The story line is better and ending is better. The special are far more better. And that is a good thing believe me. This movie is overrated 60's cheese. Do not see this movie.

		<shortDescription>I don't get it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see all the 10 out of 10 reviews describing the film as the scariest movie ever made and I just don't understand it at all. I'm not a gore fanatic at all and I appreciate subtlety but the film is not remotely frightening and for a haunted house setting with the additional use of black and white, it is not even particularly atmospheric.I keep reading people going on about how terrifying the noises and the turning of the door knob were. To me, this was barely even suspenseful. There is honestly so little of the supernatural within the entire film that I'd hesitate to even describe it as a horror film. Most of the very little tension in the film involves Eleanor fighting with Theodora.Speaking of which, Julie Harris's character who is the protagonist of this film is irritating, boring and not remotely likable. In fact, the rest of the cast is very underwhelming with the possible except of Theodora who has maybe a little more personality than the rest.Despite all this and how disappointed I am with this film, I still can't quite bring myself to give it one star. There is a slight charm to it although I think this owes more to the time period that the film was set in than anything else.I'm writing this in bed at 1:56am and am totally confident that I could go to sleep right now without feeling any fear whatsoever.</fullReview>

But I did notice that this movie had a certain atmosphere to it that is not unlike the British movies of the 1940's. The last half of the movie is much more interesting. It's not 'silly scary'. There are no monsters in the movie. It's more of a spiritual thing. Yet, there is plenty of action. A few years ago I watched this movie again (on cable), and it has withstood the test of time. The movie starts out rather slow. But it becomes very engrossing during the second half. It's pretty thrilling. Make sure to watch the version from 1963.

		<fullReview>The Haunting is still one of the strongest entries into the haunted house subgenre despite the many entries that have flooded the genre as of late. It is a classic looking haunted house movie with a great cast, great direction, and a wonderful sense of dread.Good: The cast all around is excellent. Julie Harris is really good as the outsider Eleanor as she delivers a fragile performance that is both likable and weird. Claire Bloom is great as Theo with a risqué character trait for the time that makes it stand above most movies at the time. Richard Johnson provides a great performance as the professor and Russ Tamblyn brings a lot of funny comic relief. The direction is excellent with a lot of interesting camera angles and captures the house as a living breathing character. The movie can also be rather frightening at points with a great use in subtlety in its scares.Overall, this is a certified haunted house classic. Skip the remake and watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Old School of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting" is a rare example of a British film shot in the UK but ostensibly set in the USA; others include Chaplin's "A King in New York" (which could not be made in America where Chaplin was persona non grata) and the more recent "The House of Mirth". (There are far more American films ostensibly set in Britain but actually shot in America). The film did, however, have an American director, Robert Wise, and two American stars, Julie Harris and Russ Tamblyn. Hill House, an isolated New England mansion, was built around 1870 by the wealthy Hugh Crain for his young wife. She, however, was killed in a freak accident before she could set foot in it, and a subsequent series of tragic deaths have left the house with the reputation of being haunted. The current owner, an elderly lady, refuses to live there and it is left empty, although it is kept in good repair. Dr. John Markway, a British-born academic specialising in anthropology but with a sideline as a paranormal investigator, invites a small group of volunteers to stay in the house. Scientists in horror films are often portrayed as initially sceptical about supernatural phenomena, only to be proved wrong by events. (For obvious reasons: nobody wants to see a film about a "haunted" house that turns out not to be haunted after all). Markway, however, takes the opposite position; he believes in the paranormal and hopes to gather objective evidence of its existence. Markway's companions in the house are two young women with psychic abilities, Theodora and Eleanor, and Luke Sanderson, the nephew and heir of the owner. Luke, who does not believe in the supernatural, fulfils the role of resident sceptic. Eleanor, a shy, mentally fragile individual, is clearly nervous. Theodora is, outwardly at least, more relaxed, although may be hiding something. A curious three-way relationship develops between Markway, Eleanor and Theodora. Unusually for the early sixties, this film contains a strong lesbian subtext; the dreaded "L-word" is never used and nothing is made explicit, but it is implied that Theodora is sexually attracted to Eleanor and jealous of Eleanor's growing attraction to the handsome Markway. The film subverts the normal stereotypes about female homosexuality by casting the glamorous Claire Bloom as Theodora and portraying the heterosexual Eleanor as plain and dowdy. Wise made the film as a psychological horror film in the style of "Cat People" from some twenty years earlier. He did not work on the original "Cat People", which was made by Jacques Tourneur, but directed its sequel, "Curse of the Cat People", and had a high regard for Tourneur's film. Like "Cat People", "The Haunting" is an "understated" horror film, relying more on suggestion and inference than on what we are shown directly. There is no blood or gore and no stomach-churning special effects. Throughout the film we never actually see a ghost. Wise nevertheless manages to conjure up an atmosphere of terror by the use of "spooky" music, unexplained noises, oblique or unsettling camera angles and tracking shots and the design of the sets. Today Gothic architecture in the cinema is generally used to convey a sense of luxury and opulence, especially in films about the Victorian or Edwardian upper classes. In much of the twentieth century, however, particularly between about 1940 and 1980, it was used produce a sinister atmosphere in horror films, thrillers and melodramas; other examples include "Rebecca", "Caught", "The House on Telegraph Hill" (also made by Wise), "Dragonwyck", "Psycho" and "The Spiral Staircase". (In what may be a reference to the last-named film, a spiral staircase plays an important role in the plot here). Indeed, in some cases it was used where it was historically inappropriate. The British horror film "And Now the Screaming Starts" was filmed in a Victorian Gothic house even though the action was supposed to take place around 1790, more than sixty years before the house was built. Here the exterior of Hill House is represented by Ettington Hall, Warwickshire, and the interior scenes were filmed on sets deliberately designed to look oppressive and claustrophobic. Shirley Jackson, who wrote the novel on which the film is based, always insisted that it was a tale of the supernatural, but in the film the question of whether the paranormal phenomena are real or imagined is left open. The supposed psychic disturbances centre upon Eleanor, but it is possible that they may simply be symptoms of her overwrought imagination. Susan Hayward, who had worked with Wise on "I Want to Live!" five years earlier, was originally intended for the role, but I doubt if she would have been as brilliant as Julie Harris in conveying the psychologically fragile Eleanor's mental state, a mixture of nervous energy and terror. There is an effective contrast with Richard Johnson as Markway, outwardly a calm, phlegmatic British intellectual, but possibly too prone to believing what he wants to believe and blind to the effect his experiments are having on others, especially Eleanor. The weak link, as far as the acting is concerned, is Tamblyn's Luke, an inappropriately clownish and childish individual. The film was remade in 1999, starring Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta- Jones, but the remake is not a patch on the original. The horror genre had undergone a fundamental change between the early sixties and the late nineties, following the success of films like "The Exorcist" and "The Omen", and it seems that modern audiences will only accept a horror film if it is full of gore and gruesome special effects. More recent haunted house films like "The Haunting in Connecticut" show that this is even truer today than it was in 1999. The original "Haunting", however, shows just how effective the old school of horror could be at its best. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will have to admit that The Haunting is my all time favorite film and certainly my favorite horror story.I saw for the first time at the Emerson Theater in 1963 and again for perhaps the 100th a few minutes on my television on TCM.It still has the power to give he the shudders after all these years. Based on Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House" which she in turn styled on the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose California. Produced and directed by the legendary Robert Wise with a screen play by Nelson Gidding.Ideally cast, particularly the gifted Julie Harris as Eleanor Lance, all the actors were at the top of their game. Even Rosalie Crutchley was spooky as Mrs Dudley.There are, of course, several major plot alterations from the book, but that's to be expected. The cinematography by Davis Boulton is terrifyingly effective in it's use of light and shadows and Gidding's screenplay is taught and intelligent.The FX was especially effective for the time with the bending door scene particularly memorable. To me The Haunting is the perfect haunted house movie and the finest ghost story ever filmed. But of course not everyone is going to see it that way. Certainly no film can please everyone I can only say that I really enjoy a film that works on my imagination and turns me toward my own inner darkness and I consider it to be a classic because it's still talked about and argued over even after 50 years. I believe that there is a difference between being horrified and being disgusted. Most modern horror films disgust me but don't frighten me. The Haunting never fails to terrify me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hill House.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wise directed this brilliant adaptation of the Shirley Jackson novel about Hill House "a house that was born bad" according to Paranormal researcher Dr. John Markway(played by Richard Johnson). He has assembled a two-woman team of psychics: Eleanor Lance(played by Julie Harris) and Theodora(played by Claire Bloom), along with Luke(played by Russ Tamblyn) who represents the family that now owns the property. Though skeptical, he will come to believe as mysterious and frightening forces occur at Hill House, from pounding on the walls, to disembodied voices and cold spots. The house seems most interested in Eleanor, a lonely and high strung woman who loves the house, and wants to stay there, since she no longer has a home of her own. She finds herself in love with Dr. Markway, but when his disbelieving wife(played by Lois Maxwell) shows up, she is pushed over the edge, making her easy prey for the house...Outstanding horror film, superbly directed and acted by all, with an intelligent and multi-layered script that makes the viewer wonder how much is really happening to Eleanor, or perhaps because of Eleanor. Unforgettable and palpable atmosphere of fear and dread throughout, all leading to a truly chilling end, with the closing narration mirroring the beginning except in who tells it, and the changing of "whatever" for "we". Mesmerizing film deserves multiple viewings, and remains the pinnacle of haunted house films, as well as psychological horror. "Haunting" score as well, beautifully made in black &amp; white, and set in mid to late October, which is most fitting.</fullReview>

Dr Markway enlists the group to go to the haunted mansion for his study, and that's when we meet our main character Eleanor (Nell). She is a lonely woman whose mother just passed away, and is now looking for an escape of some sort. A weekend at Hill House sounds wonderful to her at first. From the moment she enters the mansion she feels an out of world presence. We meet the other two guests and the doctor who is heading the study. Creepy loud noises occur in the middle of the night frightening Nell and the others, and it's not far after that in which we learn the chilling violent story of the man who owned the house years prior (Hugh Crane). This original version of 'The Haunting' gets it so right. It looks at Eleanor's mental state and by letting us inside the mind of Eleanor we can sympathize with her, understand her better and appreciate the character. In the 1999 remake, we get none of that therefore do not feel or completely understand why she feels the way she does. We also get a series of disturbing and eerie loud noises and ghostly scares, and this movie does it so well. While watching 'The Haunting' late at night, it's actually unsettling and makes this film a genuinely scary ghost movie.The acting was well done from everyone involved. Julie Harris played unhinged Eleanor very well, and the supporting cast (Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson and Russ Tamblyn) did a great job in their performances as well. Overall, 'The Haunting' was a very well done scary movie from the early sixties. It has some goo performances as well as good scares to keep the audience engaged. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've only watched this movie twice. The first time was around when I was 14. It was a creepy experience. The second time was when I was 31, and I was showing it to my wife. She was a bit scared by it, but not by as much as I expected.The direction is fantastic. Wise knows how to manage his angles, how to use the decoration to overwhelm the viewers, and how to keep his camera movements fluid, but very effective.The sound design is the real highlight. It's a hard thing to explain, but the sounds are all very familiar, but in some cases, hard to place exactly how they're different from what we expect.I have one complaint about the movie, and that's in the pacing of the script. The amount of time spent focusing on Eleanor's internal dialogue is effective, but it makes the film feel dated. Some trimming to these sequences might tighten things up a little.I would love to have an opportunity to see this movie in a theater, either with an audience, or alone. The movie relies on the viewer feeling immersed in the house.I highly recommend this movie to pretty much anyone. The G rating is misleading though - it's really spooky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of psychological horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the classic 1959 novel "The Haunting Of Hill House" by renowned author Shirley Jackson, and starring Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson, Russ Tamblyn, masterfully directed by Robert Wise, the original 1963 version of "The Haunting" (don't bother with the hideous 1999 remake) is a true masterpiece of psychological horror.Dr. John Markway (Johnson) is a psychic researcher who invites a group of people with paranormal experience to help him investigate Hill House - an imposing 90 year-old estate which "had stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more", feared by the locals because of its lurid and violent history that began with its original owner, Hugh Crain.Only two of the invitees show up: the emotionally fragile and introverted Eleanor Vance (Harris); and Theo (Bloom, sporting a wardrobe by edgy '60s designer Mary Quant), stylish, outspoken, beautiful, and sexually ambiguous - in direct contrast to the meek Eleanor. Russ Sanderson (Tamblyn) is the skeptical young relative who stands to inherit Hill House, and he tags along to "protect (his) investment." Early on in the film there is some humor from the group's interactions with the crabby caretaker and his wife, Mrs. Dudley ("No one lives any nearer than town. No one will come any nearer than that. In the night. In the dark."), a creepy, skull-faced woman. After that brief injection of humor (which does of course warn the audience of events to come), the film gets down to business: ghostly voices, a superbly mood-setting soundtrack, stark lighting, off-kilter camera angles and subtle insinuations all meld seamlessly with the skillful casting and direction to create some of the most chilling moments in psychological horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological horror at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Haunting is no doubt a classic ghost story movie based on Shirley Jackson's novel The Haunting Of Hill House (1959). The movie is what is basically called "psychological horror," which means that it is horror that is created more in the mind rather than visually. In other words, the feeling of being scared of things you can't see. There is no blood and gore whatsoever in this movie. Instead, invisible ghosts and a mansion that seems like it's alive provide the scares. The brilliant use of lighting and shadows also help create the haunting atmosphere. Even though color movie technology had already been around for quite some time, this movie was deliberately filmed in black and white, because director Robert Wise felt that black and white would make it darker and more eerie. He was so right. Black and white works perfectly for this film.The story is about four paranormal investigators (Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson, and Russ Tamblyn) who go to a 90 year old New England house known as Hill House to study the supernatural happenings inside the house. What happens next is haunting phenomena that will scare you. This house is a huge mansion furnished with expensive, quality items, even though nobody lives there. The mansion is very plush and regal with lots of antiques.Inside the mansion, strange and bizarre things happen. The house at certain times seems like it's alive, like it's breathing. The house actually starts to self-destruct near the end of the movie. This is the way a haunted house movie should be portrayed, in my opinion. It's what you can't see that is so frightening, rather than seeing an actual ghost or person on the screen. Rather than blood and monsters, there's knocks, bangs, and pounding noises. I love some of the camera angles used in the movie. I also like when the house is shown from the outside many times during the movie, with the camera pointed up toward the sky. It's meant to show that Hill House is staring at you. That is cool.The acting is very good. Julie Harris plays Eleanor Lance, a rather unique character who has been repressed in her adult life. She whines a lot, but that is her character. The striking Claire Bloom plays Theodora or "Theo," a character who is a psychic and displays confidence and skepticism at times and fear at other times. Eleanor and Theo supposedly are lesbians in this movie. It is implied in a very subtle way. Richard Johnson plays the always curious paranormal investigator Dr. John Markway. Russ Tamblyn plays the skeptical Luke Sanderson who is supposed to inherit the house one day. He provides a little comic relief. Fay Compton plays the role of Mrs. Sanderson. Lois Maxwell plays Grace Markway, the wife of John Markway, and a non-believer in the supernatural. Valentine Dyall plays the caretaker of Hill House, Mr. Dudley. My favorite character in the whole movie is the housekeeper Mrs. Dudley, played by Rosalie Crutchley. She doesn't live in the house all the time. She and her husband live miles away in town. Her character is so dark and mysterious. Even though she plays only a very small role, she delivers the best lines in the movie in my opinion when she says, "...in the night...in the dark".If you're a thinking person who has an imagination and doesn't need to be VISUALLY entertained at all times to avoid boredom, then this movie will provide psychological horror at its finest. On the other hand, if you're somebody who needs to be VISUALLY entertained at all times (such as needing to SEE the actual ghosts on screen in CGI form), then watch the 1999 remake, which, according to the vast majority of the public, is sub par and falls way short of the original on all levels.Remember, in the original 1963 movie, it's what you don't see that is so scary.This movie's musical score by Humphrey Searle is one of the most underrated and forgotten in horror movie history. It's outstanding, and really fits the haunting atmosphere. It's too bad it's not available for sale. I rank it as either my favorite or second favorite horror movie score ever (John Carpenter's Halloween being the other contender).This movie is always compared to The Innocents (1961) by horror fans and critics. Why? It's because both films were released around the same time (1961 and 1963), both are black and white films, both are ghost stories set in haunted Victorian mansions, both are based on novels, both are extremely creepy, and both have innovative camera-work. I often have a hard time deciding which of these two films is better. Of course, the authors whose books these movies are based on (Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting Of Hill House" and Henry James's "The Turn Of The Screw") wrote stories that are night and day different. The movies, however, will always be compared due to the above reasons and simply because it comes down to what a person looks for and prefers in a haunted house ghost story movie. When it comes to comparing haunted house movies, I personally put the movie's atmosphere first and the story second. The next person might do the opposite.If you want to see a really good supernatural haunted house thriller, then I highly recommend watching The Haunting in the night............in the dark. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm rating this purely on a horror movie scale. As far as pacing, buildup and suspense and just outright creepiness not to mention dignity in characters and acting. This is about as good as horror can get and I have seen damn near all of them.Out of 3 girlfriends and my mother I have attempted to watch it with over the last 3 years only one was even able to make it past the first night in Hill House let alone finish the actual movie. It's smart with a couple very funny moments and it doesn't show you what's so terrifying because what is there to show? The house was just born bad.And not one drop of blood to be seen in the whole movie. It makes modern horror look utterly laughable for the most part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two complaints about a genuine classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Markway is undertaking research to prove the existence of ghosts and decides to investigate Hill House. He is accompanied by a sceptic, a clairvoyant and an insecure attuned psychic. Even though made in 1963 it is still very enjoyable even if a product of its time.Nelson Gidding screenplay is based on novel "The Haunting of Hill House" by Shirley Jackson. The Haunting is an archetype haunted mansion film, superbly directed by Robert Wise. Excellent, painstakingly designed sets, amazing use of sound effects bringing to life the things that go bump in the night, which all add to the eerie and spooky atmosphere.Richard Johnson plays the perfect English gentleman, Dr. John Markway. Russ Tamblyn as the cheeky chap is amusing, Claire Bloom as 'Theo' the lesbian, at the time a risky role for mainstream cinema. The supporting cast of quirky characters are all fantastic.My only complaints are is that the movie, for effect only, was unnecessary filmed in black and white. In addition, Julie Harris'superfluous voice-overs are distracting.It's exceedingly atmospheric, foreboding, creepy and while the scares and terror are not as frightening to today's audience, it remains a classic, psychological, genuine and suspenseful horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slightly underwhelmed, though there are certainly worse (like, for example, the remake)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked most of The Haunting, Robert Wise's adaptation of the novel (and make no mistke folks, it does *feel* like an adaptation despite its debt to other haunted house pictures), as it's about as competently produced, and with some acting that turns up the intensity level in several spots quite well. I even liked the cinematography very much in certain scenes, as Wise and his team made the house come into the realm of the surreal and the unconscious in some instances (and one is hard-pressed not to at least flinch, if not jump, when Julie Harris gets up the staircase and finds a surprise behind a place she least expected). But, even as it attempts to be- as one friend rightfully argued to me- like a two-hour Twilight Zone episode, it's weighed down in exposition and narration. Where it works in a twenty-minute episode, the novel-form doesn't translate for a film like this. Do we really need to hear EVERYTHING in Harris's head? It works in little pieces, but it's laid in over and over, already with hefty scenes of conversations that, while usually not poorly written (save for Russ Tamblyn's thankless part of having to often say to the effect of 'you can't really think it's really haunted, do you?') A story like this requires just simply mood and drive to tell it. Maybe I lost something on the arc of the central character, played reasonably well (she's not terrible is what I mean) by Harris as someone with no real home and a future that seems to last in the house, but her character perhaps would keep up the intensity if one weren't constantly informed of her every thought about being in the house moment to moment. It detracts slightly from some good scenes that are there with the other actors, like Richard Johnson, Clair Bloom and Tamblyn, who all have only so much depth anyway. Still, there is a good deal to watch for if you love your classic horror films, specifically of this ilk: the house itself is quite a marvel of construction by way of its ragged edges, imposing height and curves and structure, it is something excellent to see in full widescreen. And it was fun seeing the special effects team go to work full-tilt; one can even see in a door scene the seeds for something far more disturbing done in Videodrome. There's even a laugh or two.The Haunting is good viewing for a matinée or even for something to show the kids- if they're so inclined to check out slightly-higher-than-B-movie suspense films of the 60s, and of course it makes the Jan de Bont 1999 remake look like the pile of slack crap that it is. One of the best of it's kind though? I don't think so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This ought to make your hair stand on end and there's not a special effect or a drop of blood in a cartload.Julie Harris is Nell, a complete wimp of a woman, who spends a couple of days and nights with three other folks in a supposedly haunted house. The others are Dr. Markway (Johnson), and anthropologist with an interest in psychic phenomena, Theo (Bloom), a lesbian with ESP, and Luke (Tamblyn), the heir apparent of Hill House who is there to provide comic relief.Nell doesn't have much going for her at home. She practically has to steal her own car. She's spent eleven years taking care of her invalid mother and feels responsible for her death. She doesn't drink or smoke. She doesn't do anything. For the first time in her life she feels part of a community and loves Hill House even though it scares the hell out of her at night, what with wall poundings and automatic harps and whatnot.Robert Wise does a fine job as director. He makes good use of every unsettling knob of mahogany furniture in the place. A door knob with one of those sunny faces embossed on it takes on ominous qualities.Shirley Jackson, on whose novel this was based, was a true screwball herself but a great writer within the limits of the genre. Her approach was similar to Alfred Hitchcock's. You take some ordinary person and put him or her in a situation that rapidly escalates into the extraordinary. The novel in fact is probably better in some ways than this movie. There's an occasional narrative, and it's Nell's. Of all the characters in the film, Nell is the one we'd least like to be, and not just because of her destiny. She never has any FUN! And the screenplay leaves out a few details that make the story more interesting. The handwriting on the wall incident, for example. In the novel it leaves behind a sulfuric stink.Oh, and that's another thing. In the movie, they read the inscription, taste the substance with which it was written, and leave Luke to erase it. No photos. No samples. No nothing. What kind of anthropologist does Markway call himself? Okay, okay. You expect rough edges in any case study, but Markway doesn't do ANYTHING. He doesn't even have a tape recorder. I happen to be an anthropologist with an interest in anomalous phenomena too, having once pursued ghosts through a graveyard in a culture where a ghost was something to be contended with. And I always had a tape recorder. My question is: Who is funding Markway? The standards for grants must be much more lax than they are at my sources.Well, that's a problem with Markway, not the movie. The movie is pretty good, especially in comparison to the recent remake. The remake looks like it was designed to be nothing more than a CGI extravaganza with a kind of boring story holding the phony images together. In the remake you can see the statues almost doing a tarantella. In this one, the original, you see nothing, and the film is the spookier for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As older films tend to do, full use is made of the widescreen cinema format making for very effective cinema. Some of the camera moves and set pieces are just like a modern day film, making the atmosphere very chilling, it seems this is the only real visual effect used. The only other obvious signs of evil are slamming doors and shadows, oh and of course the "throbbing" door! The rest of the fear is drawn from characters faces and reactions. All this proves very effective, yet the acting remains hammy from the leads and the, at times out of place "thinking out loud" tricks. The two supporting actors are much more interesting than the leads and the hidden affection between Theo and Nelle is brilliantly underplayed. Impressive for an old film, despite the wooden leads.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not common for me to watch movies as old as this one, but after reading lots of good reviews of this one, I innocently thought I would enjoy it. Oh boy, I was wrong. The beginning is much like the 1999's version-- except for the family introducing thing--, but maybe a little creeper. That being said, I believed "The Haunting" would have lots of tense or scary moments. I was wrong again. I watched it until around 70 minutes and NOTHING happened till there! The only thing this movie had was a bunch of jibber-jabber and paranoid feelings from the main female character, who also was annoying. I also didn't love 1959's "House on Haunted Hill", but after seeing this picture, I can say that one is actually GREAT. In conclusion, "The Haunting" is a big deception for me. If you're looking for decent horror classics, I honestly suggest you something like "Psycho", "Rosemary's Baby", "Alien" or 1974's "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many things in this paranormal psychological presentation to admire, but it can be bit stilted and stodgy for some viewers, especially when looked at today. The dialog wavers from insightful to insignificant. The investigator anthropologist is stiff and uninteresting and is the nuclei and is simply over matched by the the neurotic heroine and the forceful lesbian ("a mistake of nature...like you" says Eleanor).The best things are the piercing sets and sharp camera-work and the excellent performance by Julie Harris. While the worst things are the insistent reflective homage (to Val Lewton's "unseen" horrors) and an intrusive rich boy who is just shallow and without anything to do accept stop the scariness.This is one of those movies that has to be seen with a time transformation. Not all older Classic films require this type of time-shifting but Horror movies require this more often than not. It is not a great film but an effective genre piece if one is able to make the suspension and place it in a context without modern clichés and a numbing expectation for much more when here there is much less.</fullReview>

More interesting is Bloom as a hottie lesbian who likes to cuddle up with Harris. Johnson is fine as a professor, but Tamblyn seems out of place here. Wise, who made such fine thrillers as "The Body Snatcher" and "The House on Telegraph Hill," can't overcome a talky script that is more likely to bore than scare one to death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'It's staring at me. Vile, vile. Get away from here. Get away at once. It's my chance. I'm being given a last chance. I could turn my car around and go away from here and no one would blame me. Anyone has a right to run away. But you are running away, Eleanor. And there's nowhere else to go.' That's supposed to be subtle, is it? How 'The Haunting' got a reputation for being an understated horror movie when it's chock full of obvious, over-baked dialogue like that laughable example is something of a mystery to me. I haven't read the book this is based on, but it seems as though the makers of this movie had no idea how to transfer it to the screen with atmosphere and suggestion, so instead they have the characters explain abso-bloody-lutely everything to make up for it.It all starts when Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson) invites a disparate group of people ? nervous Nell (Julie Harris), sexy Theo (Claire Bloom) and swingin' hep cat Luke (Russ Tamblyn) - to a house with a reputation for evil. He wants to find out if the house's creepy past has any basis in fact, and he and his new pals lock themselves in ? only to find that there may indeed be spirits still lurking about. The main focus of the story is Nell, who wants to escape her old life and thinks this may be the way to do it, although the main focus for me was the counter on my DVD player, which I looked at once every ten seconds or so, willing the film to be over. Despite the critical tongue-lashing regularly dished out to this boring movie, the average episode of 'Scooby Doo' has more interesting ambiguity over whether we're seeing a real ghost or not.Ooh, say the film's fans, look the way 'The Haunting' manages to suggest everything, to merely hint at horror without relying on effects and loads of ghosts. Er, what? The last thing this over-the-top loudmouth of a movie does is hint at anything. There may not be much in the way of visual hammering but we are, however, treated to a hundred minutes or so of maddeningly patronising dialogue that packs itself into every last nook and cranny, plus an abundance of repetitious voice-over letting us in on Nell's inner thoughts. From the moment she steps out of her car we're bombarded by blunt moaning that kills every last second of suspense and build-up. Ooh, this house is evil, it's out to get me, it wants me! The movie leaves nothing unsaid.The remake came in for a lot of flak for being blunt and flashy and relying on visual effects, and fair enough ? it was utter, utter rubbish. But while this version might not overdose on dodgy visuals ? apart from the remarkably scary rubber door ? it's not one iota less incompetent at letting the horror breathe, instead preferring to bring up Nell's theme music every time something 'spooky' happens, followed by another stodgy chunk of narration to help us understand what's going on. The only vaguely subtle moments come from the relationship between Nell and Theo, which isn't interesting but does at least give you a quiet moment in between the endless chatter, feverish music and banging noises to wipe the blood from your ears.Aside from Julie Harris's over-twitchy performance, none of the actors bother to invest much feeling in their characters, opting instead to monotonously drone out the stone-cold dialogue as if they were talking into a dictaphone. Robert Wise must have thought, 'Blimey, these actors are a bit crap. I'd better completely overdo the direction in the hope that no one will notice,' perfectly complementing the concrete block of a script and Nell endlessly banging on the whole time. God, it absolutely did my head in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Haunting starts with anthropology university professor Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) gaining permission to investigate the notorious Hill House from it's current owner Mrs. Sanderson (Fay Compton), a supposedly haunted property. He assembles a team of assistant's, Eleanor 'Nell' Lance (Julie Harris) who had paranormal experiences as a child, clairvoyant Theodora (Claire Bloom) &amp; the house's cynical heir Luke (Russ Tamblyn). They all meet up at the large foreboding Hill House &amp; quickly settle down to work, as time passes it becomes very apparent that Hill House is indeed haunted by an unseen presence...Produced &amp; directed by Robert Wise I have to go against 'popular' opinion here &amp; say that I think The Haunting is far from the classic that many here seen to make it out to be. The script by Nelson Gidding was based on the novel 'The Haunting of Hill House' by Shirley Jackson &amp; I thought it was pretty dull, it's too long &amp; rather slow. Then there's the character's, I have to say that I absolutely loathed Nell as a character &amp; she annoyed me immensely &amp; I just couldn't feel anything for her at all. Then there's Theodora &amp; Luke who are given virtually no screen time compared to Nell, in comparison they are very underdeveloped &amp; as a result I felt very little for them as well. Many people like the fact that all the horror in The Haunting is suggested, it's all built up &amp; left to the imagination, this is fine if you like this sort of technique but I just thought sitting through this film felt like a lot of effort for not much reward. Having said that it's still a good film, it does what it sets out to do perfectly well, it's well written, it ticks all the right boxes &amp; it has a few decent scenes but overall I have to say I was disappointed by it, ironically probably because of all the overwhelmingly positive comments I've read about it it ended up being a disappointment.Director Wise does a good job here, this is where The Haunting excels. The crisp black and white photography works perfectly to create some very atmospheric scenes, the Hill House sets are also very evocative &amp; create a nice sense of dread. However, the pace of the film drags &amp; it starts to become a chore to watch it.Wih a supposed budget of about $1,400,000 The Haunting obviously had a fair amount of time &amp; effort spent on it's look &amp; feel &amp; in this respect it's very good, unfortunately the acting &amp; character's don't help the film.The Haunting is a good film to be sure, to be fair I think it's a film of it's age &amp; those who like these slow moving films will have a ball while other's may want to stock up on coffee to get through it. Overall I'd say I was very disappointed but I can certainly see some merit in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sooooo dated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe this was something to behold back in 1963. In today's terms this is a terrible film. Its simply not scary. There are maybe one or two moderately creepy moments. The main character is histrionic, selfish and self obsessed. You kinda wish someone would slap her. Her voice is shrill and hard to bear. The main male lead seems to have an answer for everything and is unruffled by anything. The exact opposite. Hes is almost as annoying. This film looks and acts like it could have been made in the forties so dated it appears. There is no actual recognisable entity in the film. Just a lot of loud noises. I was thoroughly bored. I really don't understand how this film has an overall score of 7/10. Emperor's new clothes syndrome perhaps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Julie Harris whimpers and cries her way through "The Haunting"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one horror story by Shirley Jackson that had a lot of potential for film...and with Robert Wise at the helm, it's a pity it's spoiled by several unpleasant ingredients.One of those ingredients is JULIE HARRIS, who is a woman with demons in her past who can't rid herself of them no matter how hard others try to help her. Another is the lesbian theme that occurs midway. And finally, the whole story is done in a very understated way which leaves a lot up to the imagination of the viewer. This worked for films like THE UNINVITED and THE INNOCENTS, but here it just falls flat as a pancake. The horror is dissolved by an irritating central performance from Miss Harris, usually such a fine actress.CLAIRE BLOOM, RICHARD JOHNSON and RUSS TAMBLYN are part of a team sent to investigate the supernatural happenings at Hill House. The horror inherent in such a tale never quite gets as gripping as it should despite Wise's direction and some fairly good performances.Far more substantial, and equally understated in the horror department, are films like those mentioned above. This one leaves me cold and is much overrated by horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An elegantly mounted haunted house movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Haunting" is based on Shirley Jackson's now-classic horror novel "The Haunting of Hill House". In the movie, a researcher into the paranormal invites a trio of individuals to join him at the supposedly haunted Hill House in the hopes of proving the existence of ghosts. As anticipated, unexplained phenomena begin to occur but those involved begin to feel that they may have gotten more than they bargained for.Producer/director Robert Wise didn't cheapen his film with hackneyed tricks of the horror trade. The film utilizes a 'less is more' approach that does wonders in sustaining the suspense for the entire duration of the film. The style is reminiscent of Wise's old boss Val Lewton and the direction seems to show Orson Welles's influence (whom Wise also worked with, as editor).The cast assembled by Wise was up to the challenge placed before them. Julie Harris had the most demanding role and she excelled, turning in a commendable performance. Richard Johnson &amp; Claire Bloom are also worth singling out though, in truth, the acting is well done all around.Wise's direction is expertly handled while both the cinematography &amp; score contribute greatly to the atmosphere. It's definitely a fine presentation for a film that garnered no awards attention besides a Golden Globe nomination for Wise.Ultimately, those who hold this up as one of the best examples of supernatural horror in film apparently have a point. Rarely do we see genre films done with this kind of consideration and verve. As a final note, avoid the 1999 big-budget remake, which is a far cry from the original in terms of quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eleanor Sees Dead People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nervous Julie Harris (as Eleanor "Nell" Lance) arrives to help investigate a reportedly haunted old dark house; since she supposedly, as a child, was able to see ghosts. Also arriving are clairvoyant Claire Bloom (as "Theo" Theodora), and the mansion's skeptical heir, Russ Tamblyn (as Luke Sanderson). The three houseguests are led by anthropologist/parapsychologist Richard Johnson (as John Markway). Mr. Johnson believes "Hill House" may definitively prove the existence of supernatural entities.Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House" is similar to Henry James' "Turn of the Screw". Both are excellent psychological stories, involving the questionable participation of ghosts. This film adaptation is not as successful as 1961's "The Innocents" (the cinematic version of "The Screw"). Possibly, this is due to the faithful rendering of Jackson's guilt-ridden protagonist being in "possession" of "ghosts" as a part of her psyche. "Eleanor" makes things up.So, you never see on-screen apparitions in Wise's "Haunting". In James' "Screw", the ghosts seem more real; their presence, in both works, is debated. "The Haunting" has a grand, eerie "look", thanks to angling director Robert Wise, and Gothic photography by Davis Boulton. Ms. Bloom's subtly homosexual performance is another highlight. But, in the end, it's a long, underdeveloped, and relatively spook-free melodrama.****** The Haunting (9/18/63) Robert Wise ~ Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Russ Tamblyn, Richard Johnson</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is living proof that a black and white film from the 60's can be as good as color, special effects intensive films of today. Director Robert Wise proves that ingredients like mood, lighting, haunting music and suggestion can be as effective as gore or special effects. The 1999 remake took the special effects approach and it cannot compare to this film.If you are looking for a creepy and chilling horror film then this is one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply, the greatest film on the supernatural ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what I refer to as a "perfect movie," regardless of the genre. The casting, the story, the script, the direction, the production -- all first rate, truly inspired. Having a director with the experience and depth of Robert Wise was a coup in of itself, combined with the incredible cinematography and set decoration making this horror classic even creepier. But far and away the most intriguing aspect of this film is that, AT NO TIME IS A GHOST EVER SEEN, wherein lying the brilliance of this master filmmaker. Using sound effects and interesting camera angles alone, Wise managed to create a masterpiece of lasting power and impact. Wise's "wise" decision to shoot the entire opus in black-and-white was even more enlightened, creating yet another dimension in dark drama and stark contrast. When I first saw this film at the theater, I remember the entire audience screaming its lungs out at the scary moments, more terrified than at any other film in my memory, yet there was no horrible monster or creature seen the entire time, the fear was totally psychological in nature. In 1999, "The Haunting" was remade, to the utter shame of its producers, this CGI enhanced piece of cinematic junk as utterly forgettable as the original was memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, It Ain't!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic plot: A group of people reputed to be sensitive to the world of the supernatural are invited to stay at a haunted mansion for a study being conducted by a Dr. Markway.I watched The Haunting for the first time today, after reading Maltin's review of it in which he warns the viewer: "Don't see this one alone!" WHY NOT? I simply can't understand why ANYbody would find this movie scary, unnerving or chilling. It has an excellent cast, gorgeous sets, beautiful cinematography and interesting camera shots, but....it ain't scary! As another comment said, 'You keep waiting for something to happen....but nothing does'. Basically, we're treated to the spectacle of a bunch of dissimilar people holed up in a "haunted" house together, bickering among themselves and listening in terror to loud noises, the sources of which are never determined. Julie Harris is a pitiable but annoying neurotic who feels responsible for her ailing mother's death. The beauteous but enigmatic Claire Bloom slinks around the house making cryptic comments to and about the Julie Harris character. Then there's Russ Tamblyn, the owner of the place, who whiles away the hours in the haunted mansion by swigging liquor straight out of the bottle and making wisecracks about the possible financial advantages of owning a haunted house. I am definitely not a fan of slasher movies or gore-fests, but I do love atmospheric horror movies that keep you on the edge of your seat. Two that come to mind are "Salem's Lot" (the 1979 TV version, not the poorly-edited theatrical release) and "Rosemary's Baby". Also "The Omen", although it does have too much blood to suit me. "The Haunting" has little or no suspense. **Spoiler ahead** And when Lois Maxwell turned up at the end of the movie looking like she'd been through the mill, I burst out laughing. She explains that her earlier sudden and ghastly appearance at the door of the attic was because she was "lost" in the house, but poor demented Julie Harris didn't give her a chance to explain. So what's she doing wandering around outside in the middle of the night? All she had to do was go back up to the house, ring the doorbell and say, Hey, I got lost.The trouble with "The Haunting" is that it's too well-made to qualify as a laugh-fest, and too bland to be scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuinely scary movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so very effective and just overall excellent due to its minimalism. Little is explained, little is ever shown and the story also isn't the most complex written one. Out of all the horror movies I've seen I can honestly say that this is one of the genuinely scary ones. It still is the best 'haunted house' movie ever made.It's a movie that puts its emphasis more on its atmosphere than anything else really. The movie knows to create an uneasy atmosphere with its slow but steady build up. It really knows to pick its moments to put in a scary moment. But even then the movie shows very little. It's a movie filled with scary sounds, which adds to the mystery and tension of the movie.It's really a movie that works out due to its talents behind the camera's. I was surprised by the movie its camera-handling and fast editing work at times. They did a really great job with this and it really helped the movie to work out with its moments. It's a technically really well made movie, that of course also is being helped by the fact that it was shot in black &amp; white. It gives the movie a more eerie and unpleasant atmosphere. It also really helps to bring the house to life, from both the outside as well as the inside.Horror wasn't really the most glamorous genre to work in during the '60's but just like Robert Wise did with "The Day the Earth Stood Still" he takes a genre to a totally different and far classier level, when compared to other genre movies from the same time period. This is what I always mostly admire about Robert Wise. He takes on a genre with his own touch and vision, with as a result an unique, as well as highly effective movie.The movie has some really effective genre moments, that will shock and will leave you with an unpleasant feeling afterward, without ever having to feature any blood or gore or anything of that sort. One moment especially really caught me off guard and in my book is one of the most scary shock moments in movie history. It's more of a slow and subtle version, that might not be for everyone but for those who are able to sit through a more of a slow and old fashioned genre movie, the movie will be a real rewarding one.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This picture gets off to a fine start with three consecutive scenes depicting the history of Hill House.It then focuses on the Julie Harris character delving into her character's tragic background;the circumstances are somewhat questionable.However two good things come of this.Her character is drawn toward the house instead of away from it.Also, the dramatic end to the picture is a notable aspect of the picture.Along the way the film becomes talky,although the talk is about the paranormal.The talk takes away from the amount of chills;there aren't as many as I expected.This picture is at least as good as some of the other oldies,like "The Uninvited" but maybe falls short of "The Innocents."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers). I'm going to try not to repeat in detail what the other reviews have said. This movie scared the crap out of me when I first saw it age 12. All the horror movies I had seen up to that point were of the Saturday afternoon schlock variety, and were easily dismissable; this was my first somewhat "adult" horror movie, and it left a lasting impression.Because of that impression, it's hard for me to put myself in the place of a first-time adult viewer. It's certainly somewhat dated in it's dialogue and it's themes (except that it may have been the very first major studio movie to have lesbianism as an explicit element in its plot); certainly the the idea of a serious exploration of the supernatural was much fresher in 1963 than it is now. This takes a lot of the punch out of the subtheme of the young skeptic Luke coming to accept the possibility of the supernatural. That simply does not resonate now as it must have in 1963. I'm willing to bet that for many moviegoers in 1963, this movie introduced them to the terms ESP, poltergiest, and psychokinesis. I want to comment on the influence of the movie on popular horror. It is well-known that it was a major early influence on Stephen King. He paid homage to it in the book *Carrie* by recapitulating the stones-falling-on-house episode in Eleanor's past, transferring it to Carrie and her mother. More importantly, *The Haunting* was quite obviously the inspiration, even, I would say, a "template", for *The Shining*, just as King mined *The Monkey's Paw* for *Pet Sematary* (let's face it, King is nothing more than a very gifted reprocessor of classic horror tales). *The Shining* is pretty much *The Haunting* with blood and with the main character's madness turned outward, rather than inward. Other influences, besides the later rip-offs and the hideous remake, obviously include *The Exorcist* and *Poltergeist*. The real strength of the film, and it's real contribution to modern horror, IMO, is it's uncanny ability to depict the *numinous*, that is the peculiarly unfleshly, otherworldly, aspect of the supernatural. Although quite rightly left unstated in the movie, by the end we have the sense that what probably haunts Hill House is not so much a collection of individual ghosts, as it is some sort of unimaginable dark spiritual *force* or entity, built up out of the accumulated tragedy and "bad karma", if you will, of the house. I think the central horror is summed up in Luke's line toward the end when the whole group is bottled up in the parlor, and he tries to prevent the doctor from opening the door, saying, "I don't know what that is out there, and I don't want to find out." We, in the audience, both want to know, and we don't want to know. We have the sense that whatever it is, it's more horrible and unsettling than whatever we can imagine it to be. It's that idea, along with the horror of Eleanor's self-destruction and absorption into the house, that give the film it's power.Aiding this, of course, is the impeccable location chosen for "Hill House" (Ettington Manor, in the Cotswolds, England, in answer to a previous poster), the pioneering sound effects, the fantastic cinematography, and the evocative music score. A drawback is the sometimes quaint and heavy-handed dialogue (I *hate* it that Dr. Markway at the end is made to say, "Hill House *is* haunted!"; we'd like to come to that conclusion ourselves, thank you). 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>watershed moment in terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen comments here that decry this movie as not being very frightening; if I saw it for the first time anytime since the 80's I'd have to agree, there's not much there. But the first time I saw it I was 8 years old in 1968 and it frightened me for years. This happened because Robert Wise pushed a lot of envelopes making this movie.Of course there were horror movies before this, Psycho preceded this as did a number of Hitchcock's works. There had been fify years of ghosts and monsters, twenty years of aliens and radioactive creatures, and plenty of film history and ground breaking fear. It was different than other movies, though, in that it based its impact only on the interaction of the characters with themselves and their environment. This was the Blair Witch Project of the 60's and pulled the genre away from the tentacles of monsters/science-gone-awry/Gothic melodrama that horror had been rutted into. Shirley Jackson, the original author, has a great deal of credit to claim here as well; her work is generally horrific, but in a slow building way rather than a jump up and grab you way. Spoiler ahead...Another point to this movie is that the ending was definitely: a) horrible, and b) final. There was no glimmer of hope, the protagonists specifically lost, one her life. Again, this had been done before, but in the context of "the monsters got 'em" or general ambiguity, where audiences knew the ending was not happy, but there was a chance for a righteous outcome. Not so here.I saw The Haunting again in the eighties after not watching it for twenty years. At that time I did find myself asking what the big deal was, after I'd seen scary damn movies like Alien, Jaws, Omen, The Exorcist, The Other, etc. For 1963, though, this was at the forefront of nightmare inducing, creepy-crawling motion picture terror, and deserves both to be respected for that and enjoyed in that light.As I was typing this a commercial for White Noise aired on TV. If you can't draw a mental line from this movie directly to The Haunting, you're not trying or haven't seen enough movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the remake, if that's saying anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well first off I want to say that I really wanted to enjoy this movie but I have to say that it was very disappointing.When viewing this film it is important to remember its age, and with that in mind only really the audio suffers. I found myself confused by what the director was trying to get across at times with the different sounds from inside the house. This is simply a technical problem in my eyes as the characters would fill in the gaps where I was unsure, but the fact that the sounds, the driving force behind the suspense and horror, had a very hazy role was upsetting. This problem alone however is off set by good acting, good camera work and a great setting (all relative for the time).What this movie does suffer from however is a feeling of emptiness and missed opportunity. The history of the house, the haunting itself, and the role of the characters is never flushed out very well. In fact it becomes evident that this glaring omission was heavily focused on for the remake years later (which fails in and of itself for a number of reasons). This problem leads to the characters not being important at all to the viewer and more of an annoyance than anything else. No amount of good acting can save a character that is never explained.As for the suspense of the film there simply isn't enough to sustain the length of the film and there is just simply nothing to be frightened of. The movie never shows you the "ghosts" which is fine, however it does a poor job of giving you anything to be really scared of in any fashion. To relate back to what I said above about the sound quality, this is the biggest selling point for the film (which is a missed opportunity) and then there is little else.It's very sad to watch this movie and to know that it was limited by the era in which it was produced. There is much potential in it and one can understand how a remake SHOULD have been able to produce one of the most frightening movies in recent memory. I give this movie a very average rating because it really doesn't do anything very well yet at the same time has a good foundation. Perhaps a different director or cast could have brought the film to life better but what we are left with is only a shell of what should be a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard for so long that The Haunting was one of the scariest movies ever made and it didn't live up. That is the main reason for my disappointment. The Haunting was, sadly, a very dull movie and I found that I didn't like any of the characters. If I don't love or love to hate characters in a movie, then that movie falls apart for me, whether it be the smartest haunted house movie or the dumbest slasher flick. Characters must move me one way or the other and none in this film did. I also have to point out that nothing ever happened. They keep telling us that the house is evil, that it was born bad. They keep telling us and telling us but they never show us. I respect the less is more concept and think that sometimes it works masterfully (The Blair Witch Project). But here I think maybe too much is left to the imagination. Then again, we saw things happen in the remake and that movie was bad with a capital "B." On the plus side, Robert Wise' direction is absolutely flawless. Those awesome camera movements must have heavily influenced Sam Raimi when shooting Evil Dead 2. So regardless of whether I liked it or not, it is one of those seminal horror classics that is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe me, I WANTED to like this movie. I heard how good it was, so I rented it, turned down the lights, and...I didn't like it. Why? Mostly because of the following:(1) Annoying characters. The Eleanor was so whiny, so blubbering, that she soon turned from sympathetic to deserving of a shot to the head! Theodora snotty attitude and guessing all the time what people were thinking and feeling got on my nerves as well. The male characters were just bland.(2) Not scary! Yeah, I know this was supposed to really be a psychological kind of horror (which did work reasonably well in "The Legend Of Hell House"), but that angle didn't scare me the least bit in this movie. All the horror here is just doorknobs turning and strange noises. Ooooh, I'm SO SCARED! (Sarcasm)....(3) ...which leads to the last reason: For the most part, NOTHING happens. Nothing of real consequence, or changing the plot anyway. Early on, I had the feeling that the characters would never be in any danger. Well, that's how it played out. When they stepped into a new room, I'd think, "Nothing will harm them here." and I was right. Look, I don't need to have a mad slasher leaping forward and stabbing a knife close to the camera to scare me, but I just wasn't scared by what was happening here. It COULD have been scary, but it just wasn't directed in a scary manner. If any new posters can explain in their review why exactly they think it's scary, I'd be interested in reading what they have to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually I'm not one who likes movies which are more about atmosphere than story. I think "The Haunting" is somewhere in between. The story looks pretty basic about a professor who wants to find evidence of supernatural and this in the spooky mansion Hill House where over the years some people died through accidents and suicide. We see this movie mostly through the eyes of Eleanor, a young woman living in with her sister's family desperately seeking for her own place. She is delighted that she is asked by professor Markway to join him in his quest. The other 2 paranormal investigators are Theodora and the legal heir of the mansion young guy Luke. No this movie doesn't have the sudden ghost faces that we see in today's horror. The horror is here created by noises and the visuals. And also the black/white cinematography as well as the mansion itself enable to create the creepy atmosphere it needs. I especially liked how we get to feel Eleanor's emotions through the voice in her head. She is terrified of the house yet also experiencing a strange attraction tot it. I think together with "The Innocents" one of the best haunted house movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely terrifying but with the worst heroine ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I make a start on this review, I'd like to put a few things into perspective. I am a 22 year old Film Studies graduate who has seen more than his fair share of horror movies. I remember seeing Psycho at a young age and not batting an eyelid, I have sat through The Omen, The Blair Witch Project, Halloween and all sorts of movies designed to unsettle and leave the viewer sleepless for days yet never had any trouble at all. Movies just don't scare me...except this one.I sat down to watch this with my girlfriend late one night and she promptly fell asleep, leaving me nigh on alone in a darkened room where I was drawn completely into the movie. I have not seen any horror atmosphere crafted so expertly as it was here: there is no blood or violence to speak of and bar one juddering warped door, no special effects. All that director Robert Wise has at his disposal is a very talented cast, an enthralling script and an expert lighting team and with them, he creates dread unlike any seen on film.The house of course is the real star and is treated almost like a character in its own right. Alone atop a hill and with a rusty iron gate guarding it, the featureless towers and Gothic architecture make for a suffocating presence. Simply put, the location scouts deserved a bonus for finding this beauty to set the movie in. You can easily imagine the restless spirits that haunt the corridors and keep the cast awake at night.The only gripe I have with this movie though is with the choice of the lead role. Not that Julie Harris isn't a talented actress because she is, it's just that her character Eleanor is the most irritating female lead I think I've ever seen. Sure, her arrival at Hill House takes place just after her mother has died, but did she have to be such a pathetic wuss? She's so much of a pansy she starts having panic attacks after barely setting foot inside the building and is forever whimpering and bursting into tears. Throughout the course of the movie, she seems to be tilting on the edge of a nervous breakdown and yet refuses to leave the house because she's "happy." That minor complaint aside however, this is still the most engrossing horror film I've ever seen. I've never been able to comprehend how a movie could scare someone before but having seen this film, I now understand fully. And considering it's over forty years old, that's a hell of an achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The House That Was Born Bad ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering myself as a relatively experienced horror buff, it's an unforgivable mistake never having seen this classic genre milestone before. Widely regarded at as being one of the granddaddies of the 'Haunted House' movies, "The Haunting" is genre monument of genuine suspense, claustrophobic atmosphere, foreboding locations &amp; scenery, great acting and directing and aftershocks. It has its flaws, most definitely, and maybe you could even say it became somewhat overrated over the years, but "The Haunting" nevertheless will always remain the role-modeling standard for the 'Haunted Houses' area, because it delivers exactly what you want to see: mystery, frisson, morbidity and old-fashioned fear. The opening 10-15 minutes are arguably the best ones the entire genre has to offer. A stern voice-over explains, in delightful detail, the horrifyingly bizarre history of the notorious hill house and it's truly a fascinating sight to behold. With dazzling bits of monologue like "The house stood there for 90 years and might stand for 90 more ?", "Whatever walks here, walks alone" and "The House was born bad", the unsettling mood is immediately set. Hill House was built by an architect whose first and second wife died there under mysterious circumstances. Also his daughter, who remained bed-ridden and inside her nursery room for many decades passed away here, and even the maid was mysteriously driven to suicide within the walls of Hill House. Now and after many years of research, Dr. John Markway intends to unfold the mystery surrounding Hill House once and for all. Is the house haunted by restless poltergeists or not? For his experiment, Dr. Markway invited some guests that are in one way or another linked to supernatural phenomena. It is obvious from the beginning that the house shows the most interest in the timid and deeply insecure Eleanor Lance, presumably due to the clear parallels between her life and that of the previously deceased residents of Hill House. Throughout their brief stay, the researchers ? and Eleanor in particular ? go through a wild carousel of frights, emotions and the unknown, but still the house doesn't reveal its secrets. Director Robert Wise, who had a past career in horror cinema as he worked under Val Lewton during the 1940's but also directed mainstream blockbusters such as "West Side Story", based "The Haunting" on the acclaimed novel by Shirley Jackson and allegedly tried to remain faithful to the original writings. I haven't read the book myself, but according to the highly respected opinion of some of my horror-friends, the novel focuses even more on the character of Eleanor and her odd connections to the house. "The Haunting" is a slow film and admittedly several sequences (like the insinuated romance between Eleanor and Dr. Markway) could easily have been cut and/or replaced with more significant ones. But then again, the moments of suspense are really authentically spine-chilling and jaw-dropping, like when Eleanor and Theo are terrorized in their room by deafening knocks on the door or when a seemingly hypnotized Eleanor climbs up a ramshackle spiral staircase. The ending comes abruptly and odd, but also strangely satisfying and even somewhat peaceful. A film like "The Haunting" will probably look very unspectacular and underwhelming to nowadays horror fanatics, as there isn't a single bit of bloodshed or vulgarity to be found here, but it is an influential landmark of a film, without a doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully creepy but too much of an exercise in style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hill House is most efficiently cast and shadowed as the main character before Nel comes in. Once Nel is inside she's not alone for long and the rationality and buoyancy of the "old-fashioned ghostbusters" team makes the irruption of raw anguish in the strange atmosphere too much of heavy effects.Sure it all depends on how much you empathize with Nel. To me the ironical voice-over in the prologue already sets the tone as an exercise in horror so the following is only big shadows, strange sounds increasingly trying to resonate with your nerves in an all around creepy mansion.Psycho's house was much more creepy since it was essentially up to the audience to fear and anticipate the horror in it. A house that is breathing and whining? That's too many big effects that dissociate the viewer from the main character. It still works in The Haunting because the ghost is the house but it's even better with The Turn of the Screw's 1961 adaptation The Innocents where ghost gradually take over the main character's sanity while the other characters are instrumental to her mental isolation, not ghost hunting mates. Eventually I think the only flaw in The Haunting is the fact that the characters are here to study psychokinesis. If everybody knows from the start that this is kind of a haunted house (and the comprehensive stories if its inhabitants), what is left to discover?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hasn't aged well but still worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Haunting' was one of the many horror movies I watched when I was a kid on TV way back in the 1970s that I can only vaguely remember. Recently rewatching the lame remake by Jan de Bont I was inspired to track down the original, regarded by many as a horror classic and one of the most frightening movies ever made. I must say I was quite disappointed, and didn't think it lived up to its reputation. Obviously it is superior to the 1990s version, there's no argument from me on that score. But the bottom line is that I didn't find it all that frightening. While I admire movies that create suspense and an atmosphere of dread or paranoia without resorting to gore or other obvious effects, I don't think for the most part 'The Haunting' achieved what it set out to do. That is, scare the living daylights out of the viewer. Others strongly diagree, but I can only state my own honest reaction. My other major criticism of the movie was the character played by Julie Harris ('East Of Eden'). Many seem to think her performance was an excellent one, but for me she was so irritating it almost ruined the picture for me! I also found the constant use of her voice-overs off putting. Apart from Harris, I enjoyed the rest of the cast. Led by the solid Richard Johnson (who later appeared in Fulci's classic shocker 'Zombie'), and also featuring Claire Bloom ('Clash Of The Titans') as the sexy and mysterious Theo (just compare her subtle performance to Catherine Zeta-Jones' in the remake), and former childstar Russ Tamblyn as the sceptical and wise-cracking Luke. I also enjoyed seeing the brief appearance of Lois Maxwell (best remembered as Miss Moneypenny in the Bond movies) as Johnson's wife. So overall, for me a mixed bag. 'The Haunting' is nowhere near as frightening as many would lead you to believe, but even so despite its flaws, still worth watching. However I strongly recommend the underrated 'Legend Of Hell House', which while not strictly a remake of 'The Haunting', is strongly indebted to it, and is a MUCH better movie. That may be heresy to some classic horror buffs, but I sincerely believe it to be true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being scared by this when you were a child doesn't make it a horror masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big deal. It scared the living crap out of you, once. Many things terrify you when you're a child - you simply don't understand that movies are engineered to scare you, and you believe that everything is real. Trusting a child's review of a horror film they saw when they were very young, and impressionable - is never a good idea.This film isn't scary. At all. You keep watching it, waiting for the big payoff - and there is none. It's a shame this movie gets so much praise, because I saw it, and thought "That was it? Was my DVD version cut?" It wasn't. Just about every scary movie ever made is scarier than this film.Yes, it's got a house that looks scary, shot with infrared film stock. Too bad nothing ever happens. Like the sequence that was just focusing on an abstract plaster tile pattern, for way too long. Go to a plaster tile shop and prepared to get scared out of your wits, if you're that easily frightened. And save your money instead of buying this. Maybe even buy yourself a tile that gives you daymares, at night. Or nightmares, during the day.Yes, it has some great sets. Too bad it has an extremely irritating lead character that COMPLETELY ruins the picture.This is a character drama with some cool atmospheric shots. That's about it. You're imagining the rest if you think it's the scariest thing you've ever seen. And I don't trust your taste in films just because a famous director also said it was scary. Seriously - the director of "The Sound Of Music" created a true horror film? No - he didn't, and obviously couldn't.And the remake at least had some creepy moments, and fantastic production design. And that lead character did a much better portrayal, and was more sympathetic. It's not a great film, either, but at least you can see where Jan de Bont &amp; Co. were trying to create something that was actually frightening. The scariest thing is why so many people call this film terrifying, and worthwhile.EXTREMELY overrated.Like Eleanor, you people need to get out more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elle is the scariest thing in this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Haunting" is a first for me. It's the first time I saw a haunted house film and HOPED everyone in it would die---well, especially Elle (Julie Harris)! Hating the characters doesn't speak well for this film as it's supposed to be a horror film! The film begins with a professor getting a rich lady to give him permission to explore her supposedly haunted house. He assumes that psychic phenomenon are real and is trying to prove this (wow, I'd love to know which university hired him!). So, instead of competent researchers, he picks strangers based on their supposed susceptibility to the supernatural--though when you see Elle you assume he picked people based on how annoying and mentally unstable they were! The bottom line is that the film is supposed to be scary but what frightened me was listening to Elle talking to herself inside her mind again and again and again--it really got annoying very fast! Rarely, in fact, have I hated a character as much as I hated this one and that is why I really cannot understand why so many people like this film. Poor characters (especially Elle...have I mentioned that I didn't like her?) and horrible voice-overs doom this one for me. Plus, it didn't seem like the house was so much haunted as it seemed like Elle needed LOTS of medication! In summation....I hated Elle. 'Nuff said. In fact, I could have just said that but IMDb requires reviews to be a minimum of 10 lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the remake directed by Jan De Bont and starring Liam Neeson, Owen Wilson and Catherine-Zeta Jones, which was spoofed in Scary Movie 2, before the original. I noticed the original listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was very interested to see it, from Golden Globe nominated director Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Sound of Music). Basically Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) is doing research into the existence of ghosts, investigating the large mansion Hill House, with a history of violence and insanity. To help him out he has invited Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn) who is next to inherit the house, and two students, Eleanor 'Nell' Lance (Julie Harris) and Theodora 'Theo' (Claire Bloom), the only two of about eight to respond. Luke doesn't believe that anything can or will happen in the paranormal world, Theo is mysterious with ESP (extrasensory perception), and Nell, who apparently has psychic abilities (well, she talks to herself in her head a lot) is insecure and feeling like she needs to be there. As time goes by it turns out they are all getting more than they bargained for, starting with loud bangs and voices in the walls for the two girls, the boys seeing and hearing a few things, and even the door wood bending. Nell believes that the spirit of the house wants her to stay, and it almost hypnotises her to do some things, so much so that when the three other people try to get her away, it causes her to crash on purpose, meeting a similar fate to past female residents. Also starring Fay Compton as Mrs. Sanderson, Rosalie Crutchley as Mrs. Dudley, James Bond's Lois Maxwell as Grace Markway, Valentine Dyall as Mr. Dudley, Diane Clare as Carrie Fredericks and Ronald Adam as Eldridge Harper. The performances are all good, the sound effects and occasional small effects do well, but I get the feeling that audiences were much easier to scare back in the 60's, I wasn't really freaked out, I don't fully agree with the five stars the critics give, but it is certainly a classic supernatural horror to try. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good spook scenes, but the film was too slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this production, the old house was impressive and creepy. The scenes with the hammering sounds and the moanings and whispering was very effective. I felt that overall the picture could have been more lively; the dialogue was way too slow in parts. Worth seeing though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is meant for it's time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unnerving, yes. Scary? Maybe it was in the time it was made.The age gives it a bit of a cheesy feel that should not be there. I think a lot of viewers are who trust the reviews that say this is scary are going to be let down by this fact, which few are mentioning. It really isn't that well-done, even for the 60's. It uses a lot of clichés from its time period, as well, and all the characters are forgettable and cardboard-thin. From a technical aspect, a lot of 60's films were far superior to this, as well.Other than that it is one of the most original and frightening movies of its time. But notice that doesn't mean our time as well, unfortunately.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>old fashion haunted house movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson) eagerly investigates the haunted Hill House in the most remote part of New England. The house was born bad. He brings along brash Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn) who expects to inherit the house from his aunt. Theodora (Claire Bloom) is a tough clairvoyant. Insecured Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris) is stuck living with her sister's family after her mother's death and desperate to get away from them. Mr. Dudley and his wife are the house's caretakers. Later Grace Markway (Lois Maxwell) comes to see her husband. Eleanor feels drawn to the house.This is an old fashion haunted house movie. The effects are old and done well. The movie is a lot of spooky atmosphere especially with Julie Harris' fragile demeanor. There isn't much of a plot to speak of. The story is simply a bunch of people staying in the house. Eleanor's narration gives the film a disturbed psyche feel. Theodora is also quite fascinating as the opposite of Eleanor. It may not measure up to modern horrors but it's quite spooky for its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely, but not quite . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming a mere two years after the magnificent "The Innocents," "The Haunting" seems a well-produced big-studio stillborn.The script, complete with Eleanor's (Julie Harris') voiceovers, is precious. "We who walk alone . . . ," etc.The film keeps taking us out of ourselves, and the situation, and jamming us into the mind of Eleanor -- a tweed-wearing sexually repressed neurotic.No matter how beautifully played by Julie Harris. Eleanor remains a sociopathic wimp who keeps trying to off herself until she finally DOES (with yet another God-awful voice-over.) The woman needs help from frame one.Contrast, if you will, Claire Bloom's "Theo." Whenever she is in frame, one cannot take one's eyes off her. She seems to do nothing. Yet, in character, she does everything.Her role is clearly lesbian. Her sensuality transcends boundaries. Even when the frame is dominated by another character, one cannot help but study Ms. Bloom's reactions. She dominates every shot she's in. Amazing!This sort of film sort of worked back in the day, in 1963.But certainly not compared to, "The Innocents," two years before.Despite laudable performances, "The Haunting" is hollow.</fullReview>
