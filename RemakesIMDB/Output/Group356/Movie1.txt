		<shortDescription>clichéd, but still under valued slasher.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the Halloween follow-ups that would give Jamie Lee Curtis the title of "scream queen".Children accidentally cause the death of a little girl, now years later they are in high school and getting ready for the prom. However, it seems someone else is planning on getting some murderous revenge on prom night.Prom Night is a formula slasher film, with plenty of the slasher trappings, but there are some elements that raise this film above some of the others of it kind. The director gives this movie a truly dark and eerie atmosphere, with the help of Paul Zaza's spooky music score. The plot remains engaging throughout and the creep-factor is kept high. One difference from the slasher "norms" is the fact that we ultimately have sympathy and even sorrow for the film's killer.While Prom Night is hardly a flawless movie, in fact there are a few scenes where the lighting is way too low and the disco prom dates the film, it does hold it's own. The cast gives good performances, especially Curtis, Eddie Benton, and the late Casey Stevens. There's also a few good rock numbers like "Prom Night" and the mellow "Fade to Black".Worth a look for slasher fans.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw Prom Night back when I was 10 years old, but didn't appreciate it as a film until re-watching it at 19. Watching it a second time was like discovering a priceless gem and I must say, as a screenwriter, I still look to this movie as motivation and inspiration. Unlike most Hollywood horror/slasher movies, it did what most of the latter cannot, which is provide a combination of good lucks and good acting, therefor ensuring we care about the characters.Scream most definitely took a page from this movie as inspiration for its mystery theme. Though the budget was low and this movie was made in 1980 I feel that it still has enough of a story to keep us entertained and also enough of a punch to make us jump a bit. But what really makes Prom Night a success is its actors. Jamie Leigh was wonderful as always, but one character I felt that stole the show was the character of Wendy. As vile and wicked as they made her, the actress portraying her gave her depth. I felt as a viewer that she was more than just the typical bitch character. With killer lines, a beautiful face, and a chase scene that has been the foundation of future horror movie chase scenes, this girl makes the movie worth watching.If you happen to see this movie on or notice it in a video store I would suggest giving it a look. I would love to see a remake, ONLY if they kept the plot the same, but intensified the horror, much like what was done in TTCM remake. And, of course, to have Edie Benton and Jamie Leigh make an cameo or guest appearance somewhere!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Prom Night' is a decent little slasher-mystery starring Jamie Lee Curtis in her third scream queen role. The movie also stars Leslie Nielsen as Jamie Lee's father and Hamilton High School principal. Everyone else in it are just bit players, but we must consider that this film stars one of the wickedest you-know-whats in slasher movie history. Her name is Wendy, and she is played by Anne-Marie Martin. Who this actress is, or was, I have no idea, but I know I hated her character with a passion. One of the biggest bonuses for horror fans in this movie will be the big chase scene with her and the killer quite near the end which was deliberately filmed super dark. You can hardly see what's going on and for me it is the best scene in the whole movie. Big points for Wendy's chase scene. It works since she plays the role well, and we've waited so long for this scene and it comes pretty much near the end, but it delivers.Anyway, 'Prom Night' opens with a tragedy in which young Robin Hammond, who is Jamie Lee's character's little sister, accidentally falls to her death from a two-story window after being cornered by four brats(Wendy, Nick, Kelly, and Jude)who were trying to scare her. Freaked out that they may be in serious trouble, they all make a pact to take it to the grave, initiated by Wendy, the leader of the brats. Ultimately the blame gets pegged on some serial pedophile and no one ever suspects the four kids. But someone else knows and was there and saw the whole thing. We continue twelve years later. It's the day of the prom and all four of the kids receive raspy phone calls, asking them to "come out to play". It concerns most of them, but eventually their minds stray back to the prom. Some of them have dates, some don't. Jamie Lee ends up going with Nick who just dumped Wendy, so Wendy hooks up with Lou, who sort of serves as John Travolta's Billy Nolan from 'Carrie', and the two of them plan to play a prank on Jamie Lee and Nick since they were voted Prom King and Queen. Pause real quick. Remember, Nick is one of the kids who was involved with the death of Jamie Lee's little sister. Could you really keep a secret that big from someone you are "going steady" with? Also, the two other girls involved, Kelly and Jude, appear to be good friends with Jamie Lee's character. I don't think there is much logic in that, but hey, it's a horror movie. I have to overlook it.In the end, prom dreams are sliced and diced as the vengeful killer begins knocking each of them off, eighties style. The movie is definitely pretty corny and cheaply made, but that's all part of it's charm. The suspense is there, the score is really creepy, and Jamie Lee does her thing. However, the best part is the mystery. Who is the killer? I'm sure we all know twenty-five years later, but it was fun finding out. Everyone is a suspect in 'Prom Night', as mentioned by Randy from the first 'Scream', and it will keep you guessing right up to the climax. Well, actually, when it gets to that point there are only a couple people left that it can be...but it was still a bit of a surprise. Honestly, I think 'Prom Night' could use a remake. My VCR copy has such awful quality that it's really quite hard to see what's going on on the screen, and I hear that the DVD isn't any better, so I think we could all benefit from a remastered version, or even a remake at this point.6/10 is my vote. A decent little slice and dice mystery from days long gone. How I miss them...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Six years ago four kids make a pack to keep a secret, which involved the mysterious death of child Robin Hammond. They thought that were the only ones who knew what had happened, but some else witnessed it to. Now that person strings them along, to eventually plan their revenge during Prom night.A real thank-you to the commercial success of "Halloween (1977)" and "Friday the 13th (1980), which saw the influx of slasher films and "Prom Night" was one of the first to step up. Too bad that we have here is an unspectacular so-so, if slick looking slasher effort that got caught labouring along with very little happening and providing us with corny school melodramatics. When it came to the crunch, most of the Prom Night sequences was about getting the groove on and listening to funky dory disco soundtrack. Oh it just makes you want to bogey; well it didn't stop Jamie Lee Curtis from strutting her stuff. However when it came to the good stuff, I thought the novel deaths were soundly executed, and there's a certain unpleasantness about them. When the black hooded killer (who's quite fast on their feet and would make for a good shaker too) is tormenting and stalking the victims (from be it to the phone calls or hanging about in the shadowy corridors) there's an ominous air to proceedings, which director Paul Lynch pulls off rather well. It's just too bad that most of the time is used setting this all up with ineffective red herrings and below par, drawn out script. Too many loose ends creep in, even though the premise is quite slight and you can find yourself laughing at its unintentional goofiness and picking up on it predictability. Robert New's stunningly vivid camera movements are atmospherically airy and Paul Zaza and Carl Zittrer's sorrowfully twisted musical score gets it cues right. The performances from the cast are acceptable with a likable Jamie Lee Curtis (earning her scream queen tag at the time) proves herself as an upcoming talent. Weak character, but well judged performance. Leslie Nielsen looks awkwardly distracted, and seems to duck off in a phone-in performance and George Touliatos gives the film some solidarity. Anne-Marie Martin is a delight as the scheming sexpot Wendy, David Mucci is perfect as the boorish brute Lou and Casey Stevens is modest as Curtis' prom date Nick.This post-Halloween slasher is familiar and slowly plotted, but its competent technical handling helps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dance Until You Die.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prom Night" emerged at the beginning of a decade, which also marked a decade for the rise and fall of slasher films as we know them. Along with "Terror Train" and "The Fog", "Prom Night" is one of Jamie Lee Curtis's most well-known returns to the genre after "Halloween", though it still remains fairly obscure to many horror fans and general audiences. The plot centers on Kim Hammond (Curtis), daughter of her high school's principal (Leslie Nielsen). She's popular, well-liked, and seems to have it all. Unfortunately, Kim and her family are haunted by the mysterious death of her younger sister, Robin, who died after falling from the top floor of an abandoned building ten years prior; the police blamed a schizophrenic child predator on the crime, but little do they know, there were four children who were there and whom were responsible for the incident. Those four children are now high school seniors, classmates and friends of Kim; it's prom night, which is incidentally the ten year anniversary of Robin's death. Kim will be crowned prom queen. Some won't live to see it.If the "Prom Night"'s plot set-up sounds familiar, that's because it is. Though the film was fresh twenty-some years ago, its originality has been obstructed by the plethora of slasher films that followed in its wake, which may leave some viewers bored and running the numbers; but if you can look past this, "Prom Night" is an extremely fun film. It has a little bit of everything going for it: an elusive killer, odd phone calls, probable motives, sassy high school girls, disco dancing, a ski-mask, and, most importantly, an axe. Team up the carefree high school environment with five teenagers' dark secret, and accompany that with a hellbent murderer on prom night, and you've got yourself a straightforward, suspenseful piece of slasher cinema.Granted, the film is dated, and the disco dances and funky hairdos of the day may take be distracting to some extent, but the nostalgia of that era is in every frame. Paul Zaza's score is appropriately ominous and ignites a feeling of being under watch by... someone, and at all times. Director Paul Lynch also does a fine job here, showing us just enough, but not too much. Nice establishing shots of the high school's hallways at night set the stage for the action that ensues as night falls and the prom begins, and several impressive instances of cinematography abound (the slow-motion throat slash murder which only shows us a close- up of the victim's facial expression, followed by a fade-in to the red punch bowl being one example). There are several surprisingly artsy shots in the film, and the camera-work is, for the most part, clever. The film has a rather bright, hazy look to it as well, which, whether intended or not, gives the movie another sort of texture.Performance-wise, we've got a surprisingly decent cast of 20-somethings playing 18-year-olds. Nonetheless, most all involved give commendable performances, Jamie Lee Curtis included. Leslie Nielsen's role is minor, but he's great, and Eddie Benton does a good job as the jealous rich girl of the school (and might I say, she has one of the best chase scenes I've ever seen in a horror film). Though the film takes roughly an hour before all the mayhem ensues, the build-up is worth the wait? the final 15 minutes of the film are incredibly fun (almost as fun as the hokey disco dance scene with Jamie Lee Curtis and Casey Stevens, ala "Saturday Night Fever"). The killer himself is eerie and has an interesting choice of weapons (a shard of broken mirror), even though his whispering "now!" upon each murder might sound funny. The revelation at the end of the film may or may not be expected, depending on the viewers' familiarity with these types of films. Either way, it's pretty poignant for a slasher movie.Overall, "Prom Night" is a wonderful example of slasher prototypes. It was early enough to not be considered a total rip-off, and it's got a lot of interesting things going for it, no matter how by-the-numbers it seems today. It's suspenseful, sometimes spooky, and genuinely fun and lively. Factor in some wonderful murder scenes, a budding scream queen, an eerie score, and a full-fledged disco blood-bash, and you have yourself one of the most memorable slasher films of the 1980s. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disco's not dead, but some of the dancers are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arriving as it did during the early moments of the slasher film explosion of the 80's, Prom Night was undoubtedly much more impressive then than it is today. Stripped of historical significance, modern viewers will probably be disappointed to find this dated offering to be a relatively bloodless affair with a meager body count and limited thrills. Certainly, as a horror film, Prom Night doesn't have the tools to deliver any solid scares. But as a piece of time capsule kitsch, this movie is a very fun watch, even if the unintentional laughs outweigh the splatter elements.The set-up that ultimately launches the film's flimsy revenge plot is silly and awkwardly-staged, with a young girl basically walking out of a window to her death because a quartet of pint-sized kids her own age chant "kill" over and over again. This isn't a particularly terrifying scenario, so things get off to a clumsy start here.It doesn't help matters that the next hour of the film is almost completely devoid of anything suspenseful, scary, or even interesting, save for a series of phone calls to the film's eventual victims made by a killer who has obviously watched too many Dario Argento films. The rest of the runtime for the first two acts is padded with long-winded character development, needless subplots, and a few attempts at red herring planting that ultimately fall flat.There is also a lot of screen time devoted to extended Disco dancing sequences, which, predictably, have aged far worse than the rest of the film. Compounding the goofiness, when Jamie Lee Curtis and her date are horrified to see that their nemeses have arrived at the prom despite being expelled, Jamie Lee proclaims, "let's show them what we can do!", at which point she and her partner take to the dance floor and lay down some revenge boogie. Take that, jerks! The film shows us too much of the killer early on, so even though this is supposed to be a whodunnit, the list of likely suspects is quite short by the time any of the murders start happening. Even worse, the masked, black-clad maniac is the smallest-statured movie psycho of all time, and any menace derived from our mysterious prom-crasher is promptly done away with once we see them and Jamie Lee on the screen at the same time, at which point we can't help but notice that our scream queen star is both taller and more physically intimidating than the killer.When the slasher movie festivities finally get underway, the resulting murders are downright quaint in their subdued delivery, and only a couple of sequences have any real impact. The payoff is relatively meager considering the extended exposition, and while the killer's surprise reveal at the end makes narrative sense, it is a bit disconcerting to see that the skulking murderer we've been following throughout the film is actually the most benign character in the entire cast.A horror classic, this ain't. But the glaring markers of the era give the film nostalgic interest, and it's definitely fun to see Leslie Nielsen playing it straight, even if he abruptly disappears from the film without explanation before the climax. Jamie Lee is also a welcome presence, and although she seems to be phoning her scenes in most of the time, we have to concede that she gives the admittedly weak material about what it deserves.The ancillary elements of the film (including the very cool theatrical poster and its killer tag-line) are actually more interesting than the finished product, and only the most forgiving fans of the genre's boom during this period will gleam much enjoyment here.It's hard to recommend a film that has such limited appeal, but I must confess that I have a genuine fondness for Prom Night, and I still enjoy myself every time I watch it. 1978-1983 was truly a magical era when the horror genre exploded with low budget delights, and if you hold those golden years in your heart, your chances of forgiving this film's trespasses are much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jamie Lee Curtis: Scream Queen turned Dancing Queen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While other slasher flicks of the early eighties involved an identifiable villain slicing and dicing countless teens, "Prom Night"'s killer remained a mystery. But like all good horrors, there is a back story which sets up the reason for the killings, in this case, the motif is purely revenge.Four childhood friends who would later grow up to be the school's nice boy, diva, meek girl and geek girl, were all involved in the death of another young girl. That girl is the sister of Jamie Lee Curtis' character, Kim. And, as Prom Night approaches, someone is hunting down those four former friends.Jamie Lee Curtis is obviously the main reason to watch this film, but "Prom Night" is not without other good points. The idea of a murderer prowling around on Prom Night is great, the music is very cool, especially the song on the closing credits. Oh, and Jamie Lee Curtis sure can dance! The rest of the cast are pretty good. Leslie Nielson's involvement is minimal, though Antionette Bower is wasted. Pita Oliver, David Mucci, Casey Stevens and Anne-Marie Martin as the school diva are especially note worthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sit this one out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another average slasher flick, one of two that scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis made back to back during her time in Canada fresh from her fame in John Carpenter's Halloween in 1978. It opens with four young kids in an abandoned building playing a macarible game when one girl joins them and it leads to her accidently falling out of a second floor window to her death. The four kids (three girls and a boy) make a pack never to mention it to anyone. But six years later, someone knows about the killing and decides to get those four responsible. As it also happens the anniversary of the death coincides with the big high school prom which the kids are all attending, making it convenient to borrow big ideas from movies like Carrie (1976) among others for the characters, situations and subplots.Although it has some good qualities and was moderately successful when first released, the movie is bloodless in almost every respect, plus the murders are so murky and dimly lit. Jamie Lee Curtis, playing Kim, the older sister of the murdered young girl, is good as the popular student who wants to be elected prom queen. But she, unfortunatly, is not one of the four students targeted by the masked ax-weilding killer. In fact, she frequently becomes a suspect along with her father the school principal, as well as her younger brother Alex, the creepy school janitor, and the school bully. But the identity of the killer is fairly obvious. But so much time is spent on establishing red herrings that more than two-thirds of the movie pass before any of the killings begin. The production values are also good, but the film is starting to show its age.Contents: Six killings, scant blood, one decapitation, Jamie Lee Curtis as prom queen, no nudity, no real suspense, no pace, lots of disco music and dancing, sit this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad story, memorable moments and a good chase scene makes "Prom Night" one of the underrated horror films of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prom Night" is one of the horror films that is highly underrated. What this film has that most horror films from the 80's generation (including some from these past two generations) do not take the time to develop is a strong plot with good character development. Of course these come with good screen writing. Having said that, as a consequence the viewer actually has to sit through a building story, which takes a while to build up. Therefore about 50 minutes of the film is dedicated solely to that. But that's not to say there aren't any moments of suspense or slight uneasiness. But during the prom sequence the film has a tendency to lose track of the fact that it is a horror film, and so there may come a time during the film that you'll ask yourself "what is it I'm watching again?" There are a few possibilities as to who could be doing the killings and why, but the revelation was a bit predictable and if you pay close attention to the film there are actually intentional hints dropped. This I found to be quite clever. Also, most horror movies don't leave the audience on a sad not but this one actually did, something rare to find in a horror film, and it was nice to see.Those who are expecting a horror film with excessive gore scenes will not find it in this horror film. For Paul Lynch's "Prom Night" it is mostly what you do not see that makes you cringe."Prom Night" runs approximately 89 minutes in length, and should at least be considered as a rental. "Prom Night" is not a forgettable horror movie, and has memorable moments. Roughly 39 minutes of the film will keep you on edge and entertained, especially during Kelly's chase scene. Whilst the other 50 minutes will keep you for the most part intrigued. ***1/2 Stars Out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night is an excellent Canadian horror/mystery movie from 1980. It starts with a group of kids playing a game in an abandoned building that turns horribly wrong. A young girl they were picking on falls out the top window to her death. The kids decide to keep quiet about their involvement in the incident. They don't know that someone was there and saw everything that happened. Fifteen years later, it's prom night at the high school and all those kids are now grown up getting ready to graduate. A mysterious, unseen person starts calling all of the people that were involved in the little girl's death years ago, spooking each of them. Soon after, most of the teenagers start getting murdered during prom. Most of the deaths are in the actual school when no one is around. All of this leading up to a well done ending which reveals the killer's identity.This is what the 80's were about. This disco music, the dancing, the fashion! It's just a great 80's horror film. The disco/music score is amazing. Prom Night is known as a slasher flick, but I would say it's more of a murder mystery. We actually have to guess who the killer is. There are actually quite a few suspects. The deaths were probably well done, but on the DVD versions, the quality is so poor you can barely make out who is who. Jamie Lee Curtis and the late Leslie Nielsen rock their roles of course. However another actress, Eddie Benton, adds real energy to the film also as the vixen Wendy.The killer dresses in all black including a black ski mask with cut out eye holes. His main (and only) weapon is a large axe. The one particular chase scene is Wendy's. He chases her around the interior of the darkened school for a good ten minutes. There are some really tense scenes as the killer pops out of everywhere trying to kill her with his wielding axe. The film location of the dark high school at night really add a spooky feeling to the movie. It's amazing.All of the characters are root-able. You really feel for most of them, even the vicious Wendy. The poor girl gets chased around the classrooms for so long, you almost want her to make it out of the movie alive. This is a very creepy and underrated horror film that should be seen by all. Much better than the sequels and the "remake" which was done a few years ago.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In truth, this is standard fair for a slasher. Only slightly above the level of many other slasher outings at the time. The killer only gets active during the last half hour of the movie, his identity easily guessed in the end (naturally revolving around a trauma from his past). The red herring is also very obvious. Lots of disco-dancing too in this one. At the time, I imagine it became mildly notorious because of one decapitation scene and gained a little recognition because of scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis starring in it.

Don't let anyone tell you this film isn't a credible entry into the classic (I hate that word) slasher genre. (SPOILER)Isn't the school janitor such a great red herring character in this movie?! And the killer's black outfit is perfect. I think I own the original movie poster -- it's cool.

		<fullReview>Prom Night is a fun chessey slasher movie, but not quite as chessey as the other Slasher movies that came out of the 1980's. Prom Night is one of the ones that has better character development than the others. After seeing the beginning of this movie you can see where "I Know What You Did Last Summer" has it's ideas from. Prom Night is actually one fun movie, it takes the time setting up suspense and I really enjoyed the chessey disco music and the lame disco dancing.Jamie Lee Curtis is truly fab in this role as I've often enjoyed her performance in other horror movies such as (Halloween and Terror Train), Leslie Nielson I also thought was pretty good at playing a serious role for a change, but his comedy films are even better like (Naked Gun trilogy and Spy Hard), Casey Stevens (Nick) did OK in his role as the boyfriend, Anne Marie Martin (Wendy) played the bitchy role with brilliance.All in all Prom Night is a fun movie, Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as always, the scenes I enjoyed in this movie is the disturbing beginning when the little girl falls out of the window, the scene where the killer chases Wendy with an axe which is definitely the best stalk scene in the movie and the climax between the killer and the last survivors which is always enjoyable in any horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big horror fan and I have always heard good things about Prom Night. That it's one of the classics and it is mentioned as one of the Jamie Lee Curtis scream queen classics. Ha ha please. I love Jamie Lee Curtis but never was she ever stalked in this film, thus not making her any kind of scream queen in this film.The points I liked in this movie: The creepy beginning, the old camera of this film (I love "old" horror movies, they have a more creepier atmosphere to them, I hate new cameras), the insanely creepy phone calls. The voice and whispers of the phone calls are just disturbing and also when he is killing victims he speaks with that voice. Then the rest of the movie tanked it...here's why.The movie dragged, there were no murders throughout the film. Everything was saved for the end, and when you reach the end you get hit with insane amounts of disco music. I personally do not like to see my murderers on screen. I prefer that they remain mysterious and anonymous till the very end. If your gonna show your killer please make him scary. This murderer was too skinny, dressed in black and just wearing a plain black mask with two holes in the eyes. Just stupid. I hated that. the decapitation was great but that final scene at the prom just reeked of Carrie. So everyone runs for the hills when they see the decapitated head, and the disco is STILL on and Jamie Lee, her boyfriend in this movie and the killer are fighting to disco music. That was that. The icing on this mess is the revelation that the killer is Jamie Lee's brother in the movie. In the flashback it just simply shows you that her brother witnessed the murder at the beginning sequence of the movie. Just lame. I was really expecting just a good solid horror movie but this just didn't do it for me.I gave this movie points for atmosphere and Jamie Lee Curtis. The rest of it is a bomb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly well done slasher entry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night came out at the height of the slasher film parade in the late 1970s/early 1980s initiated by the one-two punch of Halloween and Friday the 13th. It also had the distinction of being headlined by the reigning scream queen of the era, Jamie Lee Curtis. Nowadays, some of its attributes are certainly not as novel (especially after Scream), but one most really give kudos where due in that it did put its own spin on the genre without ever getting due credit. The film opens with the accidental death of a young girl during a hide-and-seek-type game that spins drastically out of control. The perpetrators agree never to reveal their culpability and the victim's family, high school principal dad Leslie Nielsen, edgy wife Antoinette Bower and their surviving children (later played by Curtis and Michael Tough), are suitably shell-shocked. Years later on prom night, a killer begins targeting those responsible and anyone who accidentally gets in the way of the quest for vengeance. For a slasher film, the end product has its moments of dread, but is surprisingly fun (some of the more humorous moments restored to the TV print actually enhance the affability of the film as a whole). Unlike its precursors, Prom Night was arguably the first slasher flick wherein the killer was both not an unkillable monster and whose identity was hidden until the climax, so it became the first to combine elements of mystery in the mix. And there are a fair enough share of suspects to keep the average viewer wondering (is it Nielsen's too-good to be true dad, Bower's unhinged mother, Tough's brooding brother, the escaped nut, the creepy janitor, another minor character, or perhaps even one of the original perpetrators suffering a guilt trip?). Ironically, it is also interesting that lead Curtis never appears to be an intended target, but the filmmakers never suggest the possibility that she could be the killer. Cast is uniformly strong, despite some of them looking a good 10 years beyond high school age. It is also a stretch to imagine that three of the perpetrators would end up being best friends and boyfriend to the sister of a girl they inadvertently killed (wouldn't they have avoided her?). A pre-Naked Gun Nielsen provides some much-needed gravity, although he vanishes for most of the second half. Curtis is classy as always. Casey Stevens is appealing as her conscience-stricken boyfriend. Anne-Marie Martin (then Eddie Benton) deserves special praise expertly playing one of the most repellent and arrogant shrews to populate horror films - the kind of character so noxious (and well-played) that one must hang in just to see her get it. A really great job on her part. The deaths are grisly without being stomach-churning and there are at least two really suspenseful drawn-out chase scenes. The ending is a bit of a downer, but this film is definitely one of the better entries in the genre. Sadly the recent in-name-only PG-13 remake has neither the style nor the effect of this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The chiller which inspired IKWYDLS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Prom Night SPOILERS* In 1974, four kids (three girls (Wendy, Kelly and Jude) and a boy (Nick)) inadvertently caused the death of a young girl, Robin Hammond, while playing a macabre game.Flashforward six years later, the anniversary of Robin's death. Everybody at Alexander Hamilton High is getting ready for the Prom, which is going to be that very night, and as rivalries are born (between Kim (Jamie Lee Curtis), the principal (Leslie Nielsen)'s daughter, Robin's older sister and a grown-up Nick (Casey Stevens)'s new girlfriend and a grown-up Wendy (Eddie Benton), Nick's ex, who then decides to ally with bully Lou (David Mucci) for a prank on Kim and Nick, who are going to be queen and king of the Prom), loves are born (between a now-adult Jude (Joy Thompson) and a goofy guy called 'Slick') and problems are had (a now-adult Kelly (Mary Beth Rubens) is deathly afraid of having sex with her boyfriend, Drew (Jeff Wincott), while that is all he thinks about) someone who was there and knows the truth about Robin's death begins to call our core four, saying 'Tonight, it's my turn'.And that night, he decidedly plays 'killer', but this time, for real...'Prom Night' is one of the best chiller of the '80s, even if it has a lot of ideas copied from HalloweeN, and has some decidedly cute girls going out with quite ugly boyfriends (Kelly and Drew, as an example).On the good side, it manages to get some tense stuff in, like the phone call scenes, some of the murders and Wendy's chase scene and has a moving ending, while on the bad side it's weirdly tame for an R-rated movie, has way too many red-herrings (the sexual maniac, the janitor, Kim, her father, her mother (Antoinette Bower), and the one which is the actual killer - SPOILERS Alex (Michael Tough), Kim's younger brother and Robin's twin brother) SPOILERS one of which (the sexual maniac) is very loosely related to the story, nobody notices the girls' disappearance (except for Wendy's, which is noted by one of Lou's friends) and it copies an awful lot, mostly from 'HalloweeN' and 'Carrie'.Still, it's a quite enjoyable movie, even if a little cheesy.Prom Night: 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashback to the Disco Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Prom Night when it was released back in 1980. So in honor of my 16 year old son's prom this past week, I decided to re-visit this clunky classic and see if I can re-capture my youth. And you know what? I think I enjoyed Prom Night better the second time around. There was actually a pretty good red-herring or two thrown in the mix to "confuse" the viewer into thinking who the killer really was. As a matter of fact since it's been so long, I forgot who the really turned out to be (I was after only 16 myself when I saw this movie 30 years ago!) and was actually surprised at the reveal.Although there were and still are certain things that ruin the movie for me (like the fact that most of the actors look to be well in their 30s and that disco had already made a quick exit), it's kinda fun to see how campy the film really is. I recommend watching it at least once and enjoy it for what it really is: a time capsule to those lost years of the early slasher movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young girl dies tragically when she falls through the window of an abandoned building upper floor as a result of a scare tactic prank performed by four kids playing a hide-n-seek version of "I'm going to kill you." The kids responsible make a silent pact to keep their actions behind this death secret, with a schizophrenic known child abuser accused of being the guilty culprit responsible. The wrongfully accused man is seriously burned after trying to flee the police with his car turned over in a crash. Breaking free from the asylum imprisoning him, this event coincides with the four kids, now teenagers in high school, receiving creepy phone calls from an unknown psychopath forewarning their up coming meeting at the senior prom. The film shows the days leading up to the senior prom, and the psycho, dressed in black with a ski-mask covering his face, attacking each member of the group responsible(..when they are most vulnerable, away from a crowd of people, alone in some place either inside the quiet abandoned halls &amp; rooms of the school, or just outside the building) for the little girl's death many years ago, on Prom Night.More along the line of "Halloween" than "Friday the 13th", this is a methodical(..some might say..slowwwwwwwww moving)character driven slasher with limited death sequences shown, with most of the killer's murderous activities occurring off screen. I will say that the victims are developed, given exposition before the senior prom so that they gain sympathy from the audience. The only one who might deserve her comeuppance in many viewer's eyes is Wendy(Anne-Marie Martin), the very one who instigated the silence of their misdeeds as children, and the one who causes most of the mischief towards Kim(Jamie Lee Curtis), who is dating her former squeeze, Nick(Casey Stevens). What makes this union most interesting is that Kim's sister was the girl who fell through the window to her death, and Nick was one of the kids responsible for frightening her with that game. We witness the other two girls, now young women either experiencing love for the first time or heartbreak, before meeting their doom at the hands of the mysterious psycho. As is the case in giallo thrillers, which this is closer in spirit than 80's slashers, there are red herrings regarding who the killer might be. Could the psycho be the escaped lunatic seeking revenge for being framed for a murder he didn't commit? Could the killer be Kim's grieving father, Principal Hammond(Leslie Nielsen, handed a very underwritten role)? Could the killer be the peeping tom, alcoholic, sneaky janitor? I'm just not convinced this will work for many slasher fans because the seedy, gratuitous elements which draw such a crowd are not that present here.Like a lot of fans of "Halloween" from their youth onward, I followed Jamie Lee Curtis' career, looking for other horror films on VHS shelves, and "Prom Night" was one of those. Expecting something more visceral, I guess I was a tad bit disappointed. Watching it as an adult, I believe I can see what director Paul Lynch was trying to accomplish..building up these characters looking forward to the future, or dwelling on their own personal dramas and dilemmas(..relationships and growing pains, these teens had in high school), before facing a grim fate they weren't prepared for. He also lenses the film, very soft-focus, giving it an almost dreamlike aura. One of a handful of slashers Curtis would star in during the early 80's before moving on to "Trading Places" where she'd hone her comedic chops, she was blossoming into a stunning woman. While I loathe disco with a passion, this film might amuse as a time-capsule film with how Curtis shows her stuff on the dance floor. She even teases her faithful with a lockeroom sequence showing how she has developed wearing a bra, shirt opened. As far as the death sequences, the highlight, of course, is the decapitation where a thug, taking Nick's place after he and his cronies attacked him, tying the kid up in a situation planned by Wendy, gets his head lopped off with it rolling onto the dance-floor walkway. The film's main suspense chase concerns Wendy trying to flee her pursuer through the empty halls of the school as the other teens are dancing. The film's reveal of the killer is really kind of sad, actually, as so many perish because of a childish prank which could've been prevented if the kids responsible had acted civilized.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at the drive-in. My sister &amp; I and group of friends saw this film along with the movie "Don't Go In The House". Well I loved the film when I was kid and I still like it now its now I have seen all the other films this movie stole from. This film is equal parts "Halloween" "Psycho" and "Carrie" however those films are superior. In this film a 10 year old girl dies when she playing a twisted little game with a group of friends. A innocent man Leonard Murch gets convicted of the crime. 6 years later on Prom Night we learn the man has escaped and out for revenge.Now SPOILERS AHEAD When we see who the killer is there is a few things I learned from the actor himself who played the role. If you have only seen this film on DVD you are seeing a poor transfer of the film. For years people have debated on what on his lips! Well some of thought it was lipstick and others thought is was blood. Well the actor told me himself it is LIPSTICK. Alex morphed into Robin to kill off the right people who were responsible for the death of Robin. He told me "He even now stutters like Robin" Now there is a throw away line when Kim's (Jamie Lee Curtis) mother is looking for her lipstick. This is the lipstick the killer has on at the end. The Blu-Ray Disc however has a far better picture than the old DVD. This is still a fun film to watch. The Cheesy Dance Sequence is good a for a few laughs. I just wish the 2008 film "Prom Night" would of been a true remake and not just share the same title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slay The Last Dance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring then scream-queen (and current yogurt peddler) Jamie Lee Curtis and a pre-goofball Leslie Nielsen, "Prom Night" is one of the first in what would be many holiday-themed slasher flicks meant to capitalize on the success of John Carpenter's seminal "Halloween." The concept is at once simple and yet convoluted: a gaggle of tweens playing a rather odd and slightly sadistic "hide and go seek"-type game in an abandoned warehouse accidentally drive another child to their death. Because it's always a good idea in this sort of movie, the kids all vow never to speak a word of this to anyone. Fast- forward six years later, and the kids are now teenagers getting ready for their prom. Only somebody saw what happened that fateful day, and somebody is going to make them pay.Like its fellow brethren in "My Bloody Valentine," "Prom Night" is a low-budget production straight out of Canada. Director Paul Lynch works the meager concept into a rather sleek and efficient blaze of tension, bloodshed and disco. For better or worse, not much blood is shed until about 2/3 of the way through the movie. For at least the first half of the movie, we are treated to a lot of obscene phone calls, botched hook-ups in locker rooms and student-on-student pranks. There's also adequate time to set-up the somewhat stock characters, which is handled surprisingly well. Jamie Lee Curtis sticks out from the bunch as the innocent by-stander who, before becoming the de-facto survivor girl, gets to bust out in an obscenely long dance-number that almost gives a similar scene in "Airplane" a run for its money. The kill scenes are then, somewhat ironically, less memorable than all the stuff that comes before it, which is perhaps a testament to Lynch's unheralded skill or maybe just dumb luck.Either way, "Prom Night" is a great example of the '80s slasher. All the tropes you've come to expect -- revenge, premarital relations, bratty teens, recreational drug-use -- it's all here. Perhaps not as refined as its predecessors, "Prom Night" remains an entertaining and somewhat endearing experience all these years later. It even inspired a pair of silly yet throroughly entertaining sequels in "Prom Night II: Hello Mary Lou" and "Prom Night III: The Last Kiss," along with a somewhat forgettable fourth film and an absolute piece of garbage remake. But if you're looking to hit the dance floor with a well- worn semi-classic of its era, you couldn't pick a better date than the original "Prom Night."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boogie the Night Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prom Night" is the second chapter of a trilogy of slasher films Jaime Lee Curtis star in early in her career. After "Halloween" and before "Terror Train," Curtis lended her rising scream queen talent to this Canadian production, a minor classic for slasher fans. Coming so early in the sub-genre's life, "Prom Night" follows an expected slasher outline. A group of kids, while playing a game of Killer in an abandoned high school, indirectly lead to a fellow child's death. The police pin the murder on a pedophile. As the years pass, some of the children harbor guilt over the death, while others forget about it. A decade later on the eve of the same student's senior prom, the girls begin receiving threatening phone calls. The same child molester has escaped from prison and murdered a nun already. As prom begins and the kids boogie the night away, a masked man begins to hack his way through the guilty party."Prom Night" takes a surprisingly long time to get to its murders. It's nearly an hour into the film before the deaths start to happen. For such a deliberate pace, you'd expect the characters to be more solidly developed. Most of the large cast aren't much more then loose ideas. Jaime Lee proves to be the final girl but she's not quite the protagonist. Curtis' Kim is mostly defined by her relationship with neurotic brother Alex. Her boyfriend Nick doesn't have much personality. Jerk Lou and bully Wendy seem to want to recreate the end of "Carrie" by hijacking the prom. Seymour is the required prankster character. Only Kelly, pushed by her boyfriend into having sex, has any sort of definable arc. She, of course, dies first.What joys there are to "Prom Night" come from Paul Lynch's frequently moody direction. He mines quite a bit of sinister intent out of long shots of empty high school hallways. The killer's first appearance is stretch out nicely, the death coming as a shock, the murder scene fading to red. The creepy phone calls are handled nicely, with extreme close-ups on a pencil thumping at a pad of paper. The ending is surprisingly sincere, playing the material for pathos instead of blatant shocks. While "Prom Night" doesn't quite earn that emotion, the attempt is still appreciated.The movie's camp factor is probably more entertaining. I hope you kids like disco because this movie is full of it. There are long sequences of cast members dancing to cheesy, canned dance music. Have you ever wanted to see a pre-comedy-career Leslie Nielson boogie his heart out? You've got it. The killer's sparkly ski-mask proves a somewhat comical disguise. Pre-dating "Scream," the slasher is borderline incompetent. He gets beat up by a nerd. The hilarious van crash has little to do with the killer's attempt to sneak inside. He nearly forgets his axe during a chase scene. He routinely gets beaten and battered by the film's heroines. This is probably intentional, considering the murderer is just another teenager."Prom Night" is hardly a gory film but what kills it has are quite clever. A shattered glass throat slashing is memorable. The van face stabbing generates a shock or two. The decapitation, the severed head landing on the day-glo dance floor, is darkly humorous. It's no surprise that "Prom Night" was a big hit in its day and would, years later, spawn the required slasher franchise. The movie's nothing special but I can see why slasher fans consider it nostalgic horror comfort food.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good Slasher/Horror Flick!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jamie Lee Curtis, Leslie Nielsen, Casey Stevens and Michael Tough star in this 1980 horror film. This film begins with a group of young kids playing a hide and seek type game. Soon, a young girl, Robin Hammond comes in the middle of the game and accidentally falls out a window to her death. The kids make a pact with each other never telling anyone what happened. After 6 years, Robin's sister, Kim (Curtis) and brother, Alex (Tough) are still coping with their loss along with their father, Mr. Hammond (Nielsen) who is also the principal at their school, Hamilton High. When Kim and her friends get ready for the senior prom, a mysterious killer seeks revenge on them for Robin's death and hunts them one by one. Stevens plays Kim's boyfriend, Nick. This is a good slasher/horror flick that inspired "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and Curtis is great as usual. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously Eerie score in this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main thing that I wanted to write about for this film is the musical score. No, I don't mean the disco music, but the actual score. It evokes a sense of being watched and something lingering in the shadows, waiting to attack. It is probably one of the main reasons that there is anything that scary about this film. The production is obviously lower-budgeted, though the initial idea and plot are decent enough. Some of the, then, current trends in the film can either be a distraction or charming in its nostalgia. Perhaps having the film ultimately center on "Prom Night" makes no sense at all other than it is maybe the same date as the accident from years ago. Otherwise it is a decent slasher film, just the score really sticks out as the scariest element here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually strongly criticize movies with no originality, even when they're good movies. But after seeing this picture, I may re-evaluate some of my thoughts. "Prom Night" is a big example that only an original story DOESN'T guarantee the quality of ANY film, since it's highly original but extremely bad. The story is kinda simple and seems to be an older version of "I Know What You Did Last Summer"-- but even worse. Some kids 'accidentaly' murder one guy (or girl, it's so annoying that I can't remember) and make a promise that they'll never tell anyone about it. Then, when they're going to their prom, this murdered child sets a revenge and tries to kill them all. I can't tell you if the rebel child accomplished it's will, since I couldn't make it to the end. There is simply NOTHING to make the spectator care about the film, so you can imagine how boring it gets. "Prom Night"'s 2006 version is very bad reviewed on internet, so I thought that seeing this version would be more pleasant, but I really doubt that remake can be any worse than this. Avoid it at any costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect movie but kind of confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night is a good movie. There is perfect casting (Jamie lee Curtis). And it has a good plot. If you are not good at remembering names, like me, then it might start to get confusing. For me, I got Kim's boyfriend and brother mixed up, and her friends to the little kids in the beginning. So I had to stop the video and look up who was who. But after that it made more sense. The final chase seen on the dance floor was kind of goofy and silly. The big one was when one of the students was being chased around the school. That one was intense and it kept me from getting distracted. The ending was great. Since I knew who all the characters were it made more sense. And I had not seen it coming. The entire movie was well thought out and it was defiantly entertaining. I would Recommend this before you see the remake, otherwise this movie might seem disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kids settle grudges with axes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A child dies after being chased out the window of an abandoned building by four other children. An unseen witness to the accident comes back years later looking for revenge, and heads roll. Literally.The dead child, Robin Hammond, was the daughter of the high-school principal (Leslie Neilsen) and the sister of Kim (Jamie Lee Curtis). Robin also had a twin brother, Alex. Four children were present when Robin fell, but only one of them, Nick (Casey Stevens) suggests going for help. The other three -- Wendy (Eddie Benton), Kelly (Mary Beth Rubens), and Jude (Joy Thompson)-- make him swear never to reveal what happened. Robin's death is blamed on a psycho named Murch, whose car crashes while he is being pursued by police.We see the Hammond family paying a visit to Robin's grave-site six years later. The anniversary of her death coincides with the date of Kim's senior prom. Buzzkill! In the intervening years, Nick and Kim have become "involved". Nick is a sincere chap, but not sincere enough to tell Kim that he helped kill her sister, although he appears to toy briefly with the idea when Kim breaks down in tears about how the day of the prom is the anniversary of her sister's death. "It would have been her first prom," she sobs. "Uh, Kim..." says Nick, uncomfortably, before he wimps out and trots off to football practice.Kim is also friends with Kelly and Jude, neither of whom seems to be bothered in the least by the dead sister..er, elephant in the room. As for Wendy, who has grown up to be the quintessential Rich Bitch Mean Girl, she doesn't care about anything but clothes, cars...and Nick.Apparently, Nick broke up with Wendy to date Kim, and Wendy isn't taking it well. Wendy asks Lou (played with sullen, stupid menace by David Mucci) to help her get revenge. Lou -- one of the more fully realized characters in the film -- readily agrees; you get the feeling that his future includes an appearance on an episode of "Cops". When he arrives at Wendy's house to take her to the prom, he passes her a bottle of whiskey, belches, wipes his mouth, and says "You look terrific." A shadowy figure with a guttural voice makes phone calls to Nick, Wendy, Jude, and Kelly, promising mayhem at the prom, but no one seems alarmed, even when Kelly and Jude find their yearbook pictures pinned in their lockers with shards of a broken mirror. Kim and Wendy meow and scratch at each other over Nick. Kelly agonizes over whether to let her boyfriend, Drew, go "all the way". Jude meets a short, frizzy-haired kid in a Chevy van; he calls himself "Slick" and asks her to the prom. At the prom, Wendy and Lou's entrance spurs Nick and Kim to hit the dance floor, where they twirl and prance in synchronized abandon to an aggressive disco beat.In the background, the police skitter about looking for Murch, who, conveniently for the plot, has escaped from the local asylum in time to serve as the largest and smelliest in a series of red herrings. A creepily-mustached school janitor has also been offered up for suspicion. And all this before any blood is shed at all.Kelly is the first to die, in a locker room, where she has gone to make out with Drew. When she refuses to do the deed, Drew stomps out to "...find someone who will!", leaving Kelly to sob "Drew, you bastard!" just before the killer sticks a shard of mirror through her windpipe.Jude dies next. Slick's nerdy exterior conceals a van equipped with a bed and enough weed to knock out Cheech and Chong. As Jude and Slick toke up and giggle about losing their virginity to each other, the killer opens the back door of the van, slits Jude's throat, and dispatches Slick by forcing him to drive the van off a cliff.Wendy is the only one of the victims who shows any gumption. Confronted by the ax-wielding killer, she kicks off her high heels, runs like a deer, and takes refuge in the school auto shop. The killer finds her when she attempts to hide in a closet and finds the still-warm body of poor, virginal Kelly hanging on the wall. Her screams give away her position and the ax falls shortly thereafter.When Nick and Kim queue up to be crowned King and Queen of the prom, Lou and his goons grab Nick and tie him up. Lou puts on the crown and waits for his cue -- receiving instead an ax to the back of the neck. His head, with the crown at a rakish angle, rolls out onto the dance floor and grosses everyone out. Meanwhile, Kim has rescued Nick and the killer realizes he's decapitated the wrong guy. The killer grabs the ax and goes after Nick -- only to be disarmed by Kim, who smacks him in the head. The women do all the heavy lifting in this film.The killer staggers out the front door of the high school, whereupon Kim realizes who he is and tackles him before the police can shoot. She pulls off the killers' ski mask to reveal her brother, Robin's twin, Alex. It seems that Alex was at the school when Robin fell out the window, and has known all this time who was responsible. He dies in Kim's arms as the music swells.A very large question arises from the ashes of this movie: If you were a little boy and someone pushed your twin sister out a window, wouldn't you run screaming home and tell your parents right away? And, failing that, wouldn't you feel compelled to tell your older sister she was dating one of the people responsible? Just asking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take a dash of Brian de Palma's "Carrie," blend in a hint of John Carpenter's "Halloween," sprinkle in a healthy pinch of "Saturday Night Fever" and you may end up with a concoction very much like 1980's "Prom Night," a mildly effective thriller that just narrowly manages to get the job done. In this film, an ax-wielding maniac targets four high school students who had inadvertently caused the death of one of their friends six years before. One of the unlucky quartet, Nick, is the boyfriend of prom queen Kim, played by Jamie Lee Curtis; what a shame, then, that the anniversary of the tragedy coincides with the night of the big school bash.... Anyway, this film really is a mixed bag at best. It rarely goes far enough in terms of excitement and violence, is filled with false shocks and red herrings, and has a slow buildup that is barely paid off in the picture's final third. With the exception of the plight of Wendy, the bitchiest of the four, whose pursuit by the killer throughout the school and in an underground garage IS quite suspenseful (probably because Wendy is the only one who lasts long enough to show any sign of fear!), and a bravura final five minutes that are memorably off the wall, the picture generates little in the way of thrills. (PERSONAL NOTE TO ASPIRING FILMMAKERS: If a character in a horror picture is not afraid, the audience won't be either. Imagine the shower scene in "Psycho," if "Mother" had merely killed Marion Crane while her back was to him. How less effective that scene would have been, without Janet Leigh's classic scream and the fear that was so well conveyed! Sure, the scene would still have been suspenseful, but not nearly as memorable and harrowing. Fear is communicable, and without that identification on the part of the viewer, there are no scares; just buildup and butchery.) What's worse, a side issue regarding Kim becoming aware of Nick's involvement in her sister's death is never resolved, and the talents of both Leslie Nielsen and Antoinette Bower (who will always be "Star Trek"'s Sylvia the witch woman to me!) are squandered in teensy roles. Still, there are compensations. The picture looks great and is well acted by its mainly young cast, and the identity of the killer (virtually every character is suspect) will most likely come as a surprise; I felt sure that I had guessed it for a change, but was wrong, as usual. Director Paul Lynch has given his film some interesting touches also (love that slow dissolve into a blood-red punch bowl!). Thus, "Prom Night" isn't TOO bad a teen/slasher flick; certainly better than some I've seen. If anything, the film demonstrates that disco music is good for something after all: It makes an impressive backdrop for watching a psycho go berserk!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom Night (1979)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Paul Lynch, the director of Humongous (1982).Prom Night is about 4 16-year olds who are being knocked off one by one at Prom Night. 4 years prior, they accidentally killed one of there friends yet kept it secret. The death was blamed on the local madman. Could it be revenge? More importantly, who is it?The storyline may seem unoriginal but this was the first slasher with this kind of plot. But the story was probably borrowed from Lois Duncans 1973 novel 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' which was later made into the movie of the same name (1997) based on the screenplay by Kevin Williamson, the writer of the Scream films (1996-2000). Speaking of Scream (1996), that film seems to have taken a page out of this classic...inspired?Despite the the unoriginal plot, Prom Night is really underrated. I mean, it's better than Friday the 13th (1979).Here are my points: Though they have very different story's, they are played out in a similar fashion. Also they have have similar structures. Both start with a murder(s).While the beginning of Friday the 13th ripped-off Halloween (1978), it was OK but not as good or effective as the opening in Prom Night. When the films move on into the middle section, both try to develop the characters. Prom Night succeeds with one character: Wendy, the for-some-reason likable school bitch played by Anne-Marie Martin better known as Eddie Benton-her stage name. She had everything-looks, personality &amp; some killer lines. But Friday the 13th suffers by the fact that it can't produce any characters to care for. Instead, it creates a dumb girly-girl named Alice.Now the confrontation in Friday the 13th...WHOA! in the bad way...but there were all the classic death scenes which were effective NOT SUSPENSEFUL like Prom Night.How could the death scenes in Friday the 13th be suspenseful when you don't care for a single person? Prom Night, on the other hand, had some effective death scenes &amp; Wendys death was really suspenseful &amp; really inspiring towards the chase scenes in todays horror films such as I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997).So in my opinion, Prom Night farts on Friday the 13th big time but cannot top Halloween.Now back to Prom Night. It works real good. The flick tells the story, then develops the characters while making you laugh &amp; creeping you out, then they knock off the characters in a strong manner. The use of clichés &amp; the bad quality in Prom Night really lowered the films standhards &amp; makes the picture dated but i can easily ignore them.Entertaining it is. &amp; kind of sad. &amp; funny. &amp; creepy. &amp; more stuff yet the list would go onnnnn &amp; onnnnn &amp; onnnnn.More bonus points: The score was fabulous, the acting, very good &amp; very convincing, look out for Jaimie Lee Curtis, Eddie Benton &amp; Leslie Neilson.Another thing: Prom Night was one of the first horror movies to use the who dunnit formula. For me, who the killer turned out to be in this picture was a surprise......maybe i wasn't thinking hard enough.The gore: You get a girl falling from a window, some blood, a slashed throat, multiple stabs in throat, car crash, an Axe killing, a nice decapitation &amp; some mild violence. Might sound good but most of it comes at the prom &amp; most of it is offscreen. Still, the gore was good for 1979 but may seem dated nowadays. OK.3 out of 5 stars. A dated underrated slasher...you may not see it the way i do. If your someone who likes early 80's slasher films &amp; doesn't mind soapies, than this is recommended...kinda hard to find a copy, but.PS: Prom Night &amp; Terror Train (1979) are not Friday the 13th rip-offs-all three were filmed in 1979 &amp; all three were released in 1980 so it is safe to say that they are not Friday the 13th rip-offs but Halloween inspired films. &amp; even if i am wrong, that only improves Prom Night AND Terror Trains semi-cult-following due to the fact that they are better than Friday the 13th.Followed by a sequel, Prom Night II Hello Mary Lou (1987). (THE REMAKE OF THE SAME NAME (2008) DOES NOT COMPARE.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fifth movie in the boxset. I actually like this movie. A childhood favorite. Granted that it still has it's flaws. My friend says the reason this movie gets blasted all the time is because he thinks this was made mainly to exploit Jamie Lee Curtis' career, since she had been in movies like Halloween and The Fog. The movie starts off in 1974. A group of kids are playing hide-and-go- seek in an old school building when all of a sudden, one of the kids falls to their death. The other kids vow to keep quite about it, but one of the kids knows. Flash forward 6 years later, the kids are now in High School. On the night of their senior prom. What they don't know is that a masked killer is stalking them. The main problem with this film (which is the REAL reason why so many people hate it) is because of how long it takes to get to the killings, which don't happen until the last minute (Bad move there, I'm afraid), and the kills aren't even close to perfect, but enough about that. Overall, there were some parts that creeped me out, some parts that bored me, and some parts that made me laugh, especially the scene where one of the girls mooned the nerdy janitor. Another one is of course, the cheezy disco music. So if you're a horror fan who has a lot of paticience and likes cheezy slashers, this is for you. And on the topic of the remake, just forget about that. It was so awful, it's hard to believe it ended up #1 at the box office. The power of horror, I suppose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahhhhhh the 70's thats when real horror movies were made,this is before Friday The 13th and NIghtmare. AS i REMEMBER there were a group a friends in a deserted building and one of the little girls fell to her death,they kept it a secret after all these yrs,now it's 1978 everyone was getting ready for the prom the four teens who kept secret after 10 yrs are all getting together for a good time this was suppose to be the best night they ever had,the prom queen the prom king,and four friends having fun.they get stoned,drunk, dancing, and some one is killing them one by one, this movie starred Jamie Lee Curtis she did Halloween, she was the lead actress in Prom Night. And at the end of Prom Night a surprised ending, Sometimes the acting is very bad,but you just have to wacth,also Lesly Nelson plays the detective. There's hardly any gore,but there is a lot of suspense. This movie made way for the 8o's horror movies like Jason or Micheal myers,or good Sleepaway camp series. It has a good soundtrack to it I forgot the music score. Now they made a remake of Prom Night I have seen previews and it looks pretty good I don't know if it has a or has the same plot to it, 8 stars for something new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before the slasher genre became yesterday's news</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the enormous success of "Halloween", the slasher genre emerged spawning several spin-offs including the very good "Friday The 13th" and this gem, "Prom Night" spawning its share of multiple sequels. Despite the unfavorable reviews on this site, I found it to be quite a treat and, despite it being a classic, better than "Halloween" in today's world. Not only that, but "Prom Night" is realistic in the sense that the killer never catches his victims with anything over the top, (In fact, it takes him about ten minutes to finally catch one chick and give her the old chop chop)! The surprise ending revealing the killer to be Jamie Lee Curtis' brother turns to be a little bit of a tearjerker when he says "They killed her..." before kicking the bucket. Although only one's self can be the judge and you should see this flick and decide whether you think this is a classic or a dud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted, as a horror movie, Prom Night does not succeed (half of the "horror" is obscured by terrible cinematography and lighting, you're kind of guessing what's going on as if it's an abstract painting or something...), but, for disco fans this movie is truly unique. Yes, by 1980 disco as mainstream was pretty much dead, it "sucked." But for anyone who has never lost their like for disco music and enjoys discovering the nostalgia of it all, Prom Night offers something interesting. For anyone who really knows disco (I know, scary thought...) you'll recognize the music as a blatant ripoff of Patrick Hernandez' "Born to be Alive" which was immensely popular by 1980. And also I think it's pretty creative to have the movie's disco love-theme titled, "Love Me Till I Die" playing during the final stalking/killing scene..I mean, come on, it's cheesy but so brilliant! My only question: does a soundtrack exist on vinyl, cassette or CD? I'd love to have it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bunch of kids bully a young female child as a practical joke, but it all goes horribly wrong when she is accidentally shoved out the window, and plummets to her death. Years later, a ski masked killer plots revenge on the same kids, at their high school prom. This was one of my favorite slashers when I was younger. It was one of the first movies my Mother ever bought me. Jamie Lee Curtis is my favorite actress of all time, and I'll watch anything with her in it. It does hold some special value to me, I've seen it many times, but watching it as a 28 year old, makes me realize how mundane and mediocre this movie is. I still love slasher movies, but there is nothing special about this movie at all. It has a chilling opening. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there. Nothing all that interesting commences. It lacks suspense, it has lame 80's disco music, and it's filled with really talky scenes. I do like the added touch of the threatening phone calls. A few of them were somewhat creepy, but other than that, nothing to write home about. Watching it at this day and age makes me wonder if the plot drew inspiration for I Know What You Did Last Summer? The set-up is a bit similar, without all the drama IKWYDLS had. It also throws in the very clichéd "Escaped lunatic as a suspect" storyline, and like always. It turns out to be a complete lie. They fill it with your lovable 80's slasher clichés, such as the token stoner, the jealous rival of a prom queen, bumbling cops, among other things. The acting is fairly amateurish, aside from a couple people. A couple of the actors (Leslie Nielsen included) do this weird inner monologue thing. Jamie Lee Curtis outshines everyone so much. She is a prime example of a scream queen. In fear of being type-casted, she moved away from horror movies, but she was a natural at it. She has a very thin part, and not much to work with. Jamie Lee Curtis manages to make the most out of it with sheer talent. She livened up the movie whenever she was on screen. Casey Stevens is a little bland as Nick, but I enjoyed his dated curly hair. Leslie Nielsen is wasted as a principal. I'm not sure why he was in this movie to begin with. The rest of the cast are mostly amateurish, but Anne-Marie Martin is pretty good as a vindictive witch. The gore is drier than your Grandma's snatch. We get a lame slit throat, and a decapitation, along with some light blood splashing. The killer himself isn't completely predictable, but it wasn't exactly a surprise either. He made these weird noises as well. The ending is anti-climatic tooFinal Thoughts: This isn't much better than the nominal remake of this movie. It's rather dull and often bloodless as well. I had fond memories of this movie, but not any more. Jamie Lee Curtis's talents were more suited for something better. If you wanna see JLC give a classic performance in a slasher, watch the first two Halloween movies. Followed by three sequels 4.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching this film back in the 80's on VHS and I remembered it being a little scary. I just watched this again for the first time in more than 20 years and all I can say is that it's UTTERLY BORING!! And that's a serious comment because nothing (and I do mean NOTHING!) happens for the first hour of film! There isn't one kill until we get at the one hour mark! And the wait certainly is NOT worth it. I will NEVER get that 90 minutes back. I completely wasted my time.I figured Jamie Lee Curtis would be a "saving grace" because of her role in Halloween. Actually, all of the actors did well. It's just that NOTHING HAPPENS FOR AN HOUR! We get treated to one of the LONGEST cheesy-ass disco dances on the school floor that I've ever seen. It did nothing for the film, other than show how "hot" Jamie can look while disco dancing.And the teens look like they're all in their late twenties, but I have to let that slide because most slasher films from this period have older-looking teens.There was ONE fairly effective shot regarding a beheading, but THAT WAS IT! It certainly wasn't a saving grace for this waste-of-time.If you REALLY are a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis, then I suppose I'd recommend this because she does a good job with a boring script. Otherwise, this slasher offers NOTHING.I'd much rather attend another Prom Night in real life (Heaven Forbid!) than watch this dull flick again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prom Night might seem like a generic slasher on the surface yet deep down the script goes beyond that and shows the dramatic effects on the survivors who are left behind after a tragedy. Leslie Nelson and Jamie Lee Curtis it up from the b movie reputation of bad acting into a respectable affair despite a few cheesy moments. The kills aren't going to please gore hounds looking for a blood bath, but they are creative and different from the standard knife cut or ax to the back common in many others. A few highlights are Slick's can plunging off a cliff, Wendy's Chase scene through the school and Lou's decapitation which keep you on the edge of your seat. The atmosphere is genuinely creepy, dark and feels like a storm is on the horizon.The ending is abrupt since Jamie doesn't experience a true showdown in the style of Halloween, but since the reveal is a conflict of interest it does open up a new later on if Alex was trying to kill his sister or keep her out of harm's way. Alex dying in her arms before the credits roll feel like it was missing the finale gotcha moment almost feeling like a Greek tragedy. My only complaint is Mr. Hammond disappears half way through and it was due to budget cuts yet a line or two could've cleared it up. Prom Night is a spectacular horror film that stands on it's own two feet and doesn't try to follow the trend making it true My exceptional. Pick up a copy today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masked Killer with an Axe to Grind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie begins with a young girl named "Robin Hammond" (Tammy Bourne) venturing into an old building to join some other kids playing hide-and-seek. However, when the other children discover that she has joined them they decide to have a little fun by scaring her. This results in her accidentally falling out of the building and to her death. Scared that they might get in trouble with the police all four of them swear never to tell what happened and run back to their homes. Six years later each of them are now seniors in high school and on prom night they each receive a strange telephone call that none of them know how to interpret. And then the killings start. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that this was one of the first of the films that helped start the "slasher craze of the 80's" along with "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th". Yet, although it was certainly popular when it first came out, it seems to have lost its vitality since then. Even so, I liked the performance of Eddie Benton (as "Wendy Richards") along with the way the mystery of the killer was kept until the very end. In any case, I rate this movie as about average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four kids accidentally cause the death of a little girl and keep it a secret. Six years later the kids are teens getting ready for prom but little do they know someone saw what they did years before and is ready to exact bloody revenge. Easily dismissed as just another slasher but it's actually pretty good. It does take awhile before the killing starts and in the second half some scenes are poorly-lit. But there's some nice atmosphere and a look the movie has about it that I appreciate. The cast is good, headlined by scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen. Future soap actress Anne-Marie Martin makes for a great mean girl. Her part of the film is obviously ripped off from Carrie but nobody said this was high art! There are some dated trappings such as the disco prom but I actually think this adds to the movie's appeal. I've never understood the critique some have of movies that they are supposed to look like they take place today or else they are flawed. That's pretty dumb, in my opinion. Anyway, give this one a shot if you like '80s slashers. It's a good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The prom, a formal dance which upperclassmen have their night on the dance floor. It's a night of beautiful music, happy friends, teachers and staff get have their fun as well. In the movie "Prom Night", a crazed killer takes the fun out of the prom. In 1974, four friends play hide and seek in an abandoned convent. This version was called "The Killers". A brother and sister arrive and the sister joins in , only to be taunted by the others in the game. She gets back to an old window, and accidentally fallen to her death. 6 years later, following the tragedy, the others get ready for the prom. Unknown to them, there was a rapist on the loose who was horribly burned in an accident. Then someone called the ones responsible for the sibling's death. Who is it? All of a sudden, the death toll takes action following the harassing calls. Some of the victims weren't even responsible. Great cast this movie's got: Jamie Lee Curtis, Leslie Nielsen, and a few others as well. And the music was much of the end of the disco era. It can be enjoyed in any era. Prom Night is King of the dance slasher films. 4.5 out of 5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film on Netflix and decided to watch it. Before I get into details I must say the first half of this film was pretty enjoyable. Lets start off with the acting, why do I even bother for the horror movie reviews. Its what you would expect from a 80's horror film, which is pretty much all the same. I didn't find my self caring for the characters, especially after what they did. The first forty or so minutes were enjoyable, there was some suspense, it was entertaining enough. Once night falls so does the film. The screen got so dark I couldn't even tell what was happening, felt like I was watching Avp-R. The chase scene went on for way too long, it would pick up then fall flat and repeat. No gore? okay I can live with that. The characters were so forgettable I actually didn't notice which character was absent and doing the murders. I thought this film would have been better but it failed in the last half.Recommended to anyone interested in 80's horror, if you don't mind looking at a dark screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For six years, Hamilton High School seniors Kelly, Jude, Wendy, and Nick have been hiding the truth of what happened to ten-year-old Robin Hammond the day her body was discovered near an abandoned convent.The foursome have kept secret how they taunted Robin and backed her into a corner until she stood on a window ledge and fell to her death.Though it was an accident, they feared they'd be held responsible and vowed never to tell.But someone else was there that day watching.And now, that someone is ready to exact murderous revenge-on prom night...The most notable thing about this movie is the fact that this was one of the first stalk and slash movies where the killer wasn't really supernatural, just in mourning.And really there is nothing new to offer in this movie. The first hour of the film is Curtis and the other girls getting hassled by easily the most ugliest guy in high school, and thats really it.Once we are at the titular time, the film picks up a little, but you feel too exhausted to appreciate, and by the end of the movie, when we get the big unmasking, it's more meh, than ooohhh, so thats who it was.The cast are okay, apart from one girl who is just annoying, and the film feels like it's double its running time.At least the remake was so bonkers that it actually entertained a little, and the killer looked like Forrest Gump.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom? More of an Immac really</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a massive slasher fan, I like the good ones and I like the bad ones. But, the reason why I like the bad ones is because they're usually fun ie. "Urban Legends 2" or "Halloween Ressurrection" and they usually have a nice body count and some thrills. "Prom Night" was very disappointing because it was bad and it wasn't even fun. In fact I don't think that I would call it a slasher as there is only about 4 or 5 deaths! Some might defend it by saying it's old. Well, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Halloween" came out way before this. So it has no excuse.What was wrong with it then? Well, it wasn't so much that the first death doesn't occur until the last half hour although that was quite annoying. It just seemed like it was taking some aspects from "Carrie". The biggest similarities being that the final sequence is set at a prom and that woman and her hired goon look and act exactly like John Travolta and his girlfriend. However, "Carrie" works because it's not a slasher. I don't believe in a slow-burner slasher and even if this was meant to be one, the pay-off wasn't worth waiting around for an hour.It was annoying that most of the deaths, bar one, were off-screen so we couldn't see them! Honestly, the gore was the only thing that had going for this film and it decided to get rid of that. There was also only one chase scene, making the other deaths have zero suspense. The chase scene was also really poorly done, I shot a better short horror film when I was about 14 called "Caddy Killer" which was just a laugh and it resembled that chase scene with the long shots of people running, it was pathetic.The whole film was actually really poorly directed. It definitely says "Paul Lynch" not David! The lighting was all over the place, with some shots being really over-exposed and others being far too dark to see anything. I did like the idea of a "I Know What You Did Last Summer" set-up but its potential was unfortunately ruined by the poor tenseless writing and zero-suspense directing. The writing also was unnecessarily sexist, giving excuses for the women to go around wearing hardly anything or maybe just a bra because they're in the changing room.I don't particularly understand why Leslie Neilson was in this either. He didn't have a very big part and it wasn't a funny part either (the script carries virtually no wit at all). Jamie Lee was also far too good for this, her dancing was funny though, giving John Travolta a run for his money! The cast was far too old though to play they're parts, we're meant to believe these people are around 16? They were about 10 and then it says 6 years later. Some of them looked in there late 20's! "Prom Night" has very little going for it. It's pacing is slow, it's writing and directing poor and it's death scenes unimaginative and kept to a minimum. It also carries a very unsurprising ending in which we're meant to gasp in shock. There's actually a TV movie that's a big like this called "My Super Psycho Sweet Sixteen" and that's still better than this. Keep clear slasher fans, you aren't missing much here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little girl, in her little play clothes, dead. Who killed her?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, we know who killed her. But, the police don't. And that's what half this movie is about. If you go to see a horror movie about the prom, do you care about a police investigation? I doubt you do. And I don't either. There's probably some kind of heavily masked comedy in how the police are handling the investigation. But you won't find it because it's all blah, blah, blah. It's so boring. I've seen interesting police investigations. This isn't one of them. I even resent the fact that I have to address it in a commentary about the movie. That sucks up a good 20 minutes of the movie while it's getting going. And the police think the girl's death was sexually motivated. Should I laugh?Prom Night is a stalker film. And phones and mirrors are the killer's chosen methods of communication. Now, you've got to love that. It's cheap and tacky. And cheap and tacky can be fun. I miss the era of no Caller I.D. and no cell phones, and not much awareness about "crank" calling either. If you got a call from someone back then, they most likely knew who you were. And there was no way to identify them. This was only a short while after Black Christmas - the ultimate stalker film (I'd love to tell you why, and even though you probably know already, it would count as a Spoiler for another film). Prom Night just can't measure up. But that doesn't mean it doesn't score some points for tackiness. It's dated and a bit sleazy (though nowhere near as sleazy as the Friday the 13th series and really awful slasher films like Maniac and The Prowler). But the characters are handled far more intelligently than other slasher fare of this time (Graduation Day). And the disco dancing stuff actually has a moment of brilliance, during of course the "Prom Night" dancing number, where Jamie Lee Curtis shows off her amazing moves. Now we know why she's so confident in her acting style when she's not playing a mousy victim (she also does an impressive show in 1985's gym-drama Perfect).Lastly, since it's a horror film- we've of course got to talk violence and such. The killer wears a skintight black Cat costume. Now that's the kind of tacky I can do without. I think it might even have glitter all over it. The guy (or girl) in the thing also moves like a cat - or a professional gymnast (which the two most likely suspects for "The Killer" role could easily be) - and carries around an ax. Somehow, I find that look really silly and hard to pull off. The deaths are appropriately arty. Which I don't mind. The look of the whole movie is almost surreal (as in: blurry) and dreamlike (as in: hazy). So, it would actually make a decent 2nd feature for a double with Carrie (1976).In conclusion: it's entirely pointless and there's nothing really ambitious about it. But it's a better way to kill 90 minutes than to watch just about any new horror movie. I'll take tacky over toilet-chic any day of the week.</fullReview>

Basically Hamilton High School seniors Kelly (Mary Beth Rubens), Jude (Joy Thompson), Wendy (Anne-Marie Martin, or Eddie Benton) and Nick (Casey Stevens) accidentally killed ten-year-old Robin Hammond (Tammy Bourne) six years ago, when he fell out of a window, and have kept quiet about it ever since. Though it was an accident, the four students, well, three, receive phone calls from someone who knows their secret, and he plans revenge on the high school prom night. Starring Leslie Nielsen as Mr. Hammond, Jamie Lee Curtis as Kim, Antoinette Bower as Mrs. Hammond, Michael Tough as Alex, Robert A. Silverman as Sykes and Pita Oliver as Vicki. They say Curtis cemented her title as the Scream Queen with this, as it followed Halloween, but I'm afraid to say, I don't agree that it is that good, it is hardly gory, it only made me jump once, and it just isn't a very entertaining horror film. Adequate, in my opinion!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this is considered a slasher classic. Why exactly I don't know.It's not horrible or anything like that, there have certainly been worse slashers made. Intentionally or not (I believe the latter) the film does build up a certain amount of mood in the opening 50 minutes or so, with the introduction of the would-be victims. This flick drags on forever without anything really happening in that time, but somehow it goes by pretty nicely. Solid performances by Curtis and Leslie Nielsen could explain part of that.The execution of the all-important final third (i.e. the killings) is awfully poor. The kills are unimaginative, poorly timed and paced and very clumsily done. I did like the fact that the killer here fumbled a bit in trying to off the characters (after all; not everyone has the super powers of Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees) but editing here and lazy direction kill the suspense.Spoilers: Also, the red herrings! Talk about cheaply done. Throwing in an employee on the school grounds who's mysteriously present at odd moments and always gives the girls a sinister look and there's no payoff with the dude. He's just there to look suspicious.The maniac who escapes from a mental asylum and nothing happens with that dude either. Every viewer over the age of twelve knows he's not responsible for what's about to happen. And we're not even rewarded with an extra kill scene or something. This is cheap.And what happened to Leslie Nielsen and his wife? Did the ground eat them up? They just disappear and don't even show up for the dramatic finale! I agree with a reviewer who stated this fact and said only "lazy film-making".End of spoiler.Prom Night squanders it's potential in a big way. Now, I love good slashers and this film gets high marks for having Jamie Lee Curtis in it and Leslie Nielsen but I think 4 is being quite generous.Although I found it a novelty to have the big showdown in the end accompanied by cheesy disco music. I didn't look half-bad.Overall; Prom Night is disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad movie aside, it's also still a bad movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, there are horror films, there are bad horror films, and there are so bad they're good horror films. Each of them can be enjoyed, in general, provided the right sense of humor and mindset. But honestly, Prom Night is unique in the field of horror: it's really just unpleasantly bad. It has some obviously funny "bad" moments, but it's as if the punchlines fall flat or are completely forgotten. It doesn't have anything really scary. It's like listening to that one kid go, "Hey, want to hear a funny joke? A guy walks into a bar, and the bartender says... oh wait, wait, I messed it up. Okay, no, so the bartender is bartending when he sees this guy... no wait." Jamie Lee Curtis. Apparently, if her early slasher flicks are any indication, you never want to meet her brother. In this case, however, you wouldn't have to be so fretful. Jamie Lee herself doesn't factor into the equation as much as you'd think, and honestly if you're afraid of a bumbling guy dressed up like a ninja with an axe, then you deserve to run yourself into a corner like these characters do constantly. (On retrospect, "bumbling guy dressed up like a ninja with an axe" actually sounds a lot more cool than it ends up being in this movie. Maybe that's it's problem: it has a decent concept that was later ripped off by I Know What You Did Last Summer, but even when it had good things going for it it failed).Honestly, what makes this movie a curiosity to me is the fact that it's held as such a classic of cult horror slasher movies. After all, I understand the idea behind that cult and enjoy myself some horror movies of all types, bad or good. But this might as well have been one of those video productions that immediately went out of print six months after its release and disappeared into some vault, maybe to be resurrected by Troma twenty years later and sold in a dollar bin as kitsch. Instead, it's basically the worst well-known slasher flick from back-when I've ever seen.And that's just on the liminal horror movie level, with scares or humor or much of anything. On a completely different level, ugly people, bad music, terrible sets, over-exposure, and disgusting costume and art design honestly make this movie uncomfortable to watch through sheer tackiness. It's easy to see that it's a cheap production, and to a limited degree can be forgiven for that. But they obviously paid at least some money for those costumes and sets, and somebody was behind the camera at some point who probably shouldn't have been. It's honestly really hard to watch this movie because the imagery itself is just aesthetically bad.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? It was an hour and a half long, and by halfway through, you'd have expected something to have happened. Anything. Alas, it didn't. It wasn't gory, there were no screaming chicks, nothing. And, the closest to sexual content we got was Jamie Lee in a bra. (Okay, admittedly, that was kinda cool...) Overall though, no gore. No blood. No screaming. The plot had huge holes in it. It refused to tie up loose ends. And, lets face it, nobody likes disco. Missing all the important ingredients of a good slasher movie, I'm forced to deem this one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen, even by 80's standards. Seriously, I can't stress enough how much it was lacking. It was an episode of Dawson's Creek, set in the 80's, with some weird stuff going on at the end. How did the director get a loan for this pile?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "Prom" Has the Formula But Doesn't Seem to Cut It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prom Night", starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielson, is certainly a slasher movie but undoubtedly one of the worst of its kind. Why is was such a huge success in 1980 will be the biggest mystery that this low-budget Canadian flick has to offer. It is one of the most predictable films you will ever see, it isn't relatively scary or gruesome, and the entire production cost of the film seems to be misguided.The film is about a killer targeting four high school kids on the day of their prom who were responsible for the accidental death of a girl seven years beforehand. That's about all the movie has to offer. Both Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielson are not targets, and if really feels as if all their stardom is really wasted and that they were simply written into the script to have some kind of name behind the movie.Unlike "Halloween", which "Prom Night" almost directly clones at parts, this movie lacks the characterization and substance that creates a genuinely scary slasher movie. Its mystery is fruitless with no attempts at a plot twist. The entire first part of the film is just tiresome and boring.While "Prom Night" certainly is by no means a good slasher film, or film in general, it is a fun flick to observe. You most likely won't get scared by it, but there may be some laughs at the film, especially the goofy disco soundtrack that is truly one of the more memorable parts of the entire movie. Probably the best part of this movie is a chase scene involving one of the killer's targets through the school during the actual prom dance. The chase scene is actually very entertaining, well done, and overall suspenseful - in other words this ten minute chase scene is worth putting yourself through the rest of the movie. You won't be disappointed by that one part."Prom Night" sort of has a very similar feeling to it that "I Know What You Did Last Summer" has. The latter, which is more famous in today's society and certainly a better overall movie, might be the one to look for if you are after a good, entertaining night. However if you are looking for a piece of 80's memorabilia, then "Prom Night" is the one to bring home.All DVD versions of "Prom Night" are pretty bare bones, offering up only a trailer at best. Prehaps when the 2008 remake, starring Brittany Snow of "John Tucker Must Die" is released, there may be a special edition of the original just for those who actually like it. "Halloween", "The Fog", and "Terror Train" are all Jamie Lee Curtis vehicles that are recommended over "Prom Night".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ehhhh...it's OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night is ridiculous, convoluted, and probably one of the cheesiest slasher films I've ever seen. However, this doesn't mean it doesn't offer some entertainment value. If you're looking to laugh get a few scares here and there this Halloween season then Prom Night should definitely be on your list.Prom Night came out a time when slasher films were all the rage in the 80's. After the success of Halloween there were a string of imitators with Friday the 13th becoming wildly popular. If anything, Friday the 13th showed filmmakers that slasher films didn't have to be smart. They could be merely entertaining throwaway flicks that make a quick buck but lack artistic integrity. So after Friday the 13th the slasher movie machine began pumping out flick after flick of slasher mediocrity and this is definitely one of them. The only thing truly significant is that they some how got Leslie Nielson to star in this and Jamie Lee Curtis would further solidify herself as the scream queen of the late 70's and early 80's.The plot has classic slasher movie conventions written all over it. A girl plummets to her death while fleeing from the taunts of four vicious classmates. Years then pass and now it's prom night for the children that survived the incident. Soon someone begins taking vengeance against them for their childhood sin but whoever can it be?!? My biggest problem with Prom Night is that it has the potential to be something pretty good. The plot could be quite effective but you can tell the fillmmakers had no intention of making this at all memorable, at least not for the right reasons. The film has developed a bit of a cult following on video and DVD but not because it's scary or, even good. The following is based on how incredibly flawed the movie is and lets not forget the insanely funny disco soundtrack. If anything Prom Night represents a time in the 80's where slasher films portrayed all their characters as stupid cardboard cutouts who are just featured to be killed in horrific ways. I own the film and I know I'm panning but as a fan of the slasher genre it is a rather entertaining movie watch and make fun of with friends. Sometimes slasher films exist for that purpose alone.None of the acting is worth mentioning. Not even Jamie Lee Curtis is good here and you can tell this was her trying to wide the success she had with Halloween. Of all the horror films she appeared in after Halloween, this is certainly her at her weakest. The rest of the cast consist of unknowns who haven't seemed to have gotten much work lately. I wonder why? Then there is the ski mask killer of the piece who is a rather weak and unimpressive presence in the film. The creepy phone call thing works the first few times then it just gets stale and while he is effective during a chase scene towards the end of the film, the scene isn't quite long enough to really register. He also takes a bit too long to make an appearance. The film is practically almost over before he makes his first full appearance.If you want to have a cheesy horror movie night with friends for Halloween then Prom Night should be on your list. It's completely mediocre but at 94 minutes it could provide you with some big laughs and a few cheap scares. Plus there is a disco dance off in it, you at least need to witness THAT moment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disco Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prom Night" stole a lot from "Carrie," but it stands up as an above average feature from the "carve up the teenagers" school of horror, with some nice campy touches courtesy of the disco-themed prom.One of the reasons "Prom Night" works fairly well is that it takes it time getting started so we get a chance to know the victims to be?shy Kelly, wallflower Jude, bitchy Wendy, geeky Slick?and actually feel some compassion for them when they are slaughtered (even for Wendy who whatever else you can say against her puts up one hell of a fight for her life). There are several genuinely frightening moments involving the female characters when they are alone in the school after classes have ended with a mentally impaired janitor who may or may not be the killer (I first saw this film when I was still in high school myself and never felt entirely comfortable in it after hours again) The movie is also suspenseful enough so that we remain uncertain about the identity of the murderer until the very end (the clues are there, however, for the careful viewer).As is often the case with this sort of film, most of the teenaged characters look old enough to be playing the teachers. However, the cast is for the most part competent, with Jamie Lee Curtis standing out as the spunky decent heroine who ends the mayhem, although the would be lounge lizard Slick and the obnoxious but somehow hilarious Lou?look out for his yearbook picture?almost steal the film. "Prom Night" is no masterpiece, but some genuine shocks and wonderfully schlocky disco dance routines make this an enjoyable 90 minutes worth of viewing.</fullReview>

A bunch of kids,on accident kill a girl,then 6 years later they get phone calls from some mysterious phone calls filled with vulgar and threatening utters. It's just so happens Prom Night and Jamie Lee is prom queen,which is no point; she barely gets attacked;and when she does she flings a bunch of chairs at the girl(or whatever it was,some kind of transvestite).The action begins after the first hour then proceeds. It doesn't really live up to its "chilling" title,so if your looking for some frightening film,don't pick it. Bonus:Jamie Lee Curtis does the disco and a head rolls on to the stage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom Night (1980) BOMB</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching PROM NIGHT on videotape somewhere around 1985 and thinking it was an exceptionally terrible movie, even for a Slasher film. I couldn't recall why, so recently when I acquired a free copy of the DVD as a gift I decided to watch it a second time. Well, now that makes a total of three hours of my lifetime that I shall never get back; PROM NIGHT is still a terrible film, and easily one of the worst and most unsatisfying entries in the early '80s Splatter Genre. At only 89 minutes in length, nothing occurs until one hour into it (I actually watched my counter to make sure I noticed the timing, and it was almost exactly at the 1:00 mark). Jamie Lee Curtis was cast in the movie because of her status at the time as a "horror queen" after the successful HALLOWEEN, but she's pretty much reduced to window dressing here. Insanely, the actor who receives top billing is none other than good old Leslie Nielsen, but he must have been doing it to pay off a couple of overdue phone bills or something, as he's only in it briefly, and in scenes that have nothing much to do with anything. And that pretty much sums up the whole show in itself... it's just a lot of unrelated scenes of nothing, all adding up to a load of nothing (what's with those padded police investigations?). It's not hard to figure out who the killer is either, and if you're a fan of this type of slaughter film, let me assure you that there are many other places to locate more effective chop-'em-up mayhem and gore; this limp rag is D.O.A. - 0 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prom Night (1980) Jamie Lee Curtis, Leslie Nelson. Plot: After four 10-year old friends are responsible for the death of young Robyn Hammond (And Might I add, they don't tell anyone about it), a man is wrongly captured, and deformed because of a car accident slightly before. Six years later, on Prom Night HE HAS ESCAPED! He will have is revenge! Meanwhile, Kim Hammond (Jamie Lee Curtis), Nick, Wendy, and (The other girls name escapes me), are all getting obscene phone calls that say things like "Can you come out to play... Tonight?".In my opinion, Prom Night is a classic, and I love it! My Favourite part of the movie is the big climactic scene (Which I wont give away to anyone reading). I don't get why people hate it so much, but meh.......7/10Yay Prom Night!</fullReview>

Which means watching over an hour of disco dancing and more of the darkness as noted above. Boring!3. Anything with Jamie Lee Curtis is usually a safe bet -- but not this, except for a few brief shots of her in her bra and of Mary Beth Rubens.I suggest Prom Night 2 instead of this dated, boring flick.

		<shortDescription>Good 80's Slasher Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie moves slow to a great ending. When I was eleven or twelve I had my mom rent this movie for me just because I was some what of a Jamie Lee Curtis fan and loved her work in the Halloween films (The First Two, 7 and 8 don't count in my book.) When I put this in I was sorta board for about the first thirty minutes or so but then the movie picks up the pace and finishes fast and bloody. If you have never watched this be patient during the beginning as you will be rewarded. I love Jamie in this as the last girl as she always is. The saving grace of this film though is the character of Slick, he is funny and I wished he had lived so he could maybe have been in the movies follow ups. Watch for him in his van, you'll laugh forever. One problem I've always had with the film is what the heck happens to Lesily Nielsons character, does he die, or go home. I guess it will never be solved. Watch this movie for the splatter and a good story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prom Night is the red-headed step child of Carrie and Halloween. It's a slasher that largely goes nowhere until the last act, which takes place at the prom. And it's horribly dated. Just look at Jamie Lee's disco dance-off scene. Ouch. It also features one of the loooooongest stalking sequences ever. It goes on forever. You might find yourself screaming at your television "Kill 'em already!" It's especially annoying because the lighting is so bad you can't see much action. The one thing this movie has going for it is the killer's identity isn't all that predictable. They throw a lot of red herrings in the mix to throw you off. I think it works more or less. It was also nice to see Leslie Nielson in a serious role and Jamie Lee Curtis is nice to look at in this one. That's about it. DO NOT expect another Halloween here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prom Night (1980) C-87 min. D: Paul Lynch. Leslie Nielsen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Casey Stevens, Anne-Marie Martin, Antoinette Bower, Michael Tough, Robert A. Silverman, Pita Oliver, David Mucci, Jeff Wincott, Mary Beth Rubens, George Touliatos. Dimly lit, badly executed slasher film wastes the talents of Nielsen and Curtis (who combined have 10 minutes of screen time, if that) and also wastes a pretty good slasher idea: killer stalks prom goers. Contains elements of both SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (i.e. the killer calling his/her victims, friends vowing never to reveal deadly secret) so we know where Kevin Williamson got his ideas from. But the film is very hard to watch due to the poor lighting and there aren't any murders for the first hour or so, making it hard to appeal to any tastes. Fans of Curtis and Nielsen might want to check it out. FYI: the killer's identity is so blatantly obvious from the opening scene, it should come as no surprise even to new slasher fans. Also, they picked a bad spot to roll the opening credits. RATING: 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

You couldnt help but feel remorse for this senseless cruel act perpetrated by the older cooler kids in town. The best scene was the chase scene with the chick who was wearing the metallic red gown. It was the scariest, I mean, you knew he was going to get her!!, you just didnt know when or where. The ending was really sad and pathetic, the heroine shined for like five minutes and that was that. The music was horrible, totally not the disco we knew of or even heard of.

		<fullReview>"Prom Night" takes all the elements of more successful horror films, but doesn't have any style or content to make it a worthwhile feature. It follows the standard mad slasher formula: something bad happens in the past and years later, on the anniversary of the crime, a killer takes revenge. And like most others in the genre it takes place on a special occasion in this case the high school prom. The tragedy in this film is the death of a young girl as her peers are teasing her. Each one of the kids involved in her death vows never to tell anyone, but of course, somebody witnessed it and plans to get even with them. So, SIX YEARS LATER, on the day of the prom, the masked killer goes into action. He starts by calling all of the kids to warn them and they are required by the plot to pass it off as a crank call. Later, he cuts out their yearbook pictures and places them in each of their respective lockers with malicious implications. Again, they don't take note of the warning. And by the time the prom begins, they have all but forgotten their threats (they all must have ADD). The movie tries to be a mystery setting up possible suspects such as the weird greens keeper or a horribly burned mental patient, but even those with the lowest IQ can figure out who the killer is. Since none of the victims seem to have any remorse about what they did or have any interesting personality corks, it is hard to develop any sympathy for them. They all have the old clichéd teenager problems such as getting a date, competing for attention, and not giving in to their desires. And when there in danger they act so stupidly that they almost deserve to die. For example, the masked assailant is chasing a girl and first she locks herself in a car, miraculously, she manages to escape, only to hide in a storage closet. At least the murders are done with a minimal amount of blood and gore.The star of the film, Jamie Lee Curtis, isn't even involved with the revenge plot and only is in danger at the very end of the movie because the killer targets her boyfriend. Oddly enough her scenes are almost unconnected to the rest of the movie. The best scene in the film has to be when she and her boyfriend do a cheesy spot light dance. And people wonder why disco went out of style. The film also stars Leslie Nielson, who got top billing, but disappears half way through the picture. It's as if the producers told him that this wasn't a comedy.</fullReview>

This movie starts out slowly, with many boring scenes, but slowly degenerates into a quite watchable film. There are some good shocks, and the chase scene through the campus is riveting. It would have been better if it had better lighting though. Plus, the sound and picture are not very good. Overall, a mild film that takes to long to start, and just when it gets good, it ends too quickly. A must for Jamie Lee Curtis fans!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not good slasher film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First film in the unconnected PROM NIGHT series, has a masked maniac making threatening calls to six teenagers responsible for the death of a little girl when they were all children six years prior. When said girl fell to her death from a second story window, in an old abandon high school, after the kids playing a twisted version of hide &amp; seek, scared her &amp; teased her, when they didn't want her to play. Vowing to keep what happened a secret, the kids eventually forget about the incident &amp; move on. However someone can't let it go &amp; sets into the act of killing them off one by one, at their high school prom. Canadian made horror item made to cash in on the success of HALLOWEEN is okay, but nothing all that memorable or exciting &amp; nowhere near as good or as scary as that film. The film takes several cues from various slasher films such as the "prank gone wrong" story, the "whodunit approach" the "escaped mental patient" The Halloween approach of a murder done in the past, that now haunts the present because it has gone unavenged etc. JAMIE LEE CURTIS leads a cast of mostly unknowns &amp; her appearance along with that of the late LESLIE NIELSEN, before he went onto do slapstick comedy like the NAKED GUN series, is the only real good acting the film has to offer &amp; even the acting from these two isn't all that great (although Curtis was trying to get out of the slasher genre, so maybe she wasn't giving her all in the role on purpose?) with the rest of the cast being mediocre, cardboard cut outs at best &amp; none to memorable either &amp; looking far to old to be attending high school &amp; the film isn't helped much by bland characterization &amp; clichéd, stock, stereotypical characters, we see in so many slasher films of it's kind, the snooty rich girl, the creepy janitor who may or may not be the killer, the virginal heroine, the caring boyfriend etc. in fact &amp; I can't believe I'm going to say this, especially where the slasher film is concerned, it could be argued that the characters are a little to detailed. Director PAUL LYNCH fares well behind the camera, delivering several cool shots throughout the film &amp; manages to stage a few effective suspenseful moments, unfortunately the film is burdened with a hazy, soft look, that makes it look not only overblown, but like you're watching a really old, bad soap opera &amp; the films many death sequences &amp; suspense scenes lack the amount of impact they could have had, simply because Director Paul Lynch uses very little lighting, to the point where one has to lean forward &amp; squint their eyes to try &amp; make out what's happening (a similar fate befell the same director, producer &amp; writer's next film, the less successful, but still fun monster opus, HUMONGOUS) &amp; the plot is to crammed full of pointless subplots such as the cop who arrested the sex offender &amp; the sex offenders Doctor teaming up to try &amp; locate the psycho, the tangled love life between Kim &amp; her new love &amp; his ex-girlfriend, the snooty rich girl named Wendy who wants him back &amp; who teams with the school bully to hatch a plan that will ruin the prom for her ex &amp; Kim, since they were selected as homecoming King &amp; Queen &amp; the whodunit approach between the escaped mental patient, the creepy caretaker of the school who constantly watches the kids &amp; one of the group of kids who may or may not be the killer. Director Lynch is also not very careful when looking at dailies either, since the boom Mic is painfully visible a couple times throughout the picture, especially in a scene set in the gym where Curtis is talking to the snobbish girl Wendy early on in the film, which may invoke a few unintended chuckles. Perhaps that's the film best twist in it's plot, by making the audience think it's the escaped lunatic, blamed for the little girls death is doing the killing, when in fact he's not &amp; also takes a page from Black Christmas, with the threatening, weird phone calls the killer makes to his intended victims. The films body count doesn't kick in until the last twenty minutes of the film &amp; even then a lot of the kills aren't really worth the wait, since the camera cuts away from the action most of the time. All in all, PROM NIGHT is an okay film, it's worth a watch, but to say it's one of the best slasher films the 1980's had to offer is really pushing it. In fact pretty much all the sequels that followed this one, even though unconnected, were much better than this film. On a side note, the opening sequence that sees the death of the little girl caused by the three girls &amp; boy at the beginning of the film, where one of the girls makes them swear to secrecy over the accident, they have caused in order to avoid getting in trouble, by the police, is similar to I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER'S plot, since KEVIN WILLIAMSON wrote SCREAM (Which brought this film up a couple of times) &amp; I KNOW, it could be argued that this film may have been an inspiration for the plot of I KNOW, since they are so similar. A film released in 2008 with the same title that also claimed to be a remake, is no remake at all of this film, just a similar themed movie that bears no plot connections &amp; just happened to take the title to help it sell better. Avoid seeing the 2008 film, it's beyond terrible. Followed by three unconnected sequels starting with the much better, HELLO MARY LOU: PROM NIGHT II** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly Slasher Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little girl accidentally falls out of the window of an abandoned building while she is playing with a group of older kids. The older kids swear never to reveal what happened that day. The only problem is that someone else saw the whole thing. Fast forward about 10 years and the kids are now high school students preparing for their senior prom. But someone is stalking them...someone who saw what they did and is determined to make them all pay with their lives.That said, it's pretty easy to figure out who the killer is in this film, so the time in between is filled with half dressed girls in steamy locker rooms, lots of really silly disco-dancing and a ski-masked killer in black who spends a lot of time chasing a bitchy blond girl through shadowy corridors with an ax. There's a few red herrings thrown into the mix in the shape of an escaped murderer and a creepy janitor, but though the final reveal will come as no surprise, it's well done, complete with a nasty beheading and a heroic Jamie Lee Curtis. If you liked Halloween and Friday the 13th, you may want to check this one out as well. It's dumb, but it's fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blatant Rip-off of Halloween</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this film is a blatant rip of Halloween. First, and most obviously, is the "holiday-gone-bad" aspect. The rest I realized as I watched this film immediately after "Halloween". The film starts in the past, just as Halloween does. Second, the presumed killer in Prom Night is hounded by a cop, just as Halloween's Meyers is hounded by his psychiatrist. Third, the killer escapes from an asylum and drives a distinctive, stolen vehicle. Four the killer has been catatonic since the original incident and five, his car is seen in the background of a couple of scenes. This film is different, however, as it does not want you to assume the escaped lunatic is the killer, and instead gives you about 15 choices. This "guess" the killer is pretty well done, and doesn't resort to its psuedo-remakes trick of throwing an entirely new suspect in at the last moment. The rest of the film, aside from this one novelety is rather boring. The whole set-up lacks suspense and direction. The whole affair feels like a late 70's movie-of-the-week. The film was obviously shot in Canada and suffers from a very 70s Canadian horror film look and feel. All of the characters are quickly glossed over and stereotyped, probably due to the aforementioned gimmick of "everyone-a-suspect" which requires a lot of time. The film doesn't really get going until the last half hour, and then killing after killing is fit into the film. Unfortunately, its not even all that so-bad-its-funny; its mostly just mediocre. There are a few scenes that will amuse: the whole "Saturday Night Fever" sequence; the fact that the Prom, and indeed the whole film has only one disco song in it, played over and over; the final murder sequence which is difficult to believe as its background is the aformentioned disco song; and the fact that half of these "high school students" look to be at least 28. To be honest, I felt the orginal trailers included on the end of the tape I rented were better than the entire film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Was I Under the Impression This Was A Classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As kids, a group of friends push a girl out of a window and she dies in a most heinous manner. Many years later, the same friends (who look thirty, but are apparently eighteen) are ready to go to the prom, but a masked killer wants them all dead. Is it the madman who recently escaped from the insane asylum? To find out, you will have to wait for the shocking conclusion...As my headline proclaims, I thought this was a horror classic. And I still think some people think it is, because they made numerous sequels and a lackluster remake recently came out. But I want to know why. This film was mostly boring, with really awful lighting and characters I could not keep straight or give two figs about. It comes across as something like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" (only much earlier, obviously), except for one major difference: the girl who gets killed in the beginning is certainly very dead.Director Paul Lynch should not take pride in this. Not that he has done anything to really take pride in (besides some decent episodes of "Star Trek"). If I were to sit down and enjoy a chai tea with Paul, I would have so many questions to ask him about what possessed him to make such an awful film. And then I would make him buy my tea. (Though, to be fair, this was an early attempt from him, having really only worked on the forgotten "Blood &amp; Guts", which was also written by "Prom Night"'s William Gray, who penned the much better "The Changeling" that same year.)The casting is confusing. Leslie Neilsen appears, in a serious role, but he adds essentially nothing to the movie for the brief moments he is in it. Jamie Lee Curtis, fresh from "Halloween", shows up as the heroine and I think we are supposed to think she is an attractive teenager. But she looks like a 30-year old cross-dressing man. If people in 1980 thought this was sexy, I am really glad I was not around to be a part of that. Then again, my friend Seth still does, so who knows? All the other actors are forgettable, besides maybe Sheldon Rybowski, the guy who plays Slick.Only one scene in the entire movie was actually cool for the horror fans, and you will have to wait for over an hour to see it -- and if you blink or do not have slow-motion on your DVD player, you may likely miss it. I will not say what happens, but a character gets killed. Very quickly.There is also a really elaborate dancing scene (that I hope is in the remake, but disco probably is not cool anymore). I enjoyed that, and I freely admit it. So, despite all the trash I talk in this review, I have to confess there were parts I liked... oh, you know, like every scene with Slick.I suppose with the remake having come out, you should watch the original first. Might give you some perspective. I thought it was safe to say the new one would be vastly superior, especially if they had cast up and coming starlets like Mary Elizabeth Winstead. But they did not, and that is just my personal bias. So, it seems the old boring film might be better than the new... a small miracle, really. The one thing that is hard about being a horror fan is trying to explain why Jamie Lee Curtis is a horror actress... and I just do not have the heart to defend her. Do not watch this film unless you want to be confused and disappointed.Synapse Films is releasing a 2K digital restoration in 2014. I was able to catch an advance screening, though I have to say it falls under that old story: you can polish a poop, but it is still a poop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, Terrible, Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night (directed by Paul Lynch) is a blatantly obvious rip off of Halloween. Starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Neilson, this is a typical slasher flick.The plot is fairly simple. Kids are playing some kind of chasey-killer game and accidentally kill a girl, they vow to never tell anyone. Six years later, those four people start getting scary phone calls.This movie had a good plot and could have been quite good, but it flops miserably. The killings don't start until about the one-hour mark which is much to long. And even when they start they are boring, unoriginal kills and they are mostly all off-screen.It is a very darkly lit movie, the last half-hour is a struggle to watch.I can only give this one and a half out of five. And thats only because Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Neilson are quite good and add a touch of class. Plus there is a lengthy chase scene, but the death is so lame I don't want to think about it.1?/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disco isn't the only thing that sucks in this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening scenes that set the plot of the film to the first "revenge murder", there is almost 40 minutes of slow character development, minimal suspense, and tons of pain (bad dialogue, bad acting, bad music, etc. etc.)As if the slow wait isn't bad enough, once the killer does strike, you see next to nothing. Someone gets their throat slit open and all you see is their eyes bulge out. Another girl gets killed with an ax and it's so dark, you see shadows and that's about it.If the gore was left out to make the film seem more like a respectable suspense thriller, it failed. There was no suspense and no thrills. The only thing that makes a cheesy slasher horror film worth watching is the gore (and maybe a little suspense here and there).Horrid soundtrack (all disco) + no suspense + no gore = BAD FILM.If you want to watch a good people-get-killed-at-a-prom movie, go rent "Carrie".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prom Night is one of those slasher films regarded as a classic, but it seems the only reason is because it featured Jamie Lee Curtis. Jamie Lee is an excellent actress but seems bored all the way through this film. Prom Night starts off promising with some great camera-work and what seems to be an attempt to build suspense, but soon loses steam. About 3 quarters into the film I was wondering if I was watching a slasher or a high school drama, because nothing really happens until the end. When things do start to happen, your senses are bombarded with cheesy disco music and some tedious stalk and slash scenes which are completely devoid of suspense. There is also no real gore apart from a severed head. The severed head scene is cool in a cheesy way, but that's about it. Watch this if you must, but please stop billing it as a classic. Halloween was a classic, and even Terror Train had something going for it, but Jamie Lee was really slumming it with Prom Night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eh mediocre slasher!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing I really watched this film for was for Jaime Lee Curtis. She is a scream queen without a doubt but this movie itself was lacking the biggest part of being called a Slasher film. It was missing the creative kills that we are all used to. In a way it was boring and it only had about 4 or 5 kills in total, so it's really nothing special when it comes to a body count. It did have a great suspenseful chase when Wendy is being chased by the man with the axe. It really seemed like a low budgeted movie from the 80's that leeches on the fact that it has one of the most notable and famous scream queens. Surprisingly Leslie Nielsen is in it for about 10 or 15 minutes at the most as Jaime Lee Curtis's father and tell you what he'd always be the last person I'd assume was in a slasher film. This movie had a good storyline though and a great twist at the end. Overall, I give it a 4 out of 10 which is actually not too bad because I gave Terror train a 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Sixties, a group of children are playing a game in a decrepit and abandoned convent school when a younger kid attempts to join them (Robyn). The kids begin to bully Robyn, accidentally getting her killed, and they make a pact to keep it a secret. The cops on scene assume it was a pedophile and Robyn's murder is forgotten... but somebody saw the 'accident' and they want to avenge Robyn...Prom Night follows the lives of the group of children now in high school, each preparing for the supposed most romantic night of their lives, unknowing that a killer is lurking. Could it be Mister Sykes, the pervy school janitor? Could it be Luke, the school thug? Or is it someone much closer to home? The soundtrack was written by the man responsible for the soundtrack to the 1981 horror classic 'My Bloody Valentine', Paul Zaza. The acting was great, the plot suspenseful and a funny yet creepy movie, especially to watch with friends. The only scene that seemed to drag a bit was the scene where the popular girl is chased down by the killer, it got a little boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prom Night is one of those few horror films with good motive, and plot. Sure, it can lag, but so can every murder mystery film. Although most would call foul for the lack of blood and gore, I think this actually helps the film. The kills are neat, brutally methodical acts of revenge and malice. The atmosphere is heavy enough to drown in, and the score is moody and creepy, giving the horrible sense that someone vicious waits in the dark... Probably the point that sold me on this film were the sinister phone calls. That hissing, nasty voice sets up tension like nothing else. Although the killer is not some ugly, looming monster, I still found them menacing, but then again, I'd be scared of my grandmother if she stood in a darkened hallway holding an ax and blocking my path. Anyhow, is it a masterpiece? Not in the technical sense, but if you like murder mysteries on the darker side, watch this. It'll be a scream..literally!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A competent and funky entry from the slasher hey-day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with slasher films from the late seventies and early eighties is that, in addition to bad hair and flares, is that they strike the modern viewer as horrendously clichéd. Yeah, we know that these are the films that set up the clichés, but this still doesn't go any way to reducing the feeling of?well, having seen it all before?and "Prom Night", released in 1980, is no exception. All of the main tropes are in force here: the horrendous secret kept for many years, the anniversary of said horrendous event, menacing phone calls (not as menacing as those in that seminal slasher flick "Black Christmas" though), and of course the butchering of sexually active teens who also use soft drugs. However, even given the predictable nature of the slasher genre, the joy of a good slasher has always been what can be done within such rigid criteria and "Prom Night" certainly makes an admirable effort by avoiding the "Halloween" style killer-that-can't-be-stopped motif or a "Black Christmas" style killer-we-never-see either but instead opts for (ultimately) humanising the killer which lends a degree of genuine pathos when the killer is revealed. Saying this, it definitely could have been a better film as the pace is slow from taking a long time to get going and a lot of scenes (the funky prom dancing) go on longer than they should. Overall, "Prom Night" is a watchable (if slightly boring in parts) slasher-flick which is better than many other films in the genre but nowhere near as good as it could have been.</fullReview>

With no high-contrast lighting, no color (except for holidays), with fairly common camera shots, also achieved by slasher that feeling where you look. Including the great principle of the film and all attributes that have served as a school for the other films, is recommended.

		<shortDescription>This Prom's A Bit Of A Drag, But Fun Nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first started watching PROM NIGHT about four or five years ago because it starred the famous Jamie Lee Curtis, but gave up on it about twenty-thirty minutes in just because nothing was happening. I finally managed to force myself to finish it, and it wasn't too bad.Ten years ago, four friends (Wendy, Kelly, Jude, and Nick) unintentionally made a girl their age fall to her death. Now, they're seniors and it's the day of the prom. All four have dates, and even Nick is going with Kim, the sister of the girl that died ten years prior. But on prom, someone begins killing them off one by one. Is it the principal, who was the father of the murdered girl ten years prior? Is it the brother of that girl? Is it the man who was convicted of the crime, but has escaped from a mental institution recently? Or is it the creepy gardener? PROM NIGHT really is an endurance test for slasher fans. The first fifty odd minutes consist of nothing but "character-building," which mostly amounts to just talking about who's dating who and other crap. Granted, there are some entertaining characters and some of the character-building does succeed in creating likable characters, but it is still difficult to make it through that length of time unscathed.However, fifty minutes in, the prom begins. And that's when the fun begins. Flashing, colored lights, disco music, Leslie Nielson, and disco dancing. Nielson was in the film before the prom, but still. There's about a three-minute long period where Curtis's character (Kim) disco dances with her boyfriend. It's wonderful. There are some kills, but they're not that bloody. There is some great suspense, especially in the chase scene with Wendy. The film's most memorable moment, however, is when the ski-mask clad killer decapitates one poor teen (who he thinks is Nick), and his head rolls out onto the catwalk! I still stand by my theory that PROM NIGHT is only famous because of Ms. Curtis, but it's still a fun watch if you have the patience to wait for the last forty minutes or so. Gotta love that "Prom Night" disco song, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some say "Prom Night" qualifies as a classic, some say it was just a cash-in on the at the time current fad of slasher films. Hmm... actually that also describes "Friday the 13th"Actually it tells its innovative storyline, which is different, considerably so, to other noteworthy slasher flicks. It wasn't jumping on the excessive violence bandwagon either, featuring little gore. Unfortunately, I'm not sure the story it tells is actually any good, mainly because it provides odd character focus.Years ago, four kids accidentally kill a girl and cover it up. In the present day, well, these kids receive threatening phone calls, however the movie focuses primarily on the dead girl's brother and sister, who aren't actually in danger. Less important characters in jeopardy reduces the stakes and we really don't get much emotional investment in the potential victims - the most central is the boyfriend (maybe) of the dead girl's sister.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge on your Prom Night!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night is an average slasher which doesn't too badly to today's standards. It was OK and I liked it, I just found that there could have been so much more going on for it! Here's why I didn't like Prom NIght as much as I could've: Well the story was really interesting and I liked it a lot. Some killer getting revenge on students at their Prom Night for unknown reasons was definitely a perfect story, but what my problem with it was when the film dragged on for too long, the film's story was at a faint and it didn't feel like the story I had known.There was too much waiting going on and it dragged on for far too long. Trust me, I love slow, 80's slasher films like "Halloween II" and "The Burning" but there wasn't as much happening here as I had hoped, so it was lost in that perspective. Even if I liked some additional scenes, it felt like it was carrying a heavy boulder.That's my huge down falls of this film but I did not hate it at all, I just thought it could've been more. Here are the aspects of this average slasher which I believe work decently.The unknown killer killing for mostly unknown reasons were done really well. The killings were very fast paced and were effective. The music was daunting, creepy and very 80's style. Even the disco like music made this have a creepy edge. I also think the director's casting was well done. Leslie Nelson and Jamie Lee Curtis. Good choices there! Anyway, Even if I found this boring and decent at the same time, I would definitely stay away from the tragic, unworthy remake which didn't improve on this film at all.This pleased me a little bit. Haven't seen it in a while, maybe watching it again will change my mind.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is kind of a wall flower! It starts with a bunch of kids playing in an abandoned warehouse. Little, tag-along sister falls out a second story window and dies. The remaining kids make a pact to never speak of this again. Six years later on the anniversary of the lil' kid's death, on which date the Big Prom Event is also taking place, someone starts to stalk and kill the irresponsible punks who never reported their evil deed. Jamie Lee Curtis is fine as the dead girl's older sister and Leslie Nielsen plays it straight as her father and the local principal but it's Ann-Marie Martin who gets the most points for her portrayal of the catty Wendy, really the only entertaining person in the film. I'll bump it from 2 to 3 stars just for her.There is scarce blood, less suspense, paltry thrills and a complete and tragic lack of nekkid, rutting teens so I'd give this one a pass unless you're an 80's slasher fan or a Jamie Lee Curtis completest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nifty 80's teen mystery slasher winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four seniors who all share a terrible secret are stalked and bumped off by a mysterious vengeful killer during the night of the high school prom. Director Paul Lynch, working from an engrossing script by William Gray, relates the absorbing story at a steady pace, develops and sustains a sizable amount of suspense, and stages the murder set pieces with real flair and skill (a lengthy protracted chase sequence is especially tense, gripping, and exciting). Better still, there's a strong underlying theme about the painful loss of childhood innocence, the killer's identity is a real surprise, and the ending manages to be both moving and thrilling in equal measure. The sound acting from the capable cast helps matters a whole lot: Jamie Lee Curtis makes for an appealing lead as the sweet Kim, Anne-Marie Martin contributes a marvelously hateful performance as snippy and stuck-up bitch Wendy, underrated character actor Robert Silverman has a cool part as creepy janitor Sykes, plus there's praiseworthy work by Casey Stevens as Kim's affable and protective brother Nick, Pita Oliver as Kim's loyal gal pal Vicki, David Mucci as surly troublemaker Lou, Mary Beth Evans as sensitive virgin Kelly, and Joy Thompson as the bubbly Jude. Alas, Leslie Nielsen is wasted in a pretty insubstantial role as principal Mr. Hammond. Although decidedly light on heavy duty gore, there's still a pleasingly juicy decapitation by ax at the conclusion. The fantastic throbbing disco soundtrack hits the get-down groovy spot and the sequence with Jamie Lee busting some gnarly John Travolta-style moves on the dance floor is simply priceless. Robert C. News's slick cinematography provides a bright glittery look and makes neat use of a restless prowling camera. The shivery score by Paul Zaza and Carl Zittrer does the shuddery trick. A most worthwhile slice'n'dice opus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of a let-down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting a really good slasher movie with some gruesome death scenes.Since it had Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielson, I'd figure that this movie was going to be great.Some things just don't go the way you wanted them to.'Prom Night' is an example of that phrase.The movie starts of good, but the fact that the movie takes almost an hour just to get to the murders made me want to turn the channel.What the movie needed was constant violence that happened at least 10 to 15 minutes.This isn't a bad movie, it just needed more energy and a spark that most slasher movies have.To be honest, I thought that the underrated remake was better.At least that movie had some decent potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eddie Benton-Anne-Marie Martin OWNS this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't yet seen the remake and I probably won't due to the fact that most updatings are really unnecessary IF the original source material gets as much press and has the cult following that this film has. So, I dusted off my old full screen DVD copy AND an old wide screen VHS and revisited this cool trendsetter. I dig Jamie Lee Curtis and she fully deserves her scream queen status yet I have to admit that Anne Marie Martin AKA Eddie Benton successfully steals the film from JLC and everyone involved! Simultaneously vile and amazingly gorgeous (Anne's only equal at the time was the just as striking Deborah Harry), the 'wendy' subplot really helped move the film along even though it was just a portion of 'Carrie' (1976) revamped! And you really have to give a film serious credit when the supporting actress possesses the film and takes it away from the rightful star Curtis.While everyone knows the storyline (highschoolers stalked on Prom Night at an atmospheric coastal school) the film also benefits from a demanding visual style (i.e. intercutting of beginning storyline with the killer's phone calls, flashbacks of escaped fugitive, etc.) that is equal to another modest budget slasher flick around the same time: the very good 'Silent Scream' (1980) which I was lucky enough to see in a theater at the time ('Friday The 13th' (1980) was sold out!).So, nothing new to add just my two cents on why the film has cult status. Oh yeah, as for the soundtrack: serious collector's wet dream. Paul Zaza should re-issue this Disco SnDtRcK for the masses as I know many DJs as well as the average Joe would sell an appendage to own a copy of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid entry into the slasher genre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night is thought of by many people as a classic. It's is. A flawed classic at that. It has all the familiar trappings of a typical slasher, but it feels a little off in some aspect. The real action seems to take forever to get going. This could be o.k. if there was something to tide you over, but there really isn't. The only thing that keeps you watching is the unusually talented cast of Jamie Lee Curtis, Leslie Neilsen, Casey Stevens, and Anne Marie Martin.The plot is a loose retelling of Lois Duncan's I Know What You Did Last Summer, but there's enough here to keep you interested. It's not totally original, but it has an interesting style to it. It feels more like an Italian giallo with it's black gloved killer, cryptic and threatening messages, obscene phone calls and it's strong use of color.It's still a fun movie with a shocking killer revelation and a great chase scene through a locked school building. The disco score is suitably nostalgic as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horribly dated slasher with tacky disco music...but</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's still got a small unique charm that makes me watch it here and there. Made by the people responsible for "Curtains" (1983) It was actually a big money earner and in my opinion Curtains is far better film and much more appealing. It amazes me how Prom Night was watched by a lot more. The plot is nothing spectacular and it involves 4 dumb kids accidentally killing some mousy little girl who was one of the only sympathetic characters in the whole movie (and she dies like 5 minutes in!!!). Well these 4 kids don't need any convincing at all to keep the murder a secret and jump 6 years later and all the kids are somehow still all hanging around together, hell two of the girls are best friends with the little victims older sister, Thee Jamie Lee Curtis, and the only boy of the four is dating her as well, maybe they really despise Jamie lee? and are being nice to her because they have guilt. Jamie Lee was overrated in this and her character was really obnoxious, spoiled, and self proclaimed. I really wanted her to bite the big one. Well anyways, the day of the prom and all four teenagers start getting telephone calls by an unseen prowler with his yearbook and pencil. "Tonight it's your turn" or "Do you still like to play games"...the plot plods along by giving us red herrings left and right...everyone and their dead aunt was a suspect...you be the judge on how easy it was to spot the killer or how difficult it was..I had the killer revealed by my sister who saw the movie first. The big night arrives FINALLY and we have some nice kills and good stalk sequences firmly directed by Paul Lynch and accompanied by Paul Zanza's creepy score. Axe and ski mask in tow, the killer reveals his big bloodshed of a night...which was alright..under circumstances..meaning the tacky and horrible disco dance sequence. The acting in this movie was credible and watchable, but it was kind of hard to warm up to a lot of the characters because they all looked 30 and acted as if they were 12...did teenagers really act this way? The only character that was interesting was the one hated by everyone, the likable bitch "Wendy"...not only did she make fun of like everyone, she drove a corvette, looked sexy in that red dress, hated Jamie Lee as much as I did, and treated her house maid like yesterdays garbage. My kind of women! Why no one liked this dame was beyond me...she also had a 10 minute stalk scene sequence which was right up there with the "Prop Room" stalk in "Curtains". Stylish and fun.Leslie Neilson has nothing to do but say his lines and sulk here and there. Not much of a role. As for the rest of the cast...ACT YOUR AGE!!Note: I should mention the horny, geeky, drug induced fat couple that gets it on in a Van...they had me laughing my ass off. The directing was nice to look at but someone should have sacrificed those bottles of whiskey and lines off set and invested in some lights for the lighting. Was this movie shot with just a camera? I honestly believe this to be WORST MOVIE FOR LIGHTING! I couldn't see much at times and that really made me uninvolved. Why should I have to always have my flashlight in hand to watch this because someone partied to hard in 1980?For what it's worth, it's not that terrible or that great either..it's just a fun slasher that is horribly dated and has Jamie Lee Curtis camera mugging and some killer that would be a better tap dancer then a prowler.Clumsy moron! I expected him to start doing one of those slapstick tap routines at any moment...Paul Lynch later directed the abysmal and boring "Humongous" which also lost budget for lighting because someone liked to party...it was the early eighties so I guess you can't really blame them. The producers later helmed all 3 unrelated Prom Night sequels and of course the great "Curtains".** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Waiting For The All-Star Tribute to "Slick"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So there we were, Professor Marvel, CaptainLouisRenault and I, in our halcyon days, knocking around Times Square, ready to laugh at another badly-made horror film that, in 1980, were proliferating faster than "Disco Sucks" t-shirts. And for the most part, "Prom Night" fit the bill. It had the obligatory starring role by Jamie Leigh Curtis; Canada filling in badly for the U.S. (we got to know the bad graphics like those that appear on the sign for "Alexander Hamilton High"--apparently Alex got around); the pacing, which was precisely the same throughout the whole movie, with no alteration; and the poor photography (at that time, all Canadian films were technically unsophisticated: scenes were lit the same whether it was an interior or exterior, night or day; shots began with the establishing-shot pan that moved at EXACTLY the same speed no matter what was happening or how close to the climax you were). And yet, "Prom Night" stands out for one reason alone: the character "Slick," played by one Sheldon Rybowski. Here were the same too-cute teeny-bopper slasher-fodder, most of whom deserved to be slashed, and here comes a chubby, geeky kid with a van, ready for lovin'. You just HAD to admire his chutzpah-which is something for a good Catholic boy to say. Anyway, the movie only was alive while "Slick" was...alive. Mr. Rybowski, so far as I know, has never gotten the credit he deserves for raising this film out of the ordinary. So I raise my...well, SOMETHING...and say, "Mr. Rybowski, I salute you."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are the United States and Canada really that similar?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm guessing that Jamie Lee Curtis must have been known as one of the world's primary scream queens by the early '80s, what with "Halloween", "The Fog", and "Prom Night". In this one, some schoolchildren are picking on a girl and accidentally kill her. Some years later, someone is stalking everyone at the prom. You know the rest.I was a little surprised to read that this movie came from Canada (although I could swear that it featured my dad's high school in Los Angeles). Our northern neighbor has released a few slashers ("The Clown Murders", "My Bloody Valentine", "The Brain"). One thing here is that this movie also stars Canadian Leslie Nielsen. I guess that he had to act in a movie from his native country at some point. Not anything special, but worthwhile for what it is (except that one part was clearly stolen from "Carrie").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prom Night .......No need to be uptight!This isn't the best slasher film out there, but it is required viewing for all who love the genre. Jamie Lee looks her scream queen best, playing Kim Hammond. Just happens that today is the Prom and 6 years ago to the day Kim's sister was killed falling out a window. That is a bit of a bummer for Kim and her brother but it does not stop Kim from pressing on as prom queen. The real bummer is someone is stalking Kim and her friends. Breaking mirrors, making wierd phone calls and cutting up yearbooks are this psycho's MO. Could it be the slackjawed janitor, the hometown sex offender, or Leslie Neilsen, who disappears before the finale of the movie? Who knows? Who cares! We are here to watch Jamie Lee get down with her bad self. The "Let's show them what we can do" dance sequence makes this movie worth the price of admission. Students of the movie Carrie will find a whole host of similarities. Required genre and cheeseball viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my goodness! Did they ever try and throw you off track with all the random suspects in this lame movie. You just have to love the weirded out gardener Sykes. The scene where he just stares into the camera with his tongue half hanging out was worth the $6 I paid for the DVD. Jamie Lee does her best and chief Frank Drebbin is along for the wackiness too. This one falls way short in the scare department, aside from the lengthy and I do mean lengthy prom disco get down sequence. Oh the horror! *Spoilers* It isnt difficult to figure out who is doing the prank callin' and axe swingin' shenanigans either. Of course it was the younger brother that returned to the murder scene in the beginning, he was also the DJ at the prom and the only excuse for letting that same awful disco song play for twenty minutes at the end was that he was away from the 1's and 2's killing those brats. All in all a fun time waster that Im gonna give a 5/10. 2.5 points for "Slick" Evil Keneviling his van off a cliff and 2.5 for the great decapitation of the bully type figure. By the way who would have ever called that guy Slick?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in the 80's this movie was still okay and worked well as a horror movie, but today it only appears extremely cheesy. Of course other horror movies from the 80's which were released in the vein of Halloween and Friday, the 13th are also dated, but Prom Night tops them all: The disco scene at the end of the movie is the climax of the bad taste we already got presented all through the entire movie by the badly styled people. Obviously the movie tried to be very modern back then. Also the killing scenes don't save this movie anymore. I used to like it (probably because of Jamie Lee Curtis), but after watching it again I have to rate it with a 5/10. This might be still to good for this one, but maybe I see some cult status in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the worst of its kind, but far from the best -- lotsa disco booty-shakin' though...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(** out of *****) Six years after the accidental death of Kim Hammond's (Jamie Lee Curtis) sister, the four kids who inadvertently caused it and tried to cover it up are targeted for extermination by a mysterious phone caller with a raspy voice. This isn't bad, but it's certainly the weakest entry in Curtis's '70s/'80s horror/slasher movie career. The killing doesn't even start until late in the movie, and, given that the audience knows ahead of time who the four intended victims are, there is never any real sense of danger for Curtis' heroine. Instead, she spends large parts of the movie disco dancing. There's an extended chase through the deserted high school and a fairly impressive decapitation scene, but, otherwise, this one's not very memorable. Also stars Leslie Nielsen as the father/principal (a serious role, long before he started making straight-to-video comedies), Casey Stevens as the boyfriend (and one of the four victims), and Anne-Marie Martin as the class bitch. HIGH/(low)LIGHT: J.L.C. shakes her boo-tay out on the dance floor (for a long time).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Know What You Did Last Prom Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this is the movie "I Know What You Did Last Summer" ripped off? No wonder it was so bad."Prom Night" isn't completely bad, more boring than bad. The movie starts off with these little kids (I'm guessing 6th or 5th graders) playing a fairly weird game called "Killer" (basically hide and go seek with a morbid touch) in what is an abandoned school. Well, a little girl named Robin wanders in during this game, she is then discovered by the bunch of kids who for some reason feel the need to gang up on her and make her back up until she falls out of a third story window to her doom.They then take an oath to never let anyone know they had anything to with it.Then we zoom ahead to the senior prom six years later. Jamie Lee Curtis' character (Robin's older sister) and the brother (Robin's older bro) are all getting ready for the prom. The main plot of the movie is based around a black clothed from head to toe murderer slowly picking off all those who all but pushed Robin to her doom, and of course those who get in the way.But for some reason Jamie Lee is the star even though she has almost nothing to do with most of the movie, that confuses me. The problem this movie finds is boredom and lack of tension. The movie moves very slowly, has no focus, and since we aren't given any clues, any sort of build up about the killer, there is no real tension.So, "Prom Night" is a decently enough acted movie that just didn't have the wits about it. 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

Granted, the characters aren't very appealing (except for good ole Jamie Lee), but you can tell the filmmakers meant well.

For one, there are no kills until there is only 5 minutes left of the movie, and the suspense is terrible. This movie is not scary, but, it's appealing in a sort of way that you want to watch it. Now I do think the special effects were pretty good, I mean this was made over 20 years ago. Next, the death scenes were pretty good also. Now another flaw is that the killer was too predictable.

This is very camp, very 80's (the third act feels like "Saturday Night Fever" - disco, disco, disco!!). One of the plot deveolpments and two of the characters are a blatant rip-off from "Carrie".In spite of this, some good scares, suspenseful moments, and twists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom Night had good potential, but it missed the mark!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS AHEAD** I don't know many people who liked this movie. It seemed as though this movie was a class project. The teacher went around the room assigning numbers to students then told all the 1's to get together, all the 2's to get together, 3's, 4's, etc....Each group had to write a movie script before class ended, which would have been in 40 minutes. So Group 2 wrote Prom Night. If only Group 2 had several weeks to write a script, then they probably could have written another Halloween. Prom Night had good potential, and I will tell you how it could have been better. The premise that the four kids were responsible for Robin Hammond's death ruined this movie. Right away, we know who the victims will be and who the suspects are. Did anyone really believe that the weird custodian was the killer? Why would he care about Robin Hammond's death? Why would the escaped mental patient be the killer? It's true he would want revenge for being accused of Robin's death, but it was the police who accused him not the kids. So, why would he want to kill the kids when he should want to kill the cops? Right? And of course, why would Lou or Vicki want to avenge Robin's death? They wouldn't. So we are left with Robin's family. We can tell that the killer's voice belongs to a man so that eliminates Kim and her mother. Later, when the killer appears, we see that his build is too slender to be Leslie Nielson's. Also, why would a responsible adult like Mr. Hammond wait six years to avenge his own daughter's death. Why wouldn't he have told the police what happened or filed wrongful death suits against the kids' parents. They all live in nice houses; Wendy's parents can afford to buy her a brand, new Corvette. Nick's dad is the exception. With everyone else eliminated that means the killer could only be Andy. That makes perfect sense. He was the only one standing outside the abandoned convent when Robin and the other kids were inside playing so obviously he would have witnessed Robin's death. The murder scenes are quite straightforward; the killer shows up and kills. Wendy's murder was the exception; that was probably the best part of the movie. By eliminating the movie's premise the movie improves dramatically because we longer know who will be the victims and suspects, and basic logic could no longer be used to determine which suspect would most likely be the killer. Next, the telephone calls should be eliminated; the people who get called will obviously be the victims, and the people who were not called will be safe. We should never see or hear the killer. We should not even know the killer's motives. This raises questions. Who is the killer? Why is the killer killing? Who will be killed? Kim could now be a victim too. The escaped mental patient could stay, but the death of Robin Hammond should be left out. He should just be some crazy guy who escaped from a mental institution and now is on the loose. The murders should be carried out with a little bit more suspense. It would have been great if every murder were carried out like Wendy's. Because Kim, her dad and Wendy's acting are good, especially when compared with typical slasher movie actors, they should be given more dialogue. Finally, the lighting should be fixed. There were scenes in this movie, like Wendy's chase scene, where you could not see what was happening. If the movie had been made this way, I believe history would have shone a favorable light on Prom Night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Popular HALLOWEEN imitation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PROM NIGHT, along with TERROR TRAIN and HELL NIGHT, is one of the more popular HALLOWEEN spin offs. Helped tremendously by a first-rate cast, a suspenseful chase scene and, of course, a fair amount of cheese, it's one of my favorites too. (warning: contains spoilers!)A young girl leaves her older sister and brother to sneak into an abandoned school where a group of kids are playing hide-and-go-seek. Her siblings leave her and she soon realizes that she is unwanted from the festivities. The children, sneering and shouting the likes of "Murder!", back the poor girl onto a ledge, from which she falls to her death through a flimsy glass window. The four children look in horror at the messy corpse on the ground and quickly make a pack not to tell anyone. They then hurry off to school, oblivious to the fact that soemone else was watching . . .A considerable amount of time passes and the four children have now grown up into the usual slasher movie stereotypes: Nick, the hunky prom king; Wendy, the wild girl; Kelly, the scaredy-cat virgin and Jude, the bubbly party girl. There's also Kim (Jamie Lee Curtis), the older sister of the young girl who died six years earlier. As Kim's high school starts to prepare for the senior prom, her friends begin receiving strange phone calls from a husky-voiced stranger. But it's not until that night, Prom Night, that the four friends begin meeting gruesome deaths at the hands of the ax-swinging killer in black.Despite it's fairly good reputation PROM NIGHT cannot be considered a good movie. In fact, it's pure camp: The constant disco music that plays in the background of each murder, the cheesy SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER-like disco dance sequence between Kim and her boyfriend, and, of course, the infamous "decapitated-head-on-a-walkway" gag. That said and done there are a few things to reccomend this. Besides the very good performances, not just from Curtis and Leslie Nielson, but also from Eddie Benton, there are a number of good set pieces, the best being the chase through the darkened halls of the school between Benton and the killer. And the scene where the killer thinks he killed Nick but in fact just decapitated the greasy school punk is very good. Unfortunately, the killer's identity is very obvious: Leslie Nielson is set up as the red herring but we all know it won't be him.Still, PROM NIGHT is a very fun slasher film, and while not one of the best, a huge improvement on others of its kind.*** (out of ****)</fullReview>

Seeing Curtis battle the killer on a stage lit with stroble and other disco-type dance floor lights along with disco music has got to be one of the oddest slasher movie moments. And what was with the height of the killer? Slasher movie killers are supposed to be tall so they can be more imposing and scary! Bad make-up effects at the end, too. That head was sorry looking!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Prom Night' was made directly after Jamie Lee Curtis did 'Halloween'. This is just your basic slasher flick with some good points. The movie is building up to something and you want to see what it is. After a girl gets goaded into falling from a window of an old school, someone wants revenge, but who is it? Is it the girls Father(Leslie Nielson) who wants revenge? Is it the girls brother Alex who is upset too? What about a killer who is already on the loose? What about the crazy caretaker? There are so many possibilities. 10 years after the incident, the now grown kids are receiving some menacing prank calls just before the Prom. At the Prom is where the action starts and soon enough nearly all of the kids are getting butchered by a balaclava-clad killer with an axe! The build up is slow, but it gives you time to try and guess who the killer is. Original and quite good. 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PROM NIGHT is a surprisingly popular film with 'slasher movie' fans, and I can understand why. It is VERY amusing, Jamie Lee Curtis is great, and the climax provides a couple neat twists (though the killer's identity is really obvious), but it's just . . . stupid.It starts off with a group of kids playing some freakish game in a deserted school, which results in a little girl falling out of a two story window. Cut to 1980, several years later, where the girl's older sister (Curtis) and brother are planning to go to the prom. We are also introduced to a couple of friends, who are the now much older kids from the beginning, including Nick who is now Jamie's boyfriend and future prom king. It's not before long that the teens start to get phone calls from a mysterious stranger. Then, at the prom (as if you didn't see it coming) they begin getting killed off. Now, this movie does have everything (except for the gory deaths), including a hilarious dance sequence and an exciting chase scene between one of the girls and the, rather clumsy, killer. The very end too does provide some great cheesey momments. It's not that this movie is BAD, it's just . . . obvious. And the lighting during the chase scene near the end is awful. Slasher fans should like it but every one else should just stay clear!GORE: 4/10 ACTING: 8/10 DIRECTION: 5/10 SUSPENSE: 2/10 ATMOSPHERE: 1/10 CHEESE: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite slasher-movie moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite moment in PROM NIGHT is when the killer is making threatening phone calls to his intended victims; we see that he's keeping a list (!), crossing out each of the four names as he calls them. He's been planning to kill these people for years! Does he really need to keep a list? I think my evil scheme would have to involve at least ten people before I'd have to write down their names... I keep hoping that Kevin Williamson will pick up on this, and have one of his killers keep a spreadsheet or something, with separate columns for "Stalked," "Called," "Killed," and so on. It's a pretty terrible movie--the plot is completely uninvolving, the killer's obvious, the red herrings are lazy--but there are other goofy moments along the way. The killer must be wearing roller skates to get from one murder scene to the next...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first...the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Prom Night is the best out of the 4 movies in the series. It has to do with a childhood hide and go seek game going wrong, resulting in the death of a little girl. The playmates vow to never speak of it again and run off before someone sees them, but someone has. Six years later, the Hamilton High senior prom falls on the anniversary and a masked killer stalks the four kids, planning for revenge. Prom Night is an average horror film. The film starts to get a little suspenseful during the prom, where the chases occur. The music is very eerie and Jamie Lee Curtis, as usual, gives a terrific performance during her "Scream Queen" years. Best scene: Where her and that other guy do that weird disco dance on the lighted floor to "Prom Night! Everything is alright!" The film is definitely superior to it's sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prom Night is one of the 80's slasher flicks that is a little like Rodney Dangerfield; it gets no respect. While most critics bash the slasher flick such as Friday th 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street (and possibly deservedly so due to the horrendous amount of crappy sequels), Prom Night seems to be left out in the cold. It is not a great movie by any margin, but viewing for the first time (even today) can still bring some surprises. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a fine performance (during her Horror heyday) and the director is able to pull off a few scenes with suspense. Not a bad movie, but I think it should get its just desserts by being grouped with the aforementioned movies, just so it can get some attention. I gave it a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the worthless pieces of crud masquerading as horror films from the 1980's, Prom Night stacks up as a worthy contender for my list of guilty pleasures of the horror genre. Mind you,Prom Night has the makings of a quick buck job of the highest extreme,and it has scenes and ideas lifted from CARRIE, but blasts of brilliance, such as the severed head on the disco floor make this a winner of trash flick fans everywhere. I really don't think you need to know the plot, but here it is: A cruel prank goes awry when the younger sister of star, Jamie Lee Curtis, dies in a deadly variation of hide and go seek. Years later, the bratty kids who caused the death are now teens, and are ready for their Prom Night. Someone is going to make them pay for the death of the young girl.. with their lives! Interesting footnote. B movie action star, Jeff Wincott cuts his chops here as a typical horny high schooler named Drew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, although a trendsetter, really is not as good as I hoped it would be. In fact, it was pretty lame. Jamie Lee Curtis does a fine enough job, but the quality of the film is rather poor. There are no actually scary parts, a lot of boring slow parts, and some very predictable scenes. So much more could have been done with this film, but it stands alone as an achievement in horror history because of its concept of hiding the killer's identity until the very end. Friday the 13th did a much better job (and better movie) of portraying the killer-getting-revenge-without-us-knowing-who-it-is routine. However, this film was bound to get made later on, so I guess we can laugh at the disco prom scene. Also, that crappy wannabe flick I Know What You Did Last Summer seemed to have ripped off a lot from this film (and many others, including "The Fog" another great Jamie Lee Curtis horror flick).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Prom Night" is an effective little whodunnit centering around four high school students being stalked by a masked killer during their senior prom as retribution for their involvement in the death of a young girl six years earlier. Not on the hit list but caught up in all of the murder and mayhem is "Scream Queen" Jamie Lee Curtis as prom queen Kim Hammond. She's tough,smart and sexy-every young man's dream date. Leslie Nielsen is fun in a glorified cameo (although he received top billing) as Curtis's father,who is the principal at the high school which provides the film's setting. The rest of the cast,I suspect,is Canadian (since the flick was filmed in Toronto),and they are excellent. Special kudos goes to Eddie Benton (now Anne-Marie Martin,or should I say...Mrs.Michael Crichton),who is superb as sexy bad girl Wendy. The moody,ominous disco soundtrack is provided by Paul Zaza and Carl Zittrer,and the film boasts an excellent opening sequence involving an eerie childhood hide-and-go-seek game featuring most of the main characters as children. What separates "Prom Night" from the countless imitations and clones of "Psycho" and "Halloween",is that the viewer will really find themselves actually caring about the characters...and the killer DOES have a motive! I always wondered what happened to the characters after the film's finale...Did Kim forgive Nick for his role in her sister's death? Did Kim lose her mind after accidentally killing Alex? Did Mrs.Hammond lose her mind after the death of yet another child? Did Nick's father arrest him for Robin's death? All of these questions will forever remain unanswered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very under rated slasher.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of my favourite slasher. The story is simple, kids play a game, things turn wrong, the little girl dies. Later the kids are picked one by one by a killer. Today this movie is considered basic and cliché but it was only made two years after Halloween and a couple of months after Friday The 13th. It does not have the cliché of the surviving virgin. The killer is a little too obvious and the acting is nothing spectacular. I love the dialogue and the characters. Leslie Nielsen does a great job, he is not present a lot and at some point he just disappears with out any explanation. Jamie Lee Curtis is probably the best actress in the whole movie, her character is likable and she has good chemistry with her brother. My final verdict 9/10. A classic 80's slasher movie. Oh ps: The Remake sucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course the big problem with the wave of slasher films that followed in the wake of John Carpenter's Halloween, is that the bar had already been set very high. Then there's the issue of just what do slasher fans want from their movie of choice? Wall to wall kills with blood shed everywhere and without due care and attention of story substance? Or some character and story development building to the terror? Prom Night is the latter, if you prefer the former and you have not seen this then you really are advised to stay away as you will be asleep after an hour.Paul Lynch's movie works on its basic terms, where although it inevitably is a Halloween clone, the story build is of interest. The killer isn't hard to figure out, mind, so we are kind of in a situation where the last half hour holds few surprises, but back story is solid, red herrings nicely fried and there's a good quota of suspense as the stalk and slash arrives. Acting is of the usual standard for such fare, with Jamie Lee Curtis holding court, and Leslie Nielsen headlines but isn't in it much and does a cringe worthy dance scene that is horrifying in itself. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 9/25/2011 -- 2 out of 10(Dir-Paul Lynch): Boring horror movie that doesn't have much going for it unless you're interested in seeing a late 20's Jamie Lee Curtis try to pull off a highschooler going to her first prom. She also gets to show off some pretty nice disco moves on the dance floor, but this was supposed to be a horror movie not a rip-off of "Saturday Night Fever." When the horror stuff finally starts, at about 3/4 of the way thru the movie, we're already bored. The movie is basically about a girl accidentally falling to her death while a group of kids play a creepy killer-type game at an abandoned old house. The kids vow to not tell anyone, and a weirdo is charged with the death and serves a sentence in a mental institution. Six years later, the weirdo escapes from the institution and we are prompted into thinking he is the one preparing to murder the kids who were actually involved at the prom. The filmmakers introduce us to a creepy janitor and one of the girl's planning something evil for the event, but these are all smokescreens made very obvious to the viewer. I won't give away who eventually starts doing the killing, but you won't really care once it starts happening. The movie is also not shot very well with a lot of dark scenes, where it's hard to tell what's happening, and the sound was pretty bad on the DVD version I watched. This movie was obviously trying to make money from the Friday the 13th/Halloween movie trend, but I hope not too many people put up their money for this loser. The movie spawned three sequels, unbelievably, but I guess the premise is intriguing(younguns, sex, dancing and violence), but it wasn't intriguing enough for me to care about watching any of the sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really disappointed by this movie. When I watched this movie all I could think was that some studio executive said "I like Halloween and I like Carrie - and they both made money. Make me something like that." It's a competent movie, it just had no real spirit to it. I didn't find the kills or the killer to be very creative - just very by-the-book slasher. And I know its a staple to have older people playing the "teenagers" but in this one the students and teachers were so close in age I kept getting them confused.I'd really recommend "The Burning" or the original "Black Christmas" over this to find a slasher with a little more vigor and ingenuity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In memory of Robin Anne Hammond: "Too soon taken from us".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**One of the very early post-Halloween slasher films "Prom Night" has as it's star Jamie Lee Curtis, as Kim Hammond, who-looking like she's in her late twenties or early thirties-playing a high-school student can easily be mistaken as a high school teacher instead. The very familiar storyline, that's become standard in most slasher films, of the movie has to do with a masked killer out on the loose hunting down, with his trusty ax, those responsible for the accidental death of 10 year-old Robin Hammond, Tammy Bourne, six years ago.Being released at the hight of the 1970's and early 80's disco craze the film "Prom Night" has one of the most annoying and brain numbing soundtracks that you'll ever experience in a movie! Together with lighting that's so bad that you'll end up seeing spots before your eyes when their, after the movie is finally over, exposed to sunlight!Even though we already know who was responsible for Robin's death before the opening credits were given this red herring scenario that she in fact was raped and murdered by a local sex offender Lenoard Mirch. This has the poor and confused Lenoard end up getting badly burned in a car smash-up when he tried to escape from the pursuing police. Convicted of murder and ruled insane Lenoard is sent off to a mental institution for the criminally insane in far off Cleveland. It just so happens the when the ax murders of high school students, at the Alexander Hamilton High School, begin Lenoard just happened to have escaped from his confinement and is the prime suspect in committing them. This gives the killer all the cover he needs to carry out his grizzly task with Lenoard not him, whoever he is, being held responsible for his crimes.***SPOILER***Even though it's very evident whom the masked killer is targeting, those responsible for Robin's death, he inexplicably ends up axing a number of students who weren't even on his hit list! The most prominent of them Lou Farmer, David Mucci, the school bully who gets his head lopped off which ends up dropping on the dance floor to the shock and horror of everyone, students teachers and parents, at the prom!There's nothing really special about the film which makes you wonder why almost thirty years after its release the movie has spawned a number of sequels and was even remade in 2008 for a new generation of slasher-movie fans? There's also in "Prom Night" actor Leslie Nielsen as Kim's father Raymond Hammond who happens to be the principle of the troubled Alexander Hamilton High School. Even though Nielson gets top billing, ahead of Jamie Lee Curtis, he's only in the movie for less then ten minutes! Seeing-from the script-in how bad the film "Prom Night" really is Nielsen probably realized that the less exposer he had the better it was- in people not remembering him being in the movie-for his future acting career!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not care for the original "Friday the 13th", and this movie is a bit to much like it for my tastes. An entire movie devoted to the shocking end where the killer and his or her motivations are revealed. Of course, it was somewhat of a surprise who it was when I was a kid and it made the one scene make sense for me, but now I figure most people will easily figure it out. This prom is just not bloody enough for my tastes and not enough victims either...though that sounds terrible of me now doesn't it? Still I just like to see some good kills and some good chills and I just feel I did not get enough of that even when I was a kid. Still, you get to see Jamie Lee Curtis during her horror making days and you get to see Leslie Nielson before every movie he did was a spoof. It is strange though how the sequels are completely different than this slasher movie with a bit of mystery and sadness in it. I think part two adds more of a supernatural twist to it and comedy as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Night Disco Died</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years ago, a little girl is scared silly by peers in an old abandoned school and falls three stories to her death. Enter Prom Night 1980 and time for the old gang to part, but one by one, every witness who vowed secrecy over the girl's death, dies themselves at the hands of a balaclava-wearing, mirrorshard-wielding madperson.While the story line is pretty simple, the pace of the film is long and plodding. The aim of the makers, perhaps just beyond their aim, was the Hitchcockian premise of suspense. Prom Night was apparently strong enough to compete with cult classics Halloween, Friday The 13th, Carrie and Texas Chain Saw Massacre as one of the Favorite Fright Franchises of the 1980s. Fortunately, sequels in the Prom Night niche deep-sixed the awful disco theme, but the plots didn't improve that much and somehow the original remains the best of the batch.Leslie Nielson plays Mr. Hammond, Prom Night's high school principal in one of his funnier roles from the "pre-Airplane" days of his illustrious career. His ridiculous dance scene with daughter Kim (Jamie Lee Curtis) is probably what convinced the Zucker brothers to make Nielson "their boy" in future projects.Antoinette Bower, perhaps the best thing to ever come out of Owen Sound, Canada, does adequate work as Nielson's wife and Jamie Lee's mother. I still think of her role as a "cat chick" that Cap'n Kirk beds and betrays on that memorable Star Trek episode "Catspaws"...Canadian storyboardist Jeff Wilson, who was uncredited for his part in the latter half of the movie, should be given credit for injecting dynamic camera angles amid the quick cutting, fast moving action. Critically acclaimed director Paul Lynch indicated what kind of project this was when he told Maclean's magazine that "Prom Night is the kind of film one must do to survive..."3 1/2 Stars out of 5. Nice to see it out on DVD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Prom Night" for the first time this year. I can, without a doubt, say that I wasn't missing much. I never really got into the whole "slasher genre." They are all pretty much the same, have a plot along the same lines and feature gratuitous female nudity and bloodshed. I'd rather not see them, but I can admit that the acting in them sometimes gives me a good laugh. I wish I could say the acting in "Prom Night" gave me a good laugh, however, I could hardly hear a word said. Ah, cheap slasher money makers...poorly filmed, muffled, bloody pieces of crap. Anyway, the plot is pretty simple.....though, I think that they try to make is seem complex. I can't say for sure though, reiterating the fact that I couldn't hear a word said. The movie is so boring. I can't even say that when the killings begin that it picks up. They lost me after 20 minutes of stupid filler. When the lead character (Jamie Lee Curtis) finds out who the killer is, it is all dramatic...but who really cares? We all knew who the killer was from the beginning. There is no mystery and no suspense...it has all been done before. There is no originality, it is too long and it is just dumb. I can see why I was able to buy this gem in the bargain bin.The one thing that I did enjoy, embarrassingly, was the blaring theme song. "PROM NIGHT...EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT" Call it a guilty pleasure if you will, but I can honestly say that I would rather own the soundtrack than the movie. Even though this movie features a song that I enjoyed in that this-is-so-stupid-but-undeniably-catchy sort of way, it was definitely not enough to save this movie. Zero out of ****</fullReview>

It starts well enough with a group of children killing accidentally a little girl, but all the rest is slow pacing, slow moving, slow slashing. There only a few killings, not enough sex, not enough gore to be regarded as a real slasher of the Eighties. I don't know how this movie generated three sequels (all unrelated), that sure enough are probably better than the original. Jamie Lee Curtis was starting to tie too much her career with the Laurie Strode role and she had to wait till John Landis Trading Places to return to a more sure track.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very boring '80s slasher film. No suspense, no interesting characters. Long and dull chase scenes. The movie can't even succeed on the simple-minded level of graphic violence, either having been the victim of a lazy special fx team or of aggressive censorship. So what exactly did I like? It is a period piece, capturing that '80s look. Jamie Lee was cute. The disco music was funny, especially when a stone-faced Jamie tells her boyfriend "Let's show them what we can do" before they flaunt their cool dance moves. My favorite part, as one other reviewer noted, is a scene where a cop at a desk thinks "I gotta get that ba**ard before he butchers more people". The voice-over is done with all the emotion of somebody saying "I gotta remember to get some milk at the grocery store". It is so awkward. I busted out laughing at that scene. Because of that one line, I did not regret seeing Prom Night. In short, I probably only find value in 10 or 15 minutes of this entire film. But if, like me, you cherish unintentionally funny moments in film, that might be reason enough to rent it for one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw this film when I was young, and its not that scary now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you remember back in the early 80's the Canadian government gave tax breaks to create a film industry, up here. These early films where usually low budget horror or teen party comedies or varations of these types of films spliced together, with interesting scripts that need another rewrite, choppy acting, grainy film quality, a big name lead actor with a no name cast, and a generic way of directing that makes one film look and feel like the next one. When I see a HBO film or show I can tell if its made in Canada in the first few minuties by watching the directing. In the end the tax breaks payed off with a well developed film industry, and a legacy of these horrible Canadian stinkers. This film has all the qualities of these stinkers, goes well with other un rememerable Canadian films such as, Scaners, Bells, Up the Creek, and Hog wild.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prom Night was not very good at all. Simple little special effects and low budget. Jamie Lee Curtis's Terror Train was way much better than this. For a movie released in 1980 this one hit bottom. Ron Oliver's direction fails. And watch for Leslie Nielsen in a boring performance.Only axe murders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Influenced by "Halloween", but it didn't work out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prom Night" is not, anyway, a HS (Halloween/Scream) in the horror genre. It was made only two years after the classic "Halloween", so it was very influenced by it. However, these influences didn't make the film good. It's not really scary and the screenplay is silly. However, the plot reminds me "I Know What You Did Last Summer", and I'm sure Kevin Williamson took some ideas from "Prom Night" to write his screenplay. It's an interesting plot, but nothing really special.There are some good points, too. The identity of the murderer is not that obvious- at least it was not for me, maybe because I didn't pay much attention at the details. The only scene when I felt scared was when the murderer chases Wendy- that also reminds me "I Know What You Did Last Summer", when the fisherman chases Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar).In sume, "Prom Night" is just fun and nothing else. I think I gave it a high average- 5 , but it doesn't come any closer from "Scream" or "Halloween", as I've already said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreary 80's slasher.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night starts at an old rundown convent where a group of young children are playing a game of hide and seek, things go a bit too far &amp; a young girl named Robin Hammond (Tammy Bourne) falls to her death from an upper storey window. The rest of the children are scared they will go to jail so make a pact never to tell anyone what happened, the local police assume that Robin fell to her death after being attacked by a convicted child molester who is badly disfigured in a car crash while being pursed by the police. Six years later &amp; it's the day of Alexander Hamilton Senior High School's prom, everyone is excited especially Robin's sister Kim Hammond (Jamie Lee Curtis) who is going to be the prom queen. However several of the students get strange phone-calls as a killer sets their plans into motion, a killer who know's the identity of young Robin's killers &amp; wants to dish out to revenge...This Canadian production was directed by Paul Lynch &amp; is an obvious cash-in on the teen slasher genre that doing so well back then after huge hits like Halloween (1978) &amp; Friday the 13th (1980) &amp; this dreary effort is surely one of the most forgettable slashers out there despite being fairly well known &amp; puzzlingly quite well regarded. I have no idea why Prom Night is so well liked or even remembered at all since it's a throughly dull &amp; routine film that fails to deliver the goods, the script is so slow it feels like hours before anything happens &amp; the murder mystery elements are poorly handled as is the eventual reveal of the killers identity as to be honest once the balaclava came off I didn't actually recognise who they were &amp; since they never say anything I was left slightly puzzled as to who the killer was. There's no great twist, there are a few red herrings thrown in like a strict principal, a grieving mother, a sinister caretaker, a school bully, a disfigured child molester &amp; so on but they are all far too obvious to be the killer. The character's are all poor, there's far too much dead time when nothing happens &amp; the film shamelessly rips-off better slashers like Halloween with it's event themed title, Carrie (1976) with it's prom setting &amp; Black Christmas (1974) with the killer using a phone to taunt their victims while not being as good as any of them.Even the body count is disappointing, it takes a good hour or so before the on screen kill occurs &amp; it's a fairly tame &amp; bloodless affair with all but one of the kills off-screen. There's a bit of blood splatter &amp; a decent enough decapitation but nothing memorable. There's a little sex but again nothing memorable, there's no nudity either apart from a quick flash of a bare bum. When Prom Night premiered on NBC in the US they filmed &amp; added several additional scenes including Mr. Hammond using the axe to chop wood that the killer later uses, maybe this version is better but I can only assume most of the extra footage would have been padding &amp; slowed things down even more. There are also quite a few unintentionally amusing scenes of teenagers disco dancing to some truly awful music &amp; Leslie Nielsen joining in at one point. There's no great thrills or chills here &amp; the whole film is flatly shot &amp; rather dull to watch.With what was probably a fairly low budget Prom Night looks alright but has no great visual style, apparently filmed at Don Mills Collegiate in Toronto in Canada. The acting is average, Jamie Lee Curtis looks bored after already appearing in the similar Halloween a couple of years earlier while Leslie Nielsen probably needed the money.Prom Night is a pretty poor 80's slasher that has a measly body count, a lacklustre murder mystery plot &amp; a Snail's. Followed by the unconnected but in name only sequels Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II (1987), Prom Night III: The Last Kiss (1990) &amp; Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil (1992) before being recently remade as Prom Night (2008).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little girl is accidentally killed by fellow schoolmates. They all pledge to not tell anyone that they mistakenly caused her death. A man (who saw everything) is unjustly accused of the death and sent to jail. Ten years later he escapes and all of the school buddies are being killed. Is it him...or someone else?So-so horror movie. It's not terrible but it's not really good either. It also has Leslie Nielsen (in a dramatic role!) and Jamie Lee Curtis in it--they're given nothing to do but they're pretty good. This also has to be the only horror film Curtis is in where she's NOT attacked by the killer. SPOILER AHEAD!!!! There's also a nice moment when a victim's throat is slashed and a closeup of her throat dissolves into a bowl of red punch (for a slasher movie that's a touch of brilliance!). And there's a real neat decapitation at the end. SPOILER END!!!! And, I have to admit, I never guessed the killer's identity.So, a fairly good slasher film. Also it has a small footnote in horror film history as one of the last horror films Curtis said she would do (she only did "Halloween II" after this for the fans).An OK time waster.</fullReview>

The movie was shot around Markham &amp; Toronto.There was one seen shot down at the Scarborough Bluffs.The old schoolhouse used to be a girls reformatory at one time,it was demolished shortly after this film was made.All in all this film is good for some laughs &amp; suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Halloween on Prom Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The slasher sub-genre is one of the less interesting areas of the horror genre, and Prom Night does nothing but confirm that. Halloween, the film that this and many others like it use as a blueprint, wasn't all that interesting for me; but if watching Halloween is the cinematic equivalent of watching paint dry, then watching Prom Night is the equivalent of watching dried paint. Like John Carpenter's film, this one takes its plot and title from an important event in the American calendar - prom night, obviously. Thankfully, prom night isn't a big thing here in the UK, which puts this on the back foot with me right from the start. We did actually have a prom night in the final year at my high school; and even though I didn't go to it, I'm pretty sure that it was nothing like the one here. Prom Night features a bunch of twenty-something's masquerading as sixteen year olds. The film starts off with a hugely unoriginal sequence that sees a bunch of little kids kill another one. We fast forward six years and it's time for the high school prom...however, those obscene phone calls that the girls have been getting could prove deadly...The only reason why this film hasn't been forgotten along with most of the rest of the eighties slashers is due to the presence of 'Scream Queen' Jamie Lee Curtis. Curtis sleepwalks through the film, just like she did in Halloween; and it's more than obvious that she isn't too bothered about her performance, and the people behind the film are only interested in the fact that they can use her name on the poster. The only other name in the cast belongs to Leslie Nielson. It's bizarre seeing him in a slasher flick after he made his name with Zucker comedies; but that bizarre element is the only thing worth mentioning about his performance. The film is amazingly slow paced, and it's very easy to get thoroughly bored with it. The killings are very dull, and as the gore doesn't really start until the end anyway; there's a good chance that you'll be too jaded to even notice when it does. This film will appeal to people who (for some reason) really, really like slashers; but everyone else is advised to stay clear. As mentioned, I don't rate Halloween very highly; but it's a masterpiece compared to this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the disco-music made 'em do it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prom Night" remains one of my all-time favorite 80's slashers, despite the fact that's ridiculously simple and not much more than a quickly released cash-in on Jamie Lee Curtis' previous success "Halloween". This is bloody good fun regardless the total lack of originality, and the shameless use of every possible cliché you can think of only increases the fun-factor. The long disco sequences might make you fear that you accidentally rented a copy of "Saturday Night Fever" but that finally changes once the black-masked killer violently slays his first beauty-queen. Many others follow and the connection between them refers to a deadly incident that took place 6 years earlier. Someone is out to avenge the death of a small girl and prom-queen-to-be Jamie Lee Curtis and her friends will experience the night of their lives! The murders are graphically shown and belong to the vilest of all 80's slashers. The decapitation scene near the end is pure classic in my book. Good acting and decent production values for this type of cinema, too. There's also the terrific usage of the abandoned school building and there's even a tad bid of female nudity to enjoy. My only real complaint is about the dreadful disco-music that never seems to stop! You'd go on a bloody killing spree for less reasons than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems like the inspiration for a recent slasher series starring Jennifer Love Hewitt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Prom Night for the first time in over ten years, and a few things stuck with me after the viewing. First of all, after a creepy opening sequence, detailing the cruel, yet accidental death of an innocent girl, the movie CRAWWWWWLLLLSSSSS... In other films of it's genre, such as the superior Friday the 13th series, the murders are usually evenly spread throughout the film, setting the tone for a climactic ending. Not here. The first hour of Prom Night seems like it could be from some long forgotten 70's after school special. Secondly, it amazed me how much this movie has in common with Jennifer Love Hewitt's hit "I Know What You Did Last Summer". Both movies feature a group of characters that accidentally kill an innocent, then act irrationally as they attempt to avoid blame. They bully each other into promising never to talk about the death ever again. At some future point (one year later in IKWYDLS, six years later in Prom Night...) all the participants receive threatening reminders of their crime as a precursor to the actual murders. Makes me wonder if the producers of IKWYDLS didn't INTENTIONALLY steal the plot, and just change the particulars. At any rate, Jamie Lee Curtis is always welcome in these slasher films, (even though she looks a little old to play a high school student) and Leslie Nielsen plays the principal of the school whom happens to be Jamie's father. It's not bad as early 80's slasher go, as the killings (especially the punk whom gets beheaded...) are fairly graphic, but the slow pace really lessens the impact of the entire film. Also, is it just me, or does the disco music being played at the prom sound like outtakes from an Abba recording session?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the Dancing Scream Queen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unintentionally hilarious disco dancing scene featuring scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis is the improbable highlight of this early '80s slasher, which gives some idea of just how disappointing Prom Night is as a horror movie, the film achieving nowhere near the level of carefully crafted scares to be found in Curtis's classic genre outing Halloween, nor delivering the exploitative thrills of its far more gory contemporary Friday the 13th.Just about as formulaic and predictable as the genre gets, Prom Night sees a killer bumping off a group of oversexed teenagers who were responsible for the accidental death of a young girl six years earlier. Who could the murderer be? The weirdo working as a handyman at the high school? The disfigured sex offender originally blamed for the girl's death? The dead girl's father (played by Leslie Nielsen) Or someone else? Seriously, it's not hard to figure out who killer is, so the film doesn't even work as a whodunit. No atmosphere, very little splatter (a decapitation is the only decent death; the rest is too dark to make out), the barest minimum of T&amp;A, a simple to solve mystery, and Jamie Lee grooving it up on the disco floor: hardly the stuff that nightmares are made of.4.5 out of 10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A second viewing that turned out to be rather disappointing. In spite of the solid premise (and opening scene), the nice cutting between fragments and the rather human approach of the characters, 'Prom night' does not get very far. The detective's attempts at saving the day are numerous, but ultimately inane. The kill(scenes)s are mostly dragged out too long and hardly captivating in their outcome (except maybe the chase through the school and the beheading scene of a young Tom Cruise - I mean David Mucci, of course). The chicks are certainly not hard to look at, at all (one bare butt, some almost naked breasts and J.L.C. wearing not much more than a bra), but they can hardly save the day.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather overrated slasher effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years after a terrible tragedy, a group of teens partying away at their high-school prom find themselves stalked by a murderous killer in retribution for their actions earlier and must stop his blood-soaked rampage.Overall this was a very disjointed and problematic slasher. One of the many problems facing this one is that the central motivation for the rampage is quite shoddy and rather lame, centering on the initial game in the beginning which runs for far too long and comes off as far too clichéd to have the impact it should have. When this part of the film is problematic, it certainly undoes this one a lot by coming up with a lame game that sets off a clichéd reaction which doesn't have all that much impact here because of that clichéd nature. As well, this here really undercuts the film itself as there's barely anything which can count itself as enjoyable slasher fare as a lot of these scenes are lame, drawn-out and pack almost zero suspense into them. There's very little of the really creepy type of scenes all throughout this, as the chase through the school hallways is just awfully overlong, clumsy and doesn't really feature anything to show her life's at stake so it just comes off as a bland, tedious scene from a film full of them, including the opening game and the sequences with the police attempts to catch the red herring which are supposed to be creepy or chilling but doesn't have anything worthwhile to add to the film. That would be enough to lower this one enough even without the utterly excruciating fact of this one being shot so dark that it makes for an extremely difficult to near- impossible time just making out what's actually happening at the time. It's blurry, dark and just doesn't kook all that appealing which really highlights the flaws even more as there's hardly anything that sticks out when it can't be seen all that well. There's a few good ideas here, though, that does work including the fact that the film sets up four different people as the killer and gives them each a fair amount of time to make people think is the real killer, which is really ingenious. Two people involved in subplots as being potential killers are given perhaps the most realistic killer motives that it's surprising none of them were the killer. The other thing about this one that works is the final twenty minutes in the film, as that is when all the murders take place as the rest is the prom set up. All of the deaths are all packed in at the ending, which leaves the ending to pack a giant wallop. Otherwise, there's not a whole lot of enjoyable stuff here.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Adult Language, Nudity, and a scene of Rape.</fullReview>

Meanwhile the police suspects sex offender Leonard Merch killed Robin and hounded him to a fiery crash. He turned catatonic but has just escaped from the mental hospital.This is a Canadian B-movie horror. It's not completely horrible as some other low budget productions of that genre. However one would be kidding to claim this to be a good movie. It does have Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen. That's the good part but everybody else is at least a step down. The police part is a waste of time. Overall, there isn't anything interesting. The other kids aren't compelling. The dialog is really clunky at times. It may be only my problem but I suffered through some bad lighting. There are whole sections of near total darkness. The disco is pretty cheesy. This is a generally inferior product.</fullReview>

They vow to keep their involvement in the death secret but years later, on the night of the prom a killer armed with an axe is determined to get revenge.

Prom Night isn't very good. The gore is minimal and the killer isn't an iconic killing machine ala Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees. It's a rather ordinary mystery dressed up as a slasher film graced with the presence of a charismatic Ms Curtis and a rather bravura finale set to disco.

		<fullReview>Prom Night is one of the lesser "classics" of modern teen slasher films. It didn't go on to become an institution like Friday the 13th, Halloween or A Nightmare on Elm Street but it's remembered above scores of other forgettable flicks. I'm sure that's largely because of the presence of then-scream queen Jaime Lee Curtis, but I also suspect it's due to the movie's whodunit nature and the very human qualities of its mystery killer.While playing hide-and-go-seek in an abandoned school, 4 children accidentally kill a little girl. 6 years later, those children and the dead girl's brother and sister are getting ready for senior prom. But someone else is coming to the prom; someone looking for bloody revenge. But is it the escaped lunatic who got blamed for the little girl's death and was horrible disfigured in a fiery accident? Is it the high school's creepy groundskeeper? Is it the dead girl's disturbed mother? Is it her father, who's also principal of the high school? Or is it someone even more unexpected?In all honesty, many viewers will probably figure out who the killer is early on. Partly that's because we've all seen this same formula played out time and again. Partly that's because it actually is pretty obvious if you think about it. But the movie deserves credit for effectively building up both obvious and non-obvious red herrings to at least try and keep the audience guessing until the very end. That's more effort than most teen slasher flicks ever put forth.Unlike more fantastic villains like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, the killer in Prom Night is remarkable for being realistically unimpressive. The killer isn't super strong or unkillable or defying the laws of physics to always be ahead of the victims no matter where they go. This is a killer who falls down and can be outsmarted and isn't all seeing and all knowing. The Prom Night murderer isn't some monster from the dark. It's just somebody dressed all in black with an ax, and there's something about the mundane nature of that which gives a bit of depth to it all. Because the killer is a real person, it makes the victims real people and not just prey you're waiting to see slaughtered.This movie also has the awful clothing of that moment right when the 70s shifted into the 80s and the even more atrocious hairstyles that went along with them. It's also painfully obvious why Jaime Lee Curtis was the only young performer in the cast who went on to have a hugely successful career. Prom Night isn't one of those films where you can see the best young actors of the generation all starting out together. It's basically Jamie Lee and a bunch of people who spent the rest of their careers trying to get bit parts in McDonald's commercials.For you teen horror aficionados, there is one scene of brutality in this film that must have been mind blowing in its day and has held up well over the decades. The rest of the violence in pretty tame and there's no nudity that's worth speaking of.One of the most interesting things about Prom Night is that its hero and heroine are the most popular kids in high school and they're also nice people. It's weird to see because in the decades after this it seems like the class misfits grew up, took over Hollywood and began making films where the popular kids in school were either the killers or the first victims and it was the outcast, unpopular students who would save the day.There's no denying that Prom Night is dated. It's still tolerable, though, which is saying a lot for a 30 year old teen slasher flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 Things to Like about the original "Prom Night"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prom Night" may not be a "great movie" (Besides "Halloween" and maybe "Black Christmas", what slasher move is?). But the 1980 "Prom Night" has some very interesting and original elements that sets it apart from its genre and makes it a very interesting watch, even in 2008:1. Jamie Lee Curtis- Besides "Halloween", this is her best acting role in a slasher movie, and some might argue that her portrayal of Kim Hammond in "Prom Night" even tops her role as Laurie Strode. And her dancing in this movie is just very interesting to watch, whether you are captivated by it or find it laughable.2. Wendy the "you know what", Jamie Lee's rival- Eddie Benton a.k.a. Anne Marie Martin, Michael Crichton's ex-wife, gives a great performance and is not to be missed in this role.3. The Music- Yes, it's composed of cheesy ripoffs of real disco hits, but that's its charm. And the quite original "Fade to Black" which ends the film is also excellent.4. The beheading- To say anymore would spoil too much, but the scene is pulled off masterfully and it is the only gore of any significance in the movie.5. The killer's phone calls- Very creepy, and they set the mood for the rest of the film.6. Lou Farmer- The local high school thug is the perfect complement to Wendy. In the end, his scheming with Wendy will create a bizarre twist to the killer's intentions on Prom Night.7. The Chase Scene- Though most of the killings in Prom Night are just average, the extended chase sequence across campus builds the suspense just right, even though the outcome seems inevitable.8. The Final Battle on the Dance Foor-Very well choreographed, with the outcome always in doubt until hatchet falls.9. Unmasking of the Killer- Pulled off in an unusual way. Instead of the mask being lifted, the camera looks at the masked assassin directly for the first time, and we recogignize right away who it is.10.The Unusual Ending- Some will not like it. They will want Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers jumping out at the screen. Instead, the ending is tearful and reflective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your typical 80's horror slasher flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though "Prom Night" to some may seem like a classic in certain cult circles to me it's just a typical 80's slasher flick of blood, teens, and revenge. And anyone who watches the film will see how it's paced will agree. The plot is well done though as the theme of revenge is well carried out, despite the fact that the film is not that scary. You have four high school students who have been hiding the truth of what happened to a ten year old named Robin Hammond for six long years. Only to have someone see what they did and he is preparing for revenge by stalking them as a masked and hooded axe wielding predator. And this all leads up to the high school's prom night and one by one the blood drips and heads roll! Overall it's a decent horror flick that's really just straight to the point and revenge themed while like many other 80's horror flicks it centered around teens, hormones, skin and blood. A treat worth noticing though is the work of scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis who was still very young at the time and Leslie Nielsen is likable as her father here in an uncommon role for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>* *1/2 out of 4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of children living in an abandoned building are playing a special game of tag when one of the kids is murdered. Even though the incident was an accident, the other children all swear to secrecy about the incident. The father, Mr. Hammond, (Leslie Nielson) is tortured with grief over his daughter and begins to take it out on her sister, Kim (Jamie Lee Curtis). At her school, they begin to prepare for the prom. Her brother Alex (Michael Tough) turns down a date so that he can work on the prom's sound system. One of the women (Joy Thompson) who was involved in the accidental killing is killed herself before the prom. The others are all left terrible warnings of things to come if they go out to the prom. They heed little warning to the threats, and are soon bumped off in the prom one by one. The last one alive, Wendy (Anne-Marie Martin) confides in Kim about the killer, and the killer starts to come after them. They have to stay alive to find the killer.Pretty slow moving horror film features your usual clichés and a wooden Leslie Nielsen, but Jamie Lee Curtis is appealing as usual, the last 1/3 is especially scary and exciting and the ending is a real heartbreaker.Rated R for Violence, Brief Nudity, Profanity, Sexual Situations and Rape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is only fair compared to some of the sequels. The cast does do a good job. The gore effects are effect, but since it was an ordinary guy I wish they would have had clues to the killer's identity, so we the viewer might try to figure it out. It starts off with this girl getting killed by the teasing, first off, I don't remember why they were teasing her. She didn't look smart or anything "wrong" with her. So why pick on her? Then after the death, they put it on the back burner for what seems like eternity, it gets to a point that you don't even know what was the bloody point of it. But there is plenty of suspense and shocks. But as a whole I give Prom Night 6 STARS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated early 80s slasher flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid I didn't have the longest attention span. That's why when I saw Prom Night for the first time I was bored stiff and couldn't understand how anyone could like it. I didn't see it again until several years later, and this was after seeing many other 70s and 80s slasher movies, and I guess my taste had changed a bit because now I love the film and think it's one of the better from the cycle that started after the success of Halloween.Pros: Moves at a good clip, especially in the second half. Good acting from everyone in the cast. Some good spooky moments. A scary killer with an eerie voice. Goes more for chills than blood and guts. Excellent musical score. Some good kill scenes. And last, but not least a great opening sequence.Cons: Doesn't have much in the way of novelty. Dated.Final thoughts: One of the first in the cycle of slasher films in the late 70s to early 80s, and one of the most entertaining. It's far from groundbreaking, but that doesn't always make a bad movie. It's still much better than a lot of slasher films today, especially I Know What You Did Last Summer, which clearly ripped this off. Also I don't know what to think about the remake coming in 2008, but one good thing about remakes is that even if they turn out to be crap we usually get a Special Edition of the original just before it's release. Every dark cloud really does have a silver lining.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disco Rules.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I could ask Jamie Lee Curtis one question, it would be this: so...who the h-e double toothpicks did the choreography for Prom Night?? Much like Alex Hammond, the only reason I attended my prom was because I was one of the main accompanists in high school, and my singers were performing both years. Just another gig. So, giddy prom night nostalgia was not one of the motivators behind seeing this flick. I've avoided it for years, decades, presuming it was just a Carrie (1976) knockoff. I was both right and wrong and now glad I saw it.If you enjoy movies that use technology as a character in itself, as I do, be advised that Ma Bell is the channel of choice in Prom Night. I also enjoy movies that belie the shallow creepiness and danger of the suburbs. On these two scores, Prom Night delivers as many of them do.And speaking of scores, disco fans, both closeted and out, will want to just skip to the prom night set where Nielsen shows off his utter lack of rhythm (they should have put his dancing in Airplane (1980) instead of Prom Night), and Curtis shows what dance lessons, put to such good use in True Lies (1994), can accomplish. Fans of Sylvester will also enjoy the anonymous keyboard work, which recalls the great Patrick Cowley and his analog, arpeggiated wonders.So now I'm curious as to what the entire thing was supposed to have looked and sounded like and am now willing to go and hunt for that coveted Anchor Bay DVD. That alone bumps it up to 7/10.Negative 1 for even committing a character like Lou to the screen. Bleh.</fullReview>

I love Jamie Lee in it, I love how they played her as the main damsel in distress only to have her not be in danger at all. I think the revenge idea, though not original, is great. I love the death scenes, the sound of the girls throat as it slashes is great. I love the darkness that seems to surround the victims as the killer stalks them. The disco scenes are a bit long, but that's what appeals to the older generation...my grandmother loves this movie as well. I have heard that they are remaking it, i can only hope that it is worth watching because i'd hate to see them destroy this great film. I'd say give it a go...if nothing else you can hate me for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prom Night (1980) was just another picture in a long line of slasher films that debuted in the early 80's. Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen make appearances in this horror film. One of Canada's contribution to the slash and hack "teen" flicks that has maintained "cult" status due to an unwarranted reputation.This movie has a couple of nice set pieces. Too bad because a couple of nice set pieces do not make a movie. The proof is in the pudding. Just another horror film living off of it's undeserved name recognition . Amazingly enough, it's "legacy" has managed to spawn several unrelated sequels! Recommended for genre fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that lot of people hate this film but I for one really liked it. Perhaps because my excpectations were not high and I was young when I saw it first. The plot is good, the acting as well and the death scenes are pretty cool, it has suspense and is a bit scary. It is not a big gorefest and some of the killings are barely shown. The music was also pretty good. But I will admit that this film has also bit cheesy feel to it, the entire school, the kids and of course the prom which was pretty funny especially that dance-sequence between Jamie Lee´s character and her boyfriend and that disco music. If you like slasher and disco you are going to love this one. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "classy" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night seems to have its share of denegraters, but altogether, it's not half bad.The disco music is way too prominant, and this definetely gets in the way of the overall movie, in my opinion.Prom Night is nonetheless a classy little Canadian flick, with some good scare sequences and a decent plot.The acting, although not perfect, is good enough for the whole package. SPOLIERS: The story begins with 4 elementary-aged kids playing a twisted little hide-n'-seek game in an old abandoned school house.Young Robin, who was on her way to school with sister Kim, and brother Alex, decides to join the group.They end up taunting her and backing her against a window, in which she crashes to her death.The four kiddies, led by Wendy, agree to never speak of the incident.This is 1974,--now we flash ahead to 1980.6 years have passed, and Kim is now the girlfriend of Nick, one of the 4 kids involved in the tragedy.All are in high school, preparing for graduation. On the day of the prom,the 4 culprits receive chilling, anonymous threatening phone calls.This is one of the fine qualities of the movie,to me.We see a shadow on the wall of a dark room, and the names of the 4 phone-call recipients on a piece of paper.Jude, Kelly, Nick, and Wendy are all the targets of the killer.An eerie twist is the way in which the killer taps with his pencil, as he dials up his victims on the telephone, it's quite creepy. We also see the yearbook, opened next to the phone and sheet of paper.The threatening phone calls are one of the things that stand ot nicely in this film, and the creepy way they are carried out. While not a total gem, and certainly with its share of flaws, Prom Night is worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE PLOT: On prom night years ago, an innocent childhood game left a little girl dead. The children responsible for the accidental death made a pact never to tell anyone of what they had done because they feared of what might happen to them if someone found out. Little did they know that someone WAS there, and saw the whole thing! Years later it's time for the prom and the children are now teens awaiting the big night. However, someone else is waiting, too. Someone who saw what they did. Someone who has been waiting a long time for this night, and he's very VERY angry.THE ACTING: Jamie Lee Curtis adds another horror film to her "Scream Queen" title. In "Prom Night" she's not the target of a killer but rather gets caught up in the whole thing. No need to comment on her acting because it is always spectacular. The rest of the cast did pretty good jobs for the roles they were assigned but don't expect anything great from them.THE BLOOD: I actually didn't notice much blood the first time I saw this but there is a fair amount.THE BODY COUNT: 6 (mostly neck inflicted deaths)THE RATING: I love this movie and watch it regularly. It's a great intelligent slasher flick with some added mystery. This movie obviously inspired "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer". I highly recommend this movie for a good scare. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE DEFINITIVE MASTERPIECE OF SLASHER FILMS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: this review contains spoilers! In 1974, four children, all about age 11 or 12, are playing--in an abandoned schoolhouse--hide-and-seek. When a ponytailed ten-year-old girl named Robin intrudes on these four children on her way home from school, she is backed up to a window ledge and falls through the pane, plummeting to her death two stories below. As the four other children gaze at the girl's corpse covered with broken glass, they realize no one will believe it is an accident and make a pact to keep the incident a secret. Which is a deadly mistake, as we shall see, for someone else has witnessed little Robin's death and wants revenge.... Fast forward six years to 1980. Now the four children are seniors in high school and it's prom night--but much worse, it's also the anniversary of Robin's death. Robin's older sister Kim (Jamie Lee Curtis) is friends with two of the foursome--timorous Kelly and jolly Jude--and another of the four, Nick, is Kim's boyfriend. The last of the four--Wendy--is jealous of Kim because Kim stole Nick away from her. That morning, the foursome recieve ominous phone calls from a shadowy figure with a thin, slimy, whispery voice; later in the day they discover their yearbook photos taped to their locker doors with daggerlike shards of broken glass--echoes of the broken glass that had cloaked little Robin's cadaver. The incidents are dismissed as pranks as the group prepares for the prom. As darkness falls they arrive at the prom and dance to the synthesized rhythms of disco music. The movie is worth watching for the disco score alone--it boasts some of the best disco ever created, composed by Paul Zaza, with a pulsating 4/4 beat, sensuous mock-symphonic orchestration that has glorious violin riffs and flourishes. It's a pity that there's no available soundtrack, as I've searched extensively for one. And then there's that wonderfully choreographed SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER-like dance between Kim and Nick, the two of them twirling and gyrating to the disco beat. Then the killing begins. Kelly, a wan young lass, is snuffed out with a shard of broken glass (again echoes of the shattered glass blanketing little Robin's corpse) in the girl's locker room after reneging on her promise to give up her virginity to her boyfriend. Jolly party-girl Jude inadvertently exposes her neck to the killer while rollicking with her date in back of a van parked outside the school. Wendy, looking more like a seasoned prostitute than a junior miss in her plungy red gown with the tight sequined bodice, is stalked from restroom to parking garage, from parking garage to science lab, from science lab to storage room where she is safe... ....until Kelly's bloody body dangles down from a shelf, causing her to scream--whereupon she is discovered and felled with an axe. The chase scene with Wendy fleeing through the labyrinth of darkened school corridors is the ONLY horror flick scene that has truly scared me. Then the killer goes after Nick, who struggles with him on the disco floor now empty of terrified dancers. The strobe-lit, disco-scored axe-fight is tense, and finally Kim grabs the hatchet and stuns the masked maniac, who flees outside before crumbling to the sidewalk. PROM NIGHT is perhaps the best slasher movie ever made--this from a movie buff who's seen them all. It's far superior to the mediocre FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH, which was released that same year. PROM NIGHT has it all: a fast-moving plot, mystery, a magnificent disco score, macabre killings, and characters you actually care about. If you don't want to be scared, then don't see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PROM NIGHT, while not better than HALLOWEEN or FRIDAY THE 13TH, stands as one of the best slasher movies ever made. Head and shoulders above some of the new wave stuff. STORY-On a script level, this movie was tight. We start with the death that sets the entire story in motion and then we flash forward six years later. The guilty party responsible have all grown up and are ready to attend their senoir prom. Then the tension starts building. The escape mental patient. The creepy phone calls. Morbid notes. This happens through the first hour as we get to know the characters and climaxes in one big blood bath at the Prom. One thing I loved about the movie is how it plays off Halloween. At first we're expecting the story to take the Michael Myers route, but later we're given something completely different. The twist at the end was both surprising and logical. Not to mention heart wrenching. Pacing-wise, everything moves at a perfect pace. I never got bored with this movie and nothing was ever rushed. I have only two complaints. One is that there's a subplot ripped straight out of CARRIE. The other is that damn disco sequence. I was going to give this flick a perfect score before I had to endure THAT. I like seeing a young Jamie Lee Curtis throwing her body around as much as the next guy but the MUSIC....oh, it's horrid. ACTING-Leslie Nelson is always a pleasure to watch and it was funny to see him acting serious after seeing in all those damn NAKED GUN movies. Jamie Lee Curtis is great as usual. We also get the impression that her character isn't virginal in this one...I dug that. Casey Stevens does a good job of conveying the guilt that his character felt and comes across as a guy you would want to hang with....only if he got rid of that damn afro. Anne Marie Martin plays the bitch well and gives a bit of depth to her character, but has her moments of bad acting. Michael Tough is likeable as Curtis' brother and Pita Oliver won be over as the virgin whose having problems losing her virginity. Obviously no one is oscar worthy, but for a slasher film we get more than adequate performances. The killer is a bad  DIRECTING: Paul Lynch takes a few pages from John Carpenter's book and does well for himself. Some atmosphere. Some suspense. Some great camera angles. Just like John Carpenter's and Sean Cunningham's talents were very responsible for the quality of HALLOWEEN and F13, Lynch made PROM NIGHT as good as it was. This is how slasher movies SHOULD be made.MUSIC: The score wasn't anything special and disco is always terrible.BG+P-The violence is mostly offscreen (save for one kick ass decapitation) and the nudity is mostly non-frontal (save for one quick tit shot.) PROM NIGHT isn't spectular, but it wasn't trying to be. It was a little horror film with a lot of quality. This is where the inferior I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER got it's plot. If you dig HALLOWEEN or F13 and are currently in the mood for another old school slasher, this is the movie you want. Only marred by that goddamn disco sequence...***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers.What can I say--I love Prom Night. It's derivative of Carrie, Halloween, Friday the 13th, and perhaps a few others, and while it's no where on the level of those, it's still an enjoyable film on its own.In a very creepy opening sequence set in 1970, Robin Hammond accidently falls to her death while being taunted in a morbid hide-and-seek variant called "The Killers Are Coming." At the urging of shrewish Wendy, Robin's tormenters swear secrecy...little knowing that the accident has not gone unwitnessed. Now it's 1980, and the kids have all grown up and are ready for the senior prom. But strange things begin happening, as the teens are stalked by someone out for a decade-delayed revenge.As I said, this isn't exactly earth-shattering material, but Prom Night turns out as a slick, light slasher exercise with enough energy to make it fun. The acting is good and the characters are (mostly) very appealing, in contrast to the vapid bags of blood that populate similar affairs. Jamie Lee Curtis is terrific as the Prom Queen--and Robin's sister--and she gets to show off her dancing ability at the prom! This is undoubtedly the most bizarre point in the film, as the action comes to a three-minute halt as Jamie and Casey Stevens burn up the disco floor to the blasting title tune. The music, though not exactly Saturday Night Fever material, is pretty memorable--though Gordene Simpson's end-title song, "Fade to Black," is haunting and beautiful. Leslie Nielsen (in a small role) gives one of his last dramatic performances before becoming a professional buffoon. Well-photographed and effective, with an excellent climax; I should add that I was surprised by the killer's identity, though I fell for that typical horror-movie trick of forgetting about the character's existence until the end. For what it is, Prom Night is quite well-done all around.See you at the prom...</fullReview>

Jamie Lee Curtis plays the little girls sister who was not one of the 4. This is the only good one in the series besides part 4, but this one is much better. Its also good how it keeps you guessing who the killer is like in "Scream", "Friday the 13th", and "I Know What You Did Last Summer". Not only does it give you suspense and mystery, but it gives to drama to! See this it is a good horror film with my favorite actress Jamie Lee Curtis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most underrated movies in horror history for a few reasons, #1- disco sucks! #2- Action doesn't start up till most of the movie is over. #3- Leslie Nielsen is being serious (mind you, he's an excellent actor even being serious, however I am such a fan of the Naked Gun series that I was incapable of picturing him seriously). #4- A few of the murder scenes were a bit on the corny side. I know that about sums it all up, but wait a second!! Don't stop reading this review yet. For some reason the film still worked!!! I don't know how, but it worked, it did, I kid you not. There were a few suspenseful moments, and any of you horror fans out there will notice that Scream and countless other movies took various elements from a chase scene in there. Also, up until now the whole idea of a victim putting up a fight with the killer was unheard of (until the hero or heroine came along) but in this one a few of the victims put up a good fight. There are many things which were done well in this movie. And I felt very sorry for the killer when you realize who "they" are. It's actually kinda sad. I dunno why, but it is. In the time peroid that this came out I can imagine it was a cut above the rest. But in these days to be appreciated you have to be an explosion above the best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be Jamie Lee Curtis' second best along with Halloween. This movie must have spawned I Know What You Did Last Summer, because it is very similar. Four friends accidentilly kill Jamie Lee's sister and agree to not tell anyone. Well they've kept quiet for six years until the anniversery of the girl's death which happens to be on Prom Night. The four friends begin getting phone calls, then glass on their pictures, and then are killed one by one. By someone who witnessed the little girl's death. Is it the weird janitor, the girl's father or mother, or is it the escaped lunatic. Watch and find out. Not really scary, but very suspenseful and very good. You could say it's I Know What You Did Last Summer on Halloween with a little Scream and Satuday Night Fever mixed in. Very good, rent it you'll enjoy it very much. *** out of ****</fullReview>

Her brother Alex is also at odds with some bullies at the school, as someone is trying to crash a most deadly prom night, where no one may go home...Mediocre slasher film has some effective scares but is mostly predictable and obvious, with an unsatisfying reveal of the killer that is most bizarre.

		<fullReview>I've seen "Prom Night" about three or four times, many moons ago. I remember thinking that Nielsen must have gotten his career back on track after being in "Airplane!" and then this. I remember Curtis because what slasher movie in that time period WASN'T she in?I even remember the basic plot (mad killer kills teens who were responsible for death of little girl when they were kids).I don't remember disco being so popular in 1980, though.There are so many red herrings in this movie they should have opened a fish market instead. I remember thinking I knew who it was early on, changing my mind a dozen times till the killer was unmasked, then changing it again as their mask was being pulled off, then STILL being surprised.I'm no fan of mad slasher movies, but I like it when they keep me guessing. And this one did. "Prom Night" probably seemed to have more class, what with Curtis in the cast. Her and Nielsen are the only ones I had ever heard of in the film (before and since). And Nielsen: any time I see this film now, all I can think of is he's warming up for "Police Squad!"Now THERE'S an idea for a slasher spoof: "Prom Night!: from the files of Police Squad!"As it is, four stars. Mostly for watching Curtis as a teeny-bopper. Also for keeping me guessing for so long.See you at the "Prom"....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom night, everything is alright...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't help loving this film. It's not the usual kind of horror movie, it's a sad one. During the prom (and among the bloody murders) there is plenty of disco music and very good dance sequences (especially with Jamie Lee Curtis and Casey Stevens). The great difference in "Prom Night" is that the murderer has human motivations rather than "supernatural powers" or things like that. He is as human as anyone and doesn't "resuscitates" like Jason or Freddy Krueger. Another favourable point is that "Prom Night" has very good actors, from the children cast to the grown up ones, including Leslie Nielsen as Jamie Lee Curtis' father. If you want to see an 'I Know What You Did Last Summer-kind-of-movie', then watch "Prom Night". You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GOOD HORROR MOVIE!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very good horror movie. I especially liked the menacing phone calls, wich sticked to terrifying the person on the phone and not playing games with them. It is not as predictable as many other horror movies of it's time, and the opening sequence sets the tone for the rest of the movie. like all horror movies it has the blood and sex but also has a good plot. Jamie Lee Curtis stars in another one of her post halloween roles, and the killer in the end is very surprising with a twist to it all.I like the part where the killer decapitates a guy and his head rolls down the stage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So what is this? A slasher or a disco-flick?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a slasher this movie really fall short. The movie kept me constantly waiting for something that just never happened. The movie feels like one big build-up to nothing.It will really be the horror-fans that will be most disappointed and displeased with this movie. There are not enough killings or other defining genre moments in it and besides when the killings do occur it feels very sloppy and the blood and gore is disappointing. In my opinion the killer seems more like a slapstick character at times.The movie makes some wrong and uninteresting choices with its build-up. The character development just feels uninteresting and also unnecessary. What you want from a slasher are some killings and preferably some gore and creativity to go along with it all. This movie just keeps building up and developing. It plays on the idea of presenting as many different character in this movie as possible, who potentially could turn out to be the killer. Of course nothing wrong with this idea and it gets used quite a lot but when nothing is happening you just couldn't care any less for who will turn out to be the killer. The movie just never gets tense or scary. Think you can blame inexperienced director Paul Lynch for just not handling the genre very well. It's an early '80's movie, that in its style foremost still feels like an '70's flick. It uses some fancy editing and there were some nice moments in it, which kept the movie going. The movie unfortunately also prominently features some disco music and some disco moves from all of the cast members. The kind of moves that are just too embarrassing to look at now days.The story also feels quite messy, aside from the fact that it just isn't a very interesting or even remotely original one. Lots of the characters just feel very random and only seem to be put in the movie to serve as potentially suspects for the killer role. I just don't get it for instance what the roles of the cops are in this movie. They are lurking around everywhere all the time but doing nothing at all.But well, it still has scream-queen Jamie Lee Curtis in it, so how bad can it actually be, you might think. It really is an irrelevant fact that Jamie Lee Curtis is in this though. She gets nothing interesting to do. Same goes for Leslie Nielsen and all of the other actors in it. Nielsen probably still gives the best performance out of the entire movie and it made me wish he was more in it. It made me wish as well that he made less comedies and played more serious roles throughout his career. A disappointing and just mainly very uninteresting slasher.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>prom night has a good plot but the writter did not do the best with the screenplay, it starts off with four kids playing a game and a little girl comes to play as well but by accident she is killed by the four other kids. now six years later on prom night someone is out to get revenge. they tried to set the story up like Halloween, with little action till the end, but atleast Halloween was scary. the first hour of prom night is very slow, the final 30 minutes though are real good. Jamie Lee Curtis stars in this movie so that's one good thing about prom night. all around prom night was a really good movie. i guess you can even say a classic. prom night was later ripped off by i know what you did last summer and by scream. prom night is good for some suspense and maybe a good scare or two. the director did a very good job making the kill scenes pretty suspensefull i say check it out if you like old school horror movies. i give prom night 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All crap after this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay. I'm going to say right now that my favorite characters were Kim Hammond and Kelly. They were the best characters since they both had the right emotions at the right times and made the movie progress. Until one dies and then it's carried solely by the other. The others were pretty good too but I couldn't feel bad. Kelly was the only one with sympathy when they killed poor Robin in their little game and Kim just had that childlike innocence around her. The movie was great. I liked the plot, which was really creepy, and I also liked how it intertwined amongst the key players. All in all, a largely earned 10 for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PROM NIGHT: EVERYTHING'S ALL-RIGHT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A typical "I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER". There is a Julie, A Helen, a Barry, and an occasional Ray. In the opening scene, the children play a twisted game of hide and seek, chanting "THE KILLER IS COMING, THE KILLER'S GONNA GET YOU!". The object of the game appears to be, KILL THE PERSON RUNNING FROM THE KILLER! because they do not stop torturing a young girl who just showed up to get her friend. The children chase the young girl, Robin, until she falls to her death out a window. The 4 make a pact not to tell any one about the incident that took place, much like "I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER". The lines are much similar to " I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER" like the line where Wendy, the Barry like character, Yells at Kelly, saying," Kelly?...KELLY!" and Kelly says, "I don't wanna go to jail" and Wendy says," Say it!" "I'll never tell" much like the confrontation between Barry and Julie in "I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER". 6 years later, LIKE IN SCREAM, a stranger, who witnessed the death of young Robin, begins to call the children, who have grown up and are struggling to get ready for the prom, in a low, soft whisper. The voice threatens them over the phone saying, "I'll see you at the prom" and other things. Then, at the prom, one by one, people die because of at least one of the following: sex, drugs, stupidity (not shutting up while hiding from an axe wielding killer). All in all, to make matters worse, before walking down the aisle, Jamie Lee Curtis' (Prom Queen(Kim)) opposite, Nick (Prom King) gets knocked out by the school bully, and as the school bully is preparing to walk down the aisle with Kim.... Well, I won't give any more away, but the movie is good for what it was and when it was made. I give it *** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prom Night (1980) * 1/2 (out of 4) Canadian slasher has a young girl getting killed when four others play a prank on her. Six years later it's prom night and a masked killer is after the four. This was an early example of the 80's slashers so that should be kept in mind when viewing this today as it really doesn't have too much in common with the better known slashers of the decade. The body count is pretty low and there isn't too much in the way of suspense but the biggest sin in this film is the fact that not much happens until the final twenty-minutes. I found this film incredibly slow moving and lifeless, which isn't good for a slasher. I also wasn't too thrilled with any of the performances and that includes Leslie Nielsen and Jamie Lee Curtis. The supporting teens aren't any good either with some of them being downright horrid. Another problem with the film is that it's hard to really feel anything for the four teens because of how mean spirited the original prank is. The "killer" chant that they do at the start of the film is rather effective but it also had me against the teens later on in the film. The direction by Peter Lynch is pretty bland as he brings no suspense or style to the movie. He also lingers on too many scenes including an extended disco sequence and another chase sequence that goes on way too long. All in all this is a pretty forgettable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst... Movie... Ever... Seriously... Worst... Movie... Ever! Pure... Suckage!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me start by saying that this piece of crap doesn't even deserve a 1. A 1 is reserved for movies with actual frigging' plots. You wanna know what a plot is? Let's see, Webster's Dictionary should have the meaning of a plot.Plot - n : The pattern of events or main story in a narrative or drama.Drama? What drama?&gt;?? Narrative? Meaningless. So there goes two out of two of what a movie has to have for a frigging' plot.Now what does this leave with the rest of celluloid crap put to waste of a movie reel? Something for my friends to start knocking' at my door to beat my honky cracker ass because i was stupid enough to watch this piece of crap...alone...If you've seen "Prome Night II: Hello Mary Lou and thought what part one was like, then stop thinking. Put every intention of tracking down "Prom Night" and bury your stupid dead with it.I was, I was going to go into explanation of how crappy "Prom Night" is...but I'll save you from Jamie Lee Curtis coming through my television screen and purging me into a purgatory of unspeakable horrors. The only thing you can do to this movie is go to the nearest sand dune, climb to the top of the highest one, and throw it with all of your might while it's Midnight so that you can never see with this curse from God himself might fall into the blackest abyss that is nothingness.The end. I hope I die. Now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best slashers ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PROM NIGHT (1980)starring: Jamie Lee Curtis, Leslie Nielson, Casey Stevens, Eddie Benton, Antoinette Bower, Michael Tough, Pita Oliver, David Mucci, Mary Beth Rubens, Joy Thompson, Sheldon Rybowski, Jeff Wincott, George Touliatos.plot: Kim Hammond (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Nick McBride (Casey Stevens) are two high-school seniors planning to be crowned Queen and King of the prom. But a few things threaten their coronation, such as bad-girl Wendy (Eddie Benton) using bad-boy Lou (David Mucci) to help in a prank to split the lover's apart so she can win back Nick, and a masked killer stalks Nick, Wendy, Kelly (Mary Beth Rubens) and Jude (Joy Thompson) six years after they accidentally killed Kim's little sister and vowed never to speak of it again.the good: Great slasher, which inspired later slashers such as "I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER" and "VALENTINE". As you can already see, slashers are my favorite type of horror and this one was definitely worthy to the sub-genre.You got your Jamie Lee Curtis, horny teenagers, pot-smoking teenagers, a who-dun-it, a vengeful masked killer, murders to disco-music and Leslie Nielson in a serious role as Kim's father, who is also the principal at Hamilton High.I also liked the fact that it introduced characters who weren't in the movie just to die or be chased by the killer, such as Kim's friend Vicki (Pita Oliver) and Kelly's boyfriend Drew (Jeff Wincott).The murder scenes were also very effective. Yes, they didn't start until an hour into the movie, but they were all to disco music, which was almost kind of creepy. One of my favorite's is a slit throat, that didn't show it but it focused on the girl's face so you just see her reaction.I also love the creepy phone calls and notes the killer leaves.One more thing is the identity of the killer, you'd never see it coming!9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay slasher,but nothing really impressive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Lynch's "Prom Night" is an average slasher movie about four high school students stalked by a masked killer during their senior prom as retribution for their involvement in the death of a young girl six years earlier.The first half of "Prom Night" is pretty dull,but after it the film becomes interesting.There's a bit of suspense and some good kill scenes(bloody axe decapitation being my favourite!)but the disco soundtrack is truly horrible.Overall I enjoyed this film and you should too,if you like slasher movies-still there are much better slasher flicks for example "The Prowler","Maniac" or "Just Before Dawn".My rating:7 out of 10.</fullReview>
