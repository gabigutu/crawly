		<shortDescription>Prom Night 2008, how do I hate thee...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...let me count the ways.1. A title-only 'remake' that pulls out every cliché in the slasher handbook.2. A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic.3. A completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills.4. A PG-13 rating that insures no gore, violence, or sex.5. A villain that is not frightening or even mysterious.6. A cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldn't possibly care about them.7. A lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere (much unlike the original Prom Night).8. A script of dialog that's beyond poor - it's mind numbing. 9. A series of cardboard performances (not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that).10. A completely inept teen-targeted slasher remake that's not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination - or even to show a puddle of blood.It's a no-brainer horror fans, save your money.BOMB out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less scary than the kid toucher episode of Webster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a Lifetime original film. You know the one. This October, Lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving (insert disease name here) to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex-boyfriend. It's dramatic ? it's sappy ? it's immensely dull. It does nothing to further a genre, tell an original story, or strive for ANY sort of newness. Prom Night shares this plight. Watching the killer poke holes in his victims, we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled. It occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history.Our director is working with a fairly good-looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier. Think about Matthew McConaughey coming at you with a knife. You'd probably go ? "OH! Good lookin guy is going to kill me? Naaaa." Not scary even for a second, so the director throws Schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror. This mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator. You'll get 15 jump scares in this film, 2 of which made my date jump (I might mention she is afraid of EVERYTHING). I'd also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me.As if this film were not disjointed enough, it appears to be cut to shreds. I'm not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film; I'm saying as the film moves from scene to scene, you often get a jarring jump. This is the kind of thing you'd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together, cross his fingers, and hope for the best. The editor should be shot.With a plot you can pack into two sentences, one stray spray of blood, an emo killer, and the tension of a very special episode of "Silver Spoons", we're left with no reason to support horror this weekend ? at least on the big screen. In fact, this is the sort of film that should be punished. Is it really that hard to make a scary movie? Was this crew even aware they were making a horror film??!! A complete waste of my time and yours. I bit the bullet to get you this review. Don't let my sacrifice be in vain. DON'T GO INTO THE MOVIE!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor acting, no script, no plot, no convincing killer, no suspense, no original setups, it uses the same closet/under the bed/person-behind-you-in-the-mirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring, and NOT in a foreshadowing way either, and the fact that NOBODY ever "really" gets killed (at least not on screen) , which in turn zaps any suspense it may invoke right out of it and makes everyone feel eve MORE cheated for spending money on their admission ticket....its a horror film w/o any horror LMAO. The MOST you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheet.You have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this, or you were high/drunk at the time.Honestly, I have a life and don't bother writing reviews that often unless I really really hated something, or enjoyed it tremendously.But this film is AWFUL and I feel I have a duty of sorts to warn you NOT to give your money to Hollywood and encourage this kind of filmaking ever again! It is one thing to rent a "bad" movie at blockbuster from the Weinsteins, its another when you have to sit through it in a theater.Also, in case you want some remake nostalgia, forget it! This is NOT a remake, nor is it a re-imagining. It is not scary, nor engaging, nor is it satisfying enough to be "funny" like others on IMDb have claimed...it is just stale and booooring.Here is what you will take away from this film: remembering the scar on Brittany Snow's head that stands out more than the plot, the fact that Jonathan Schaech MUST be having some sexual affair with J.S. Cardone of "The Forsaken" to have gotten another role as a killer(because he is as frightening as my poodle, and too cute to kill just about anyone) and that for some reason (duh) everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back. What kind of person would NOT get worried at the prom when they decide to announce the candidates for prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just somehow doesn't show up? This is my warning to you. DO NOT waste you're money like I did. The "original" sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for Jamie Lee Curtis fans, though no way near as bad as this piece of crap (sorry to sound vulgar or rude, but once you see this, you will understand why I say what I say).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom night is probably the worst film of 2008</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night. And by doing so killing her family, friends, and her enemies. Now before I begin let me say have you been tired of PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately. Are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'Oh my god' and talking about girlish things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing are you tired of the US remaking Asian, Japanese, and Chinese films. That pretty much sums up Prom night but I'm still not done with the review.The only reason to see 'Prom night' is to crack a laugh at the kills. If not, don't see Prom night. You never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7. So not only aren't they scary but it's obnoxious. By the time I met the cast I think I was ready to hurl. Too much girl talk, too much guy talk, and lots of 'Oh my gosh. It's our prom'. I understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate. If I were to put Prom Night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films I'd be the first one too. I'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick. Seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting, cheap scares, and a 'Night to die for' when watching the film.1 star out of 10. (P.S. If I could give the film zero stars I would).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror is gone in Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself, but I just got back from this movie, and felt I had to express my opinions. Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development. I know they often lack in horror movies, but Prom Night looked like it didn't even put forth ANY effort in that department. Next, we all love suspense. That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night had none of that! Of course, we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night have that? Nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife. And when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 like Prom Night, they leave that stuff out too. So with all of these elements missing, I ask....does this still count as a horror movie? Nope. I'd call it more of a comedy. People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw "Semi-Pro" that was supposed to actually be a comedy (which also sucked, but thats another story!). I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror. All the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money. The people I went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake! Which made me mad! I wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake??? Where will horror go next???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scary movie? Not really...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie. I'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning, but upon seeing it, it is neither horror or thriller.I was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable. You could predict what was going to happen next. The young actors were alright at playing their characters, but I'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise.Yes, I'll give props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling or scary. There were almost zero "jump-in-your-seat" scenes. So, don't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres, wait 'til it comes to DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Midnight Everyone's Ready To Go Home...But Someone Has Other Really Stupid Plans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for Prom Night, I have to admit, the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie. So my friend and I saw Prom Night last night and I have to say I must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film, not to mention I am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people. There was no tension, the characters, how was I supposed to care about them? They had no development what-so-ever, the killer?! Oh, my God, this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed, I know it's a film, but why would a man who never(or at least we know of) killed any one before, kill a girl's family and friends that he's just obsessed over? I mean, was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her? I have no idea, because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror.Donna's family was just brutally murdered by her teacher, who has become very obsessed over her, he was captured and put in jail. It's been 3 years and she's just now getting some peace in her life, she's even going to her senior prom. But the killer has escaped and still has Donna on his mind, he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends, and the hotel maid, and the bell boy, because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employee's are. Donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un-noticed and can kill people so silently, just, wow.I'm sorry, I really did want to love this movie, we haven't had a good slasher flick in a long time, but this was just a stupid movie that I was not impressed with. Just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious. I know that this was a PG-13 movie, but I just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes? Not to mention no stab holes? I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone unless you're a teen, this movie was made for the teenagers, not adults, and not for those who know a real horror movie, no offense to those who did enjoy this film, but I don't understand how anyone could.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how badly we've regressed?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon "retellings", but this film truly peeved me off. The original Prom Night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. Sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! The scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly. (A good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) This film couldn't successfully pull that off, so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. There needs to be a likable hero or heroine. This film doesn't have one. The person I most identified with was the head detective. His calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. Common sense approach to events that occur. (If you're running from an Axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) If you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone. And if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. These clichés are tired and well overplayed. In the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Collection of Clichés with a Total Lack of Originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Bridgeport, the deranged high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed by the teenager student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, the traumatized Donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills. On her prom night, she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples of friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel for the party. But the psychopath Richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing Donna, stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path.The forgettable slash "Prom Night" is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality. The stupid story is shallow and silly, with a bad acting of Johnathon Schaech in the role of an insane killer. The predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "A Morte Convida Para Dançar" ("The Death Invites to Dance")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good grief I can't even begin to describe how poor this film is. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting much to begin with. Let's face it, a PG-13 slasher flick is pre-destined to be missing the ummm... slashing, so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore. But it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away. We have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. And here's a turnup for the books... SHE NEVER CHANGES - hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing - character development. If you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again. On top of this, we're handed possibly the least intriguing (and definitely the least scary) killer ever to grace the genre. I'm not joking when I say that Dora the Explorer has scarier villains than this movie.Finally, because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept (and apparently thirteen-year-old) director, what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time? Closets, that's what. Lots and lots of closets: big closets, small closets, mirrored closets, closets to Narnia, so many damned closets you'll not want to dress yourself for another year. In fact this movie should have just been called "CLOSET", and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the DVD case. On the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by Roger and Ebert - something to the extent of: "what the f*@! did we just waste our time watching!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine the scenario - you are at the movie theater only because you are in Washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're finished with the Museums. You think you might go see the Sarah Marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don't have to engage your brain. It's sold out. Options? - The Bank Job, In Bruges, The Leatherheads or Prom night. You've seen the Bank Job (suprisingly decent heist movie that) and In Bruges (again, pretty good) so you're down to two. You don't fancy watching Clooney or the nice one from the Office run around in 1930 football uniforms, so you go see Prom Night right? Wrong. You take the $8.50, walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for $8.50. It would be money better spent.It actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror/thriller or whatever it is supposed to be. If I was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut I wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry. Probably both. An insult to anyone's intelligence... my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie, as for the acting, they might as well have cast robots (or maybe dogs) in the roles, they would have been more realistic. The detective has to be possibly the worst actor I have ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I hate his acting so much I don't care how you spell his name) you are relieved on your title(s)) So in summary 'not good'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business. The idea that audiences paid to see this movie (and like an idiot I rented the film) is discouraging also.Obsessed teacher (3 years prior) kills teenager's family because he wants her. For no reason he kills the mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction. Years later, obsessed teacher breaks out of prison. HMM--usual bad writing--no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute. Obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a Navy SEAL and can sneak around, sniff out people and with a knife is super killer. Sure!!! Now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason, knifes bellhop for the fun of it, and starts to hunt down the teenager's friends. Now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you. Obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel---again it is stupid, ever cop would know his face--but he walks right by them. Now he kills two cops outside teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend.There is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage. If any other profession put out work of this low quality, they would be fired. Yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and rent a GOOD horror movie. It's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like "Scream" and "Scary Movie".In between the scary bits is the most BANAL and BORING dialog ever written. Stupid "we're going to the prom" junk. I wanted to claw my ears off. Honestly, "The Hills" has better dialog.There really was no need to make this movie. Leading lady is uninteresting and I kept thinking "Her? Really? Guy is obsessed with her? Really?" All the characters act in stupid ways, including the police. (Cover the place in teams of 2! Front and back! Not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed.) The serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem. No resistance from victims (or doors). Nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back (or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door). The people are like mentally disabled sheep.By the by, if you're a gore fan, you'll be disappointed too. All the killing is kept offscreen and is -- ahem -- tastefully done. (So boo hoo for you!) None of the killings is the least bit interesting. Most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out.The only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies. "Oh kitty! You scared me! I thought you were the killer -- AIIEEEE!" And then at the end when it's time for the killer to die -- well, let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. Snore.The audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout. It was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough. Don't encourage this kind of lazy film-making.(Oh, and by the way -- no crowning of a prom king or queen. No tiara. No bucket of blood.) So save your money and rent "Carrie" or "Friday the 13th" or "Halloween" or "Scream" or "Scary Movie" (any of them) to get a good scare with some original twists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most clichéd horror film imaginable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay. So I just got back. Before I start my review, let me tell you one thing: I wanted to like this movie. I know I've been negative in the past, but I was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film. I didn't.It's not just the fact that every horror cliché imaginable is in this. And it's not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare (walking into a baseball bat left on the floor? Are you kidding me?). It just wasn't scary. One thing I was surprised about: there was more blood than I thought there was going to be.. which isn't saying much.The film starts off with Donna being dropped off by Lisa's mom at her house. She comes in.. goes upstairs. Camera pans to her father dead on the couch. Spooky. She goes upstairs, where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens. Finds her brother on his bed, apparently dead (how could she tell? He didn't have a spot of blood on him). Killer comes in, Donna hides under bed, mom dies. She runs outside screaming for help. Killer behind her: "I did it for us." Cut to therapy session. This confused a lot of people- everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it- and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back. Filler dialogue ensues.THey cut to the chase pretty quick. Few scenes at the salon, they go to the hotel. Of course the killer is already there (for some reason, he escaped 3 days ago but the police/family weren't informed until he's already there). More filler ensues.I'm not going to go on about what happens in the film, because I don't want to spoil it too much. If you want to know who dies, Horror_Fan made a post about it already. But on the subjects of deaths: they weren't that exciting. People in the theatre actually laughed out loud (an experience I've never had before in a horror movie, not even in When A Stranger Calls) during several of them. One in particular: the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious 'scared' face I've ever seen. The only death involving any blood was Lisa's, and that was pretty scarce. Her throat is slashed, blood (if you can even call it that- it was practically black) splatters on the curtain-thing. The only other blood was on Claire when we see her body. Apparently, Fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death. Um, okay? The movie was one of the most clichéd I've ever seen. Let's see here.. obligatory close-mirror-curtain-BOOM! scene. Check. Twice, actually (you could tell they were struggling). Mandatory backing-up-into-killer. Check. There's also the backing-up-into-lamp scene, but you've all seen that. Oh, you say you want a birds-flying-away scare? Well, you got it! (Yes, they managed to incorporate one of those in here). And, of course, the we-have-security-on-all-exits-but-he-still-escaped scene. Shall I go on? I could.For anyone saying the characters weren't stupid, are you kidding me? "Oh, even though the massive alarm is ringing, literally saying PLEASE VACATE THE BUILDING, and 3 of my friends are missing, I'm going to go upstairs to get my wrap." These characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever. The only likable character - Lisa - made one of the most stupid moves in the movie. "Oh, I just realized the psycho-teacher is here! I must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her! Oh, shoot, the elevator is being to slow? Guess I'll take the stairs and run off into the construction site!" Ugh. By the end of the film, they all deserved to die. The only death anyone felt any remorse for was Donna's boyfriend (I can't even remember his name- is that bad?), and by that time, the audience was completely drained out of this scareless, clichéd film.There were SOME positives- the acting was decent for the most part, and it was well-shot. But that's about it.I'd give it a 1/5, and that's being generous. Just for the laughs (and believe me, the audience had a few), and Brittany Snow.Oh, and the reaction was bad. Very bad. People were boo-ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative. Expect bad legs for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've ever seen... EVER.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I could give this movie a zero out of ten. Before going to this movie the day after it came out, I came on IMDb to check out the comments. A comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog. I never go by other people's opinions, so I wasted seven dollars for this crap movie. It had to be one of the WORST movies I've ever seen.The person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff. Since when do scary movies have sappy scenes? I swear, I'm amazed there weren't any GROUP HUG ^-^ moments.I think I jumped. Once. And that's because I zoned out, thinking about my research paper for English. The clichéd, birds/cat popping out of nowhere thing when you THOUGHT something was gonna happen.And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost DIED laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said, "I have to get my mom's shawl!!!" You. Idiot. Screw the shawl! Safety is just a few steps away, but NO, my mom's shawl (that didn't match the dress By the way) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety. And to top it all off, they take her BACK to her house, knowing that the killer knew where she lived. God.My friend and I also predicted the ENTIRE movie. And not just the, I bet he's hiding under the bed, moments. It was the, "HE stole the bellhop's clothes and sneaked out of the hotel" and "It's the detective coming down the hallway, not the killer!" moments. Movies should NEVER be THIS predictable. Disney movies aren't even this predictable.I'm gonna complete my rant now by saying, this was a terrible movie. I'm glad I went to see it in theaters so I wouldn't buy it for $15.00 and then hate it. It was just bad. It would've been better if only one thing would've happened. If, after being shot by the detective, the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in. Knife in hand, falling and stabbing the girl on his way down. Oh, how lovely that would've been.Don't waste your time or money. Go see a GOOD movie.</fullReview>

Now, she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends. Once there, they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt. pros: I got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves.An example:Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her (she doesn't seem that great) has escaped from prison. Their reason: They don't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. LOLcons: Let me start off by saying I'm a huge slasher fan. Usually I can have fun with even the bad ones. I even like some PG-13 horror films. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated PG-13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie.First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher films that don't even have stories. At least they can be entertaining. This is about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her entire family. A few years later, he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends ...? Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone cared about. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I couldn't care less. This should have been a Lifetime feature, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. And then ... this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes. I don't even care that it's not that gory, some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not that gory but they still had effective murders. Here, we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen, a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds, and a closeup on a bad actor's face as he screams in agony. I'm sure that 10 year-old girls were terrified, but not me.I also hated the characters. There was Donna's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life, unless you are a gay male. Then we had Donna's annoying friends Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the token mean girl Chrissy (Brianne Davis). If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were annoying, try watching this movie. And don't get me started on Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and the DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me flashbacks to Usher's performance in SHE'S ALL THAT.Add to all that predictable plot turns, a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material, and you have quite a stinker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this with my hopes up, by twenty minutes into the movie I couldn't have been more let down. Despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake, I kept my hopes high that maybe...just maybe someone would get it right this time around. Sadly, Prom Night is about on the same quality level as the recent April Fools Day remake, bad script, bad direction, cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror.From beginning to end it's boring, repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls. We've seen it all before and we've seen it done a million times better then this. If you go to see Prom Night in the theater (I'd say wait for the DVD or PPV), get ready for the audience to laugh, because laugh they will. The laughs aren't at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny, they are in response to key "thrilling" moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of Scary Movie. Seriously, was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof? The film makers missed the mark so badly here, that a large number of the audience in the theater I attended walked out about halfway through the movie. Which in retrospect, I wish I had done. Not me though, I had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better. Needless to say It didn't. The "horror" scenes are a joke, not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction, the script, the "special effects" and the camera work. The movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it, but still came out of it with a micro budget movie. I halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking I would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere. This movies scary alright, if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom Night = Sad movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what an awful movie. Bad writing, bad acting, bad clichés; I really wish I could have the 1 1/2 hours of my life back. This definitely wins the award for the worst movie of 2008 so far. What were they thinking when they made this movie? It's like they put nothing special into it; nothing we've never seen before. Did they really think this was going to work? I knew, going into it, that it would be a bad movie, but I didn't think it'd be the WORST. The only way I'd see this movie again is if I was strapped to my seat, duct tape around my mouth, and my eyes taped open. Even then, I think the sight of seeing me like this would be more exciting than the movie.Save your money!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully Predictable Slasher 'Remake'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prom Night" is a title-only remake of the 1980 slasher flick that starred Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen. This movie takes place in an Oregon town, where Donna (Brittany Snow) is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years. She and her friends arrive at the prom, which is taking place in a grand hotel, and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives. Little does anyone know, a man from Donna's past, who has haunted her for years, is also at the prom... and is willing to kill anyone in way of his pursuit of her.I'm a fan of the original "Prom Night", so I tried to maintain a little hope in this movie, but I have to admit I was quite disappointed. "Prom Night" suffers from the worst affliction a horror movie could have, and that is predictability. There are absolutely no surprises here, and I felt I had seen everything in this movie done dozens of times, often better, before. What does this equate to for the audience? Boredom. Unless of course you have never seen any horror movies, or are part of the pre-teen crowd, but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen. The plot is simplistic, but the entire script is void of any type of surprise, twist, atmosphere, or anything, and this really, really hurts the movie because it never really gives the audience anything to sink their teeth into. It all just seemed very bland.A lot of people seem to complain with the fact that this is a PG-13 slasher movie as well, and I understand what they are saying, but I don't think it's impossible to make a good slasher movie with minimal gore. Take Carpenter's "Halloween" for example - little to no on screen violence, but still an extremely frightening and effective movie. You don't need gore to make a film scary, but even had "Prom Night" been gratuitously violent (which it is not, it is very tame), it still would have added little to the movie because there is not much in the script to build on to begin with. The tension and suspense here is mild at best, and I spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of situations, and was correct about 99% of the time. Our characters aren't well written enough either for the audience to make any connection to them, and their by-the-numbers demises are routine and careless.I will point out a few things I did like about this movie, though, because it wasn't completely useless - the cinematography is really nice, and everything was very well-filmed and fairly stylish. Among the "jump" scares (that are for the most part very predictable), there were a few that were kind of clever. The sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold, however predictable the unfolding may be. As for the acting, it's mediocre at best. Brittany Snow plays the lead decently, but really the rest of the cast doesn't show off much talent. Johnathan Schaech plays the villain, and is probably the most experienced performer here, but even he isn't that impressive. However, I did like the character he played, which was a nice change from the typical 'masked-stalker' type killer we see a lot. As far as the ending goes, the last fifteen minutes of the film had me bored to my wit's end and it was very anti-climactic.Overall, "Prom Night" was a disappointment. Everything was very by-the-numbers, routine, and predictable, which is somewhat upsetting considering this had the potential to be a decent slasher movie. There were a few neat moments, but the movie lacked any suspense or atmosphere, and had little plot development, nor believable characters. I'd advise seasoned horror fans to save their money and wait till it's out on video, or rent the original instead, because there are absolutely no surprises here. Some may find a little entertainment in it, but it was far too predictable for my tastes. I expected better, and left the theater very disappointed. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An abysmal success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I doubt there's much question to this movie being technically terrible. I mean this movie epitomizes cliché in all the wrong ways. From the not-so-clever scare tactics (i.e. cinematic tension unfolding into either a jolt or a joke) to the clear as day plot twists. It ripped off all the classic slasher flicks failing to amount to them whatsoever. I'm not saying that Scream was good, but this is like a carbon copy of Scream minus the strategic comic relief and plus some awkward, cardboard acting and poor attempts at getting a laugh. There is little doubt that this movie is an abysmal failure.Then why say success? The one thing that this movie delivered with incredible success only applies to a certain target audience. Those are the 11-13 year olds who are simply excited to have gotten into a 14A movie and will be bombarded with, for some, their first "horror" movie experience. It gives them all they want: blood, twists, jolts, tension, and of course kissing. They can't tell a bad slasher flick from a Tarantino masterpiece. Not because of their age, however, but because they just haven't been exposed to enough 14+ movies in order to have a well developed movie sense. It's a good experience for them, a benchmark, if you will. I may have hated the movie, but all the twelve year old screams and laughter in the theater made me think that maybe it was worth it to make a horror so mind numbingly terrible for the sole purpose of appealing to those young ones. Revisiting the Scream days, but with less prowess.oh, and financially, it was a great success as well. This probably due to the massive influx of underage movie goers.A success. An abysmal success, but a success nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the remake game, old always triumphs over new.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, the old now-you-see-him-now-you-don't bathroom medicine cabinet mirror gag! Edgy! Ooh, the prom-date-making-her-grand-descent-down- the-stairs-in-her-best-teenybopper- regalia shot! Innovative! More than any other remake of late, Prom Night aggressively reaches out to the shopping mall multiplex crowd -- kids who are too young to notice its pervasive clichés. In fact, it feels more like a Scream clone than a standard remake, thwacking us over the head with airy dialogue about boys, hair, and dresses (one character exclaims, "Oh my God, you guys!!!~~~" in a cadence that somehow demands the use of tildes) and milking a slew of ever-so-hip musical re-appropriations (including a drab and downright funereal cover of The Zombies' "Time of the Season").There is zero style in the cinematography, editing, story, or sound design here. It's all warbly booms, balanced soap opera lighting, and quick cuts framing a hackneyed, lazy, and dubious plot. It's hard to believe that J.S. Cardone, who wrote and directed the phenomenal 1982 slasher The Slayer, penned this pile of sugar-laced garbage. It's a prom for platitudes. If anything, Prom Night shows us how out-of-touch these nouveau slashers are with their forefathers. By spelling everything out for us and rigidly expressing its killer's motives and sentiments from the very beginning, it strips away any potential intrigue -- it makes no attempt at the mystery angle that was somewhat palpable (if not altogether effective) in the 1980 Prom Night. And, because it's firmly planted in PG-13 slasher-lite territory, it doesn't even have geek show appeal.Despite the fact that such practicalities as the killer's name, identity, and wrap sheet are completely revealed to us early on in the first reel, Prom Night is surprisingly tight-lipped about his origins. He is a former high school teacher -- that much I ascertained -- but under what circumstances did he become obsessed with our platinum blonde Final Girl? Simply put: what is the point? And what's with that boring baseball cap he wears? The scariest thing about this guy is his level of banality.Even inferior slashers tend to raise the octane in the last 20-30 minutes or so, when the Final Girl has spotted all her dead friends and encountered the killer and the cat-and-mouse game ensues. Prom Night, however, is interminably boring in its latter quarter. We tediously follow the cops around the hotel as they make austere discoveries of bodies we've already seen slain. We also watch the Final Girl laze around her bedroom a lot, with nary a bag of tricks in sight. It all leads up to a matter-of-fact and unceremonious climax that actually has you thinking, "That's it?"Perhaps the only good thing about this tepid junk is winsome newcomer Dana Davis, who, unfortunately, doesn't last long enough to make a complete impact. I guess I should have prefaced that last sentence with a spoiler warning. Oh, who cares?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young girl is stalked by an former teacher of hers who had a major obsession for her &amp; vowed to make her his. After having a restraining order put on him, he breaks into her home &amp; murders her entire family one evening as she watches terrified under a bed. Captured by police, he is sentenced to a maximum security prison for the criminally insane, however three years later he escapes &amp; picks up a knife with plans once again to make her his, killing a few of her friends along the way on her prom night. If this plot synopsis doesn't sound anything like the original PROM NIGHT (Which this supposedly is being billed as, a "remake") that's because you're right, it isn't the same plot &amp; this film is no more of a remake of the original slasher film than E.T. would be, with the added difference that at least E.T. was entertaining &amp; fun, all the things that PROM NIGHT 08' isn't. The version I saw of this movie was billed as "The Unrated Version" however after seeing the film, I often wonder if SCREEN GEMS &amp; ALLIANCE ENTERTAINMENT didn't add that to the video box just to make us horror fans laugh, because there is nothing in this version that I saw that would merit it an Unrated movie, there's no gore, sex, nudity, drugs or alcohol taking, no extra violence to brutal that would even merit it an R rating in the first place! Which begs me to ask the question to those unfortunates who seen this in theaters &amp; who wasted their hard earned money &amp; hour &amp; a half of their life they can't get back (Just like us who caught it on DVD) what did you go &amp; see, what version of the film did the studio put in theaters for you? Did it just contain The beginning &amp; end credits only? because that's the only explanation I can come up with as to why this is being billed as "Unrated" The acting is mediocre, the direction shabby, there's no suspense or any tension, nothing frightening going on, the kills are all off screen, none of the characters are interesting &amp; all come off as obnoxious, the villain isn't scary &amp; I could go on! I can only assume that the only reason the film did well at the box office is because a group of 10-12 year olds who have never seen a horror movie before all flocked to the theater to see it, because it would be their first horror movie experience, another reason could be because they thought it would be "cool" to see a PG-13/14 A rater (No really I would like to think that was the reason) because even the previews of the film made this flick look boring &amp; bad, so if it looked so boring &amp; bad in the previews why did I go see it when it arrived on DVD? Simple, I had seen &amp; liked the original four PROM NIGHT movies &amp; it would keep my reviews on the series up to date &amp; while yes the original PROM NIGHT with JAMIE LEE CURTIS was no masterpiece, it at least tried to be scary just one of the many things this film seemed afraid to do, just like THE FOG 05, WHEN A STRANGER CALLS 06' &amp; oh how I wish I could forget this one too - the supposed "remake" of APRIL FOOLS DAY, which like this movie, was not a remake at all but a rip-off of I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. In short, this is not a horror film, it is not the supposed "remake" the studio heads said it was, it's a flat, boring film, named PROM NIGHT because they knew if they didn't say it was a remake to pick the curiosity of horror fans, that no one would go see this garbage. Horror fans can rest easy knowing that PROM NIGHT 08' nor APRIL FOOLS DAY 08' are remakes of their slasher favorites, they are way to different in plots therefore studio's cannot say they have officially remade them. like I said E.T. was more of a remake of PROM NIGHT (Or APRIL FOOLS DAY for that matter) than these. Avoid at all costs, even if you seen &amp; loved the first four PROM NIGHT movies don't see this, this is yet another example of greedy studio heads giving horror fans the middle finger!* star</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was alright I guess you could say. You could probably go see better movies than this one. In my opinion the movie was VERY predictable. You could guess everything that was about to happen next. The way the "crazy teacher" killed people was all the same, and it was rather boring. One positive thing I can say about this movie was that it did make me jump. Everyone in the audience also had the same reaction. But then again, the whole predictability's was just too much. Oh he's in the closet. Oh he has a knife. Oh no Oh no he's going to look under the bed. C'Mon Hollywood. Also too much hype about prom. I felt like I was watching Laguna beach only with a psycho killer teacher on the loose. Another thing I noticed were that some aspects of the movies reminded me of "Silence of the Lambs" only that was a far far better movie. For example when there was blood dripping from the vent, the elevator, when he just so happened to fit in the same size clothes that the hotel worker did, and how he was so obsessed with Donna.. but wouldn't hurt her. I don't know about you, but it just seemed like there was too much publicity for a movie that definitely did not live up to what everyone thought it would have.I agree with everyone else, save your money and go watch a real scary movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a difficult one to talk about objectively: it's a teen slasher movie, which as another comment pointed out has every cliché in the book. The acting is pretty good, I have to say - Schaech was particularly chilling (especially for me as I've only seen him before in That Thing You Do). The story is obviously screwed up.How many people, seriously, ever escape from maximum security prisons? There's a ropey premise for a start. How many hotels keep so little track of their staff that no-one notices if they go missing for a couple of hours UNTIL the police mention the wandering psycho? And for God's sake, how many idiotic teenagers go back into the hotel for a shawl, in a building where there's an emergency evacuation being repeatedly announced over the tannoy. Demented.On the other hand, if you know what to expect from this kind of movie, it's actually quite amusing, and it's far from so terrible that there's no level of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't even concentrate on this film, it was that bad. I had little expectations for this movie because it was a remake, and it's American. But please! This film was atrocious. Not only did was it horrifyingly predictable, it had two-dimensional characters, terrible dialog, and one of the worst villains ever. First off, the characters, particularly Donna - she seemed completely fine over the fact that her mother had been murdered right in front of her eyes, only a couple of years ago. I'm no psychologist, but I'd think she'd have some form of disorder after said incident, and wouldn't be all 'la-di-da'. But that could just be me.Second, the villain. Okay, this film reeks a lot of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', but even that had a pretty cool 'bad guy' - the teacher/killer in this was so boring. Ooh, he was infatuated with a high school student, snapped, and was thrown into jail? And what was with that minuscule knife of his? Please.Which leads me on to the ending - why on earth would they send Donna and her boyfriend back to HER house? If this killer managed to escape from jail, it's pretty effin' obvious he's gonna be able to break into a suburban home. I haven't seen the original, but would like to - even if it's the same film, I'm pretty sure it was executed a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what it is with the latest set of want-to-be horror thrillers dropping their blood, guts and overall grotesqueness simply to make the PG-13 rating. You'd think movies would learn after the downfall of "Alien versus Predator", which is that a horror movie without blood is kind of like a romantic dinner by yourself. At least the Strause brothers learned from the mistake of "AVP" when they made "Requiem". J.S. Cardone, executive producer and writer of "Prom Night" missed the memo somewhere. "Prom Night" is a prime example of a movie with great possibility. It simply tried to target the wrong audience. It's a thriller/horror that should be targeted to high schooler's through college students, but with the drop in rating, it seemed to target the middle schoolers. Because its one of the few slasher films with a PG-13 rating, when someone is stabbed, their bodies don't show stab wounds when they appear again. With a fairly straightforward plot that doesn't go very far, Nelson McCormick's, big screen directoral debut was at least somewhat successful. The cinematography that McCormick was able to capture was still astonishing. It's very elaborate and the jumps where largely unsuspected. One of the better credits to Cardone's writing was the fact that the opening sequence was the best part, because it throw's us into the action and forces us to become enthralled when main character Donna Keppel played by Brittany Snow, who is one of few proved actresses or actors in the film, comes home after a movie with a friend, her actions and mannerisms mimicked my own whenever I walk in the door, but I don't find dead bodies of my family like she does. Snow's other great credits include "Hairspray", "John Tucker Must Die", and also the television show "American Dreams". But in the end it was still predictable, which always takes away from a horror/thriller. Even in this film, we're not on the edge of our seats because we know who the killer is immediately, so there is no surprise or any unexpected plot twists. Another positive credit is the fact that this film has is some terrific foreshadowing. When Donna says "This is it, some of us won't see each other again" I was simply giddy inside thinking that it was not only true figuratively but literally. In a surprise move, we know the killer and his motives very early in the film, so their isn't a whole lot to the character, but great acting by Richard Fenton made this character creepy and direct, which was true to the script. Casting directors Lindsey Hayes Kroeger and David Rapaport seem to love their television series, because that's all the actors consisted of from their previous roles. Kroeger and Rapaport have been part of the casting department of some great films, but as casting directors, neither have a very good streak, including "Vacancy" and "Daddy Day Care". This is a movie that shouldn't even be called a remake. The movie shares the name and the fact it is a thriller, but this new movie lacks a sense of mystery. And one last thing, when you had your senior prom, was it even in a hotel? That fact that it is only seemed to give the McCormick less locations to have to film at. I would only recommend this movie to those who, like Jamie Kennedy's character in Scream, love to point out the horror flaws of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good laugh if you weren't expecting a serious movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I haven't seen the original version, but I can tell you that it's probably better than the remake. The movie's PG-13 rating takes almost all of the thrill and suspense out of the film.The beginning of the movie starts off sudden, but afterwards there's a nice drought of action until the first prom killing. The PG13 rating makes the death scenes quite bland and boring. You won't see the victims actually getting attacked, but you'll see silhouettes and blood smears. That's about it.The characters in the movie make it seem like you're watching a movie of The Hills. The girls are the classic "dumb blonde" stereotypes while the men are the typical "hard jock" stereotype. Any angst there is between the characters is very dry and holds no real meaning to the overall movie.The plot is very predictable, I sat through the entire movie correctly guessing what was going to happen next and when something good was going to happen.All in all, this is a good movie if you're looking for some good laughs, but overall don't expect to be extremely happy with the final product. Personally I'd wait for the movie to come out on DVD. If you've seen any other slasher film, chances are you could guess every next move in this movie.</fullReview>

Also, the dialog was sometimes stupid, but the plot was good. It was really scary at parts and sad. I wish it was a little longer and explained more things better. Also Brittany Snow didn't seemed so sad when her friends and boyfriend died, her character should have cried more or have been more scared. It's called having a heart. Well anyways, I would recommend going to the theaters, it's much better at the big screens and it's not a huge waste of your money. So if you see it, it's not that bad!</fullReview>

But i have to say that i have some hope for the unrated cut. But please, if you are a teen, grow some grapes and see an actual r rated horror movie, i don't care if you have to sneak in, i snuck in to see avpr. Also, i don't know why that there was not even one scary scene in the whole thing.

		<shortDescription>Another Awful 2008 Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night (2008)NOTE TO READERS: This review is for the UNRATED version of "Prom Night" on DVD. I didn't see the PG-13 version, but I can't believe that this is much better.2008 didn't start that well for horror. One of the first movies released in theaters in 2008 was "One Missed Call", which was so horribly awful, it was funny. March's "Shutter" was even worse, because it was horribly awful, AND it wasn't unintentionally funny. And April's "Prom Night" concludes the trio of awful horror movies that are some of the worst of all time.So, there's a girl named Donna. Her entire family was murdered by a teacher who was obsessed with her. But, the teacher was caught, and locked up in a maximum security mental institution. FLASH FORWARD a few years. Donna is a high school senior, going to her prom. She and her friends go to the prom and (surprise, surprise) the teacher has escaped from the maximum security mental institution and is back to kill everyone that makes any kind of contact with Donna. First off, 99% of all remakes suck. Hollywood, please stop remaking movies and think of ORIGINAL ideas. Even though this can hardly be called a remake (the only things the same are the "killer at a prom" idea and the title), they still shouldn't make remakes. Just getting that out of the way quick-like.So, this is an awful, awful, awful, awful, awful movie. It uses EVERY cliché in the "Book of Slasher Movie Clichés". Every character makes the absolute stupidest decision you could make in a situation like this. There's nothing really right with this movie.You know how in most slashers, you don't know the killer's identity until near the end? And if you do know the killer's identity, sometimes you don't know WHY he's killing? Well, "Prom Night" gets this wrong right off the bat, because in the first 10 minutes, you've learned everything about the killer. His name, what he looks like, why he's killing. And instead of revealing plot elements cleverly through dialogue, all they do is have a cop talk about the killer for a few minutes, telling you everything you need to know about him. Yeah, eliminate any and all mystery from it right off the bat.Then, you're introduced to the annoying characters that you don't give a crap about. The closest thing to characterization is one girl whining about how her boyfriend is complaining about her going to college. Most of the dialogue is annoying, too, plus it adds absolutely nothing to the story. "So, my dress is kinda like a champagne color, but it's got diamonds on it, so, you know, it's kinda sexy." WE DON'T CARE! The first half hour of the show is like a freakin' episode of Gossip Girl. "Oh my god, she's such a hoe." "Oh my god, look at you. You're so hot!" "Oh my god, like, oh my god!" Stop talking about your damn dress. I don't care. No one in the audience cares. It makes you want them all to die so the damn movie can be over.So, after the first "Gossip Girl" act of the movie is over, we get to the actual killings. The director has no idea how to handle a killing. Of course, it's PG-13, so they can't show much blood. Even in the unrated version, they don't show anything gory at all. But along with the absence of gore, the director feels the need to make all the kill scenes "flashy" and "stylish", but fails miserably, just making them unwatchable. Here's how EVERY one of the deaths goes. Killer pulls out knife. Screen goes black for a second. Killer runs towards victim. Screen goes black for a second. Wide shot of the killer stabbing victim, with weird stabbing noise that sounds incredibly fake. Screen goes black for a second. Kill scene over. Plus, add random slow motion, fast motion and annoying camera angles, and you've basically got every kill in the movie.Also, the characters are so mind-numbingly stupid, it gets to the point where you think they deserve to die. In one part, the fire alarm gets pulled, and repeatedly the words "Warning. Leave the building at once," are said over the PA. But despite this, no one gives a crap. Everyone EVENTUALLY leaves the building. Except that Donna, after leaving the building, just goes "Oh, oops, I forgot my shawl," and walks up to her hotel room, despite the flashing lights and the "Please leave the building" warnings. Is anyone really that stupid? Seriously?In some parts, it's even nonsensical how stupid the situations are. It's either a stupid situation or a cliché that has been done many, many times before. About 6 different times, Donna opens a mirror to get something, and then closes a mirror, and suddenly, someone's behind her. Somehow, she doesn't actually notice the person going through the door, which is right by the mirror. Plus, it's about as scary as the "cat jumping on screen" gag that has been done so many times. Jump scares are overabundant here. Donna runs into lamps and jumps. Donna runs into her creepy aunt who appears out of nowhere many times for no reason and jumps. Donna trips over a table and jumps. Not only are jump scares not scary most of the time, when they're handled as badly as they are in this movie, they're just funny.Well, I'm going on and on, so I guess I'll just stop myself here. You get the point. "Prom Night" is awful. Here's the full rating:Overall Rating *** (3 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, was this lame, or what? "Prom Night," held the potential to be GOOD in the venue of slasher flicks. Frankly (and I do try to be frank), there is nothing new here. In the venues of remakes, sometimes that is a good thing as it lends familiarity to an old story, and basically gives your ardent fans an updated version of their comfortable old slippers.In this case, however, instead of atmosphere and skill, the audience is cheated by cheap thrills (loud noises that make you jump instead of earning the scare via masterful suspense); cardboard cut out characters with so little depth that there is NO WAY to develop any emotion at ALL towards them, be it sympathy or worry or even animosity; and no dialog, no effort whatsoever in the area of a screenplay and/or story.It's a shame, really. This could have been a GREAT slasher flick, but alas! It is pretty mediocre in every way. From the performances to the screenplay, this movie is flat, plastic ... flaccid.All in all? If you're a horror fan, don't bother with this. Wait for On Demand. Actually, if you're NOT a horror fan, there is no reason at ALL to see this. Actually, there's no reason at all to see this at any rate. Yes. That's it. All in all? Don't see this. Wait for it free on cable to decide if you want that DVD, or better yet, rent or buy the ORIGINAL Jamie Lee Curtis flick and watch a GOOD horror/slasher flick!It rates a 2.9/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so glad I won a free ticket to see this boring,lame movie which my friend thought was a comedy.I now think it is the worst attempt at a remake.The whole idea and plot is stupid.The acting atrocious.I kept shaking my head thinking how could it get any worse after each laughable scene that was painful to watch since I really liked the original with Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen.At least the killer of the original had a motive and reason to kill.Also his identity was hidden until the very end which made it fun to guess who it could have been.In this hatchet job and embarrassment to the original movie,you see the killer right away and there is no mystery and a not very believable reason for killing with absolutely no character development,just a very quick &amp; lame flashback scene. This is nothing more than just a movie of the week type of thriller with bad dialog.If it was written like the original prom night but updated for this generation , had an R rating and was directed by someone else it may have worked better. I didn't like anything about this film.I hated it and did not like even one of the characters. Every single character should have all been butchered viciously, especially the Brittany Snow character and the surviving black guy. If I had to pay for this piece of s**t,I would have demanded a refund! The only people that may like this juvenile film are 12-14 year old's only!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Three Out of Ten Stars*** Where does one begin to try to explain what a complete debacle of a disgrace this film is? Right off the bat, you know you're in trouble when a film production needs eight different producers to get off the ground. This means you have eight different people pulling in eight different creative directions, even if they delusion-ally believe they're all headed in the same direction; they're not. I don't need to re-numerate all the negative aspects of this film which have already been posted on this web site. What I will say, is what a terrible shame Sony dropped $20,000,000 on this waste of a film. Imagine the long line of creative, budding horror film makers that would've jumped at the chance to work with a mere $5,000,000; and in turn, undoubtedly, producing a unique and artistic horror film creation. But instead of adding to the artistic ingenuity of the horror genre, Sony drops this pile of crap in our laps. Thanks for nothing Sony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is as frightening and stale as left over cabbage. The acting isn't too bad... But the screenplay is terrible, clichéd, and predictable. I could literally call out what would happen before it happened. 30 minutes ahead of time.The killer was actually a fairly interesting (if rather pointless) character. The emphasis could have been more on him instead of Snow's character. Although, that still would not have been nearly enough to save this monstrosity of a motion picture.Its biggest problem, besides being predictable and not scary, was that the story line was completely uninteresting. I didn't give a rat's ass if these characters lived or died anyway. I guess that's what makes this a slasher film.There's absolutely nothing to this movie. A bunch of horny teens go dancing in a hotel on prom night. A guy with a knife comes along and kills some of them. End of story.This movie is awful and one of the worst movies I had the displeasure of seeing in theatres.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't the original suck bad enough?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to this movie some credit, it's hard to make a slasher film thats more boring than the 1980 Jamie Lee Curtis flick Prom Night and in 2008 it was actually accomplished with it's remake. That is of course if it were actually a remake! It had nothing to do with original at all. The original Prom Night begins with five children playing in an abandoned house and one of them dies as the result of a prank, and five years later on prom night a mysterious killer begins picking them off on Prom Night. It was pretty mediocre even for 1980. The coolest thing about it was the cover art which is the only thing these movies have in common. But cool posters only makes the movie more disappointing when it sucks. The remake begins with a cheerleader named Donna witnessing the murder of her parents by a psychotic teacher who is in love with her, Just like in the original. I'm not dropping a spoiler here this movie gives you all the information you need in the first ten minutes.One year later he escapes from a mental institution (because that's where all teen stalking double murderers are put. This cliché only works if the killer is psychologically interesting and the killer in the movie is anything but that, Charles Manson isn't even in a mental institution and he's beyond batsh*t. So after his escape he stalks Donna and her friends at the prom. The only other thing this movie has in common with it's original In the original you don't find out who the killer is until the end which is a key essential to making a slasher movie. Don't you know the rules? there are certain rules one must abide by in order to make a successful slasher #1 the killer's identity is a secret until the end. This guy doesn't does even wear a mask or so say anything cool. The same thing was done in Slumber Party Massacre but they got away because was wielding a giant drill. This Teacher guy in Prom Night uses a knife that is so small it doesn't even make his bleed. Which leads me to rule #2 which was also broken by Nelson McCormick on this movie. BLOOD! There is almost no blood in this movie. One horizontal splat on the wall just to be artsy. Along with it's lack of DNA it also has no T&amp;A a minor sin really but after making it's demographic watch this whiny boring blond whine about how screwed up she is, and try to have fun with you boring football player boyfriend, while the killer stands around in hotel closet. Showing Lisa's amazing cleavage in that blue Prom dress without having her whip'em out once before she dies her boring, bloodless,off screen death. that's just mean. and the Lisa character she more attractive and has a little personality. who is played by Dana Davis is the one the killer should be stalking. Donna is so bland. Her Banality is unmeasurable, She's only factory setting attractive, Her personality sucks. What makes her worth this killer's effort. If she was like Thora Birch with the Personality like Juno McGough I'd buy it. but even this killer's taste in women is lame. A Prom Night remake should have been about Mary Lou the villain of the original Prom Night Franchise. anyway yeah this movie sucks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie ultimately SUCKS!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night is about a girl named Brittany Snow who is being chased by a phys co killer (AKA, her former teacher who is in love with her) trying to kill her at her prom night. And in the process, he just happens to kill he family, and her friends, and even her enemies!!!Now, I think the world is tired of PG-13 'horror' movies that aren't even close to scary. And don't get me started on all the stupid (girly-girly) talk. (Oh My Gosh! I am, like, SO tired of hearing Oh, My Gosh!!!!) And come on, what is with all the relationships and the crying and the gossip and the non-violent killing! Oh please!!! I see almost all those things almost everyday, and I really DON'T want to see it in movies!!! Besides, Hollywood NEEDS to get creative and quit remaking every foreign country's movie that they can get their hands on.What can I say about this movie that isn't already obvious? It's a wanna-be horror movie that forgot the horror. You can laugh 'so much more than scream in horror ' And if that's the case , then this movie needs all the comical help it can get because I thought I had invented the stalest joke ever, but this movie proved me SO wrong. It was good for nothing- wait, scratch that, - it's the perfect put-me-to-sleep movie. And you still won't be able to sleep because it's that boring.Okay, so what have we leaned? First, this movie is SO predictable and has no suspense or fear. Secondly, it's flat out boring. No horror, or comedy, and too much 'girly-talk', and not enough blood for a horror (show me the blood!) And third and most importantly, don't see it unless you like wasting money. Go see, Barney's Halloween's Special and you'll be more interested. So go, listen to me, and don't, waste your time for what it's worth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just wanted to say first of all, that I'm a big horror movie buff. From blockbuster to low budget, I've seen some pretty bad flicks. Now, just to start off, the opening of this movie was cheesy. But, to know who the damn killer is the whole time??? Where's the suspense? There isn't even a good scare in this thing. For a prom that's taking place in a huge hotel, the murderer walks around looking terribly suspicious, hiding behind doors, hiding behind pillars, and other furniture. Don't even let me start on the murder scenes.......all I have to say is, if I could think of a word that meant lamer than lame, I'd have it written already. Don't even waste your time on it. Trust me. This movie sucked with a capital S and if there was a person in this world that enjoyed this movie, there is something completely wrong. I suggest for a good "bad" movie, try Black Sheep(not Chris Farley's). Nothing like killer sheep running around eating people. Better than this piece of crap.</fullReview>

The acting is terrible, the situations and scares are laughably unimaginative and predictable.I cannot seriously believe they thought this movie would scare people. But the movie accomplished its goal: To be a cash-cow for teenagers by releasing it during Prom Season.The dialog could have been written by a a fourth- grader.......I apologize maybe thats insulting the capabilities of a fourth grader. It seemed like they weren't even trying to build suspense at all . This movie is about as suspenseful as watching paint dry. Please do NOT waste your money on this poorly made remake it only gives them more of an initiative to make more movies as terrible as Prom Night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the trailer for Prom Night makes the movie look very scary. It's a classic slasher story about a psychopath who's obsessed with some girl and will kill anybody who gets in his way. But even though it looks scary, it falls extremely short of expectations.The plot seems really predictable and unoriginal that it feels like 5 year olds version of Haloween.Even though I don't watch slashers, I'm pretty sure the killer is supposed to hide his face with a mask or something, which makes this more unscary. The characters in this movie seem totally cliché and stereotypical and uninteresting. Obviously, the idea for this movie has been done a billion times, making it one of the most unoriginal ideas ever.But the biggest issue that this movie has is it tries to hard to obtain a PG-13 rating by hiding and the blood, sex, gore, and graphic terror violence it needs to give movie goers a good chill up their spine and a feeling of sickness in their stomachs. Whenever the slasher goes and kills someone, the movie is just stupid enough to cover up all of the stabbing, blood, and scary killings our slasher brings out.What you have hear is a silly, pointless, and ultimately unscary half-hour of your life that looks like a Disney-fied terror movie thats made for little kids only. If it was more bloody and gory, it might have givin people a slight jolt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A teacher is obsessed with his student, so much that he has killed her family so that she would have no one but him. After years in a mental institution, he escapes and comes back for her, on prom night.I never really thought the horror remakes were truly horrible until I watched this piece of crap. For some strange reason these PG-13 horror remakes are still being made, ruining the reputation of the originals. Damn you Prom Night, Black Christmas and When A Stranger Calls...why? WHY?!?!?!?!?!?! So what's wrong with this film? Well, let's get out the list.For one, it's not thrilling, chilling, scary, intense, jumpy, gory, fun, interesting, funny...so on and so on. The execution of this film is pathetic and weak. It's not even a well made crappy horror flick, at least When A Stranger Calls can say that. This isn't even really a remake, it's a remake by name only. The film is so predictable that it makes the ending to films like Titanic or Passion Of The Christ surprising.Slasher horror films always have certain clichés to them, meaning they are full of violence, sex and gore. This film had none of that. That PG-13 rating cripples it so much that I did not even get any enjoyment out of the deaths of these horribly acted characters. That's right, the acting is bad too, surprised? The characters are horribly written, I had no attachment to any of them. I didn't even hate them enough to want them to die. I simply did not care. At least in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre I hated the Franklin character so much that I was cheering when he was finally killed. Here, none of them do anything. I guess you can say that the horrible acting is attributed to the horrible script with horrible characters, but some blame has to be put on their shoulders. Don't even get me started on the dialogue.The killer? What ever happened to mystery? We know who it is from the beginning, we see him all the time so there is no suspense or edge of your seat entertainment. It's just the viewer sitting there wasting their time watching this guy stab people.So to say this movie sucks is an understatement. It's a pure and simple cash grab. I'm sure film fans know well enough to skip it, now I'm telling you horror fans. Save your money as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Standard slasher fare(..the kind "Scream" was poking fun at)has a psycho(Johnathon Schaech, effectively cast), a teacher so obsessed with his student Donna(Brittany Snow)that we see him murder her entire family in an attempt to have the teenager all to himself, escaping from his holding cell in a sanitarium &amp; invading the poor traumatized girl's prom night(..quite a lavish affair, held in a prestigious hotel)murdering her friends throughout the night. He has taken a master key from a maid he kills and sneaks into the room of Donna's pals, football star Ronnie(Collins Pennie)and girlfriend Lisa(Dana Davis), slicing and stabbing various victims who find themselves alone with him, attacking them from behind with his pocket knife. The film follows Detective Winn(Idris Elba)and his men as they canvas the hotel, trying quietly to handle the situation which will eventually spiral out of control. The climax will show the obvious eventual confrontation between the unemotional, remorseless homicidal maniac and his devoted goal, Donna at her home, in the bedroom.One might wonder why I'd give away the conclusion, but honestly this slasher follows the rules of the genre to the very letter, sore afraid of taking any interesting or original routes. Most of the stabbings(..all of them, actually)appear off-screen with the camera displaying the horrified expressions on victim's faces as they are getting the knife plunged into their stomachs..you also hear the sound of the knife as it drives into the victim repeatedly(..probably the sound-effects guy stabbing a melon). A major visual stamp for the movie shows the killer unfolding his pocket knife right before he sticks into his victims. We do get two scenes where he slices the throats of victims with blood either squirting or splattering, but the actual contact of metal to flesh is cleverly disguised with the camera appropriately placed. The film silhouettes the killer and he often springs from the dark like Michael Myers, such as a hotel closet(..this technique is used multiple times by the director)as victims open the door not knowing what awaited them. There are a lot of scenes where folks pop up scaring the daylights out of Donna..the kind of jump-scare technique(..with cued jump music)that grows tiresome really fast. While I though Schaech was appropriately creepy, he's merely a walking menace of the Michael Myers variety, a robot killing anyone in his path. The way the film produces the first confrontation between the killer and Donna in the hotel is rather contrived. And, the killer's escape from the hotel is rather preposterous. But, the screenplay of a slasher is supposed to have that final sequence where the killer and his muse finally meet and a score is settled, and this movie's is really an uninspired, "seen-it-all-before" kind of experience. What's sad is this is probably superior to the original(..which, to be honest, isn't similar to in any way). The film is professionally made, well produced, but an empty hollow shell of a slasher film, devoid of anything remarkable or satisfying. In other words, it's just right for the teen target audience it's meant for. How the killer is able to move about bodies, keeping everything quiet, with no blood getting on his clothes as he thrusts his blade into torsos repeatedly, is anybody's guess.</fullReview>

Brittney Snow played her part well for the main role, but it's not really the acting that Im upset about. It's the story line. No plot,no interesting dialogue, and no thrill. Maybe once or twice something popped out, but it was somehow expected. The original movie is scarier, it has a good plot, and the dialogue was little more interesting.

		<fullReview>"See... pretty, dumb kids killed!" That's the whole plot synopsis. You don't even have to worry that there's too much plot in this one. Various prom attendees find reasons to go do things alone, and a killer reliably stalks and kills them. It features, rock-bottom, nonsensical scripting. In the 15 minutes before the prom king and queen are announced, two eager noms head up to their rooms to fool around. ???I've seen some lazy horror movies before, but this one takes the cake. Everything is perfunctory, lazy and limp. It uses the clichéd medicine-chest mirror scare not just once, but twice. (Thank you, Fatal Attraction) Startle scares, Yep we got em by the pound. The movie can spare about ten seconds of film after the killer is shot to jump to the credits. The movie goes to some length to incorporate a black couple as the white protagonists friends, and then the director, the script and the white couple treat them like garbage. This is the kind of movie you'd make when you've given up competing on every aspect, except style. The prom looks like it has the budget of a decent awards show. If you are in your teens and so sheltered that you don't know your primary colors or your alphabet, this may be for you.</fullReview>

Possibly its good points lie in its soundtrack and occasional humour, ideally the film is a date movie for anyone under 20. The main character is as plastic as Barbie and you won't want to see this film unless you could sit through Clueless. The plot itself has some gaping wholes, and some BAD cinematography including some very eighties stuttering slash scenes. As is any teen slasher there is a creepy looking bad guy, except in Prom Night, you might be offended as he isn't actually that bad, adding more to conclusion that if you haven't got that blonde cheerleader mind set this film will be tough to envisage seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake of prom night seemed like a great way to fix the disco era music video feel and style while still keeping the suspenseful cult horror atmosphere for a new generation in love with old school movie. Instead it was a remake in name only about a girl named Donna being stalked by her obsessed teacher who will do anything to have her.While it takes the supposed suspect in the original as the villain he's neither freaky, memorable or poses a danger to his beloved. Instead it takes all the clichés you come to expect and hams it into a bland colorful coming of age teen movie. The rating prevented any bloody carnage, sex scenes or drug used the original never shied away from squandering any chance for a successful remake.None of the actors, besides Brittany Snow, offered any worth wild performances and are written so poorly you stop caring if they live or die. Donna is the only one capable of emotion, has a great personality and I felt the fear and horror she went through making her survival a treat. The only praise besides that is the opening family massacre which set the mood wonderfully and if it followed that throughout it would've been on the same level as scream.</fullReview>

Its a fun time so watch it, don't let the negative reviews fool you, just know thats its a thriller and not a slasher flick and you'll be fine, promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that great of a horror remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom night the remake just isn't that great of a movie. The acting is pretty wooden and phoned in. The writing and script is run of the mill and horribly cliché. There were some entertaining moments, some of the kills were kinda thrilling and some of the action/running sequences were fun and had a little adrenaline. But the overall plot was just so cliché and been there done that that it was kinda hard to overlook. Brittany snow (John Tucker must die) was enjoyable as the lead, and Kellan Lutz (Twilight) is alright I suppose, the rest of the cast are just cardboard cut out characters that fall flat. The violence wasn't too graphic or gory, it was PG-13 level goriness, which was good, I thought an R rating would've been too much considering teens are the target audience for this remake. 4/10 for the 2008 remake of prom night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can honestly say that I actually really enjoyed watching this movie. I honestly don't care that this movie was 100% full of clichés but I actually like movies that are like that. Yeah it may not be good, but its at least very enjoyable, well to me at least. its a movie, like the remake of Black Christmas, thats usually watched for more entertainment than actually being watched intently and carefully for a storyline or whatever. Once again, its a movie that I actually really liked, and i can say there were some few times that I actually saw some pretty good acting and ideas but were just executed terribly. I'd say its decent, not amazing, but not horrible in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Horror Film But Something Much More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gifted director Nelson McCormick has simply done an inspired job of bringing J.S. Cordone's brilliant screenplay to the screen. The shocks and thrills come fast and furiously from the very opening scene to the shattering climax. However, it is the sensitively observed portrait of a traumatized young girl going through a profound life transition that makes this motion picture so much more than a horror film. The film has its share of blood and gore but it never diminishes the development of the central character. A superb performance by Brittany Snow brings depth and humanity to her role of Donna Keppel and it is a deeply moving portrayal. Certainly a unique genre film as it departs from the expected and will surprise audiences in many ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) returns home to find her obsessed former teacher Richard Fenton killing her family. He's put away in prison but she still has nightmares about him despite treatment from Dr. Crowe. Three years later, she's going to senior prom with boyfriend Bobby, best friends Lisa Hines and Claire. Then Detective Winn (Idris Elba) is told that Fenton had escaped from prison. He contacts Donna's new guardians Aunt Karen and Uncle Jack. Winn tries to find Donna but Fenton is already at the prom.It's a lot of unscary jump scares. Everything is predictable. It is all paint-by-numbers horror. The kills are nothing special. It's not especially bloody. The killer isn't a mystery. The cops are really incompetent. It shouldn't be that hard to find a girl. Even in a world without cell phones, they could call the front desk. When they find the dead body, they should be rushing around. I know they don't want a panic but there's a killer on the loose. It's also not good for the tension of the movie. It just feels lifeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie by myself and though my friends had said it want scary and was boring, I however thought the movie was good! The teacher DEFINITELY freaked me out every tine he was gonna kill somebody. He was very creepy and, dare I say, creepy and crazy! Donna and everyone else were innocent victims in the whole ordeal and I was actually shocked every time he killed someone. I was especially shocked when he killed the boys but I understand, in the teachers twisted mind, that ANYONE in the way between him and Donna would have to go. I can't believe people said that some people said the movie was not scary because I was almost scared when, at the beginning of the movie, when Donna remembers finding her ENTIRE family dead because of the teacher, I was almost scared and creeped out SOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad!! When one of the detectives is detectives about Donna's case with her past teacher and her family, it's scary HOW infatuated he was with Donna and what lengths he would go to to be with her!! You would think that he would have somewhat of a mind to understand what a restraining order is and how to live by the rules but NO!!! Keeps going, gets locked behind bars, sent away to the looney bin; hopefully that would say something like: "hey, I might be crazy but I can fix it if I work at it." but, he doesn't and gets the punishment he deserves. Anyway, the movie was good, scary, shocking, and having me wonder if my teachers in high school ever had a crush or infatuation with me..........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Friday the 13th in a grand hotel, but not as good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...that's the best way to describe 2008's "Prom Night," which isn't a remake of the 1980 film. Brittany Snow plays the protagonist hounded by an ex-teacher who's psycho-obsessed with her. He escapes from prison and goes on a killing spree at the grand hotel where the prom is held. Jessica Stroup and Scott Porter are on hand as friends of the protagonist.Being a PG-13 film there's not much gore, but I could care less because I'm more concerned with how interesting the story &amp; characters are and not how much blood &amp; guts are shown. While this is a well-done production -- costing $20 million -- the story &amp; characters are only mildly interesting. The film never rises above mediocre to become something great or even good, but at least it's decent mediocre. For comparison, every single Friday the 13th film is more entertaining. Despite this, "Prom Night" was a minor hit at the box office, pulling in well over twice it's expense in the USA alone. Go figure.Practically the entire movie takes place in a grand hotel, shot at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. The flyover views of the spectacular bridge were shot in Newport, Oregon. The film runs 89 minutes.GRADE: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloodless, Unscary Slasher Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night is a remake of the 1980 Canadian slasher pic by the writing/directing team of J.S. Cardone and Nelson McCormick who's contribution to the world of horror prior to this film were minimal...and it shows. Three years after the murder of her family at the hands of an obsessed teacher, an unstable girl readies herself for the night of the prom unaware that the killer has escaped and is on the hunt again. This is a relatively bloodless movie which will undoubtedly disappoint the lowly gorehounds who usually appreciate this sort of thing and serious horror fans will find it devoid of scares. Being that the killers' identity is given away from the beginning there's no mystery except to wonder why anyone bothered making Prom Night.</fullReview>

The acting is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and poorly planned, the editing is poor, there is no continuity and the worst aspect? The killer isn't the least bit intimidating or scary. The kills are exactly the same, it's basic level horror tactics with no direction or authenticity, even for a remake this is horrible. Idris Elba is a superb actor (See Luther) but his American accent is horrendous (He's British) and completely undermines his power and influence as the leading detective. Honestly, I wasted 90 minutes watching this film, I hope you don't do the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Prom Night was a Canadian slasher flick starring Jamie Lee Curtis. It had amazing, fast-paced disco music by composer Paul Zaza, an original plot, great acting and a creepy cast of possible suspects.This version of Prom Night has just piggybacked off the classic original. It has very little in terms of originality, boring and unmemorable modern soundtrack, bad acting and a predictable killer. People will probably disagree with me but remakes are never better than the classics. I'm not some out-of-date old man, I'm eighteen, but I still love the classic 80's slashers the best.If you have any sense left, stick with the original Prom Night, or at least watch the other three in the series, they're much better than this load of garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This watered-down, PG-13 "horror" film is so tame it could almost be shown in Sunday school, especially given how chaste the main couple is. I referred to it as a "slasher" film in my Summary, but that's misleading as no actual violence occurs on screen. Nor any sex or nudity, the other staples of the genre. What we mostly get is a lot of dumb, clichéd teen dialogue about how much fun prom night is (unless a serial killer shows up, I guess). In recent years, Hollywood has started releasing R-Rated horror films again after a brief spate of PG-13 drivel that wouldn't scare a five-year-old. Producers thought the PG-13 rating would bring in more money, but the fact that junk like Prom Night didn't bring in the big bucks as expected apparently led them to change course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's Laugh About Prom Night, Shall We?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2008 version of Prom Night sucked wind. I just don't think that the killer is 'creepy' enough - let's face it, Rob Zombie did a better job with his re-make of Halloween; a MUCH better job.Kudos to Rob Zombie. Rob's take on Halloween was brilliant in really depicting what happened to Michael Myers. He seemed possessed by a demon or even suffering from a particular psychosis that gives him the compulsion to murder, much in the vein of say Dahmer but... not really. Zombie paid homage to Carpenter's original character by incorporating the back story as believable and not a complete retelling marketed with a name that many of us remember as a rather creepy movie from 1980. Despite having what one might consider "Cormanesque" qualities, Carpenter's direction and moody music and shots make for a much more suspenseful thrill-err...where was I?Oh yes, that stink burger Prom Night:Also, the acting is rather wooden. While it is commendable to have a racially diverse group of teens acting pretty much the way the rest of the country interprets the quintessential "Valley Girl" persona, the pretty people are just so *blah* that we don't really care if they get stabbed by a stupid little hunting knife. Speaking of which, why hasn't this escaped insane freak stuck on a mask to at least make an attempt to disguise himself? Is he nuts? YES he is. He thinks a shave and haircut will disfigure him enough that none of the people anywhere near this girl in this really weird hotel/disco setting with no group sex scenes that are all the rage (or so I have heard - Jedi do not form romantic attachments - to engage in physical sexual intimacy can create a new Luke Skywalker and there is NO WAY JediMasterCheryl is going there with those crazy kids... uh uh) ...What does all this have to do with Prom Night? Nothing.Anyway, so many of these stupid people are killed by this retractable Bowie knife (do they really MAKE those things? Are they hard to acquire when one has just escaped from the prison for the mentally insane? Did this insane freak walk into a town and hit up the local feed store for a large pocket knife with his savings from his prison drawings selling on e-bay or what?) Don't they realise the escaped mental patient needs to have a place to stalk the kids that is set in like THE WOODS ? Isn't sort of important that he can work in secret with big weapons like huge butcher knives, axes, pitchforks and even chainsaws. Friday the 13th would not have worked as well or been nearly as spooky to us if it had been set in a day spa.Let's face it, those of us old enough to remember seeing Friday the 13th in 3-D at a drive in when it first played know what cheese-ball effects are, and yet even that element of fright (which was cheesy back then, we admit it) can't be equalled by a turkey like "Prom Night."What effects are in "Prom Night" you might ask? I have seen some pretty good throat slashing in films before "PN" and this kind of killing reminds me a lot more of a deranged deer hunter. Why is he fixated on this girl? It isn't as if she is being played by Courtney Love or Lindsay Lohan (skanks for sure) whom many of us would pay to watch get stalked and killed. Nope this is just some so-so valley girl who does absolutely nothing remarkable except turn down cheer-leading squad for some reason we have no knowledge of. I mean we get absolutely no real clues as to why he fixated on her and killed her whole family. So then we don't care. And we don't care in a, "well this is around the 586th time I have popped "Holy Grail" in the player, and hey presto after watching it so many times because it's funny I can do other stuff while listening to it in the background. So when it catches my attention I remember the exact look on John Cleese face when he rescues Terry Jones.I was expecting a lady, too.You see our innate physical human being intuition tells us when things are funny so we watch them to see the great acting and expressions that are part of the overall performance. Yet with "PN" even though it is the first time I was watching this cow-plop of a film when I was distracted by something else I already knew happened based on the tense score and heavy breathing alone. None of the actual deaths were scary or elicited any response other than 'so what' from me. Been there, done that and by much better uses of celluloid than this one.So to conclude....This film was frightful; the title should have been "Prom Sh..eye..te." I highly recommend to you that have not yet sat through this piece of drivel to avoid it like the plague. Review old shows like "I Love the 80's" or "Survivor"'s first season where the gay tax evasion fraud guy won instead of watching this movie - honestly, that is how bad it really is. Watching Hayden Christensen act is better than this. (I can't believe I actually just said those words in that order and meant them. Oh goodness, that is yet another sign of the approaching apocalypse my friends,...)</fullReview>

I think this movie is okay and I wouldn't rate it a one. Her acting can be a little horrible at times but I find the movie like any other. Johnathon plays a very well serial killer and can look intimidating. Unfortunately the kills are very basic and very boring. It is nothing new and everyone basically gets killed in the same manner. If I could change something about this movie it would mostly be the killings. Since it is pg-13, you hardly see him doing the damage, just the aftermath.

		<fullReview>Another crappy remake/reworking of an '80s horror movie. It's not like the original Prom Night is sacred or anything and it certainly could be improved upon. It was, for the most part, a routine slasher (with decidedly little gore). Yet this piece of crap remake somehow manages to be ten times worse and less original than that movie. Basically it's just another boring 21st century retread of a subgenre that had reached its peak long before this came out. There's the obligatory music video gloss and more pretty young people than you would ever want to see in one place at a time. There isn't a single scare to be had and it's all so tired and predictable, it's pathetic. Sadly, there's also some slumming going on from Ming-Na Wen and Idris Elba. Gotta pay the bills, I guess. My score is low but generous. Avoid this trash.</fullReview>

I guess there's not as much gore as I'd expect it but the little amount of gore that they had in this movie was very well done and it looked pretty real unlike some other horror movies these days that go way over the top with orange and pink blood. I love horror movies myself but I'm not picky if there's a little extra something in a horror movie. For instance, I think the problem with this movie is that it is claimed to be a horror movie but actually there are the same amount of drama scenes and action scenes. Not to mention that there seemed to be a lot more suspense scenes than horror scenes. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie and I really think that the acting on the actors starring in this movie was well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cookie-cutter approach, and the lack of creativity or thrills sink this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donna Keppell (Brittany Snow) comes home one night, and witnesses her parents being murdered by a psychopath obsessed with Donna named Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) The killer is locked up, and Donna gets over it, thanks to the help of her friends. Prom Night is supposed to be the night Donna will never forget. Sadly for Donna, Richard Fenton escapes, and begins to terrorize Donna &amp; her friends on Prom Night. I love slasher's. I'm not that persnickety about them at all, but let's face it. The original was OK at best, but it was at least tolerable. This isn't really a remake. I did admire that it does its own thing, but it couldn't be any more mundane if it tried. It has a slick set-up. The opening is quite riveting, and I thought I might be in for a pleasant surprise. The obsession storyline was basic and effective. There was nothing flashy about it, and that was fine with me. Sadly, I couldn't turn out to be more wrong about being pleasantly surprised. This lacks suspense, creativity, scares, or thrills of any kind. It throws in everything I hate about slasher movies these days with plot holes that baffled me. Why are all of the cops such bumbling idiots? How did it take them that long to think that maybe the killer would attempt to disguise himself? The characters, except for Brittany Snow are all disposable, and I didn't give a damn about any of them. They are so vague and thinly written, it's impossible to care about their fates. They're so interchangeable it's not even funny. Brittany Snow is the movie's lone saving grace. Her performance is so strong that it makes you wonder what she's doing in this film in the first place. She's beautiful, convincing, sympathetic, and more importantly, likable. I did care about what was going to happen to her, and I give all the credit to Snow. Good stuff, woman! Why didn't Rob Zombie cast her as Laurie Strode in Halloween? She would've been ideal! Scott Porter has to be one of the blandest jocks I've ever seen in my life. This kid couldn't conjure up a personality if his life depended on it. He had no chemistry with Snow, either. Idris Elba is fine as the detective, but did they have to write his character to be that stupid? Schaech is decent as the killer, but we don't know why he's so obsessed. Kellan Lutz has an insignificant role for the women that go nuts over him. Linden Ashby plays Snow's uncle. That's noteworthy for me, because he's Johnny, freaking Cage! How cool would it be to have Ashby for an uncle? The blood is drier than a popcorn fart. Not only are some of the deaths pointless, but bloodless as well. We get an average slit throat, stabbings, and that's about it. This should also be nominated for having one of the most anti-climatic endings I've ever seen. Final Thoughts: The IMDb rating is spot on, if you like your horror movies, teeny bopperish, with no imagination what so ever, this one's for you. Brittany Snow deserved better than this crap. I'd revisit my prom with Brittany Snow any day!3.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A teen is chased by a serial killer during a school prom night.This film is lacking in many different ways but the main thing is the bad plot. The entire plot can be explained in one sentence and here it is: Donna goes to prom where her friends get killed. There is no originality to the story and the entire thing can be guessed in the first 5 minutes. The acting was horrible and this was probably the scariest part of this movie besides the budget. I was rooting for the killer just to not hear them talk anymore. Some of these actors played better corpses than their roles!!! How does a killer go through a whole movie without getting a drop of blood on himself after killing multiple people with a knife? Prom Night. What is the worst way to spend $20,000,000? You make a movie called Prom Night.I normally try not to review bad films but I have to make this exception. The only horror of this film was that it was made and that it cost $20,000,000. Everything from the direction to the acting was horrid. Do yourself a favor and stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Attempt at Teen Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In these journal pages I'm going to practice writing personal critiques on the numerous horror movies I watch in hopes to find tune my writing skills.Prom Night (2008)I have never seen the original Prom Night (1980 with Jamie Lee Curtis) but I will be watching it after I finish with this newer version.I have nothing against remakes; especially in the horror genre because special effects have improved in the last 30 years. However, there is a sentimentality behind a lot of horror movie, for loyal fans, and there is a resentment towards those that will tread on those memories. I have to admit that I would be a hard critic if they should remake some of my personal favorites. Nonetheless, I have no personal attachment to this film so I will go forward with my review.In this remake the concept is fairly simple: Obsessed teacher &amp; sweet innocent student Donna; who's family is brutally murdered in his obsession to be with the girl. History is established quickly thus leaving the story line, seemingly, on a predictable story line.Three years later, Donna, who has decided to stop taking her medication, is just as full of life as she was before her family died. Tonight is Prom Night and everything is going to be magical. However, the police learn that the crazed teacher escaped from the high security mental institution and happily unaware Donna goes to the Prom with all of her friends.Thus the killing begins with little attempts to build any character development. Which is fine if all you want is for the bodies to stop dropping.At 1 hour &amp; 2 minutes the death toll is only at five; which is fairly amazing with the killers perchance to stab anything in his way. So far the acting has not made me want to pull my hair out, the element of teen drama is very superficially not important, and really it just was an attempt to give the watcher a false connection to these characters. But do we really care? This movie is not terrible but simply a terrible attempt at horror. There are no thrills, suspense or moments of intense dread. Anyone who watches will be able to predict what will happen in each scene but then again it can be fun to just zone out to some cheese horror.Questions I ask Myself While I Watched this Movie:1. A psycho killer, who is obsessed, with a teenage girl escapes and it doesn't even make it to the news?2. As a police officer, even with Idris Elba being the lead detective, why do the police come off as bumbling idiots?3. Why do police while on surveillance always have their windows down and doors unlocked? 4. Who can sleep knowing that?: A. The Killer of your family has escaped B. Has Killed your friends C. And is on his way to get you? And let me add to this by saying why is everyone in separate rooms? I'm sorry I think that it is perfectly okay for everyone to be staying in a well lit room; together with police and guns. But then again maybe I just don't have the balls for being a character in these movies?Scare Level: Not a single jump on my part or surprises.Creativity: Very Low Acting: I did not find that the actors had to work hard in this movie but they delivered their lines without sounding like witless robots.Smartness of Characters: N/A (intelligence didn't really play a part in this clear cut movie) Violence: Lots of Stabbing Gore: For being a teen slasher the blood level is very minimal in which there are not huge pools of blood, missing body parts, or red splashed everywhere.Over All rating: Two Stars out of 5 for at least having decent actors.Spoilers: For those of you who like to play "Who is going to die first or next?" games here is the order of deaths (including non-major characters)The Night of the Prom: 1. Maria who is a House Keeper of the Hotel2. Clare (who is devastated that her boyfriend is such an asshole and has horrible cramps;which, pretty much set her up as the 1st of the friends to die.)3. Clare's boyfriend Michael (Are we surprised yet?)4. A random hotel employee who completely ignores his "fight or flight" senses.No boobies have been shown so far which makes me a little bit surprised at this teen slasher movie. However, why does a girl who is eager to become Prom Queen decide to go "make-out" just before they are about to announce who gets that amazing tiara? Which, thus leads us the next death:5. After a chase, where the killer seems to have a sixth sense of exactly where everyone is going to be or do; Poor Lisa dies and never receives her tiara.6. The Two Police Officers guarding the house (not sure in what order)7. Poor Sweet Bobby ... more therapy will be in order for DonnaAnd lastly, the KILLER.I think my counting is correct but if not have another shot on me.</fullReview>

Also when Lisa sees the killer i think its hard to believe that she wouldn't instantly recognize him he was a teacher at her high school number 1 and he'd killed her best friends family number 2 its just poor Ronnie regardless as to whether they knew of any danger let his girlfriend run off panicking she would have been alive if he would have got up and chased her anyway that rants over another thing i had a major issue with are Donna's aunt and uncle i mean i guy who was by all accounts normal until he became obsessed with the girl and murdered her family has escaped and has been on the loose three days (dont get me started on how late the local police found out ) so had time to get where the girl was and aunt and uncle still didn't think to tell her and bring her home because obviously prom is more important than the rest of your life NOT! It wasn't scary it was boring it was stupid not true to how people would react and the serial killer was unbelievably good at being undetected or is that just the police being crap ?all in all rubbish film !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally do not write a review but i had to after I saw this movie on TV last night. It made me angry when I saw that the makers of this movie wasted the opportunities that they have about making a film. As a young and amateur director, I always try not to be preconceived and watch the movies to the end. But I should say that if you have this opportunities(budget, actors and etc.), you have to be more conscious about what are you doing instead of wasting them. I actually do not know why I gave a 2 out of 10 to this movie. Yes it may not be the worst movie ever, as I saw worse ones, but I feel that '2' is like a reward after what I saw. I tried to respect the crew's effort of making, directing and editing of the film. That's why I gave a 2. Otherwise, this movie has one of the most ridiculous plot ever, it is full with clichés that the audience are sick and tired to see in movies. Also, the acting are not good enough except Idris Elba(the black police officer). Honestly I could not stand it to the end. So if your time is valuable, you better stay away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnas senior prom is supposed to be the best night of her life, one of magic, beauty, and love. Surrounded by her best friends, she should be safe from the horrors of her past. But when the night turns from magic to murder there is only one man who could be responsible, the man she thought was gone forever. Now, Donna and her friends must find a way to escape the sadistic rampage of an obsessed killer, and survive their prom night....In the barrel of horror remakes, this has to be the most weak and pointless one of the lot of them.But for some reason, it's like a car crash, horrible, but you have to watch.Maybe it's the fact that the killer has taken his love of Forrest Gump too far, or the fact that this has less gore than the muppets, but there is something about the film.The performances are all underwhelming, Elba looks embarrassed and Schaech spends the film looking like Gump and lurking on one floor of the hotel.So the film goes like this, stalker in hotel, one of the party goes upstairs, gets killed, and so on.The conveyor belt of horror movies.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really did have high hopes for this movie because i thought the storyline was really good and fresh. A teacher who becomes so obsessed with a student that he murders her whole family so that they can be together and then he comes back three years later on her prom night and makes mayhem for the students.... that is really run and interesting.....but when i watched it i was severely disappointed. the death scenes were really badly shot and they cut off too quickly, the climax of the film was so very disappointing, the special effects were cheap and the acting was repulsive. Usually you can find at least one good thing about every movie but there is nothing good about this movie...even if there is nothing else on TV, don't watch this movie...you will regret it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Absolutely Nothing to Improve on Anything and Doesn't Even make for a Better Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of "Prom Night"???? What was the point. I never saw the point in them remaking the original because the underrated 80's slasher film itself was on a decent level and it wasn't anything special at all. Sure it brought another slasher to the table but still. It didn't need a remake because it's an untouchable classic like "Halloween" or "The Omen". It didn't need a remake because there was nothing to improve on at all! The remake is a totally different film and serves no purpose to the original at all. It sucks and it just sucks. People who love the original (not like me) will be gutted if they see it. The remake basically stars cheap actors and then there's Britney Snow. The remake's story is departed from the original as well.This girl's parents get killed by an overly obsessed teacher who wants to be with the girl dearly. He gets taken to prison and that's that. A few months (I don't know) how many what ever's later she is going to her senior prom with here boyfriend. The teacher manages to escape and he follows, stalks and kills his way through the Prom to get to her.I hated this film. The minute I got watching, the minute I wished I had turned it off. I mean why???? It didn't need a remake because the original was so good, just mentioning again it didn't need the remake because there is nothing to improve on. Remakes are purely done these days for money and not for improving on. Out of 100% most of them are OK but never improve on the original movie.This was just crazy. The CGI-effects were put to good use and serve no purpose. The actors are crappy and I was disappointed with Britney Snow's performance here. She did so well in "Hair Spray" but here, my gosh she was awful. The killer is not imitating nor is he scary. A guy in a baseball cap and a suit does not make for a scary killer. Many kill scenes are done the same and they are laughably boring. There was no suspense build up at all.Overall, the original was a decent/average film which was actually watchable. Here, it's definitely not the case. Here there is no improvement. They should have put so much more effort into this remake. When you do a remake, you are trying to improve on the original. That's what I would do if I chose to remake something (which in most cases I would never do that). Like the "The Fog" remake, it is a wasted shred of film, and deserves to be forgotten. It does absolutely nothing to improve on anything and doesn't even make for a better story! 0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing Prom Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Straightforward boring remake in the post-Halloween style about a group of friends during their prom night finding themselves on the run from a serial killer. There is no such thing as suspense or 3D characteristics, and it rehashes all of the genre clichés, which makes you feel that you've seen it all a dozen times before. People move around in corridors and rooms, where lights flicker, with the murderer lurking around in the shadows, and so there is suddenly a squeaky sound, and it's a big SOUND OF NOISE supposed to make you jump, but oh (!) it was nothing, but oh, wait, it was something after all, it was... the killer. Sadly the killer is one of the less effective I've seen in a horror film, mostly because you see his face all the time (a handsome face too), and he's a romantic at heart, and he uses a small, jagged knife that would look better on a cheeseboard table, and he wears a cap. When the killer and his chosen one battles throughout the latter parts of the film, they sound more like a married couple arguing. And the prom night dramatics are truly terrible, as we shuffle through kings and queens, slow dances, DJ music, partying and school nostalgia. This is bad American teenage horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review Prom Night 2008Title: Prom Night Director: Nelson McCormick Stars: Brittany Snow,Johnathon Schaech, Scott Porter &amp; Idris Elba Year: 2008 Running Time: 87 minutesPlot Summary: Donna Keppel's High School Prom turns into a terrifying game of cat and mouse when the obsessed Mr. Fenton (the psychopathic teacher who killed her family three years earlier) escapes from Prison and goes on the inevitable killing spree at the High School Dance?Thoughts: Another day another horror remake to add to the ever burgeoning list coming out of Hollywood at the moment. Unlike the 1980 original "Prom Night 08" forgoes the blood and gore and instead relies on a good looking cast and the occasional jump-scare to keep the viewer entertained.It's as though first-time director Nelson McCormick wanted to create something all together classier than a straight "Hack &amp; Slash" stalker flick and has tried to give his remake more of a "Thriller" feel. Unfortunately this means that the film falls between the two genres and as a result Prom Night 08 lacks any true originality or character of its own.As a straight out horror film it won't appeal to the "slasher" crowd as even though the film boasts it's fair share of deaths none of them are particularly gory or memorable and it won't appeal as a straight down the line thriller due to its lack of plot complexity and one dimensional characters?Brittany Snow's "The Plucky Heroine &amp; Idris Elba's "Jaded Detective" are just genre avatars with no defined character of their own, which is a pity as both Snow and Elba are talented actors. Prom Night isn't a total flop of a movie and works as an undemanding thriller but fans of the 1980 vintage can't help but be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It'll put you off a prom for life, and not in the way you might think so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't a fan of the original "Prom Night" so a remake would've seemed like the perfect opportunity to perfect all the things that sank the original down. But, comparing this tripe to the original, makes the original look like an absolute masterpiece.In fact, this "Prom Night" has absolutely nothing to do with the original, it's a name-only remake, which makes it even worse because it means the writers couldn't have even been bothered or original enough to come up with their own title! And the film really doesn't look as cinematic as the poster, it looks like a made for TV movie. It looks cheap, it sounds cheap and it is cheap (you probably could find it in the half price bin at "Poundland" but for Christ's sake don't buy it!) There are so many problems with this "Prom Night" that I seriously do not know where to begin. I usually start of with the positives but they're literally are none, apart from the main actress was the nicest thing to look at. "Prom Night" opens up to rock music (not looking good so far) and the poor prom girl sees her parents get murdered (we don't) and we fast forward a few months or years or whatever and she's living with her uncle and aunty and she's going off to the prom.Then we go over to the police department (yawn) and see that the prom girl's murderer has escaped from prison (remind you of anything? Several I should imagine) and really fancies her and so wants to go to the prom and eat her or whatever. Then we're introduced to the prom girl's (I don't know her name so I'm just going to call her prom girl) friend's and boyfriend who talk a load of chick flick crap so we get no characterisation at all, in fact if two of them weren't black I'd think that they all looked the same, because they all have the same personality. So we don't like any of them, which means that there's no suspense when they get stalked and slashed (there is none anyway, just to make that clear.) From here it's a complete overload of appaulling direction, really bad acting, sickening writing and some of the worst editing I have ever seen. In the end we get a film that looks like it should be part of a music video. When the most unmemorable killer of all time actually kills people, we don't see anything at all because the editing is so so bad. I don't think that we actually see one death which completely sucks every bit of fun out of a slasher.The writing is really disastrous. The writer has managed to create really uninteresting and unlikable characters as well as probably the worst killer ever ( he doesn't even have a cool mask), I mean the least they could've done would've been not to have shown his face throughout the film to at least create some tension! The writer also thinks it should appeal to 13 yr olds by putting in chick flick talk that horror fans aren't at all going to be interested in. The writer also thought it would've been to throw in absolutely every last cliché in the book, I bet he only wears a T-shirt because he's got so many tricks up his sleeve. I don't know who this writer was (probably the director) but don't ask him to write you a slasher film.The ending also seemed like a complete joke *SPOILERS* The police come in and kill the man and then it ends *END OF SPOILER* (I'd probably read it to save you time). It feels like a joke and thankfully most of it is funny (unintentionally of course) so it is quite fun to watch, just to slag it off completely. Overall, "Prom Night" is one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I've sat through some crap. It's a perfect example of how not to make a film. You have to see it to believe it. (But I wouldn't bother)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me the movie didn't have much horror to it. It was mostly the actor who was being scared.There is no hidden plot or mystery to this movie, what you see is what you get, but the actors were surprisingly good, and the movie was entertaining for what it's worth - which is saying a lot for a movie of this type. The production is good, and everything is done with good quality. Still, it's hard to believe that this movie cost $20M to make, but it did good at the box office, so it did cater well to its target audience.The movie is one of the best produced teenager based movie (I didn't say it's the best movie, teenage or otherwise - okay ?) I've seen, and I've enjoyed it because its integrity kept me watching 'till the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Training wheels sl*sh*r flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know how, when you're a kid, you want to ride a bike but two wheels on a full scale bike is too difficult because you fall off, so they bolt on two extra wheels to your back wheel so that you can't fall over? Training wheels? Well, someone had the bright idea that if you go from ordinary movies to full scale horror movies you might fall off, so it's a good idea to make a movie which is the equivalent of a bike with training wheels - all the things which go into horror movies are there, but in junior, non-scary versions. So, when someone gets stabbed - which happens fairly often - there's no blood or stab wounds. And there are lots of scary moments - but they aren't actually scary.This is a slasher movie for people who need it spelled sl*sh*r because they can't cope with the full spelling.Above everything, this movie is a movie of disappointments. You have a moment where boyfriend and girlfriend have an argument. He goes looking for her, not knowing she has been killed. Does he find her, giving us a moment which may have some emotional resonance? No, he gets killed too, without ever finding her.This movie is glossy, and the young people in it are attractive and try hard. But it is disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the plain laziest slasher films I've seen in a good while. As a "remake" it fails; the only idea carried across is that a killer is killing teens during their prom. Great, I thought, perhaps the chance for a more original storyline (I'm not generally a fan of remakes anyway). Unfortunately, no, this turns out to be just another lame, politically correct movie, a slasher that goes through absolutely all of the motions without ever once approaching anything halfway decent or unique. I truly hate the way these films exist and act like the same old storyline hasn't been done a hundred times already.This one suffers from a particularly inane script that features the killer lurking in a hotel suite for much of the running time, bumping off anyone who pays a visit. I mean, seriously? Could this particular story get any LESS suspenseful or interesting? A bland cast of interchangeable characters are the victims, but you couldn't care less about any of them. In fact, the only people I really registered were Idris Elba's detective (mainly because he's one of the few here who can actually act) and Uncle Jack, as played by Linden Ashby (MORTAL KOMBAT), a one-time martial arts star. Mix in a kid-friendly PG-13 rating that makes this an entirely bloodless affair and you have one big waste of time. About the only compliment you can give this is that it's better than the WHEN A STRANGER CALLS remake, but that really isn't saying much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So... there's a crazy killer on the loose after one teenage girl. Now, she's at the prom, we don't want to make her feel awkward around her friends by removing her from the prom! That would just be terrible for her. Instead, let's wait until three of her friends and two hotel staff have been killed before we do anything. And THEN when we finally remove her from the prom, let's bring her to her house, where the killer knows she lives rather than somewhere safe, like the police station or something, and then we'll put our most inept officers out front to watch for the killer, who kills people with a knife! Sadly, even though cops usually can kill with guns, knives always beat guns. Its like how paper covers rock, when in all reality that rock would rip right through that paper...

		<fullReview>I will be honest and say that I didn't think much of the original Jamie Lee Curtis version, but it is rated three out of five stars and liked by most people, this remake was rated one star, I was interested to see why. Basically Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) spent three years haunted by the memory of her deranged high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) murdering her family, having a nightmare almost all the time, but she may be getting over it at last. This comes just in time for her high school prom night (the same night her family was murdered), but she wants to remember all of it, so doesn't bother taking her calming pills. While she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples of friends to the Grand Hotel, killer Richard has escaped from the prison which he was never to be released from, and he obviously wants to get Donna. The police have found out about the psychopath's escape, and know that he will be going wherever Donna is, so they make their way to the prom, while Richard has mingled his way into the hotel and found a room near her's. Donna is obviously having fun with her friends, completely unaware of the killer being in the building, but she a few jumps from the fact that she is not calming herself. One by one, her friends and some of the hotel staff members fall victim to Richard's deadly blade, and Donna realises that he is there, and now she and everyone else is in danger. But everyone including her naively sticks around, and when it looks like the psycho is gone, he manages to get away unnoticed back to the home of Donna, but don't worry, he gets killed by the end. Also starring Jessica Stroup as Claire, Dana Davis as Lisa Hines, Collins Pennie as Ronnie Heflin, Kelly Blatz as Michael, James Ransone as Detective Nash, Brianne Davis as Crissy Lynn, Idris Elba as Detective Winn and Kellan Lutz as Rick Leland. This has a pretty different plot line to the original, which saw three friends accidentally kill someone, and that someone wants revenge, I could almost say that this version was an improvement, but I know that I wouldn't watch this or the other one again. This one is completely predictable most of the time, the characters, apart from the smart killer of course, and thick and easy victims, there are stupid fake jumps, it could have been bloodier and made itself different to the original, and it just wasn't very scary, a silly horror thriller remake. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this remake of "Prom Night", I had to wonder why the producers of this movie spent the money to get the rights to the old "Prom Night" movie. Yes, both movies take place on prom night, and both involve killers picking off teens, but when it comes to similarities THAT'S IT. Anyway, I thought this movie was even worse than the original. The characters are very thin, from the teenagers to the psycho killer. (By the way, they don't even TRY to hide the identity of the killer in this remake!) Gorehounds will be disappointed that the PG-13 rating prevents any serious bloodshed. Needless to say, there's also no gratuitous nudity and sex. (By the way, if you are thinking the unrated version on DVD has the missing blood and sexual content, it doesn't.) The only reason to watch this movie is if you're a depressed teen and want to see that there are people your age with shallower and emptier lives than yours.</fullReview>

Honestly the first 6 mins were good, and I thought, OK, maybe we have something here, but nah, we got nothing. The killer isn't even scary besides the fact that he looks like Charles Manson, now that is scary. Why does he have such a thing for Donna? Who knows. This movie was like part 2 of a movie, I kept thinking, did I miss part 1? Nobody was worth rooting for or even caring about. You just didn't care who got killed or who lived. I felt Lisa was the only one with any charisma, and she sucked eggs too. The guy playing the detective from that Ali Larter movie Obsessed was unreal and just STUPID! Why didn't he warn Donna about the killer as soon as he got to the prom? Why didn't he get on the microphone that the phony DJ guy had and announce to the crowd what was going on? Why would Donna go back up to the hotel room during a fire alarm? I know she wanted to get her mother's scarf, but still...is she willing to burn for it? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since Carrie turned her senior prom into a no-holds-barred free-for-all of revenge, mayhem and murder, we've been subjected to one bloodbath after another set at that annual rite of passage for pimply-faced teens. You might think that the remake of "Prom Night" could not possibly be more hackneyed and predictable than the 1980 original ? but you'd be wrong. In fact, there is not one original idea to be found in this film, neither in its storytelling nor in its filmmaking style.Brittany Snow plays the pretty blond teen whose entire family was massacred three years earlier by an obsessed teacher who, at the time, looked like only a slightly more maniacal version of Charlie Manson. Now, it's prom night and the killer, all cleaned-up and ready for action, has just escaped from prison, determined to finally claim Donna for his own (though whether he wants her alive or dead is never made entirely clear). Thus, as the revelers dance the night away in the ballroom below, an assortment of whiny, horny teenagers ? and various hotel staff ? meet their untimely ends in the poorly lit suites above.Nelson McCormick's directorial style consists entirely of obvious point-of-view shots, false scares and images of people popping up in mirrors at inconvenient (though entirely predictable) moments. The greatest waste is that of Scott Porter and Idris Elba who are both so good in their respective TV series ("Friday Night Lights" and "The Wire"), but who have been given absolutely nothing of interest or quality to work with here.</fullReview>

So, it comes on, serial killer, i was expecting it to be terrifying, but honestly, it was EXTREMELY predictable. All of the characters must've been mentally ill, like for one, SPOILER: When Claire, discovers who the murderer was, why not bring her boyfriend with her? No, she doesn't she goes alone, and gets killed. The ending was depressing in many ways too, it ended too abruptly. It wasn't a remotely happy ending, her boyfriend is dead, and there's a dead body lying in her room. You can watch it, i was kind of scared at some points, i mean i'm not an adult either, but still.

		<fullReview>I watched Prom Night on TV, nearly a year after it's theatrical release. I hadn't forgotten the horrible reviews it got, and after seeing it, I can say the film pretty much deserves them. First of all, the film fails miserably as a horror movie. It has a very basic plot, and doesn't make a good enough effort to add any chills or suspense. It's basically about a teenage girl whose parents were killed by a teacher who was obsessed with her. On the day of her prom, he escapes from prison and stalks and kills her friends and tries to get her back. While he does look like a freak in the flashbacks, he looks pretty inconspicuous and harmless when he goes to the girl's prom. Almost all the characters are typical teens you've long gotten used to seeing in films and television. Except for a black couple, and the protagonist's boyfriend, none of them show any sort of emotional depth. The killing scenes are ridiculously predictable, the one involving the black girl almost making me laugh. The only saving grace of the film is its flashy, good-looking set pieces, and the fact the it captures the prom atmosphere quite nicely. The only 'scares' come from bloodied corpses popping out of various places, and a few jarring nightmares that the girl has. Otherwise, the film is a major joke in the horror genre, and works as an amateur thriller, at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another remake of an old slasher movie and, as seems to be the case with every remake that comes along, the knives were out for this one. Not just in the killer's hands but in the fists of the fans, too. As it happens, all of the fears and concerns were entirely justified this time around.I've not seen the original movie, let me just say that right now, so this review is not a comparison to that film (something I usually try to avoid anyway) but that's quite a relief considering how much I have to moan about anyway.The plot is simple stalk 'n' slash stuff: obsessed guy yada yada young girl who survived previous attempt blah blah escape happens etc etc and things start to get a little murderific on the prom night the title refers to.Everything else is equally simple. In fact, it makes the simple plot seem like some Einsteinian theory of thriller construction. Let's dismiss the acting straight away. Brittany Snow has no personality I can detect whatsoever and is simply a talentless, mildly eye-pleasing, harmless teen. Does that sound too harsh? Okay, maybe it is but it's hard to separate the individual blame from the entire mess this movie actually is. Almost everyone else is equally bad and not worth even mentioning although Johnathon Schaech does okay in the role of the baddie and Idris Elba deserves so much better surrounding him for his decent enough portrayal of the standard, heroic detective figure.The script is banal and almost put me to sleep. Yeah, I really want my horror movies to dwell on the teen angst of imminent separation and the bittersweet experience that the ridiculous ceremony of prom night embodies (*please take that in the sarcastic tone it was conveyed in*). Characterisation? Look elsewhere. Any sign of wit or intelligence? Look elsewhere. Anything to entertain a viewer in between the boring, all-too-similar, bloodless kills? Not a chance.This is exactly the kind of glossy, teen-friendly, anaemic horror movie that fans select when finding the very worst of the genre and this particular movie is, in a packed field, one of the very worst. With absolutely no tension, no decent special effects and an unending deluge of dumb, irritating genre clichés (including the old "let's all go off one by one while nobody notices until much, much later" standard) this is less fun than having your bikini line trimmed by a blind man. The fact that it also shows a frustrating lack of any logic and that characters seem to be motivated by some urge to do the dumbest thing possible (hmmm, I left a shawl upstairs in my room so WILL HEAD UP IN AN ELEVATOR WHILE EVERYONE ELSE RESPONDS TO SOME IMPORTANT EVACUATION PROCEDURE) is simply icing on a cake I never want to taste ever again.See this if you like: Black Christmas (remake), Death Tunnel, Valentine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Box office data shows this time audience were more excited about this,like they wanted to love it.Britanny Snow plays a character has a past she wants to forget.She's enemy also can not escape the memories of her.A cop does not wants to stay inside this strange,but from one side forbidden contact.I have to say this was one of the better crime-thriller-horrors I've seen.Unfortunately the killers character was not enough mysterious for me.This movie was not really gory,and sexuality is also something where they should have done more in this film.Director had to walk by what producers say,and what parents guide-13 means for he's work.Nobody looks insider from the whole cast,including those worked only with the completed footage.Now I really want to see the original Prom Night horror movie,I want to see the differences,and also what,and why that would be too different like this was.This movie would be better with more little details,but this film was far,far better,than originally made for television movies,if it's directly does not wants to be more like a simple parents guide-13 crime -thriller-horror,with a strange bad guy,that is not a typical bad man,but has it's own bad,and skills that is hard,or interesting to accept him,but please don't be afraid to rent this,cause this is interesting in a good way.Give this movie a chance.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>not sure where i wanna start with this,, first off i didn't see the original so i guess i won't have any biases. what would have worked way better i think is showing how the teacher became obsessed with the student , i felt the movie should have gone back to that to open the movie. it seemed that they spent too much time on kids getting ready for the prom , than the actual killer at prom night. i don't think having "stars" in this one would have helped too much. the girls in the movie are sooo vain it's pathetic, trying to one up the other, and all of the jealously going on about how the other girl is showing too much up top, pure jealousy, one thing that i did like was the killer's eyes they are so stone cold, definitely the eyes of a killer, i thought that they could have worked more on the part where the killer at the beginning of the film kill's the girl's parents, more time on her identifying him,, it's seems to me that they introduced the cops in the movie way too late, would have been nice to see the escape of the killer from the asylum, overall i mean it's good a few good points, but it just seems to miss on a number of points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the Drive-In last year to see The Zohan and Prom Night. I didn't want to see Prom Night at all. I wanted to watch Indiana Jones 4 again but who listened to me? Nobody... and they really should've listened to me. Prom Night is a film of no thought and unbearable length. By unbearable length, I mean an hour and a half. If you call a film with that length unbearable, you know it's bad. Unlike films like Halloween and Drag me to Hell, this film has little thought. This film is one of the worst films i've ever seen. I only liked to things about it. I liked Brittany Snow from John Tucker must die and Hairspray. But she can't even try to hold the disastrous film together. The best part of Prom night is the credits, because you can walk out of the theater and try to forget this piece of sh*t ever happened. This film deserves a rightful place on the bottom one hundred. Though a 3.7 is reasonable enough, I still think it should be lower.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three years after witnessing the massacre of her family at the hands of an obsessed former teacher, high school senior Donna is gear up for prom. As she arrives at the extravagant ball (held in a hotel??), word comes that her would-be stalker has escaped from a mental institute. Slowly knocking off both hotel staff and high-schoolers, Mr. Fenton evades the police and makes it back to Donna's house for a final showdown. The good guys win.I see this movie on 'worst horror movie' lists all the time. I've seen MUCH worse dreck than this! By no means is Prom Night a great (or even good) slasher, but it's not as bad as I expected. If you saw previews or trailers for the movie, you knew what you were getting into: glossy, safe, CW horror. So why, then, would one be disappointed that that is exactly what the movie turned out to be? You can do MUCH better than Prom Night, but trust me, there are far worse horror movies out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the traumatic murder of her family, Donna Keppel(B. Snow) is just starting to rebuild her life. On the night of her senior prom her family's psychotic killer escapes from the mental institution to come and get what he wanted?Donna.Because this movie is PG-13 it was guaranteed no violence and no gore, in which could have made up for the terrible murder scenes. No suspense what-so-ever, all the murders follow the same murderer in the closet/behind you in the mirror style, which made every murder more and more annoying.The entire movie was basically a give away, because of the lack of twists and poorly written script. There was only really one twist that I didn't predict and basically the only twist in the entire script.Although the setting was beautiful it was very far-fetched for this film. It wasn't realistic what-so-ever.I can't complain about the camera work, the camera covered all angles of the prom and in the hotel rooms.The acting wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. Brittany Snow almost under reacted in some scenes, but I think overall she was delivered a decent performance. Jonathan Schaech registered extremely well as the chilling killer. But I wasn't impressed with the rest of the acting.So, overall this film delivered cheap scares, a terrible script, no plot, and decent acting.Overall 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, to be frank, this movie was just so clichéd as a slasher. If you have watched enough slashers, you could predict just about every death in this movie. Here's the quick plot summary...Girl comes home one night from the movies, she comes home to find brother and dad dead, then the psycho killer/stalker kills her mother right in front of her. Girl keeps having the nightmare, but deals with it since prom is coming up, killer SOMEHOW ESCAPES a maximum security mental hospital after 3 years of the killing, goes to the prom, kills and terrorizes almost all the friends, and pretty much that's it in a nutshell, your typical slasher flick. So please, if you had the much displeasure of watching this as I did, just go out and rent Halloween and watch a real Slasher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our next generation horror film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it's a raining day and I had nothing better to do so I did what I've been avoiding?watching this movie.Afterwards, I read the IMDb reviews and was somewhat shocked at all the negative reactions to the film because it really wasn't that bad. Most of the negative reviews were about the LACK of blood and gore in the movie and how that was a betrayal of the "genre." Apparently to some, the "slasher genre" requires a certain body count as well as a certain "yuk" factor in order to be valid.There's no question here that the film makers are trying to "break rules." I like that. Out the gate, I'd give them a 5 for trying to do something different and trying to change the genre. That's what "Scream" did. It changed the genre and reinvented it. First broken rule, as noted, this isn't a "blood and gore" flick. They've specifically minimized that which is apparent from the PG-13 rating as well as the opening scenes. Those wanting more should have walked out at the opening (or shut off the DVD). There's no sense waiting for something that isn't going happen.The second rule that's broken is that the killer doesn't invisibly sulk around the fringes of the film while committing his mayhem. In fact, the physical appearance of the killer is very much a part of the unfolding story. To further this, they've even cast a "hottie" as the killer; someone whose screen presence is more likely to delight rather than cause fear. This is a very significant deviation from the expected. Another rule that was broken was that bodies weren't discovered until later in the movie. This means that our "core characters" don't wander off in the face of danger. Of course, they still wander off to their fates, but not with the usual setups. Instead, they event some equally implausible setups to bring the killer and victims together.However, that's where the rule breaking ends and the regular genre rules come back into play. There's the usual "false jump" shots where something could happen but doesn't.The cops are only marginally competent and end up being simply more "cannon fodder" for the killer/stalker. The worst though is that there is no character development. The teens are all just "eye candy." There's nothing special about any of them and they are all interchangeable. You can go down the checklist of possible characteristics and find only the expected. There's the "going off to college" conflict(s). There's the "who is going to be Prom Queen? There's the horny teens going off to propose marriage/have sex. Even the main character has only one individual characteristic in that the killer tried to get to her before. But, beyond that, she's a vacuum. The stalker/killer also has no character. He "wants" Donna (our main character) but we don't really know why which would actually seem to be critical if want any kind of believability. As such, I don't think the film makers have advanced too far in challenging the genre. They've made some positive efforts but have fallen way short of making something different and unique. A few more steps in new directions could have given us our "next generation" for the genre. Instead, we'll have to wait for someone else to finish those steps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom Night '08 aka. Stab 4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning lights flashes and loud speakers echo throughout the building: "ALERT! PLEASE EXIT THE BUILDING! THIS IS AN EMERGENCY", as the main character of Prom Night has just decided to take the elevator upstairs to get a scarf or something. A police officer walks up to one of her friends to ask her where she is and they explain that she's gone up, and this is where it happens. I actually shudder. My body gives out a physical reaction to the low quality of what I am watching. I have seen some bad movies, but I guess that's a record.The original Prom Night wasn't much of a movie. Suppose Scream was the Halloween of the 90's, the original Prom Night was the I Know What You Did Last Summer of the 80's. One in the flood. But I never thought I'd say it but if you recall I Know What You Did Last Summer, it opens with the festivity of 4th of July and when I'm watching Prom Night, and think of the blandness of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Love-Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr and Ryan Phillipe - I realize that Kevin Williamson's mediocre b-movie is Classic Vintage Horror in comparison to Prom Night. In fact, if you are familiar with the Scream-movies, I'm sure you recall the spoof element of the "Stab" movie series. Honest to God, I thought I was watching Stab 4 when I saw Prom Night. And if you like actual classic vintage horror, well, heh, I guess I don't have to tell you that this is a bad movie.Had this been made for TV I wouldn't have lifted my eyebrows. On the other hand, I probably wouldn't have watched the movie. I'm an optimistic guy, and I want to say that I'm sure somebody out there would like this movie. But thinking about it, I realize I hope never to meet that person. But, well... Do you want to see Stab 4? Go for it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are Hollywood really running out of ideas, because all we seem to get these days are remakes after remakes. And now they're starting on the 80's slashers, they've already butchered scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis's horror's Halloween and The Fog and now they've turned they're attention to Prom Night, an almost forgotten but decent little slasher gem from the 80's.Although Prom Night was by no means a classic or pefect, but it was great and had moments of suspense, in which this version doesn't. There's absolutely no scares or tension in this remake, and to top it all off no gore equals crappy murder scenes. The killer was just rubbish he wasn't menacing or scary, just some guy with an ugly mug.The only good point in this version is Brittany Snow, who plays the main heroine,who does a pretty decent job given the crap material she's got to star in, only one hopes that this pile of rubbish doesn't ruin her career.All in all this movie isn't even mediorce at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a slasher flick with dumb cops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This type of film has been done numerous times. Here a psycho teacher became obsessed with of on his students, Donna. Once fired he showed up at her house and killed her family while she was hiding. It's several years later, and Donna is attending her high school prom. What she doesn't know is the killer has escaped and he's tracking her down.The cops learn of the escape that night, but decide not to call and warn her. Instead they let her go tot he prom and plan to stake out the hotel without her knowing. So stupid. So of course the killer shows up, gets his own hotel room, and follows Donna and her friends to the the room they are staying in. He kills a maid and gets a room key master card. Now all he has to do is wait in their room for her.One by one a couple of her friends go upstairs not to return. Eventually the police find the maid's body and know he is there. They evacuate the hotel, but of course don't tell anyone why, so Donna goes upstairs to get a scarf???? Next it is her meeting with the killer. The very ending of the film at Donna's house was little different than the usual, that part was OK. But every other part of the movie was so old.Also, this movie was pg 13 instead of R. So, while showing the actually stabbings, there is little blood ever shown. If you make a movie like this, it has go to be R.FINAL VERDICT: Not worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom Night (2008)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prom Night remake is really not a retelling of the 1980 horror classic. The story is completely different from that one or any of the sequels that followed. In this film, a young girl Donna (Brittany Snow) watched in horror as a man brutally killed her entire family. Much time has past and her prom night is fast approaching. She has been living with her aunt and uncle since the nightmarish incident. The man who killed her family is revealed as her school teacher (Richard Fenton) who developed a very unhealthy infatuation with her to the point he would kill to be with her. Of course as prom night hits, we see that the psychopath has escaped from the asylum he was in. The prom is held at a gorgeous hotel, and our four main teenage characters rent a room on the third floor. Of course the killer follows them to the hotel and up to their floor. A few murders take place throughout the middle part of the film. None of the murders are very gory, but there is a certain brutality with the way in which he kills them. There is one chase scene in the hotel, which I guess pays homage to the 1980 film where Wendy gets chased throughout the school for 10-15 minutes. Donna finds out that he has escaped and is in the hotel. This all leads up to an ending that leaves you sort of wanting more.That's how this movie came across to me. It constantly left me wanting more. The murders were very quickly done and had little suspense to it. It just felt like the makers of the movie wanted to rush through a lot of good stuff that makes horror fun, and just skip to the story and the ambiance of the prom night dance scene. The reason the original prom night worked was because of the suspense with the killer's identity. It kept you on the edge of your seat waiting to find out who was doing the killing and why. In this one, we know from the start who it is and why. And the motive of the killer is very weak in my opinion. There are some good parts within the hotel corridors, especially the chase scene involving Lisa (Dana Davis) and the crazed maniac. The acting for the most part is very good. Brittany Snow and Dana Davis were believable and Johnathan Schaech who plays the killer is pretty creepy.Prom Night (2008) is sort of the perfect horror film for a person who cannot handle real scary movies. It milks out all possible gore and suspense and leaves you with some jump scares and a few bloodless kills. It is a decent watch for a modern day horror film, but the 1980 version is much better. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is NOT a remake of the 1980 "Prom Night". This one has a young girl who is (inexplicably) being stalked by somebody. He kills her entire family but she gets away. He's locked away for life and she goes to live with relatives. Three years later she's happy and is ready to graduate from high school and attend her senior prom with her utterly dull boyfriend BUT--the killer escapes and goes after her and will kill again to get her.Yawn. Boring and pointless. The plot is as old as the hills and gets increasingly stupider as the film progresses. This is one of those films that the killer can magically appear where his victims are and is able to outwit the entire police force and kill multiple people in the meanwhile. There are endless stalking sequences and the killings are relatively bloodless (for the PG-13 rating). The acting is just OK. Not ONE person in this film has any personality traits whatsoever so the actors do what they can. The only good part is the opening song--an updated version of "Time of the Season". Otherwise this is boring with no scares, no memorable moments, a stupid plot and is so instantly forgettable it's insulting. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tasteless hunk of garbage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three years ago, Donna(Brittany Snow) was forced to watch her former teacher Richard Fenton(Jonathan Schaech), who was obsessed with the girl, kill her entire family. Fenton was put away and Donna had to go into therapy. Now it's Donna's last year of high school and she's getting ready for the senior prom. But Fenton's escaped from jail and he tracks her to the prom. Det. Winn(Idris Elba), the man who put away the psycho those years ago, desperately tries to stop him before he finishes what he once started.Now I know there are crappy horror remakes like House of Wax and One Missed Call, but this one takes the cake. For the positives, it's incredibly short. But that's about it. The acting is pathetic, with wooden performances all around. The scares are weak too.This is supposed to be a horror film. You need the occasional pop-ups. But this ruins any of those chances, like Fenton slowly appearing out of the darkness to the point where you can see him clearly and then attempting to scare the wits out of you, but that slow movement has already killed that off.Overall I give it a 1 out of 10(I wish there was a zero stars option). This is definitely a night I WOULD want to forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Prom Night" is the epitome of a massive disappointment.**SPOILERS** Having survived a traumatic experience, teenage Donna Keppel, (Brittany Snow) and her friends Lisa Hines, (Dana Davis) Claire, (Jessica Stroup) Bobby, (Scott Porter) Michael, (Kelly Blatz) and Ronnie, (Collins Pennie) decide to celebrate at the Pacific Grand Hotel for Senior Prom. Soon afterward, Detective Wenn, (Idris Elba) receives word that Richard Fenton, (Jonathan Schaech) one of her ex-teachers who harbored a psychotic crush on her and was responsible for murdering her family before being put away, has escaped from jail and is out stalking her and her friends at the hotel during the prom. While they try to have fun at the dance, they fail to notice their disappearing numbers, and with the police in the area finally realizing that their target is on the premises and is going after them, try to keep her safe from the psycho while they make sure he doesn't kill again.The Good News: There wasn't a whole lot here that actually worked for the film. One of the few bright spots is the fact that it gets off and running at a fairly early time, as the first attacks come quite quickly here since it's not too long. It's barely half-an-hour into this one before it starts knocking them off, meaning that there's a fairly-fun pace to this one, moving along at such a good enough knock that there's always something happening, and that's a good sign. The relatively high body count also works in this one's favor, really much more so than expected and it gets up there in numbers, not something that's to be expected with a film that's played as a thriller. It's got about a dozen, which is always a good sign when it can knock off some more people than expected. The only other fun part of the film is that, when it wants to, it's got a couple of really entertaining stalking scenes which are better than expected and are quite enjoyable at times. The first stalking scene in the under-construction segment is rather good, with the creepy setting coming into fantastic use, the action is really nice and the whole sequence works really nice. There's also a really good sequence where he stalks her within the hotel room that is quite good and a little intense at times. There's a couple other really good stalking scenes in here, and these here are the film's overall best qualities.The Bad News: There's a whole lot of problems with this one that really hold it down. One of the main ones is the easiest one to stop, this one is just so tame as to be almost effectively a kiddie film at times. The fact that the kills are just done with a simple knife is bad enough, but to have them singularly stabbings is where it really fails, not offering any creativity but also really lowering the amount of kills possible with this one. It's incredibly embarrassing to witness the manner of kills in this, as there's hardly anything to see when it gets the chance to. The stab-wounds aren't visible at all, merely marked by a small red dot on the article of clothing near the area where the knife entered during the kill. That's, of course, considering that you can even tell where the kill took place as most of the time this is edited in such a way as to make sure that the official killing method isn't determined so as to make sure that no one is really offended by this one. That seems to it's entire spiel, to be sure that no one is offended, as there's no blood or gore during the kills, the ones we can see are so tame a kindergärtner wouldn't be offended at it, no nudity or sleaze despite this being about Prom Night for high-schoolers and a resulting feel of just being so completely tame and harmless that it's really almost enough to knock it down because of that. Another problem is a completely glossed-over back-story that really doesn't do much of anything to explain rationale, motives, or anything at all. Rather, it's just explicitly stated as being a crush and the one time something could've been done with it, the keeping of journals with photos and thoughts about her, nothing is done. It's a grand missed-opportunity to really give this one something to it, and it fails on that mark badly. The last big flaw to this one is the fact that there's a never-ending series of utter stupidity presented here, both from the police and the characters. The characters' one is big, constantly wandering off by themselves to investigate the disappearance of their friends, all of which is done at the exact same area which makes them really stupid, but the biggest ones goes to the police for failing to inform others of what has happened, including her. That should've been a top priority once news leaked of the escape. It even could've worked, where she's under protection and told to act normally so as to make him go after her, yet that isn't used. All of these here lower this one.The Final Verdict: While not the utter failure that it's been targeted as, there's still not enough good points in this one to really raise it up. Really only recommended for those who prefer these kinds of films or fans of the creative side, while those who prefer harder-edged slashers or against the trend are urged to ignore.Rated PG-13: Violence and mild Language</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it doesn't deserve its abysmal 3.7 rating on IMDb, I thought, as the movie started. I like Brittany Snow, and I thought she did well her early dramatic scene in which she discovered her dead family. But, unfortunately it takes more than actors to carry a movie.The story and characters were pretty much as contrived as to be expected in a teen slasher - that would've actually still made for an average movie if done right, but no, the director has no sense of suspense and believes that ba-dumm! scenes are enough. There was one scene in which there could've been decent suspense, when the killer was pursuing his victim through a dark construction area, but no, the director made her so clumsy, tripping over everything and squealing, that the whole moment was ruined.It's also been a while that I've seen a teen slasher that killed off all the good guys instead of the bitches and bullies. While the characters were too one-dimensional to care for, I still think it's a bit too bleak for such a movie.</fullReview>

This is a very predictable movie with weak acting, pitiful slasher scenes and a downright dumb ending. OK- here's the story: psycho killer with no reasonable connection to the young girl he fantasizes after starts killing her friends on her prom night. Then a policeman kills him and the movie ends. No, seriously, that's the movie. There's no killer coming back to life for one last scary scene, no boyfriend to save the day, just lots of killing and credits rolling. There's nothing but stereotypical characters, a flat storyline and no element of fear whatsoever. what a waste!</fullReview>

There is really no suspense since it's revealed right off the bat who the killer is. There isn't a whole lot of grue in either the PG-13 rated version or the unrated for that matter. The screenplay goes through the motions and clichés and never really does much to engage the watcher. The photography is fine since the main bulk of the action takes place at the hotel. The sound design picks up a little slack by making the kills sound much worse than they were. The cast is pretty, faceless and chock full of the teen drama types.In Conclusion: 'Prom Night' is a bland remake that still manages to better the original, barely. Good for teenagers and snore inducing for adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought it was a good movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so, first off, this movie was not nearly as bad as the critics or some people in general thought it was. I mean, sure it was predictable in parts and the killings with the knife got kind of old after a while, but it was still a good movie to watch without you being badly disappointed! Sure for some people who are expecting a grotesque slasher film with a lot "dirty" material and scenes that will scare you horrifically it will be a bad movie, but you can't expect that. It was just another good movie! It wasn't outstanding, it wasn't unbelievable, it wasn't horrible, it wasn't bad, it was good! Just be happy with it because it could have been A LOT WORSE!!! It also could have been better. But that doesn't mean it was bad! It wasn't really scary but it had it's moments! It was suspenseful and also a little disturbing! There was also a make out scene for some people who like that ;-) I can see how the critics wouldn't like it and I can also see how some people in general wouldn't like it, but there are also some people out there that will find it great or good! Teens - some will like it some will not. People that are in their 20's - some will like it, some will not. 30's and over - they are most likely to like it less than other people, but some of them still will like it! My mom did and she is 41! Overall, it's just a good movie and for people who are expecting a grotesque slasher film with a lot "dirty" material and scenes that will scare you horrifically it will be a bad movie as I said above! So don't expect that! Expect what I told you :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually thought this movie was decent. Granted I didn't expect much in this film but some parts were good. Despite the movie not being great Brittany Snow was very good. The opening scene was actually very good. The first half was the strong point of the film if there was any the movie grew sour on me once Lisa's death scene came all the death scenes were pretty lame but a lack of suspense hurt too and yeah more blood would've been great.The ending was pretty crappy also. Brittany Snow was the only bright spot throughout the film the rest wasn't all that good but it was better than expected probably because of low expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not actually a remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of the Prom Night series (four Canadian horror films that were released between 1980 - 1991) and so was intrigued at the idea of a remake of the first movie.But strictly speaking, it's incorrect to describe it as a remake, despite the fact that's how it was marketed, because other than it's title and prom night setting this new film takes nothing from the first Prom Night. It's basically an original movie that's been labelled as a remake because such cinematic xeroxes are currently in vogue.I have to say that the new Prom Night is totally unoriginal, and stacked full of slasher-movie clichés. But it's slickly made with solid &amp; professional performances from the cast, and boasts a script that's more intelligent than usual for the genre. Any notable plot holes only start to occur at the end: I can accept the killer managing to ambush unsuspecting hotel staff and half-drunken teenagers with relative ease, but at the climax he somehow takes two experienced &amp; highly-trained policemen by surprise, despite the fact that both officers know that he's in the immediate vicinity, and are actually keeping guard! The new Prom Night might be an unremarkable and surprisingly bloodless film, but it's probably one of the better entries in the ongoing wave of 'remakes' of 70s &amp; 80s horror movies. It's also paradoxically more entertaining than the original Prom Night, which was actually very dull and decidedly inferior to the sequels that followed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is "bad".....then there is this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoyed Prom Night (2008), then I feel bad for you. Because you have been lied to throughout your undoubtedly short life by many people and institutions. Mostly though, you've been lied to by yourself. This is less of a movie and more of a giant commercial for everything that is wrong with our dying nation. This crap-fest has nothing to do with the mildly enjoyable predecessor that it shares the same name with. Other than the name "Prom Night", the only thing it has in common with the original is that there is a prom. Only now, Proms apparently are more glamorous that any Oscar celebration and there are no long fat people or kids with acne in high school. Plus, money is no object for the most annoying characters you'll ever endure. Never have I rooted more for a killer in a horror film. They spared us any suspense by showing us who the killer is in the first 4 minutes of the film. From there on the viewer is subjected to painful dialog and unbearable music that fills each ocean of time between the letdown killings. Everyone in this turd acts embarrassed to be there, as they should. Any evil person or group to churn out crap like this onto the public and stamp the name "Prom Night" on it should hang there head in shame at the disservice they have imposed on their fellow humans. The way this movie sucks so effortlessly is a reflection of how the United States is fast slipping into the footnote of history. Prom Night (2008) is a simple reminder that all is lost and that we deserve the demise that awaits us. After watching this, I realize that we are now one step closer to oblivion. I hate this movie. Not even God can help us anymore. Prom Night (2008) will forever scar my brain with its putrid and unyielding assault on everything that is good in this world. Hunting down and destroying every last copy of Prom Night (2008) may not undue the damage that it has inflicted upon our universe, but it is a start that may protect future generations from such careless and irresponsible film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just rented this movie tonight and I was very disappointed. I am a big fan of horror and thriller movies and I must say, this was neither. Prom Night will not leave you on the edge of your seat waiting for whats going to happen next because you already know what will happen next. I had a better chance predicting what happened in this movie than if I was watching a different movie a 2nd time. Brittany Snow does a good job with her character and the killer does a good job with his. A very simple plot with very simple roles.I do not recommend paying any kind of money for this movie. Wait for it to come on cable, and then if you have nothing to do for the next 90 minutes, watch it. But do not expect to have nightmares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give this film a Break....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK Prom Night is not the greatest horror/thriller of the genre but it is certainly not the worst either! In fact what we have here is a predictable yet enjoyable teen slasher flick, yes it doesn't take a Sherlock Holmes to figure out whats coming next but if you do give it a chance you will find it does have suspense and under the unlikely circumstances a certain degree of realism. The leading Cop is professional and he instructs his men in a sense which is be believable as a genuine detective, and his supporting comrades do a fine and professional job too. The victims also play their roles well, the crying and screams are very realistic and yes they all make typical dumb moves that is the exact intention with this kind of movie. Did you expect them to all to just stay in one place and hold hands? what kind of a movie would that be! The real star of the show is the Villain it just shows that we don't always have to have some creepy guy in a hockey or clown mask to pull off scary expressions human expressions can also be terrifying too and he portrays this with perfection his actions and cold temper extremely credible as a serial killer.The cinematography in this film is great excellent scenes good camera work atmospheric sound maybe needs more gore but then the PG rating would need to be pushed up and this was aimed at a wider audience All in all what you see is what you get with Prom Night and i knew exactly what i was expecting so i didn't let myself get disappointed, instead i saw good acting with likable characters in suspenseful scenes! Although the end isn't great this was an enjoyable 90 minutes ignore all the bad ratings and give this a go 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the worst film of 2008. First of all if you're gonna make a horror flick make darn sure it'll be at least Rated R because a horror flick without the rated R is like an iced tea without ice. This movie calls itself a horror flick but there's little amount of gore and blood. This should be more in the line of "Teen kween melodramatic mumbo jumbo" because its not scary at all.The serial killer is very unconvincing, the actors gave cardboard performances, the script and the dialog is poor, they used almost every tired horror cliché in the book and the attempts at suspense and thrills were so lame, halfway into the film I'd just wish the film be over but since every avid film goer like me, we are supposed to finish it all the way through so you can imagine my disgust when it ended so abruptly and that was that.I wish I could take back the lost 90 minutes of my time.</fullReview>

He's in a maximum security cell and he escapes through a ceiling vent? Come on... Even worse is how he disposed of kills. How can you stab someone so many times so violently and have only a few drops on the victims shirt. There should be blood everywhere. Even worse how can someone hide something like that from other victims so quickly. I couldn't relate to any of these characters at all. I didn't feel sorry in the least seeing them picked off. I was actually looking forward to it. I'd pass on this film. Travesty! That's the word I was looking for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Prom SPOILERS* The inflatable doll Donna Keppel (the bot-ox-looking and completely unable to act her way out of an open door Brittany Snow) is going to Prom with her cardboard cut-out boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter, who's done way better), her best friends, the PC Prom Queen Lisa (Dana Davis) who shows that Hey! Black girls can be morons too! and the hot but 'lights are on but nobody's home' Clair (Jessica Stroup, who at least is pretty) and the respective boyfriends, Michael and The Black Dude.But a man (go figure) from Donna's past is going to be at the Prom too; it's Richard Fenton Quackshell (Jonathon Schaech, who looks like a poor loser, and I was too busy laughing at him to find him even remotely scary), the science teacher who's obsessed with her - and since Snow is as attractive as a piece of glass stuck in my neck my question is 'WHY?' - and has killed her family three years prior, for 'us'. Yeah, buddy, killing a girl's family will really get you into... jail. And he's going to kill again... WHY? Why not just kidnap the bitch? Since the police doesn't seem to care, especially Detective Wynn (Idris Elba, who should really get a better agent) - I mean, the dude escaped from the stupidest High Security Prison In The World and they come to know this only THREE DAYS LATER???, nor seem to do her uncle and aunt, who ask the police 'not to ruin Donna's prom' making me believe that the whole family got into the gene pool when the Lifeguard wasn't looking.And so, the End - of those Body Snatchers and of all good sense, if there was ANY in this movie to begin with - begins, and Donna is going to feel the terror... yeah right.The 2008 'Prom Night' is not a remake of the 1980 original if not in name and setting (a small town's high school) - or not, since in this movie it looks like the local high school's prom night is some sort of Academy Award thing - and that's just as well. As Fangoria said, this movie, even with the Godawful remakes like 'Hitcher', 'April Fools' Day', 'Black X-Mas', 'HalloweeN', 'Psycho', Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'One Missed Call', 'Shutter', 'Day Of The Dead', 'Dawn Of The Dead' and 'When A Stranger Calls' and many others, manages to be the very worst of the recent slew of remakes. It's nothing but a series of clichés rehashed under a dubious semblance of plot, with characters who have no personality at all, nothing but a face and a name, situation that when are not contrived (I mean, the whole ending is an exercise in stupidity) they're impossible (the moronic Donna going upstairs on the elevator to get her mother's shawl while there's a fire alarm - the elevator wouldn't budge off the ground) or ripped off (Silence Of The Lambs anyone?), and the direction is flat and lifeless... did a zombie direct this? Or Michael Bay? Anyway, I'm afraid of what these tools are going to do with 'The Stepfather'... let's keep our fingers crossed.Prom Night (2008): 1/10.

I couldn't watch the credits because I was busy looking for a knife to slash my wrists. Perhaps the producers would have been better served focusing on developing a screenplay before they send it up north to get ruined by weak production value. Shame on everyone involved.

Of course the killer hates to look under beds because he's afraid that their might be monsters under their so she hides under the bed and the teacher gets caught and put in a maximum security prison, which is guarded by one guy. While in prison the teacher learns ninja skills like the art of jumping from one place to the next. And how to stab someone fifty times to have it seem like they just got a paper cut. After doing all of this, he stabs the security guard as he's watching Two and a Half Men and runs 1,000,000 miles to this girls house, on what night other than her PROM NIGHT!!!Okay, that's not really the plot of the movie, but honestly this is one of the funnier movies I've seen in a while.

		<fullReview>As a lover of the horror genre, I endeavour to find a positive aspect about every horror film even if the storyline is, for lack of a better word: bull. Last night I decided, against my better judgement, to watch this film because it couldn't possibly be as bad as it looks.SPOILER ALERT: Well, in all honesty, I cannot think about anything good to say. It's a typical teen slasher only without the gore factor, so it may as well just be put up for public viewing under the certificate of a PG. I'm being serious. I can only assume the victims died from being stabbed because the killer seemed to carry around a blade, which I might admit, was immaculate for the number of people he'd stabbed.There was one gory part, which was Lisa's death. This was the first and last time that blood was present. And some of you may say "well, that's not so bad". Wrong. This is a horror film. How can it be classified as "horror" if you don't see any blood? I thought "okay, this film COULD be saved should there be a phenomenal ending". No such luck. The ending was as boring and bland as the rest of the film.My advice: give this film a miss. Take it or leave it. If you watch the film, be prepared for the most boring film in the horror world. At least the Blair Witch Project had the making of a good film, despite how much I trashed it. It was nothing compared to this.</fullReview>

It's so sloppy, like they made it overnight or assigned a middle schooler to write it.Basically, a teenager was stalked by a psycho teacher and he killed her family. He was sent away, and he broke out 3 years later on her senior prom and attacks the place. The killer is not mysterious or creepy, just a Javier Bardem in No Country For Old Men expression-less looking guy with a pocket knife....very scary.

The killer just seemed to kill people for no reason, managed to teleport dead bodies around rooms and magically move across a room without one of the main characters standing in the same room noticing?? The main characters are just annoying and I ended up not caring if they died and wishign some would get killed quicker because they annoyed me so much. The black girl only ever moaned about becoming the prom queen or slagging off her opponent, her boy friend just took pictures the whole time. The main character and her boyfriend just moaned about how they would not see each other again and how "real" their relationship was.The killer never managed to kill anyone well not that I seen anyways, the camera just suddenly found another object in the room more interesting than one of the main characters getting killed and suddenly when we next see them they are dead. Another thing I noticed was that this killer wasn't scary, creepy or weird at all just that he wanted to screw some chick really bad.There was no suspense or surprise at all when characters were about to die it was all predictable and very very boring. There was a cool slow down camera effect when the guy got killed when he jumped out of the wardrobe. This was actually the only memorable part of this movie to be honest DON'T GO AND SEE THIS&lt; ITS A WASTE OF MONEY AND YOUR TIME</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Prom Night was, at the time, just a standard slasher movie. And it must be said, not a very good one. However, compared to this remake, it's a masterpiece! Three years ago, Donna was being stalked and harassed by one of her teachers. The teacher ended up killing her family trying to get to her. Now on the night of the high school prom, he's back to try and get her again....It should be pointed out that the plot is a bit different to the original movie. It's that that gives it the 1 out of 10. Everything else would get a 0.So, where to start with this rubbish? The script by JS Cardone is awful. It has characters do completely stupid things at times, all in an attempt to create tension (which this movie sorely lacks). Examples? Well try these :1. A character being stalked by the killer, has a chance to scream for help from her boyfriend, but instead remains silent, and ends up dead.2. In an attempt to flush out the killer, the cops set off a fire alarm. Great, except Donna (the so-called heroine) pulls a really dumb blonde moment, and GOES BACK to her suite to get something....3. The killer not content with killing Donna's friends kills some members of the hotel staff, yet no-one sees anything or hears it, which in a hotel that size, you would think had some kind of internal security camera system...and best of all...4. THE COP WHO ARRESTED THE TEACHER 3 YEARS EARLIER, AFTER FINDING OUT HE'S ESCAPED TELLS DONNA'S AUNT AND UNCLE, BUT DOESN'T TELL DONNA AT HER PROM, OR ANYONE ELSE!!!!There are more, but this list would go on almost as long as the movie.The direction by Nelson McCormick isn't good. He actually repeats a so-called shock moment twice in the movie, once near the start, the other near the end. Except neither are scary. He seems to be more interested in the scenes at the Prom, as opposed to the so-called horror/thriller parts of the story.The kill scenes are bloodless (it's rated 15 in the UK). Using a knife, you would expect to see more blood spilled, but even when you see victims after, the so-called stab wounds look like simple stains on the clothing! As for the set-up of the kills, none are that shocking, surprising or scary.The performances of the mostly unknown cast (to me at least) aren't that good, but Brittany Snow as Donna is awful. Admittedly her part as written does her no favours, but she's not good. In fact the only actress or actor of the group that was any good was Jessica Stroup. She was convincing in The Hills Have Eyes 2 as a marine, and would have been a better choice for the lead role, in my opinion.Incidentally, one of the film companies involved in this sorry mess is called (and you'll love this) ORIGINAL FILMS!!! Yeah, right....It's depressing being a horror fan, when you look at the so-called horror movies coming from the US at the moment. Film companies seem obsessed with remaking everything from the past 30 years. In the majority of cases, the results are simply not good enough. The only good remake recently was The Eye. But it's still a remake.Enough is enough! Stop with the remakes! Please! Make something original, or stop making horror movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prom Night is the sort of horror movie you go into expecting nothing more than a cheap scare, sure in the long run it's likely to be forgettable, but so long as it makes you jump, gives you a laugh and lets you leave the cinema feeling entertained. Prom Night is your average slasher really, no big creepy set piece, nothing really out of the horror movie cliché, its just a piece of average horror junk. Its a shame then that its also a poorly made, acted, and delivered piece of horror junk that not only fails to entertain you, it fails to even slightly chill the bone, it fails to even make you jump! I'd have accepted this a tiny bit more if there was at least some gore to make the movie a tad more interesting, the gore is beyond tame, how this got a 15 is completely beyond me. Adding insult to injury the movie is also stupidly boring, its the same scene pretty much repeated over and over again, its only in the last half hour we get a tiny bit of change, and yet that features so many stupidly pointless scenes its hard to wonder what the hell the point in the movie is. Oh and did I mentioned its funny, stupidly funny. Hell I was crying with laughter in one bit, its a shame its completely unintentional, and the bit I am on about is a bit when a man gets killed. The stupidly poor reaction just sent me into hysterics. Prom Night is a thriller basically devoid of any thrills, the only reason it actually gets a 2 is because of the fact I laughed in it, and I think my brain has numbed the experience making me forget it almost instantly.So onto the acting, or well the cardboard cut-outs. First there is Brittany Snow, who I noticed had a distractingly hairy face, anyway she was stupidly poor. Her acting experience ranging from startled expression to make random crying noises via trying not to scream. The opening sequence with her is just ridiculous, and one of the final scenes, which conveniently enough is repeated (yes the scene is literally a copy scene for scene) just shows you've had enough of the actress. The actual killer himself, played by Johnathon Schaech just has little to do. The biggest failure with the character is that we see him too often, he's just not scary as we know exactly where he is in every scene. The acting itself is tolerable, but then again he doesn't have to do much but look evil and stab people. Dana Davis (of Heroes fame) is just about tolerable, although once again she has little to do. She features in the best scene in the movie (trust me that isn't a compliment) as well as the very worst scene (random pigeons, good god). The rest of the cast really are that pointless/forgettable. Essentially they're there just to die, or go through the whole prom motions, or try and catch a killer, they're basically living breathing stereotypes running round.So that gets me onto the horror side of the movie, or the extreme lack of it. As I have previously mentioned the movie fails because we see the killer to often. Its just so annoying. Scenes that start to become tense are ruined because we just see the killer calmly walk in, scenes that look like they may make you jump abruptly end when we see the killer just standing somewhere in a corner. Tense chase scenes are ruined by stupid random damned pigeons appearing out of nowhere! As you can imagine I really disliked the pigeon sequence. The film being unintentionally funny just stomps the final nail in the coffin really, the porter death scene is something that I want to see again just for a laugh really. The poor dialogue is just embarrassing, the script is once again embarrassing, and the ending so damned predictable you might as well have not bothered to even see the movie. The movie does admittedly improve as it goes on, the first forty minutes being almost unbearable. Once the killing starts you no longer want to slit your wrists, but you still have to cope with an incredible amount of stupidity.Overall Prom Night is boring, stupid and just a lazy attempt at a horror movie. People who nearly die when watching the tamest horror movie could watch this, it just isn't scary, doesn't make you jump and doesn't even attempt to creep you out. Save your money, go rent the original Halloween if you want a good slasher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best bad movie of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so Prom Night was the most popular movie at my school a few weeks back, all my friends had seen it, some liked it, some hated it. So my friend was willing to see it again with me, so I could see if I liked it. We were the first ones in that room, because everybody else was seeing Iron Man. There were only three other people who showed up after us and boy, did we have fun.It was flat out terrible, completely predictable and funny every time we were supposed to be scared. That's why we loved it; it wasn't scary at all, but it was entertaining because we had big- and we mean gigantic knee-slapping rounds of laughter, so I wanted to see it again in case we missed some stupid move the "I've obviously never seen a horror movie" teenagers made. For example, in one scene, one of the protagonist's friends is running away from the killer, and the elevator won't show up in time, so the girl decides to run down the stairs with her high heels on, she breaks one of the heels, takes the shoe off, and continues running down the stairs with one high heel shoe on and the other off. Pardon me, but if the girls are really that dumb, then they almost deserve to die.This movie is so dumb, that I was whispering to my friend what I thought was going to happen, and nine out of ten times, that's exactly what happened. Now if you like classic horror movies and want to be scared, you will be disappointed, but if you want to see one of the years biggest laugh riots, you'll be pleasantly entertained.If you've seen as many horror movies as I have, and you watch this and don't laugh at least once, I'll be astonished. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just been to see this movie and all I can say is "What a pile of s***"!!!!! If this had been a re-make of the original Prom Night it could have been half decent (maybe gaining a respectable 3 or 4 stars) but instead they have just used the title and made a whole different movie that is beyond awful!!!! I love horror movies and have seen some pretty awful ones in my 26 years but this rates up there with the worst of them including Rob Zombie's version of Halloween, Hostel: Part 2, the re-make of When A Stranger Calls (I didn't think anything could be worse than that) and Premonition. I even enjoyed AvP:R more even though it was stupid and OTT but at least it had a smidgen of dignity!!! I can honestly not say anything good about Prom Night - the cast were awful, the acting was awful, the direction was awful, the story was awful, the script was awful - it was all just awful!!! And - to make matters worse the tagline reads: "It's Midnight Everyone's Ready To Go Home - But Someone Has Other Plans" Which pisses me off for 2 reasons - A) The Grammar is just atrocious and B) It has no relevance to the movie because it all happens before midnight and all the kids are staying at the hotel so nobody planned on going home anyway!!! Easily the worst movie of 2008...so far!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time waster. Don't support it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film just came out today in the UK. I thought it would be quite scary and a good night out, I mean its a 15 certificate. The only scary scenes are jumps, and there are so many. The killer is not scary. The victims are typical blonde Americans, all stupid. The cops are the worst I've ever seen. And the killer is not very good at killing either. There is no comedy. Like the "Scream" films, it has comedy to support the up and down flow of the film so the scary bits are actually scary. This on the other hand is just drama and stupid teenage behaviour. It is funny when Tatum (Sidney's friend) gets trapped in a cat flap in "Scream" because its ironic. In "Prom Night" there is no comedy thus makes the tense bits (which happen a lot!) kind of dumb.Overall: It did make me jump but I had to force myself to stay to the end. I can't believe people can make money from such bad entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I Don't Mean The Harsh Headline For This Review, But It's True. Coming From A Horror Movie Fanatic Like Myself, I Had Heard Of This Remake and Knew That This Movie Was Gonna Suck From The Start. Well, Here Are My Thoughts On This Movie. I Got The Chance To See This Movie On Opening Night and Went In With Hopes and Expectations With This Movie, But As Many With Recent Horror Remakes It Was Toned Down, Didn't Resemble The Original's Plot (Except The Prom Story), and Not Enough Blood &amp; Gore. I Mean, Come On Hollywood, If There Are Gonna Be Horror Remakes, Make Them To Resemble The Original and Not Insult Them By Rating Them PG-13. As For PROM NIGHT, I Fell Asleep For The First Half Of The Movie and Was Awakend By The Screams Of The Group Of Teenagers In The Row Behind Me. What I Saw Was A Cheesy Looking Death Scene Of The Hotel Maid Getting Killed By Our Maniac Killer. In The End, Avoid This Movie At All Costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is shocking. Why do a PG-13 'slasher' movie? As soon as i saw the PG-13 stamp on the film, i knew it would be dismal. I know there couldn't be too much blood + guts but you would think that when a person gets stabbed there could at least be visible blood marks. When Donna is hiding under the bed with her stabbed-dead friend, Claire, next to her, surely they would both be lied in a pool of blood from Claire seeing as she had been shot! And when her boyfriend (i forget his name he was that good) is dead in her bed, surely there would be blood actually on her bed so she would know he is dead without her having to turn him over. Before commenting i read the 'Goofs' on this website and i spotted a large number of these whilst watching the movie for the first time. Particularly the fire alarm - working lift thing and the loud screams but nobody hears thing. There was clearly no pilot research that went into this movie before it was shot and there cant have been much of a proof viewing because surely these obvious errors would have been picked up on! The whole cliché ending made me laugh out loud! The whole police man killing the guy JUST before he killed Donna was incredible timing! Wow, it amazed me. How many times were there the whole 'look in the mirror, see the killer' cliché shot?! I lost count and started to despair. Every time i saw a mirror in the movie i knew what would happen next. And as for people falling over when they should be running away! Damn, people need to be more careful! From shoe heels breaking at the wrong moment to paint pots being knocked off, i found myself laughing along and wanting to push these people over myself, just for added effect. I got more thrills and scares from playing the Prom Night game on the Official website.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible waste of a cinema trip!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I could give this film a real rating, it would likely be in the minus numbers. While I respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible "horror" films, seriously, people, buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time.Despite it being a horror film, there is nothing scary about it, unless the idea of seeing how many horror cliché's you can fit in one movie scares you. If the rating had been higher, it probably would have made for a better film in the long run.Whoever made this version of "Prom Night", you screwed up. The actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren't for the questionable scripting. This was a terrible waste of a cinema trip. I'd sooner go and see "One Missed Call" again, at least that had some plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "Prom Night" was located far from Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When any teenager sees a good trailer for a horror movie targeted at them, they get very anticipated for the movie and are sometimes left out when they leave the actual showing of the movie. That's my predicament in a nutshell: saw an interesting trailer, got very excited and was disappointed at the final product. Of course, if I had started at anything scarier (as this was my first horror movie), I probably would have left. I scare easily and this is perfect to start out with if you're not used to the jump scenes. However, I can understand good scripts and acting and this was not it. The characters had no real personality and most of the "chase" scenes were about 45 seconds long. Is it the bad actors or is it the lousy script? I have seen "Red Eye" and that really intrigued me and I hope to find more good thriller or horror movies in the future. For example, I am hoping to see "Disturbia," "Flightplan" and "When a Stranger Calls." We'll see how well they turn out. This got a 5 from me because, again, it was my first horror movie (although I'm not sure whether you would call this movie that or not) so I was lenient, but for all you experienced moviegoers out there, this is not the right "Prom Night" to go to.</fullReview>

At least BRITTANY SNOW's performance was good and some others like IDRIS ELBA were good too, but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing. The killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too. The deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginals. The movie was very boring too and very overrated. It wasn't suspenseful at all, i almost fall asleep. Its another bad PG-13 remake, its really a dreadful movie IMO. The ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring. The movie is pretty slow too. Overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe BRITTANY SNOW i think she gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA too, but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake. Well thats just my opinion. i gave it a 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts. I must admit, I found it pretty decent...until I started to THINK about what the characters were saying. Logical problems:1. Her boyfriend, who seems to be a pretty fit dude, makes no sound while being killed. Don't you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer? 2. When the remark is made that the gym teacher is "SOOOO in love with Lisa," I almost screamed at the screen. When your best friend's family HAS BEEN KILLED BY A TEACHER WHO WAS IN LOVE WITH HER, you don't make comments like that if you have half of a heart.3. As soon as Nash asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead, wouldn't the smart thing to do be to get Donna, boyfriend, aunt, and uncle into a car and drive far, far away, then bait the house with the HRT and police force so that the killer has no way to get out?I could go on. And on. And on. Basically, the plot was decent, the characters weren't profiled enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered and there were way too many errors.HOWEVER.This movie might be good for teenagers, or young couples just looking for a fun night out. If you don't consider all the goofs, it's a mediocre film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three years ago, young Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the brutal murder of her mother, father and brother at the hands of obsessed teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech). Fenton was captured and sent to jail, and life continued on for young Donna.Fast forward three years later, and she's about to go to her Senior Prom with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and her friends Claire (Jessica Stroup), Lisa (Dana Davis), Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and Michael (Kelly Blatz).Unbeknownst to them, Fenton has escaped prison and is heading back for a reunion with his lost love. It's up to Detective Nash (James Ransone) to find him and stop him before he kills again.But, let's face it, he does kill again...and again...and again...Sure, this is nothing more than another cheap slasher pic, but Brittany Snow made the film. She had a great performance, and should look into being the next 'scream queen' (like Jamie Lee Curtis and Neve Campbell before her).Other than that, all I know for sure is that Donna is going to need some MAJOR therapy once this is all over, with how many people close to her Fenton kills, it's crazy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why Hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes) but is it considerably worse why Hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that weren't brilliant to start with (Prom Night, The Amityville Horror) Much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere, character or any genuine scares at all. Prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch, but for all the wrong reasons.It's a poorly acted, massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do. It's clear Hollywood Horror is dead. Even The likes of The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot. Prom night is virtually bloodless and I'm not even going to mention how bad the plot is. Its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm... the original.One of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be. Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) has survived a terrible tragedy, but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style.When the big night finally arrives, Donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high-school blowout by living it up and partying till dawn. But while Donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future, the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance. An obsessed killer is on the loose, and he'll slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only Donna.Who will survive to see graduation day, and what will Donna do when she's forced to confront her greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davis co-star in the slasher remake that will have tuxedo-clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor. A plot that will probably put you off going to see this. Witch if you ask me is a good thing.Without much to work with, McCormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations. At one point, a girl backs into a floor lamp (a lamp!) and McCormick tries to pump it up into a jump-scare moment. Desperate times really do call for desperate measures. There haven't been this many shots of closets since the last IKEA catalogue.In the era of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator, there probably is a freaky, scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and society's creepy obsession with youthful beauty. This is not that movie.My final verdict? Avoid at all cost. Nobody will like Prom Night, it's even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hack-job remakes. Considering its absolute lack of blood or frights. A night you'll be in a hurry to forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom Night: Almost as enjoyable as being hit repeatedly in the teeth with a mallet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The night of the prom: the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic. And so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head-peckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives.There really is no excuse for Prom Night. There is less than nothing original about it and I truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on IMDb. The only part of my viewing that I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of 'ghosts'. It was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them.The plot was basically some guy going on a rampage. And the thing was, it wasn't even a slightly exciting rampage. Maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame Robbie Williams lookalike with a baseball cap, I might have sat there feeling slightly anxious. The fact that I cared less about the characters than I did about the colour of the cinema carpet didn't really add to the effect, either. And to make matters worse, the rest of the characters were equally one-dimensional and oblivious. The hotel staff didn't seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave. I was incredibly surprised that the bitchy, stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was. She realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs, entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets. Nice one.The worst thing was, I hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest. He really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening. Shocking! And the music, don't even get me started. It was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral.I really wish that Prom Night was a joke. It was terrible and stupidly predictable. No one, in their right mind or otherwise, has any reason to see this film. Mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation. If you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film, hear my plea. Don't do it. There are better things to spend six pounds on. Like a sheet to play ghosts with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but could have been better... (contains a spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the story line - very creepy - and overall, I thought the movie was pretty good. However, there were some things that could have been tweaked to make it a really good movie. For one thing, it was very predictable; you pretty much knew whether a character was going to live or die within the first ten minutes of meeting them. I didn't think that the acting was bad - I personally thought that the killer was immensely creepy and passed off well as an obsessed-stalker-teacher-killer. I felt that there was not enough blood to be convincing. I mean, the guy is a throat-slasher...there should be blood everywhere, more than just a splatter when he does it and then somehow, there's no blood left in the body...maybe he's part vampire??? Although, this movie is just rated PG-13, so they probably aren't allowed to go over the top with the gore. I just felt that it could have been more convincing. I wish that there had been more action in the hotel. That place was massive and I was actually expecting the majority of the "scary" stuff to take place there. I was also expecting some nameless student deaths, but I guess that would have been irrelevant to the plot and would not have fit in with the killer's plan that seemed to be get in, get girl, get out. ***** Spoiler Here!!!! ******* Since the movie was a bit of a failure in the surprise department, I thought that they could have tried appealing to other emotions. For instance, after the prom, when the girl goes to the bathroom and leaves her sleeping boyfriend in the room only to come back and find him dead...totally saw that coming (a prime example of unrealistic lack of gore, by the way...the bed would have been covered in blood). A scene in which the boyfriend and the killer have a struggle (which is lost by the boyfriend, obviously) would have been good, because the audience would have felt some suspense, hoping that the boyfriend was going to win. **** End Spoiler!!! ****** Suspense makes a thriller more enjoyable than a few jump-in-your-seat surprises, if you ask me. And since the movie's surprise factor was lacking, I thought that they really should have worked on the suspense factor more. They also could have made it longer. I definitely felt that the chase scenes were way too short. I'm not saying that they should drag each one out for fifteen minutes where the girl or whoever just keeps screaming and falling down, but they could have made them a little longer than they were. Overall, I thought that it was a pretty good movie. I liked the opening scenario and like I said earlier, I thought that the actors were convincing. A good one for girls who wanna have a fun scare, not good for people who are seriously into horror/slasher flicks. My recommendation: wait for DVD, if you can't, see the matinée.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay. It was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes. The ending was even worse. Everyone kept dying, but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly OK! They did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had, etc. The movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline. The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I kind of feel bad for the young actors. They needed better coaching. They could have really made this an OK film, but the screenplay and acting failed miserably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly, but semi-watchable pre-teen slash fest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Screen Gems' Prom Night, the latest in a long, seemingly endless line of pre-teen geared PG-13 horror films, proves that Hollywood still has a long way to go before they realize how a good horror film works. Prom Night promises a lot, but leaves the viewer feeling stood up and alone by the end of the movie.A remake of the popular 1980 Jamie Lee Curtis slasher vehicle, Prom Night discards the original's more interesting plot and opts for a more obvious, silly, and TV movie storyline, centering around innocent teenage Donna (Brittany Snow) and the older male teacher who is obsessed with her. Needless to say, the new story could have truly gone somewhere and it's a shame that it ends up feeling more like a typical Lifetime movie event rather than a scary or suspenseful thriller.The young cast manage to give pretty decent performances, but they have very, very little to work with. Dana Davis as Donna's best friend, Lisa, is especially likable.The film's condescending PG-13 level shocks and scares are pretty dull and bland, but the film does have a nice pace to keep things rolling smoothly, which is one thing that you can't say for other watered down pre-teen efforts like Boogeyman and When A Stranger Calls.Fans of the original might want to consider this new film as more of an unofficial sequel in the Prom Night series. Eiher way, no matter how you think of it, remake or sequel, it's a disappointing, scare less affair, with a lots of potential, but little pizazz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom Night (2008) - Neither Bad or Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one sentence: Prom Night (2008) is neither bad nor good.I am a big fan of the original: it was a fun and unpredictable 80's slasher film, but I walked into the theatre of the "remake" (if you could even call it that) not expecting anything but an average slasher film - despite reading the bad reviews.'Prom Night' begins with an actually good opening sequence involving Donna and her family - it is a tad creepy and even a little emotional -- involving a scene with her mother. Unfortunately from here, the movies dives into a pool of clichés. THE GOOD:*The characters aren't anywhere nearly as annoying as I thought they would be, though Donna did get on my nerves a few times.*Lisa and Ronnie - these two characters stole every scene they were in. Ultimately for me, Lisa and Ronnie were the film's saving grace - the only thing stopping me from giving this movie a 2/10. They were believable characters and the actors portraying them have good chemistry.*The previously mentioned opening scene with Donna and her family.*The acting was pretty good on the most part.*The film was a lot more emotional than most slasher films - one of the saddest scenes being the aftermath of a character having to ID the body of a dead friend. This was a really powerful scene in an otherwise, pretty bland movie.*The credits - watching all of the characters dancing in footage taken earlier that night (knowing that many of them are now dead) is oddly creepy.THE BAD:*The biggest problem with the film is the script. The characters are all decently written (nothing deep, but they're not shallow clichés) but as soon as it gets time for the scares - the script becomes clumsy. Characters die not because of the killer but because of completely random and increasingly stupid things (to mention any instances would be very spoilerly - so I'll refrain but I will mention that high-heels, birds, and paint cans all play an active role in one character's demise). The funniest scene involves Donna VS a lamp...yes, a lamp. *Besides the script, the killer is another huge problem in the film. While the killer has a decent back story (it could've been much worse based on other genre entries), he is so far from scary its not even funny. Hannah Montana looks scarier than this killer (who looks a little like Ashton Kutcher). As other reviewers have noted: good looking, normal people are NOT scary killers. *The final major problem with this film are the death scenes. I know this was rated PG-13 so I wasn't expecting any gore or too much blood and oddly that wasn't the problem with the death scenes. I can live with no gore and not much blood but the death scenes are so stupid, I think the audience felt more pain just having to watch them. Some of the scenes seem to be fast-forwarded a little and it really distracts the viewers. Adding to this, the fact that the killer seems to be able to teleport magically, the on-screen deaths are horribly done (I can only think of two exceptions).*Oh and the hair salon scene made me want to puke out my insides...I think 'Prom Night' is a decent, though very bland movie. My overall attitude coming out of the movie was: 'Eh..' (I wasn't happy or angry). Those die-hard slasher fans, looking for something new to the genre, should definitely skip this mess but for anyone just looking to watch an OK teen slasher film, not looking for anything new, I am sure you could do much worse than Prom Night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prom night was predictable, a cliché, and neither scary nor gory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the preview for this movie, I really couldn't wait to see it. The plot seemed good and the setting was great. I mean, a slasher movie that takes place on prom night, great idea!! And the plot: A High School teacher that becomes sexually obsessed with one of his students, goes crazy, gets arrested, and escapes three years later on prom night! Prom night, a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable, turns into hell!! However, I saw it and was extremely disappointed. It was not only the worst "horror movie" I have ever seen, but it was one of the worst movie in general that I have ever seen!! First of all, it wasn't even scary. There was not one moment in that movie when I jumped out of my seat. Also, the murder scenes were so cheesy and dull. All the slasher did was either stab his victims in the stomach multiple times or cut their throats. Also there was absolutely no gore (its rated PG-13). The scene with the most blood was probably the one where the killer murders the black girl. He slits her throat and blood splatters on the sheets hanging around them (they don't actually show him cutting her throat).Next, you see the killers face the first time he is introduced in the movie. He isn't mysterious, creepy, or scary. He's just this guy who kills people.Also, everything in the movie was so cliché. An example is when, at the end, the killer is about to kill the main character and at the last moment, the detective shoots and kills him. Also, every single thing in this movie was so predictable. The victim, after seeing the guy with a knife, runs for her life, hides, thinks she gets away, and then the killer just pops out and kills her.Finally, the sequence of the movie was extremely bad. The guy goes into the hotel, kills a few people, the bodies are discovered, someone pulls the fire alarm, and everyone evacuates. The main character forgets something in her room, has an encounter with the killer, runs and escapes. Thats it! She and her boyfriend go home, the slasher kills the guards patrolling the house, finds the girl, then gets killed by the detective. The movie sequence was so stupid and cliché.If your thinking of seeing this movie all because the preview looked good, trust me, don't waste your time or money. No wonder this movie was being shown in the smallest theater in the movie theater. My friend and I, along with these two girls sitting in the back, were the only ones in the theater. That should have told me something about the movie beforehand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I expected...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I instantly was excited, I expected this to be one of Britney Snow's best just like John Tucker Must Die, unfortunately when I saw this movie, I was sadly disappointed. In the beginning, everything was thrown out that basically was in the commercials, I expected towards the end a little twist, but all in all, everything was predictable. I give this a "6" for what I expected it to be, how emotional it really was, and the plot. Those were good, I just wish that there was a little more to it at the end as well, like a "5 years later...." and it shows how shes doing and everything and they cut it, it ended the story at the point of Donna crying with her family, but it really should have had at least a minute or two added about her life in the future, so that we get the total story. Plus, we never really understand why Donna was practically physic in the bedroom/bathroom scene at the end? I give this movie props, but unfortunately it was not extraordinary, or something you want to waste 10 bucks on, its a okay movie, don't get me wrong! But I think you should save this movie to get on DVD or rent it.The actors and actresses are sensational though, you can really get the feel of how their scared and mad, Britney Snow did an AMAZING job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So they remade an average slasher film and made it worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have all been asking ourselves "why don't they remake the slasher films that were only OK instead of remaking the ones that were great already, that way they can only make it better?" well with Prom Night they have remade the average but trashy fun 80s Jamie Lee Curtis film and made it even WORSE. Its a paint by numbers slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens (hence no violence etc), the knife in this slasher flick is blunt.The director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the window.The cast who include Britney Snow (who was superb in Hairspray) try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared.More annoying is how the death scenes are handled (we will hear the attack but wont see it). It also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing suite since the film looks like it has been butchered (im guessing anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so as not to scare the kids) Yet in pours the money from Americans sending this film to number 1 at the box office!!! Slasher movies are a lot of fun but in Prom Nights case it made me want to download the original.I've seen scarier OC and Dawsons Creek episodes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are bad reviews out there already... they kid you not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*warning* this review contains me complaining a lot which is likely to get very annoying.I had very low expectations before seeing this movie (read lots of other bad reviews). I had the plot worked out in my head just from watching the previews. This is a remake of a 1980 movie of the same name, and that movie was much better (even though it also was pretty bad). The original was also rated R. Why the change to PG-13? It's simple, it's prom season and they're gonna want as many teens to see this as possible; that, and what adult would want to see a teen horror flick? So any possible thrills it could have had were immediately whiped out. (and i heard there were a lot of boobs in the original....was the director of the new one gay?) The lead girl wasn't even that attractive; pretty, but not enough for her to have the camera close up to her face for 80 minutes, having each and every pore and scar visible. Sigh....The scare tactics were also predictable. They used the same things over and over (the background shot of the killer, the sudden unnecissary jumps, the music build up to those jumps) and yet, i didn't even twitch. Nothing about this movie is scary.It's also pretty obvious that this movie was made for girls excited for prom. The scenes early on that were spent getting ready for the prom were overdone and just way too cheesy. The chemistry between the actors and their dates made me want to throw up... they weren't cute, they were dramatic and far fetched. They give an illusion to girls that their guys should be just like the guys on the big screen; which basically encourages girls to be high maintenance.I don't generally like horror movies, and this is a perfect example why. I'd rather see a cliché comedy over and over than a cliché horror movie once. This movie was cliché cliché cliché.2 out of 10 (they shoot the killer in the end, the girl lives, her boyfriend dies, her 2 best friends and one of their dates dies, a maid dies..... there, now you don't have to see this. I just saved you some money. You're welcome.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a remake, not original, just not a good movie!!! Period!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the idea of young people going to a prom, this film has nothing in common with the film starring Jamie Lee Curtis back in 1980! That might not have been a bad thing, because Prom Night (1980) was forgettable even by most 80's slasher horror standards- however somehow with undoubtedly a bigger budget, this film maker has made an even more forgettable film! To give you an idea of how forgettable this is: I've sat down to write this review three times, and lost interest in writing it all three times. So, I'll give you a little idea of what this film is about and what's wrong with it.Girl is stalked by a fired teacher who kills her parents and brother. Girl is in therapy. Girl going to her prom. Ex-teacher escapes from mental hospital and kills most of the girls friends and her boyfriend. Ex-teacher fails to get girl, and is killed when he is about to kill her.The major problem with this film is that everything happens with coincidence! For instance, ex-teacher is checking into the hotel when the girl and her friends arrive for their prom. He's STILL checking in when one of the guys comes comes to get more key cards, announcing which room is theirs. When ex-teacher wants a master key card, the cleaning lady just happens to be a couple rooms away. I could go on and on about this, but what's the point? This is not a good movie...its not even an OK movie. My advice: skip it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It really is a night to die for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well where do i start?! First of all i am appalled by the lies that have been said in comments on this fantastic film. It certainly doesn't deserve one out of 10 and it is obvious that it is mostly guys giving it a pitiful mark. Donna's reaction to her mother's death is not only believable but heartbreaking and it even made one of my friends cry. The film was full of suspense but a bit predictable but to be honest what horror film isn't? There is a limited amount that can be done with a horror film so i think Prom Night did a pretty damn good job.The murderer was a frightening character but one of my friends did fancy him! But she has a really weird taste so that's not relevant. His eyes were menacing and i couldn't look at him properly he scared me so much. Me and my friends were hidden behind our hoodies for most of the film it was that scary. My friend also had nightmares and had to check her wardrobe that night before going to bed.The characters may not be well developed but they represented the typical rivalry between the hotties and the notties (that is also an amazing film btw). I was devastated when ronnie's love of his life was killed brutally by a slashing of the throat and the effect of the blood was superb.In conclusion i recommend this film as one that isn't just a clichéd horror film but one that really tries to break free from the horror film mould. In the words of one of my friends LOVE IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well the plot was good but it wasn't scary at all! To me in the ending he should of gotten away with the girl not died. Also they should of made him wear a mask or something.So when he pops out it scared me and it wasn't like ooh there he is. I didn't like how the ending it was more of a chase instead of him killing people. The one boyfriend should died also because his girl friend died. The acting was OK the only thing i like about seeing it in theaters was the audience that was watching it. There was the screams,clapping or just people telling other people to shut up. But if you want a real scary movie don't see this. If you want a movie that you can see and not see any gore see this. But hey its your choice not mine. So have fun watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did u expect a lot of blood? did u expect 2 be scared? I will answer that for you...NO!! I wanted see the movie regardless because it looked fun...I actually expected it to be worse than what it was... I hated the fact that they killed basically every damn body... but besides that its a good old time if your a 17 or 18 year old, because it's prom season...the movie was kinda repetitive, but fun, even though u already knew what would happen. So not being so harsh the movie was kinda kool for what it was, because you can't expect for a PG-13 HORROR film to be exquisite so go into the movie theater not expecting to much and you will not be let down.</fullReview>

In Prom night there were no jump in your seat moments and some things were never explained. A lot of people who hated this movie hated the affects. I however did not feel it should be even classified as a horror and hardly a thriller. I think though Britney snow played her part fairly well but the killer was definitely the best.

But when the night turns from magic to murder there is only one man who could be responsible, the man she thought was gone forever. Now, Donna and her friends must find a way to escape the sadistic rampage of an obsessed killer, and survive their Prom Night.Thrilling and well made script, scarier than you would expect from a film that is PG-13. While this is not the best, the original was slightly better. The script is good and there is cameos planted throughout the entire film.Rated PG-13 for Graphic Violence, Adult Themes and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for starters I give this movie 5/10 because it truly is a good movie to see if you just want a laugh with some friends. but why oh WHY did she, after having a premonition about having her head smacked into a medicine cabinet, would she then proceed to go about everything in the exact same way as that premonition, even GOING to the bathroom and using the medicine cabinet?!?! And how stupid was Claire's boyfriend Michael, endlessly talking with his back to the bathroom and blah blah blah he was just awful. Why did the police officer tell the aunt and uncle that there was no reason to think that the crazy psycho killer would come after Claire? Jeez, I dunno, maybe because in the line up scene he TOLD her he was going to??? And if the murderer of your niece's parents and brother gets free from jail and has been roaming around for three days, umm i think you might want to pull her out of the prom. Honestly, the uncle or aunt was like "ooh nooo let's not embarrass her, much better to let her best friends, boyfriend, maid and bellboy die than poor donna miss out on what honestly looks like a boring prom". but it's still so so funny!</fullReview>

If we start at an automatic zero, her presence adds 4 stars no matter how poor the rest of it was.2. This movie was horrendous, and very very weak. It was so enjoyably terrible however, that I was thoroughly entertained by its utter failure to create any original circumstances, generate a suspenseful moment in the film, or frighten anyone over the age of 14 in the audience.With those two things considered, i recommend this movie with 7 stars to anyone looking for a good laugh.</fullReview>

It actually had me on the edge of my seat.The story is quite intriguing, frightful, suspenseful and terrifying. The main character is played by the wonderful young actress Brittany Snow (Hairspray, Pacifier) and despite what many, many people had said about her and the rest of the young actors and actresses performances, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie; it's worth watching.As far as recommendations go, I recommend this to anyone who like suspense without too much gore, trashy horror or just a good spooky story.

		<shortDescription>Alright Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was alright... The story line was decent, somewhat clichéd... It started out with her having a nightmare, remembering when her parents and brother were murdered. It would have made a great, scary addition to the movie if they would have developed the story line starting from when the stalker first met her. They could have shown how it developed into her parents being killed, etc... And considering that the movie is only 88 minutes long, this would have made it a more full length movie. Her friend Lisa is also killed in the film in a somewhat intense chase scene, but the viewers have a better connection with her than with her boyfriend, who is the only friend that makes it out alive. I don't really understand why they let her boyfriend survive and not her. I was really disappointed and wanted her to live.The way the guy killed people was not that scary. He would just slit their throats, giving them no chance to fight. This is where it could have used some Halloween-like ideals. There were a few scary scenes, but it was not really that suspenseful. He would just kill anybody who saw him, plain and simple. Not as many chase scenes as I would like. This movie was EXTREMELY predictable.It was pretty good. I was entertained, but it is not good enough that I would see it more than one more time in my life. It is thousands of times better than the world's most god-awful movie - Shutter. The story line was good, but the way it was done did not give it justice. It was really depressing, though, that all those people died. They could have killed less and gotten the same point across. I felt so bad for that poor girl!Lastly, the acting was excellent. This movie does not follow the tradition that has long plagued horror movies of bad acting. Brittany Snow does a great job.Decent movie, entertaining enough that you're not bored and waiting for it to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth the money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was awful from beginning to end. I came out of the theater enraged that I'd spent money on this tripe and furious that I couldn't speak to anyone about getting it back. First, let me stress that the 2008 remake of Prom Night has no resemblance of the original done in the 80s, which still had a better premise than this. Prom Night 2008 revolves around the very empty plot line of an obsessed teacher escaping from a maximum security prison to be with a student, Donna Keppler (Brittany Snow). He'd fallen in love with her as a freshman 3 years previously and killed her parents and younger brother when he couldn't get to her. Donna has now moved in with her aunt and uncle, continues to attend the same school and is haunted by reoccurring dreams of the murders. But nothing will stop her from attending the prom. Donna and her friends pose for the camera in their trashy outfits and stretch limo to a red carpet gala complete with its very on paparazzi. They have a "Bring It Own" moment with another student competing for prom queen then enter the main event. As we continue to not learn about these friends of Donna's it is obvious that the writers were trying to rush to the action because these very under developed characters seem to be oblivious to Donna's previous dealings with the teacher. With music pumping, butts bumping, and sappy conversation about the end of high school and the rest of their lives Donna and her peers show their immaturity by arguing about the smallest of things and running around the hotel as if they've never been out before. And if that's not enough every one is trying to rush upstairs to get laid. Enter the killer transformed by a hair cut and baseball cap. Quite the chameleon! He lurks around the hotel killing maids, bellhops, and Donna's classmates with a completely unrealistic mode of attack might I add. No one is able to defend themselves from this average looking knife wielding maniac. Instead they do nothing but scream blindly into the camera. Get those 15 minutes of fame! The meager attempts for heart pumping moments are few and far between. The killer appears in the mirror behind Donna way to many times for the gag to be scary and it is always predictable. Plus the dead bodies that keep turning up are just bad actors laying around waiting for the pay check and the credits roll in. Oh and covering your mouth with your hand does not always keep the screams from coming out yet the writers appear to think so. At least that's the case when the attack-ee is cowering under some furniture hiding from their assailant. In the end, Donna is able to fight off her would be killer after losing all of her friends and protectors (sorry police officers) to his knife. She cries, he dies. All is well. Credits roll, torture ends. There are no redeeming qualities in the movie whatsoever. If you want to see a show please spend your money elsewhere. Prom Night is a horrible attempt to revive slasher movies such as Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer with no avail. Unfortunately, because the commercials for this were somewhat entertaining this movie will probably do well in the box office. But hopefully more people will feel obligated, as I did, to forewarn others about the pitfall which is Prom Night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much like "Donna," I witnessed a murder...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's right much like Brittany Snow's character, Donna, I witnessed a murder...A murder of the original 1980 horror film, 'Prom Night.' I don't care if YOU think it's not a remake. It's a remake, people. Under movie connections, it says, "Remake - Prom Night (1980)" That wasn't put there by an IMDb user, it was put there by the fine people at IMDb.The reason I gave this "movie" 2 stars was for the following: ---The scenes were WAY to predictable. I mean you got the "Turn Around! Turn Around!" scene, which is dead, it was killed about 3 years ago. Then, there's the plain stupidity of some of the characters AND writers. ---The animated voice saying that it's an emergency, and Donna goes and gets a scarf out of her room. There could've been a fire. ---And what's with the pigeons in the hotel? I understand if you wanna get a good jump out of the audience, writers, but seriously, and I understand it's under construction, but it's inside, how'd they get in, and why aren't they anywhere else? ---The variety of killings were VERY slim and very uncreative. ---The killing of the bellboy was completely unnecessary. He could've just said that he hasn't seen the maid. ---Why would Donna go to the bathroom after she just had a dream about being killed in one? ---Why the hell would Lisa go up into the suite minutes before they announce king and queen, when SHE'S nominated?!Then the final, and biggest reason why this movie disgusted me, was because there was NO twist. I was totally expecting a twist, especially when they took a movie with such a great one. But, no, it was to difficult for the writers to come up with one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This made me long for House of Wax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie... well I had mediocre hopes for it. I thought okay another slasher film with people getting murdered but hey that can be kind of fun. This was not. It starts out really slowly and the atmosphere isn't even all good that then turns to bad it begins in a kind of half-good/ half-bad kind of limbo where you're not really sure if you should feel on edge or relaxed.... anyway the back story is skimmed over and I'm pretty sure they mention how the killer escaped once- briefly... it didn't make much sense to me- you'd think they'd build maximum security asylums to keep people in and that when someone escaped it wouldn't be such a ho-hum affair as these people lead you to believe it is. I'd certainly be worried if in real life it was treated so casually.Anyway they get to the prom and the horror begins. Death after meaningless death ensues and each one again is taken very causally by the film and suspense isn't really built unless there's some action surrounding Brittany Snow. My main problem with this film is that the killer goes for those separated from the others but it's all too easy. Some of them leave each other when in all honesty they wouldn't if it were real life. Oh and no one thinks to grab a weapon. I'm sorry but if I had a stalker- let alone one that tried to kill me before I'd be sleeping with some form of weapon, even a taser or machete or gun... ANYTHING... and yet no one the entire movie- bar the police have weapons of any description... there's an entire scene set in a construction site... COMMON! *ahem* anyway the film ends abruptly like most of the deaths/ character development.... and it makes me miss House of Wax... at least in that I had Chad Michael Murray to look at...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Will Want To CRY Instead Of Being Scared,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came back from the movies from watching 'Prom Night' on Friday.This film came out okay. It could of done better. The actors were great, it was just the story. I found this movie depressing, like if you would want to cry towards the middle or the end.Why? Because it the same thing happening over and over again. BORING.The movie is practically about a teacher highly obsessed with Donna Keppel(Brittany Snow) and would do ANYTHING to get to her at her Prom in a hotel. The teacher is very smart, in the movie so I liked that about the movie. I though this movie was stupid, I would give it a 1 star but I gave it 2 for the effort.I want my $10 dollars back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was some parts that were jumpy and kind of scary. the murderer's face will haunt you. but no i wouldn't call it horrible. i liked it, i just wouldn't BUY it. its fun to go see with a couple friends and make comments about the movie. sure there are parts that were kinda stupid... but if you are 13 you would consider it scary. for people like me (im 21) and have seen a lot of scary movies, you would consider this movie more like and action thriller. my advice, watch it for fun but it's not worth $20 to buy. i thought it was funny in the theater that people were jumping and screaming, but i didn't jump because the background music let you know if something was going to jump out, so i kind of expected it. overall, i would give it a 5 out of 10 oh, and the story line Was pretty good, it wasn't totally stupid... until prom night then the story line headed for stupid but ended great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Really Good, but OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My expectations were not high as I went into this film. And that was a good thing because had they been I would have been severely disappointed. This is your average run of the mill horror film. Just about every single horror cliché is thrown in here. Including the old shut the mirror and there's someone behind her thing. which has to have been done at least ten times in this movie. It was also horrible predictable, every plot point can be seen from fifty miles away.Even with all of those flaws it is an OK movie. Our main character (Donna) is at her senior prom, when her crazy-obsessed ex-teacher escapes from the mental hospital and then proceeds to kill anyone in his way. There is a lot of killing in here yet, to my disappointment, virtually no blood or gore.If you have absolutely no other way to spend your weekend, and your in the mood for a scary flick, and you haven't already seen the ruins, then go ahead and check this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers for Prom Night (1980,2008), Halloween (1978), and The Silence of the Lambs (1991).Prom Night is the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie has essentially no plot. (It is also rips off Halloween and The Silence of the Lambs in some scenes (ending) (When the bellboy Simms, died). (Which isn't surprising considering such a masterpiece both of those movies are, when this one is just C rap.) Many may say the the picture looks nice, but since this is suppose to be a scary movie (yeah...if you're like three), shouldn't it look a bit rougher? I can sum up my hatred in two words: NO SUSPENSE, (you could obviously tell when someone is going to die, (with a pocketknife), unlike the original which had a great plot, and was at least entertaining (the ONLY drawback was how dark it is, in my opinion). 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this recently on DVD and though yeah it was an OK movie. When I thought about it, I could have made it so much different.Sorry there are spoilers.1, I would have taken out the back story completely. I wouldn't have shown her family being murdered as this give away the rest of the film.2, I would have upped the character development, explained a few more things and made it less obvious who the lead was. Put in a bit more with the Blonde in the black dress - made her a say a indirect accomplice or even made her into more of a bitch than she was.3, When the killer is at the hotel, I would have made it so he had an infatuation with more than one of the girls and you never know which was the primary target. 4, I would have put in where one of the others got killed, the leading lady would find him/her and they say who the killer is and then the back story revealed.Thats what I would have done different. All in all, its a good film to watch and definitely on the wet Sunday afternoon list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two different plots in one film. Could've worked... Results are poor overall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let's get things straight: This is not a remake of the early 80's cult classic. The thing is like this: Some producers bought the rights for the original slasher and changed everything about it! The plot, characters, gore, etc. Instead, they decided it was "Hip" to have a killer inside a prom night, so they came up with a horror movie idea that could use the title literally. The "Prom Night" remake could be watched as a movie divided in two parts: 1) The very lame killing spree started by a wacko in a prom night dancing. 2) The detective and his team chasing the killer inside the hotel and Brittany Snow's home.So I can say that we have two leading characters: Britanny Snow's traumatized character and the Detective. The whole idea is not bad at all but it's poorly executed. This movie feels like the "When A Stranger Calls" remake mainly because of the watered down killings, absent rough situations like language, sex, and even sub-plots. So we have a movie dedicated for dumb teens who will consume anything that's Horror in a light manner.Heck, it even copies cynically "Halloween" (1978) and doesn't even feel guilty about it. For example, when Snow's character watches through the mirror and watches the killer standing, or when she hides in her closet, or what about the demise? When the Detective saves the day and shoots him.The plot is similar to any slasher from the 80's but sadly it doesn't live up the expectations. Some situations were extremely lame while trying to create an intelligent horror movie. For example, what was the deal with the black guy getting worried and later identifying his dead girlfriend? I mean, what was the purpose of having him crying if his character was irrelevant? What was the point of having the typical blonde bitch being mean with our heroine and friends? It was pointless I mean she wasn't even killed, come on!The soundtrack is terrible. It's just a mix of teeny emo songs and some dance tracks. I kind of enjoyed the whole Detective chasing the killer situation that pretty much reminded me of the original "When A Stranger Calls" and it's sequel. Brittany Snow is very pretty and it's good to see her. She's candy for the eye and her performance comes up pretty well. She carries the movie on her back. Jonathan Sschaech (sp?) is a very good actor and delivers a menacing performance. The Detective played by Idris something stole the show and I want to see more from him in some genre movies. The direction is pretty good and the edition is really great. The production values are elegant but sadly, that isn't enough to make a competent movie. Just give this movie a chance if: 1) You're a teenager 2) You are a die hard horror gorehound like me and will consume everything that deals with the genre.The ending felt pretty rushed up. I mean, there were many sub-plots that didn't receive any attention or resolution! It just ends abruptly.This is an incomplete new wave Horror movie. Lame excuse for film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was quite skeptical or cynical for watching this movie spending my couple of hours on a teen slasher movie which was more likely to make me feel regrets of having wasted my time.Anyway I spent my rainy day movie hours watching this insanely and dumbly acted and directed movie of no plot sequence taking people nowhere but being more and more dubious of the easily anticipated ending . The movie starts with the killings of a family of a young girl named Donna who later rakes up most of the attention of this poor movie . The killer is a deranged highschool teacher obsessed with this half chubby girl Donna and he finds his way to escape from the prison where is sentenced . He is even shown how he manages to flee from the prison and ends up at the hotel of the prom Donna attends with her friends. The cop who was into the investigation of the case is alerted of this prisoner's running away from the clutch of the authorities and he throws the fit of a kid and rushes to the house of Donna and he sees his family and tells them the escape of the killer .He later goes to the hotel where Donna is celebrating her prom and the poor storyline takes up most of the attention . 1- The cop never asks the hotel of the surveillance cameras which are most likely used by the hotel . 2- the janitor is killed and her whereabouts is found by another janitor who is also killed right after he has seen the female janitor's dead body . 3- there are no floor cameras the cop wonders to ask to the receptionist.I can count more incoherence but i am really not going to waste anyone's time reading these clichés. This movie is just a crock of crap . Instead of spending couple of hours watching this wannabe and making no sense but flipping yourself out on this movie better to stay away from it.Evren Buyruk</fullReview>

I wanted to pick up an axe myself and decapitate them all. From the nauseatingly Saccharin sweet lead female, Donna, to the most unconvincing psychopath I have ever seen in a movie (he just wasn't scary)each and every one of them would have been better use in High School Musical 6 or whatever.There were so many stupid and implausible story lines at work here, but here are the BIG THREE.1. If a whole hotel had just been evacuated because of a psychopathic killer on the loose, and you needed to ensure that you were safe.. WHY would you go home? Wouldn't she have been safer at the police station? 2. Upon getting home..why would you at first go upstairs and not stick together in one room? Furthermore why would the whole family then decide to turn in for the night? I think you would be sitting up, each armed with a bread-knife! 3. When he was trying to find her in the hotel suite, why did the killer not look for Donna under the bed immediately? I would have thought that this would be the first place that he would have tried CONSIDERING he had already stashed a body under one of the beds!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zero Stars (out of 4) By Aaron Dumont There are and will always be mind-numbing, fatuous thrillers that come, rob a significant stash of money from sadly unsuspecting citizens and scat into obscurity. These movies suffer from: 1. By-the-numbers plot 2. Flat, ugly thrills and stale (if laughable) chills 3. Turgid, rancid dialogue And et cetera. They are mostly regurgitated in January.However, Prom Night (committed and schemed by Nelson McCormick) was something that I thought couldn't be achieved with idiotic thrillers. Technically, all of them are excruciating and among the worst released in quite a while, but it takes true soul, passion and heart to achieve the level of inhumanity this film has wallowed itself in. Prom Night was not just a crime, it was...unholy.It's desecrating. In fact, now that I think of it, I may have changed my mind about all those absurd, uninspired blockbuster-thrill fare garbage that I described earlier. They are all horrid, true, but forgettable - they disgust you, but they easily leave your then-tainted imagination within a few hours' time. They are the cinematic equivalent of that troubled kid in your grade 5 class who ate juicy insects in anticipation of getting not four, but five quarters from his classmates and other young spectators. By contrast, Prom Night is the cinematic equivalent of being attacked by a group of deranged child molesters. You are not only disgusted, but their presence grows on you well after the initial encounter. How could I let this happen/rent the movie? Why didn't I fight back/turn off the TV? What kind of people would conspire to commit such a crime/direct this type of movie? The film follows several high school students - all of them 2D pretty girls and jocks - being chased by a rampant, murdering, masked Jonathan Schaech. That was how far I got into the film. I walked out after 40 minutes. From then on, you're on your own. Good luck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming, yet all too profitable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone bored with mediocre horror films had better get used to them. Even this film made some good money. With its PG-13 rating, and millions of parents looking to get their teens out of the house for a couple hours, this film couldn't miss. Thank goodness I saw this film at home and not in the company of a hundred or so teenagers in a theater...I guess this is a remake of an old Jamie Lee Curtis film from the early 1980s. Oddly enough, I've seen just about all of those old horror films a million times each, yet I don't recall seeing that one. Hard to imagine it was any worse. The story here deals with a deranged former teacher breaking out of prison to murder a teen on her senior prom night. It seems he killed her whole family 3 years earlier in some bizarre effort to win her over. Honestly dude, I don't think that was the best way to go! The girl is played by the fetching Brittany Snow who may or may not have a decent career ahead of her. I liked her performance, actually. She and her classmates are having their prom at a swanky hotel in the Portland area. One thing that struck me is the supposedly most bitchy (think Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls minus the talent) girl in school had her dad pay thousands of dollars for the whole thing. Apparently in an attempt to get the prom queen crown rapped up for his daughter. Anyway, that would be a hell of a generous gesture for anyone to do for a senior class. Yet the protagonist kids still rip on her at every chance.The killer in the film is played by Jonathon Schaech, a man whose career once looked brighter than it now does. Recall him as Jimmy from That Thing You Do? He was the arrogant band leader and boyfriend of Liv Tyler. He dated Christina Applegate in real life for years. Any way, in the opening scenes of this film he is a dead ringer for one of those Geico cavemen. Later on, once he's broken out of prison and killing the teenagers, he has cleaned up a bit. Only now, he's a dead ringer for Billy Bob Thornton whenever he wears a baseball cap!! You have to see it to believe both resemblances! The kids and hotel staff are picked off in a series of predictable and not the least bit gory scenes. Really nothing scary about the film, you just might have a bit more trouble than usual predicting who lives or dies.Some random observations...... Did I hear a product plug for Midol?? Do most maids clean rooms during prime time hours? There are at least two early scenes where our killer finally has the girl of his dreams all alone in the suite and does NOTHING with her!! Uh huh. He's been obsessing for how long? How many films have we now seen the dead detective in the car outside on the stakeout? Let's see.... Black Christmas, Tightrope,... help me out here, people. It's only one of the oldest clichés ever. Watch if you must. I had to, because like the dirty older guys in the elevator, I find high school girls delicious! 5 of 10 stars.The Hound</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with Prom Night is the same problem that so many remakes have. Relevance (or lack thereof). They're so busy trying to keep you distracted from the lack of a sensible plot that between jump scenes (albeit well done ones, at times), they forget to tie things in. Random bits of plot are thrown in to keep you from wondering what exactly the point of the movie is, or what it's even trying to say, or why you care are all. There were a dozen times during the movie where, had the director not been afraid to push a little further, he could have done something that wasn't so ... well, predictable. Maybe, in the future, McCormick should stick to directing TV shows.You have to feel bad for Brittany Snow who tried her best, but clearly wasn't given too much to work with. Then again J.S. Cardone did write The Forsaken and Wicked Little Things; both similar to the remake of Prom Night in that the plot didn't push where it should have, or pull back where it should have. Good original concepts, but without that edge they became just a few more dime-a-dozen, poorly executed movies with decent make up effects (or CGI, as the case may be).I will give the movie a few points for the few properly executed jump-shots (even though I have to take said points away for the many many painfully obvious and predictable ones) and for the good filming. Also, props to Johnathon Schaech for his creepy intensity (but then again he was also one of the few saving graces in The Forsaken).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There should be no shred of humor in what I am about to say: reading the plot description on Wikipedia will give you more chills than the actual viewing of the film. That's what I couldn't help but ponder halfway through 'Prom Night', a poor excuse for a movie that is supposed to instill fear into the viewer. Instead, it instills boredom, disdain, and sheer anger that time and possibly money were spent watching this garbage.While the premise of 'Prom Night' is not the formula for a masterpiece, it actually had the potential to be somewhat scary and even a decent movie. A teacher becomes obsessed with a female student, murders her family, gets locked away, and escapes years later to return to terrorize her on her prom night. Unfortunately, the director, screenwriters, and actors appeared to make it their mission to throw away any hope of making something memorable. The killer is not menacing, the scares are poorly built up, and the actors are too bored to put in any effort.'Prom Night' is, to put it plainly, a mess. It's predictable, implausible, clichéd, and mind-numbingly dumb. This is the horror genre at its worst, and, for that matter, American cinema at its worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a review written as the film is being watched. . .- Update at 5 minutes - This is one mighty long opening credit sequence seeing as the whole movie is only 88 minutes (I think I would actually rather re-watch 88 Minutes than this sadly). Opening scene wasn't awful though.- Update at 15 minutes - Well, there have been a couple pretty violent kills (The mama and the maid), but where the hell's the blood? I know this is PG-13 and directed by crap TV director Nelson McCormick, but c'mon. . . give us at least a little something other than a few moderately-attractive-from-the-right-angles teenage girls.- Update at 28 minutes - I really hope there's some kind of twist at some point. I don't care what it is. I don't care if it they make the killer the reanimated corpse of Richard M. Nixon, but I just need something so that this total lack of suspense and mystery actually means something.- Update at 34 minutes - Alright, it's been a few years since my HS prom, but c'mon. . . when did dancing turn that BAD?! It's embarrassing to watch when a group of kids this young can't dance for shlt at their prom. Man. And was one kid wearing jeans? What the hell? - Update at 44 minutes - Halfway through and I'm beginning to realize that this film does just about everything wrong. Really. Every fault a slasher can have is obvious here. I couldn't care less about these stupidly hollow characters. There is no mystery of the killer. There are no scares or suspense. And, halfway through the film the "final girl" doesn't even know what's going on. How can you expect to feel the reverberation of fear from the main characters if none of them know what's going on? The moment anyone does, they're bloodlessly hacked up in a hotel room. It's a huge flaw that essentially ruins any chance of this flick rising above even mediocre.- Update at 56 minutes - AH! Blood! Not a lot, but it was the first spurt we've seen all movie! Congratulations! Almost as thrilling as winning prom queen. - Update at 61 minutes - AH! Lamp! Even more terrifying than blood! Man, I've been waiting for a scene that terrifying my whole life. I'm not sure how I made it through. I need a rest now.- Update at 63 minutes - Okay. . . I'm not a girl, that's clear. But, I've been to dances and balls and other fancy events. . . and I don't think I've ever seen a girl leave her clutch/purse behind. This is now the, what, 3rd time these girls have had to go up to the third floor in order to get something out of their purses. The reason you get a clutch (girlspeak for 'little purse') is so you can hold it (or CLUTCH it) without it being too cumbersome. That means you can sit it on the table when you're dancing. Note to writer: Find a different reason to get these kids alone, please.- Update at 66 minutes - Well, at least our Final Girl finally knows what's going on with her. That's a plus, right? Maybe it'll finally give us a bit of suspense with a whopping 15 minutes left in the movie.- Update at 74 minutes - I do actually like the performance of this detective (Idris Elba), and I'd like to see him do more.- Update at 80 minutes - Ooh! Exciting music! I think that means I'm supposed to be thrilled! I am ready for some suspense. Finally.- Update at 84 minutes - Well, they tried to give us a little thrill with that closet scene, but really, I'm just shaking my head in stupidity. He's holding your mouth: You can still make noise or kick the door open or something. Jesus. What is wrong with this writer? But, who wants to guess that there's going to be some cool last scare? I bet you it'll make me jump! - Update at 86 minutes - I was right! There was one final scare: More of that awful, awful dancing! Ugh. . . thankfully this garbage is over.Final Verdict: 2.75/10 -AP3-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing worse that Hollywood stealing foreign films and remaking them with dumb cable stars (WB, Fox, CW), is Hollywood stealing ideas from slasher films and presenting the same so-called stars in a film that has to be the worst film of the year.Yes, I know, it didn't get a Razzie nomination, but that was only because the category of Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel had some many more deserving nominees.What really galls me is the Unrated version of this film. Adult content, according to raters, but, at the same time, considered appropriate for 15+. Since when is 15 the age of consent. Are 15-year-olds adults? Can they consent to sex, buy booze or smokes? You know the answer. This is commercial ripoff in the highest form.Now there were supposed to be 13 murders in this film. I saw five. I must have slept through the rest of them. The five I saw - not one drop of blood. Language? "Bitch" was the strongest word I heard.Bottom line. A five years old can watch this and the only scare they are going to get is some teen girl screaming. Pathetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst thing since Day of the Dead (it's PG13, what do you expect?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with what everyone else has said.what I don't get is how an escaped psycho who was locked up for 2 years managed to get enough money to book a room in a flash as hotel?! Wouldn't the maximum security hospital still have his possessions? e.g. wallet and clothes he came with? Also, how stupid is Brittany Snow?! When the black guy (forgot his name) said "Lisa said she's coming down here to tell you.." She RUDELY interrupts him with "Oh she might have gone to the toilet" &lt;-- WTF?! if someone tells you that someone is coming to tell you something do you just randomly assume that they went to the bathroom?? Apparently Lisa is supposed to be on her way to the ballroom but somehow Brittany Snow, the genius that she is, thought to look in the bathroom.I find it funny how the not-scary-at-all killer managed to hoist the waiter's body up into the tiny vent without the help of a ladder. Was the killer just abnormally tall and strong? Even if he used a chair, the waiter was about the same size as he was and it would have been difficult.If your door is getting bashed by a psycho killer wouldn't you run away? Brittany Snow just stood there while the killer was bashing the door. There were two other doors there that lead to the adjoining room, but she just stood there like a dumb-ass waiting for him to bust through and decided at the last minute to run away.Wasn't the young detective informed of the seriousness of the situation? When he was asked to go inside and check the family he questions his superior, arguing that every thing appears to be under control. When he finally decides to follow orders he just lazily shines the light on the house instead of going in to investigate. Serves him right to die.don't bother even downloading or renting this piece of crap you'll never get the two hours of your life back. Taking a dump would be more satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointment on Many Levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sorry, but I wanted to enjoy this movie but by the end I was sad. The trailer made this movie look like a decent slasher flick but when the plot goes nowhere and the characters barely develop you get this piece of garbage! DO NOT waste your time on this film! I could of made a movie with a better plot.I mean you keep getting this dream sequences which confused me because I did not realize if we are in the dream or in real life! This is how it all goes down, two people go up to a hotel room and are killed the next couple goes to look for them (dead), the next couple and so on and so forth.And the killer is some teacher who loves Brittany Snow SO much that he killed her parents and all her friends and a maid! Wow all that for her??? Well Brittany isn't that bad ;) The acting is not very good, but again this movie was made with a bunch of nobody's, sorry but I did not recognize anyone in this movie except my friend who said "isn't that girl from Hairspray?".Overall I disliked this movie a bunch (can you tell???). I hope this review keeps you from viewing and wasting your money on this trash!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Brittany Snow, she was perfect in that TV show "American Dreams." And she actually isn't too bad here as Donna Keppel who has periodic nightmares that a murder has returned for her.But the writers and director have not given her much to work with here.This movie deserves its low rating. Donna and her high school friends are going to prom, and while they are there the local police chief gets a fax that the murderer of her family has broken out of prison. Seems he was convicted but judged mentally incompetent so instead of being executed was confined to a high security mental ward. But he broke free 3 days earlier and they are just notifying the local community.Much of the movie takes place at the hotel where the prom is being held. Naturally several of the students make off to rooms where they are murdered. The bad guy is really after Donna and almost gets her, but the police arrive just in time.Donna is taken back home with her aunt and uncle, with police guard posted outside. But the murderer is much like Batman, now you see him then you don't. He is very slippery. There isn't a very good story here, and it isn't very thrilling.SPOILERS: At the home two different cops are murdered. The bad guy gets into Donna's closet and has her in his grasp. She bites him hard, he yells and she escapes, but he grabs her ankle and trips her up. Just as he is raising his knife, the police chief comes in and shoots him. Then shoots him two more times. He falls dead right next to Donna as she rolls over just in time to avoid his body.</fullReview>

At least show a little bit of effort with the production value or something. These movies look like they've been shot using someone's credit card. Who's stealing all the money from the budgets? There's no bignames in it so where is the money going and what the hell is Ming-Na doing in such a P.O.S.!This movie might be the worst so far. It's so full of cliché's and so horribly produced (i.e. no value) that I couldn't even bare to finish it. Maybe it's my fault for not researching who was involved. But at least I only paid $1.00. Where do I write Mr. Forby to get that buck back?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the original coming from the legendary era of horror the 80,s. The re-make was obviously not gonna reach the expectations of true horror fans but for the teenagers of today like myself it's a no- brainer. To put simply it gives you the eye candy ; Brittany Snow , the simple plot , the stereotypical characters and the obvious ending. Despite all the bad reviews about this film however it did make a lot in the box office just showing that the movie watching generation like the " Non - Brainer Films ". If your in the mood to sit back with your teenage Bf / Gf and make out during it without worrying your going to be behind then this is the film for you. If your a true horror fan steer clear this film otherwise i'll be expecting a bad review from you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a horror film fan, I have seen some bad films in my time, and there is a certain guilty pleasure in truly bad horror films. However, this was truly dreadful by any standards. The acting was horrible - and this by horror film standards - the plot did not exist, the dialogue was excruciatingly terrible, and I would burn all the copies if I could to prevent anyone from having to suffer through such an atrocity. The characters were so irritating, it was a pleasure (well somewhat) to see them killed, and the thrills were non-existent. Do not waste your money, do not encourage more pointless remakes, and do not try to justify the existence of such a truly dreadful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, they've done it. Those who are in Hollywood have actually made one of the worst films I've ever watched in my life. Okay, wrong. One of the worst remakes I've ever watched. Basically, this film is a slasher about a group of friends who get killed one by one at the Prom. No twists, no surprises, no amazing murders. Just... that. The original, starring Jamie Lee Curtis, was about a group of friends who had done a crime and began to die, one by one. But it had twists and suspenseful moments. This one didn't. This one was one of the worst films of the year. Of course, there were no amazing acting jobs in the film. Some people were even more dull in this film then they were in others. It was pretty irking to watch this film without shuddering from the thought of people thinking that it was nice, but it was watched and now, I know that I never want to see a film like this ever again. Not unless it comes with an R rating and a lot more suspense, gore, twists, acting, etc...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the acting was reasonable, and the plot was something to look at, this movie is not worth seeing whether in theaters or on DVD. My friend had loaned it to me one weekend, and even though she had warned me how bad it was, I ignored her and went onto watching it. Boy was she right... To me, this 'horror' flick turned out to be a crappy teenage movie, something 14-year-olds would watch with their boyfriends on a Friday night. The style itself reminded me too much of movies like "My Life as a Teenaged Drama Queen" or "Bring it On", and in my opinion horror movies shouldn't even be near that genre. If I were anybody, I'd stick with "The Exorcist" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". At least those provided good scares.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, first of all, I never made a comment on IMDb before. I personally decided to register to make a comment on this movie. I mean, I use this site a lot to find info on a lot of movies, and was never irked as much to make a comment on this site. However, when I read the comments by a few people who say; hmm, probably 95% of comments on this movie is wrong and maybe the movie wasn't made for them, is complete BS, and you know what that means. Any person who defends this movie and actually says it is a good, OK, or even bearable movie should never be allowed to comment on movies again. I saw the trailer to this movie and I was like it looks horrible and trailers are the best parts so I know it is awful. Would have never watched this movie, but my new roommate actually rented it and we had just moved in the apt. and had only one TV with no cable at the time. She was wanting to see it; she likes cheesy horror movies as well as good ones,but she can not tell either one apart. So, to be a good new roommate, I decided to watch it with her. I figured that I would just bear it and see if there are any good horror jump scenes or just great bizarre scenes. Man, I should have just been plain mean that day to my roommate and saved an hour and a half of my life, cause the only horror to this film is actually sitting down through the whole film. This movie is so clichéd it does not even let you remotely guess wrong. You will actually fall asleep because you know what is going to happen. My poor roommate guessed everything right, and she believes that is what you are suppose to do in a good film, poor poor girl. Plot, can you say I need to make money so lets make a film to make quick money, just long enough to fool people into thinking this is going to be a good remake plot. Cause that is exactly what I was thinking, and I am sure the people responsible for making this crap was too. Suspense, thriller, blood gushing, or any startling scenes, you better not expect that if you come see this horror movie. If you do, well you should have listened to me. For people who are frightened at horror movies and think this might actually be a movie for you to enjoy because it is not scary, I hope you do not plan on taking a quick nap after the movie, because I can ensure you will want to go to sleep during the movie if you are not sleeping to hold off for that nap later on. NO entertainment purposes associated with this movie whatsoever.Please bear this warning and save yourself from a horror of a movie. Unless you are like my roommate and can not tell from a bad horror movie from a good one. Or like some of these people on here and can't just tell from a bad movie period. I mean I have seen some bad movies in the past, however this has to be in my top worst five. I mean Charles Barkely would not put this movie in his fav five for money endorsement. Just ignore the 5% percent on here who says that this movie is even bearable to watch and just stare at your TV while it is off for an hour and a half. I guarantee you will get more out of that than this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, this movie was nearly unwatchable. My biggest problem with this movie was just how absolutely atrocious the script was. The "scare" moments were laughably predictable. To be fair, I have no problem with any of the actors. Nearly all them were more than serviceable and I honestly had no problem believing any of them were teenagers enjoying their senior prom. I can't understate this enough... The acting and dialogue were pretty darn good. The strength of the performances were enough to lift this movie from a 1/10 to a 3/10 for me, but everything else about this movie just fails so miserably. All of the dramatic set up and so-called "tension" was forced and poorly constructed and it ruined any chance this movie had for working. I counted 3 occasions in which supposedly dead bodies suddenly became animated and just fell out of places. Is this thing a zombie flick? I understand the limitations that a PG-13 rating forces upon a movie, hence the liberal use of the cheap scare tactics, but that was the least of this movie's problems... It felt less like a PG-13 movie and more like a 13 year old wrote it.</fullReview>

No Thrills, No Gore, No T&amp;A, no 15 chase scene with the villain and heroine, no plot... and the Killer. For Petes sake wear a mask. Groucho Marx, Willam Shatner, even a black ski mask would have been better than a baseball cap.The supporting actors are just written in for the sheer sake of dying. Pretty boys and girls with their pretty shallow Beverly hills lives. For that alone they deserved to die. If this movie was geared towards teenagers, then I'm glad I was one in the 80's. At least my horror movies were scary.best part of the movie were the end credits where the song Paralyzed was played. Exactly how I felt after watching this wannabe horror flick.Please,no more hacking and slashing of our precious horror classics. There is just no way a remake can surpass the original. Unless the original was a flop to begin with. Now if this gets a make over in say, 20 years, it will surely be better.LOL! Final thoughts: This would have been better suited for television on say ...the WC network. I actually saw one of the actresses on the premier last night of 90210 and on the WC network.LOL!</fullReview>

You find out who the killer is within the first two minutes of the movie. The kills were all bland, repetitive and gore-free. I honestly question if the director had ever seen a decent horror movie, because he has no skill at setting up scenes or payoff. The cast is annoying and you root for their deaths just to stop the horrific acting. And the script? What little their was of it was riddled with cheesy dialogue and sadly predictable events. Kids separate. Kids die. That about sums it up. Why did they bother acquiring the rights to a remake if this version has absolutely nothing to do with the original? Avoid at all costs.

		<shortDescription>Average mild scary movie suited to teen viewers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an average "MILD" suspense/thriller/horror movie suited to a younger- maybe teenage audience - that being said, Im 35, and I still found it enjoyable to some degree! In my opinion - comparable to "Scream" or "A stranger is calling" to give you a general guide.There were no big surprises, no major twists etc. so maybe a bit predictable...but still - it had those slow moving "please don't open the door...and please don't go up the stairs.." kinda scenes where the victim is alone and the predator is stalking them- as predictable as they are, I always like a little fun nonsense type suspense. I always get a bit edgy even if I have a good idea of whats going to happen - as knowing whats going to happen - and watching someone about to get pounced on is a small thrill, and puts you on edge. But I guess if you are more into "hardcore" hair raising type fear, then this one most likely isn't for you.I tended to think that maybe they started the story from the wrong point - that is - it was like a 'second' film in a set rather than a first - and it seemed to me that the historical/background plot may have made for a better film than the ACTUAL plot (you won't understand what I mean unless you've seen it) - As far as the acting went - it was a bit average, though I thought the predator was psycho enough...at any rate.. In a nutshell - the parental level ( M )15+ (that's in Australia) gives you a fair indication of its intensity - NOT an adults only type flick really - and with a name like "Prom Night" - lets face it - you wouldn't expect a masterpiece- and it wont have a cult following like CARRIE or anything - but it was OK, and worth a look, especially if you are a little on the younger side.(My 14 yo daughter and her friends LOVED it!I must shamefully admit that I double checked the doors were locked before I went to bed;) but i get chicken way too easily!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Subject: Boring Movie 101. Prom night is a night most high school seniors never forget. Maybe this time it is regret. You get yourself set for another teen slasher flick and you get nothing that resembles what you may have had in mind. No over-used foul language; no obligatory brutal violence; absence of nearly nude babes...to be exact no knockout beauties here, sorry; no sex; no real frightening slasher, stabber, killer; and to be exact its a predictable bore the likes of something made for the Lifetime Network.Donna Keppel(Brittany Snow), an attractive enough teen is anxiously looking forward to prom night. She is haunted with the visions of watching her mother being killed by her former teacher and stalker Mr. Fenton(Johnathon Schaech). The limo arrives full of friends excited about "make out" night. The prom takes place in a swanky hotel set up by the class snob and hopeful prom queen Crissy(Brianne Davis). Escaping from the prison for criminally insane is the obsessed teacher seeking his prey...the off her medication Donna. He makes it to the prom for... oh what a night.Also in the cast: Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, Dana Davis and Idris Elba. Something that is impressive is a couple of songs from the soundtrack: "Time of The Season" by The Ben Taylor Band and "Paralyzed" by Rock Kills Kid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking at this movie and what it represents as a whole, it is in some ways supposed to be a remake.It does reference a number of horror films that have come and gone, but it especially seems to take off from the original Halloween film that featured Michael Myers. In this day in age, it would be hard to have total originality in a horror film because of the history of horror movies.This movie strays from the plot of the original Prom Night, which featured Halloween star, Jamie Lee Curtis. Brittany Snow has made her mark in Hollywood, but on a different scale of acting.The film follows all the criteria that is needed for a B horror movie, however you are sensitized by stronger characterizations of having more than one dimension to the others on the screen. For the setting the plot has, it is necessary and may even suggests that the film could have been longer to further develop Donna and her friends.Overall, it isn't the worst horror movie, or the best. Films like these quite often are underrated on IMDb and don't get the attention that they are screaming for. If you like a good thrill, take my advice and see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lot Better Than The Bad Reviews State</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the review of the Unrated Version and contains some spoilers.Plot: Three years after her entire family was murdered at the hands of her obsessed teacher Donna is now in her senior year of high school. Prom rolls around the corner and so does the news that the homicidal teacher with a never ending obsession for Donna has escaped from prison. Will Donna and her friends be able to survive Prom Night? PG-13 horror gets dumped on all the time (One Missed Call, The Fog, the upcoming The Stepfather remake, etc.) and this is no exception. Critics are never kind to the genre of teens getting sliced and diced, but horror fans (most, myself not included) weren't praising this one either. Once again I think people are wrong about this (as was the case with The Ring Two and Flightplan). It's not the new horror classic and it does have some faults, but it's not as bad as most of the people on here say it is.The best part of the movie is the radiant and likable cast. Brittany Snow (The Pacifier, John Tucker Must Die) as Donna exudes a warm and likable demeanor and you root for her in the final showdown. Johnathon Schaech proves that you don't need a mask to make a villain scary. He plays the obsessed teacher role to the hilt and you get chills from watching the brutality of his actions. One other character worth mentioning is Lisa played by Dana Davis (TV's Heroes). Ever since her short, but note worthy stint on Heroes I have always liked her. She comes across very real and is almost more likable than Donna, our heroine. The rest of the cast performs as well as they can and nobody embarrasses themselves.Another big plus that the movie has is that it's unpredictable. The cops aren't bone headed idiots and actually do everything that is required of them. They intervene in the face of danger, get Donna under protection, and comb the hotel doing their job. This also ties into the wonderful mixing of genres that is going on in here. On the surface it's a glitzy teen slasher, but it's also a cop thriller with a little teen drama thrown in the pot. Finally, there is some decent suspense and tension running throughout the picture. The hotel setting helps stage some truly great scenes and the chase through the construction area was an edge-of-your-seat experience.But every movie has faults and this one's show a bit more. Reviewers we right that the PG-13 rating did foul this movie up. The killings are pretty dry and even in the Unrated version it still is pretty tame. The only death that has a notable difference is not even a kill itself. It's the discovery of Lisa's body that was eliminated from the theatrical version. In the theatrical version when the police find her body you don't witness it, but the Unrated Version shows her dead body with a very bloody slit throat.The ending in Donna's house wasn't that good either and seemed rushed and anti-climatic. There was also a chance for a bigger body count, but that wasn't played out to its full potential and the movie could've had more scenes of the teacher stalking Donna in the hotel instead of rushing everything to get to the sub par ending.Overall I liked this movie and plan on buying it. It entertained me and kept me glued to the screen for ninety minutes and wasn't a boring time. The bad reviews are off on this one, because it is definitely worth picking up and checking out.P.S. This is NOT a remake of the 1980 slasher movie Prom Night</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnas senior prom is supposed to be the best night of her life, one of magic, beauty, and love. Surrounded by her best friends, she should be safe from the horrors of her past. But when the night turns from magic to murder there is only one man who could be responsible, the man she thought was gone forever. Now, Donna and her friends must find a way to escape the sadistic rampage of an obsessed killer, and survive their Prom Night.Forget about what you've heard about this movie. Forget about the critics panning this film. Forget all of that. This movie isn't bad as people said it was. When horror fans think "slasher" and "PG-13," they assume it won't mix well, because the base formula for a slasher is blood, guts, and gore. Unfortunately, since this movie is PG-13, it has barely any of that.Now here comes the catcher: This movie relies more on suspense, a brooding, ominous atmosphere, and sound effects to scare the audience, which, more or less works. The bad thing is that there are some clichés. The good thing is it's different from everyday slashers. Like I said, barely any blood is spilled in here.If you don't like the sound of that, well, skip this movie. It isn't for you. Yes, the clichés are still there, like some big "WTF" moments pop out in the middle of some scenes because of some characters' stupid moves. Other "WTF" moments, in my opinion, is the unusually high body count, which is ten or more. I found some kills very unnecessary but I guess it was to please the gore hounds out there, which obviously didn't work. I was also disappointed in the end.Apart from those flaws, the film stands up pretty well. I appreciate that the film was trying to do something new. I love the use of sound here, and if you know me, I usually don't praise horror movies for their sound effects. The use of sound makes this movie more suspenseful and gives it a more dark tone. I also love the way the kills were shot. It was different and unique.I also liked the fact the filmmakers decided to show the killer's face within five minutes into the movie. Judging from the trailer, you would think they'll show it in the end but you're wrong. The performances were good. I also felt some sympathy for the characters, which is also another high point in the movie.Overall, the way this film was shot, the use of sound, and some other magical elements in this film, like the young, unknown cast, gave the film some life. The film is not perfect in any way but I liked that it was trying to be different, and although it may have failed with many viewers, whom weren't likely the target demographic in the first place, I appreciated that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be the blandest, most pointless "slasher" film I have ever seen. It takes all that is good about the genre and discards it just making do with tired old clichés and paper thin characters. I guess in theory the actual premise behind the story held water but it is used only as a device to explain the story instead of being integral to it. However the worst is yet to come, this SLASHER film is PG-13. Somebody, somewhere must understand the logic behind such a decision but for the life of me I can't. No sex, no gore, no bad language, no nudity. This is what you would get if Mary Whitehouse made a Slasher Flick.Watching this is like watching a non-contact boxing match on Pay per view. It makes no sense what so ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had skipped my lessons with my friends and walked into the cinema with an open mind for this movie, and despite all the * out of 10* comments I had read right here on this site just a while ago, I have to say that it really surprised me as well as my friends. People are saying things like its too predictable, or the directing and acting is horrendous...endless list. However its not unwatchable. At least it had my eyes opened for the entire screening. This movie is never meant to be an Oscar or box office robber, so just watch this movie like you are watching any Saturday night slasher flick, you won't be disappointed, or at least not so disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical corny horror with a lacking cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I didn't mind watching this film. I thought it had a good story. The only problem I had with it was the cast that was very lacking in their "scared to death," looks.I really enjoyed the psycho stalker teacher character. I thought this character was played really well and was really creepy, but again, its almost impossible to have a really good main star without having a good supporting cast.I did like that all of the murders were done with a knife, that brings you back to the old days, but if you're looking for a horror/gore, this movie isn't for you. This one was more about the stalking/creeping type of horror.Overall, I think its worth the watch, but not if you're looking for the new age gore type of horror. If you want something to scare your girlfriend into snuggling closer to you, this is a good movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, before I begin, one thing I really need to stress. To all the bad reviews on here with "high hopes" or "expectations" ....... The movie is called Prom Night, what did you expect? Yes, the movie is unbelievably cliché, yes, the characters are your typical teen/horror movie characters, but again -- the movie is called Prom Night. I'm tired of listening to folk whine about how upset they are that movies like Prom Night turn out with the aspects I stated above.Your teen slasher is always |ALWAYS| going to turn out like this. Sure, some will be better than others, but when it comes down to it, they're all the same. Centers on the girl, her friends get slaughtered because the "stalker" wants to get close to her, the cops try save her, she almost dies, they shoot, stab or set him on fire -- the end. Right? Yes.Now, Prom Night wasn't the best I've seen from this genre, not even half-way, but, there were a good few scares here and there that I will admit to gasping too.The main problem with this movie was, the usual story (I stated above^) was too obvious, even for a movie like this. She looks in the mirror, he's there, she turns - he's not there. The friend has an argument with her boyfriend, she goes up-stairs to chill = killing time. The biggest thing that got to me was the choices these teens made, for instance. The Prom is held at a well-off, beautiful hotel. Towards the end of the movie, the cops take over and tell everyone to leave - so you leave, right? No. The automated voice is talking over the loud speaker: "Emergency, please leave the building" (repeated over and over). So, what does the girl do? "Oh I forgot my moms shawl, it's up-stairs" of course, because that's the first thing you worry about, naturally. There are about one hundred of those "shawl" moments in this movie that it just gets you thinking, it's now 2008, can't they come up with anything better? Now, I'm not gonna take a pop at the actors, because their acting was good, but with this material, there's only so much you can do. Go into this movie the way I went into it. I expected the expected, and I was right. Don't go into a slasher movie titled, "Prom Night" thinking you're gonna get a stunning piece of film. It's just not common logic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A promising premise, not directed well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes of old cult Horror films are about as common as clouds in the British sky at the moment. There was Halloween, remade by Rob Zombie into a brutal, but effective display of violence, The Hills Have Eyes I &amp; II which massacred all that was good about the original franchise.Prom Night was never a huge film when it was first released over 20 years ago, so the reasoning behind this remake is not all that clear. All that can be said however, is that it is hugely disappointing.What starts off as a predictable, done 1000 times before type of premise seems to evolve into something much better within the first half; the acting is by and large good, the cinematography is also good and the plot actually has just that, a plot.Unfortunately, after reaching the half way point, it seems the director has run out of fresh ideas, using the same shocks over and over again; any gasps from the audience simply discussing the fact that it seems to have a terrible case of deja vu.Brittany Snow is memorable for her role as Amber in Hairspray, she will not however, be remembered for her role in this OK, but could do better; horror flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ridiculous PG-13'd slasher flick that doesn't even try much of anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some have called the remake of Prom Night the worst movie they have ever seen and I won't go that far. I can't say that I hated it because I don't regret having seen it but mostly only because I can shake my head and laugh at what I just sat through. Plus the performances weren't entirely disastrous and they only did what they could with a sub par script. Now as a fan of slasher/Horror flicks I can accept a lot of cheese and camp and plot holes but there has to be something to back it up and the worst part of Prom Night and with many Horror films nowadays is that they have decided to firmly aim the demographic at young teens meaning PG or PG 13 so whereas in the eighties you had original, gruesome, scary, blood splattering effects where you could rate how good a killer was and how good a horror movie was based on how clever and crazy they could be with the death scenes now you don't even get to see death scenes and Prom Night was awful. You never once see the killer kill anyone. It cuts away or hides the death scene and there is barely blood. That doesn't really match up to the horror genre. I'm not even sure I could classify this as a horror but rather a weak teen thriller.Brittany Snow is really a teen idol in the making. She is perfect for the film because she is cute and bubbly and does have some elements of talent and for all intensive purposes she makes a decent scream queen but the script for the film is very weak and has acting like a high school girl but unrealistically but she shouldn't be held responsible as she is alright in the role. Scott Porter plays her boyfriend and he probably also has talent that pokes it's head through in the film but he is given little to nothing to work with and they don't even use him as a male hero which is unfortunate but again not his fault. Jessica Stroup is a victim and not much else so they don't explore her character or give you any reason to get attached to her unfortunately for the actress. Dana Davis, much like Snow, is a decent scream queen but isn't given a lot to work with but still her character is one of the stronger in the film and she does well in it. She probably shows the best acting ability in this particular film. Collins Pennie is also decent as Davis' boyfriend but he doesn't get to do much either...unfortunate for everyone involved in this cast. Johnathon Schaech is disgustingly misused as the killer because Schaech has this heir of brilliance in his performance as a deranged former teacher who became obsessed with a student. They even very cleverly use lighting effects and shadows and his appearance to make him a little more scary but the rest of the film destroys any effort and with a good script and director and such he could have been a great killer. Idris Elba is unfortunately boring and rather foolish as the detective who wants to take the killer down before he hurts anyone.Prom Night might be a loose remake but Prom Night feels like more of a bad sequel. I mean when the film starts an entire event that would be worthy of a movie has already happened and you're dropped into the world after this event and before the killer returns. So it's like you're seeing Part 2 of a horror movie without ever having seen part 1. I mean they do their best to explain the story and really get you involved but something just falls apart. There are some good chase scenes that end in poor deaths that you never see and the plot holes are endless. The sheer idea that the police and this girl's guardians would rather have her enjoy her prom then bring her into protection is quite simply stupid and not in the least believable. The decisions that the protagonists make (in particular the male protagonists) are so outlandish that it just makes you realize how stupid the movie really is. The film falls victim first of all to a director, Nelson McCormick, who comes primarily from TV. The only problem with this is TV Directors have the opportunity to tell a story over 24 episodes or more and they try to do the same only cram it into an hour and a half and you feel ripped off and shorted. All in all Prom Night is sadly a bust and I'm all for remaking Horror Movies but do it right please. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agree and disagree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found that the actors did a good job for the script they were given.. i do agree that there was killing 24/7 with no actually seeing the killing, but what did it for me was the major plot flaw. Only people who have seen the movie will no what i am talking about. OK well the scene i am talking about is at the hotel room when Donna meets the killer. When she runs out of the room she finds the cops but the cops can't find him. They search the whole hotel. While they are searching through the hotel Donna leaves back with her boyfriend to her house for safety. After the whole hotel is checked and they find the dead waiter in the vent the cop remembers seeing him (the killer) in a waiter uniform while they were evacuating. The cop asked the waiter (the killer) if everything was alright and the killer said i think so. This conversation is repeated before when we didn't know it was the killer and we say it from a different camera shot. So unless the cops can search a hotel in the speed of light then it was just a poor job of just trying to gain a few more minutes of film. Unless there were two killers this is impossible, because the hotel was evacuated first, then they found her upstairs (where the killer is). This angered me because that shows the writers were trying to hard to drag on the film and they underestimated their audiences intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Prom Night,and I'm not even kidding, it was the worst movie I have ever seen. It might have been better if it had an R rating. Since the movie was PG-13 there was no blood and guts, or twisted "horror movie type" psychotic killings, which made the acting from supporting characters extremely over dramatic. They ruined the plot by not setting up a proper back story. Plus the writers messed up on a few parts of the hotel investigation scene. The detective obtained information that only the "murderer" would have know at that point of the movie. Plus, there is NO WAY that someone who had just witnessed her entire family be sliced and diced be so stable after only 3 years. Also, a lot of the transitions were terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Donna (Brittany Snow) was 14 years old, she witness her mother and family getting killed by her crazed ex-science teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech). Which Fenton had a dangerous crush on his student. Three years has passed, Donna is trying to move on with her life. Especially her and friends are going to their senior's Prom Night together for the last time before College. But Fenton actually escaped from the mental hospital to be with Donna and he kills people, who gets in his way to get to Donna.Directed by Nelson McCormick (Who's an pro directing T.V. Episodes like "E/R", "Nip/Tuck" and "NYPD Blue") made an entertaining teen slasher movie with the right moments of suspense and terror. Schaech does an good job playing the crazy serial murderer in the movie. Although i am not a big fan of actress:Snow, she does an pretty good job in the feature. Idris Elba has an scene-stealing supporting performance as Detective Winn. The cast are likable as well like Jessica Stroup (The lead actress from "The Hills Have Eyes 2"), Dana Davis, Collins Pennie, Scott Porter, Linden Ashby, Mary Mara and others.DVD from "Prom Night" is actually the Unrated Version, it includes one minute of additional footage (Mostly violence are added back in this version). DVD has an solid anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an entertaining commentary track by the filmmakers, actors:Snow and Schaech. DVD also includes Deleted Scenes with optional commentary by the filmmaker, same goes from the Alternate Ending, Featurettes and Bloopers. This is not a remake of the infamous Canadian film of the same-name, who was starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen. Although there's one scene in the new Prom Night that reminds me of the original. Slasher fans will find some enjoyment in this thriller and don't listen to the critics in this one, just watch and enjoy it. Joshua Leonard from "The Blair Witch Project" fame has an amusing cameo as one of Fenton's victims. Written by B-Movie Scripter:J.S. Cardone (Alien Hunter, The Covenant, The Forsaken). Super 35.

		<shortDescription>Didn't Hate It. It Managed Entertain Me Despite Some Big Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this expecting to hate it but I watched it because Brittany Snow is hot. I didn't hate it....it was clichéd, obvious, and failed to create a creepy or scary atmosphere but as far as horror movies go, there has been A lot worse lately. The main thing that bothered me about this movie was if your going to have an unrealistic slasher flick where an obsessed school teacher manages to be very skilled at killing hand fulls of people at least make it bloody. This was a PG-13 flick to the core (saw the unrated version), people get stabbed repeatably and it just looks like they put alittle red paint on the shirt. Plus the director kept trying to pull off cheap thrills by shocking the audience with family members suddenly appearing in the mirror or what not. It just got just old quick. I did think the villain was well cast and a few scenes I actually felt like he was a creepy person but the movie got so caught up in killing tons of people that they didn't focus on the villain being creepy or evil. This is why I liked The Hitcher so much. It wasn't a perfect movie but at least they got the concept of a truly evil and creepy villain without having to turn it in just some random person killing off the cast.</fullReview>

The reason why I gave it a seven was because Prom Night did have a couple good suspense parts and the sets were really good as long with the quality. The killer was not scary at all and there was no unique with any of the deaths. All there was were stabbing and gun shooting. I wouldn't tell any one to see this movie. The Ruins is a movie though that you should go see! The gore was awesome so was the acting and everything else! Prom Night was not a night to die for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>decent if not really original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I never saw the original with Jamie Lee Curtis but as this was a re imagining not a remake I didn't really need to see it at all. Secondly I walked in knowing that it is a PG horror film, so you know that there is going to be very little blood, nothing more than kissing and looks in the intimacy department and whatever killings were done would be mostly off screen. Within this kind of setup the film works reasonably well. The only reason I didn't rate this higher is because of the logic flaws in the story which are almost funny to try to accept. As they could be called spoilers I won't try to list them here but some of the comments here allude to them, and some of the other characters come off as cardboard cutouts, which is more the fault of the characters and the writing than the actors. The acting works for what is here though Ms Snow isn't given much to do other than do the bland I'm the heroine of the story shtick. There are no major flaws in the killings the tension is reasonably done for a PG flick and the best acting in it is done by the bad guy who is played by someone who isn't really known for playing psychos. So if you want a decently paced quickie that won't strain your brain this is for you but stay away if you like your horror more direct.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An honest review on the film...which I loved!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been anticipating Prom Night ever since the movie was announced, because I definitely thought the original, which was only a decent film, definitely needed an update. It was boring in parts, and one of the 80's slashers that I didn't enjoy that much. Just because the original had Jamie Lee Curtis and an R rating, doesn't mean it is necessarily better. I definitely enjoyed this remake over the original, and people saying that this movie is the worst they've seen are just over exaggerating. What worries me most, is that the majority of IMDb voters think that this is the worst movie ever made and the best movie ever made. It's not either of those. It's a fun PG-13 thriller/slasher with a great cast, suspense, chase scenes, entertaining death scenes, a psychotic stalker for a killer and more.The movies plot tells the story about Donna (Brittany Snow), whose family was brutally murdered by her teacher Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) a few years back, and just when she thinks her life is getting better...Fenton escapes from jail and begins killing her friends off on her Prom Night. Firstly, I thought the acting was great from everybody. Pretty faces doesn't mean bad acting, which some people think. I've seen most of the actors and actresses perform before, and I loved them in this. Donna, Bobby (Scott Porter), Ronnie (Collins Pennie), Claire (Jessica Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis) were all likable and acted their age, and I felt sad when the characters were being killed off. Michael (Kelly Blatz) could have had more character development, as he came across as the biggest jerk. I loved the fact that they included a bitchy character named Crissy (Brianne Davis) into the mix too, and I liked what they did with her character. You might be expecting the bitchy character to bite it...but she doesn't! Instead, the nice friend of Donna's does. That was refreshing.The movie is rated PG-13, and has been bashed because of this. Well, I felt that the movie was actually quite violent for a PG-13 horror/thriller and it had a high body count, suspense and even blood. There may have not been lots of it, but this movie didn't really need it. The deaths were quick and quite violent and aggressive, and I loved them. Schaech played the role of the killer very well, and I think that he proved that you don't need masks and an overall for someone to be creepy. He was creepy enough, and nailed it with his creepy voice and movement. There's plenty of action thrown into the mix also, especially with the cops who are hunting the killer, and I thought the movie had a great soundtrack and location. The teen song choices fit the movie and the supposed Prom in the original was nowhere near as great as the one in the remake. The one in the original was one you'd probably skip, whereas the one in the remake is one I think everyone would go to. It was realistic for nowadays, and I loved the way they made it into some kind of almost "celebrity" event.I honestly think all of the comments on this movie are just unfair in general and I saw all the hate coming to be honest. People keep whining about movies like this, yet keep on seeing them? This movie, in my opinion, doesn't deserve a 1 or a 10 as both are just wrong for this movie and people just don't know how to rate. Horror websites have been getting ready to let rip at the movie for ages, and it's sad that a lot of people are calling this the worst movie of the year when it's only April and we still have some productions coming up this year from horrendous directors (do I need to say names?). It's a fun movie people! People are too hard to please nowadays, and just love to nitpick at everything...even WITHOUT seeing the film. This movie might not have boobs, women getting killed naked and tons of blood and gore. If you want that, wait for the remake of Friday the 13th! You should have known what you were getting in for when, and if, you saw this. In a nutshell, I'd say it's a fun remake which is entertaining non-stop with realistic, young teen characters, a great cast who aren't just pretty faces, a creepy killer, cool soundtrack and great death scenes. It's not a masterpiece and it is certainly not one of the worst movies ever made. If you are looking for a movie with heavy blood, profanity and nudity...then skip this as you'd probably dislike it. Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend Prom Night. And if you do watch it, watch it with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good film go out and see Prom Night. I like prom night. I notice from my film and literature course the directors style of using faraway shots then moving towards close up shots creates a feel of the macro to the micro for films films environment. The viewer resonates a bond with the lead protagonist with the macro to micro camera work. A believable story of a sick teachers obsession with a student. Not believable 10 years ago, but just tun on to CNN and there is a deranged teacher story on the news everyday. A few cheesy spots in the film, but all horror films need cheese. The cheesy flat characters create the lotion to lubricate the movie. The jerk and lackey cops always become victims in any horror movies to portray the danger of the killer. 7 out of 10 scares for Prom Night. A good drive in movie, but they closed the drive in this year. Sob Sob!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** possible spoilers *** If you're looking for a suspenseful movie that will give you a fun scare, this is it. But unfortunately, the attempted scares are executed improperly. The movie could have gone a lot farther with everything, and it still could've been PG-13, so why didn't it? There could have been a little bit more gore. There's more blood on primetime television then there was in this movie. The creeper could have been a little bit more creepy-looking. And he could've had a more interesting weapon, like a screwdriver or axe or something. A knife? How is that original? This movie lacked the elements that movies such as Halloween had. To really scare you, the murderer must be memorable. The killings need to be grotesque. It's as if they didn't even try to be unique.Also, possibly even more importantly, it's hard to be sympathetic with the characters. There is almost nothing unique about the characters that makes you say, Oh, I wish they didn't have to die! It's hard to even cringe during the less-than-climactic murder scenes. I felt more sorry for the maid then the best friend, and that just goes to show that there was little character development. The only people you really root for are Donna and her boyfriend, because Donna's just been through so much, and her boyfriend is so supportive. But it's hard to identify with these super-nice main characters. There could have been something added in that would make the two of them a more believable couple.Honestly, the clichés are easy to get past. Even the best horror movies have clichés. But it's the fact that the people who made this movie didn't even try to add a unique spin to it. It was like they set out to make a stereotypical, predictable movie and were pleased with what they accomplished. Any little unique touches might have made this movie more memorable, but the movie doesn't even bother to try. That's what's so disappointing. So if you want a few thrills and some suspense, this movie is a good idea. But if what you're looking for is a well-developed horror film that will keep you up at night, Prom Night is definitely not it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, this may not be the most original or visually brilliant film, but then again thats not what you would expect it to be. It tries to be jump-out-in-your-face type of scary and for the most part I would have to say I think it succeeds.The story isn't too crash hot, but I genuinely found myself on the edge of my seat towards the end, and it was especially sad when one of the characters is crying because his girlfriend who he was about to propose to dies. From the very start I could feel a sense of dread, and I knew that things were going to go haywire pretty quickly.This film also doesn't waste much time in building up the plot, which is absolutely a good thing. It sets up the characters well, just enough so that the audience cares about them a little bit but not enough to drag the main story down. Many, many deaths along the way, although they are almost entirely gore-free (just a bit of blood spatter on walls, plastic drapes, etc), which is not really surprising for an M rated movie.Overall I found myself enjoying this movie, more than I expected I would. Go see this if you want to get moderately scared or you just want to have a good time for a few hours.Genuinely scary and atmospheric and I would recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining ... But not without its flaws!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the teen generation, this adaption of the 1980's slasher "Prom Night" will prove to be a little fun scream-fest. When I first heard that they were remaking the original prom night, My expectations were glum. After viewing some truly horrible remake films in the past, I had almost given up. I acquired an advance screening ticket to this movie and who am I to give up a free movie ticket? The film started off as you would expect. A little character development combined with some backstory and mystery. I wont give anything away but it is a little weak and leaves the audience wanting more information. As the teens arrive at the Prom, Donna (played by Bittany Snow) is trying to forget the horrors of her past but little does she know, shes in for one hell of a night. A stalker which is obesessed with her has broken out of prison and come to find her. The night is filled with screams and blood(not a lot of which I might add) and it all ends in disaster. The acting throughout this film is not great but is believable. The actress who plays "Lisa" really does shine in this film. All in all, Prom Night is not a masterpiece. Its an entertaining, guilty pleasure that is sure to leave the younger generation with a smile on their face. Take it for what it is. Don't! and I repeat Don't have high expectations!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the previews for Prom Night, I got very excited because the previews made it look really good. I couldn't wait to see it. I saw it on opening night and was not disappointed! The film follows Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) on the night of her prom, fours years after she was traumatized by her pedophile former teacher stalking her and then watching him kill her family. This is shown in the very first scene and the thrills and suspense take off from there. Let me just say this movie is very creepy and not for the faint of heart.The thrills I got from this movie were the most I've gotten in a long time. It had that natural horror movie tension buildup, where the character slowly walks backward as the music builds. Sometimes the climax was just the character bumping into a lamp, while other times you saw the guy, staring infatuated at her with those creepy, unforgettable eyes. I will admit I jumped out of my seat a couple of times.This movie was one of the best teen slasher films of the 21st century, as the acting is amazing! Brittany Snow is spectacular and believable as the lead and the supporting cast was amazing as well. The characters were realistic, too.(Most of the time) they were intelligent and believable as party-going, fun-loving young teenagers with romantic drama enjoying their senior prom.The only thing that could have been better for me, was the ending. I felt it could have been better. You will probably realize it when you watch it, but they had a golden opportunity to make really creepy ending.Anyway, if you are a fan of horror films, particularly teen slashers, watch this movie! Teens especially would love it, as I did. There are thrills, suspense, romance, and you actually become attached to the characters and hope they survive. This movie will stay with you and have you checking your back after you get back from the theater and have you checking your bathroom after you walk in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Prom Night was probably the most intense scary movie i've seen yet. Although I'm not particularly a fan of blood and gore, I expected to see this while watching this movie. I thought that the actors were well-chosen and did a great job. It is definitely different from any other scary movie that I have seen, particularly since there were so many killings. Different from most movies, the murderer in Prom Night was so obsessed with this girl that he would take anyone's life, even the girls, to get to her. I also liked the fact that most of what I had expected did not happen; timings for the killings were different than what i predicted, so that kept me entertained. I'm sure some of the dialogue could have been better, but all in all, i give this movie a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A former teacher becomes obsessed with this high school girl, to the point of killing everyone she cared about, just to be with her. I almost stopped watching this movie, because it was slow and really boring for close to 45 minutes (just showing the prom and people dancing), but I'm glad I didn't. It got better. The farther along the movie went, it finally got interesting. This is the kind of movie that'd be considered as a teen slasher, with a high body count. This is some what scary and grotesque, without going over the top like in Friday the 13th or one of the Saw films. Pretty decent movie, with some legit scares and thrills,and OK storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, enjoyable film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the ratings of the film beforehand, I thought to myself "Oh no. Just another Hollywood attempt of a Horror film, which may very well end disastrously." However, I then watched the film. This changed my thoughts. To be frank, I actually quite enjoyed it. To begin with, let's discuss the music and soundtracks. They were upbeat in the necessary places, to create suspense and drama. They also very loud sounds for the inevitable Hollywood "jump scares" and they didn't hang about. VERY MINOR SPOILER: The first jump scare is around the 4 minute mark. The soundtrack also becomes very emotive and, almost, heart-warming in all the right places. Very effective. One criticism I have about the film would be, not so much the use of special effects, but the look and portrayal of them. They seemed to be quite unrealistic for a 2008 film, with a relatively high budget (20 million US dollars). Maybe this is just because I, personally, like my horrors filled with guts and gore. I'm sure you will be able to rate the effects to your own personal standards. The protagonists, who are all very obvious from the outset, are all likable, even though some of them do not have much substance, and not a lot of room to "act well", for example the boyfriend played by Scott Porter. There is a very interesting camera technique (movement) used around the 26th minute, in which the camera does a full 360 degree rotation to reveal Donna and then the antagonist, played by Johnathon Schaech (pronounce at your own risk). I found it a little confusing when one of the victims seem to know the killers name. I am not one for looking into film plots and trying desperately to work them out, so it is maybe more obvious to other people as to why or how she knew his name? I feel that Prom Night has a strong, emotive script. It may not be original, obviously not as it is a remake, but it is enjoyable nonetheless. The plot is predictable at times, however, this allows the viewer and/or audience to become more involved, I feel.All in all, I would recommend people to see this film. I would rate it 7/10.You will like it if you like films in which you know a lot of characters are going to meet their demise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watered down teen remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night is set in the town of Bridgeport &amp; where graduating high school teenager Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) prepares for her school's prom night, Donna's date Bobby (Scott Porter) picks her up &amp; they both leave for the local Grand Civic Hotel where the extravagant prom is being held. Local Bridgeport detective Winn (Idris Elba) is informed that murderer Richard Fenton (Jonathon Schaech) has escaped from the maximum security hospital he was being kept in for the brutal killing of Donna's family, Fenton is obsessed with Donna &amp; will do anything to be with her &amp; is considered very dangerous. Detective Winn discovers that Donna is at her prom night but also finds evidence that Fenton is there killing her friends &amp; anyone else who stands the way of Donna &amp; himself being together...This American Canadian co-production was directed by Nelson McCormick &amp; was yet another watered down (no-one gets drunk, no-one gets naked, no-one swears...) teen remake of a classic horror, having said that the original Prom Night (1980) isn't particularly well regarded or liked even among genre fans. Having not seen the original Prom Night, but hearing rather bad things about it, I cannot directly compare the two although one suspects that this remake is by far the better made &amp; polished at the expense of genuine horror content. While the original Prom Night was a standard teen slasher whodunit of no great distinction this remake doesn't bother with any mystery aspect &amp; it's revealed immediately who the killer is, to be fair the guy is more of a psycho stalker as he follows Donna around which moves Prom Night into the Fatal Attraction (1987) camp with some crazy love torn psycho as the villain rather than the teen slasher film I was expecting where some wise cracking killer gets to murder a load of annoying teens. Don't get me wrong though, the teens in Prom Night are still annoying. It's just that Prom Night feels more like a psycho thriller than a teen slasher. The whole film feels rather watered down &amp; bland, there's little in the way of shocks or bloodshed &amp; the character's are upper class perfect teens, there's too many shot's of kids looking great with perfect teeth &amp; smiling &amp; long flowing hair wearing expensive clothing &amp; everyone just felt fake like some horrible soap opera. The teenage angst about going to college, losing loved ones, broken relationships, cat fights with the bitchy girl in your class &amp; behaving like a spoilt brat makes Prom Night difficult to like. There is very little motivation given to psycho stalker Richard other than the line he is obsessed with Donna, we never know why or how it developed or get any proper face-off between the two. The majority of the film is set in a hotel (again a very expensive one) &amp; &amp; focuses on Richard trying to meet up with Donna. At just under 90 minutes Prom Night drags in places, it's entirely predictable &amp; with unlikable rich kid character's who think they own the world I found it hard to sit through. I suppose it has a reasonable story that is not helped by a distinct lack of suspense or tension, some may like the spoilt brat kid character's &amp; it's competently made but for me I can't say I liked it.Everything in Prom Night is picture book perfect from the model like cast to the settings to the clothes, it wasn't a world I could relate to or like particularly I have to say. Watered down to get a PG rating in the US there's a fair body count but most of the kills are bloodless or off screen, the odd stab wound is as graphic as it gets. Most of the attempted scares here are of the cheap variety, people suddenly popping up in the background in mirrors, people suddenly jumping out of shadows &amp; two dream sequences that suggest Donna may be killed off in a twist but ultimately go nowhere. The whole film looks too glamorous to me, I've already mentioned the clothes &amp; hair but these kids arrive at the prom &amp; actually walk up a red carpet! The cops are incompetent, letting the killer know they are on to him &amp; letting him escape several times.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 this did quite well at the box-office but I hope that there's no sequel. The acting is alright, none of the character's are that well written or acted but I didn't expect much else.Prom Night is more of a psycho thriller than a teen slasher &amp; has little in common with the original apart from the title &amp; the prom setting, unlikable character's &amp; a lack of suspense &amp; gore make Prom Night an unrewarding viewing experience. There are better films out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A below par remake of a below par movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as the genre goes, this is hardly the worst movie to watch out there. But just like its original it's also far from the best. It's not very original and it doesn't seem to know what it wants to do and be, which strangely enough was also something that the 1980 original movie suffered from, even though both movies are very different from each other in story and approach.This movie basically has very little to do with the 1980 movie "Prom Night", which starred Jamie Lee Curtis. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing though. The original movie also really wasn't a great one to begin with. It's basically only a sequel in name and only basically uses the idea of letting murders take place during a prom night. The story and all of its characters are totally different and so is the killer, which is not a good thing though.Thing about its killer is that we know who it is. We see him commit all of the murders and we even know what his motivations are. So there is totally no mystery about it who is the killer in this movie, which already takes away lots of the movie its tension as well. It besides isn't a very strong villain. He doesn't act very smart and only seems to unnecessarily get himself into more trouble when he needlessly kills lots of people. The actor besides didn't impressed me, as did none of the actors in this movie really.It's one of those movies in which a bunch of teenagers get portrayed by people in their 20's. They are over-the-top ridiculously beautiful and perfect and are all oh so friendly all of the time. The characters were all quite annoying, though I must admit that I kind of liked Kellan Lutz in this, though his role is extremely small. All of the actors are kind of acting in this as if they are big stars already who are going to make it big time. I have some news for them; no one is going to know who you are in 10 years from now and no one knows who you are now either by the way. Except for Kellan Lutz, who I for some reason predict a great future, most likely in the action genre.The story doesn't really provide the movie with much originality. The movie isn't really being a slasher, which should be a big disappointment for the genre fans but I have no clue as well what the movie is being. Not scary, not bloody, not surprising...I know what the movie is not being. It's a very cliché filled movie that doesn't even handle its clichés well. A lacking movie that can perhaps be best described as a teenage-thriller, without thrills and real teenagers though.But nothing about this movie makes me say that it's a completely horrible or unwatchable one. It's lacking on basically every department yes, but nothing about it makes me hate this movie. Perhaps it's just that I have seen some far worse movies. But anyway, no, it's not a movie that I would ever recommend to anybody watching.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad movie especially a pg-13 horror movie. But if it had been a stronger remake it wouldn't have been such a bad movie. Brittany Snow wasn't a bad actor, and the movie had a few surprises in it. Kellan Luzt's character was kind of a random character. And the mean girl i expected her to die. But once again another surprise happened. The black girl died instead of her. If they really wanted it to be a complete horror movie more people should have died. Yet they made it work. In my opinion good movie. But could've been better. If they're planning to make a sequel to this movie or a prequel film. I'm looking forward to it. People who say it's a bad movie OK understandable. People who say it's a great movie you're probably out of your mind. Prom Night was good just not too good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I gave this a 5, on the basis that I watch 30-50 horror movies a year so believe I have a fairly balanced view on what makes a good and bad horror flick.I have seen many terrible films in the genre recently and whilst this one offers little which is original, it's not a flawed as many of the others.It is relatively enjoyable but falls short in some departments - e.g. there is no real mystery at all in this horror film. That alone is quite unusual for a horror flick involving teenagers and school kids etc.On that note the casting is bad. I mean its not unusual for directors to cast actors older than they actually are. But this film cast near actors who looked near 30 to play teenage prom kids. It really did detract from the look and feel of the film.The other note on casting is that strangely the main killer is very good looking. Whilst many horror flicks involves a creepy mask and so on, this guy is not creepy at all to look at. Very strange indeed - and even though I am a hetero sexual male it made me very unphased by staring at this killer who is meant to freak me out. It simply didn't. I was even contemplating how 'cool' his look was.Whilst there are obvious flaws in "why didn't she do this and that" throughout they are by far not that noticeable compared to other similar horror flicks.I was quite surprised this film received a 3 overall. I thought it deserved at least a point or two more than that.I'd comfortably give this film a 5. Merely for the fact that although its not original in story, it does follow a strange pattern where what you expect to happen half way through doesn't entirely happen. Without spoiling it I'll leave it at that.Worth it if you are under 30 and like films like the craft/urban legend. If you are older you may find it a little hard to swallow being more mature and all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** Even though the film uses the same title of the 1980 Jamie Lee Curtis horror flick its in no way a remake of that earlier slasher thriller.In the movie we see pretty 18 year-old Donna Keppel played by Brittany-white as-Snow looking forward to attend her and her friends senior Prom Night at the famous Pacific Grand Hotel in downtown Bridgeport. Donna has been under psychiatric care and taking strong anti-psychotic drugs ever since her entire family was murdered by her English teacher Richard Fenton, Johnathon Schaech, three years ago. Fenton who had an obsessive attraction to the at that time 15 year-old Donna went berserk when she turned him down to be her lawfully or, in Donna not being at the age of consent, unlawfully wedded wife.Unknown to both Donna and her Aunt Karen, Jessalyn Gilsig, and Uncle Jack, Linden Ashby, whom she's now living with Fenton has escaped from the loony bin, or mental institution, that he's been interned in. The murderously as well as revenge driven Fenton is now headed for the Grand Pacific to rekindle his strange and unnatural relationship with Donna. It's that relationship that ended so abruptly with his capture and conviction some three years ago.The movie "Prom Night" has the cunning but mentally deranged Fenton turn the Prom Night ceremonies at the Grand Pacific Hotel into a house of horrors. Fenton is so unstable and blood thirsty that he ends up murdering a good number of the hotel staff who have nothing at all to do with keeping him and his "beloved" Donna apart! The guy-Fenton- also seems to have the power to travel from point A to Point B in some cases 20 to 30 miles apart on foot, he probably wore a pair of Air Jordans, faster then even a speeding police car, running red lights, could have done!The local police headed by Det.Winn, Idris Elba, have more then their hands full in dealing with Fenton in that besides his ability to be a step or two ahead of them at every point in the movie he's also a master of disguise as well as expert in camouflaging himself. As we soon see Fenton can easily turn himself into a piece of furniture as well as any member of the hotel staff without anyone, including Det. Winn, ever noticing him!***SPOILERS*** Donna who had enough troubles to deal with, in overcoming her deep psychiatric problems in seeing Fenton murder her entire family, is now confronted with the knowledge that not only is "Mad Dog" Fenton on the loose but had already murdered a good many of her high school friends, in his rampage at the senior Prom, including her one and only love, that she plans to marry after collage, her overprotective boyfriend Bobby, Scott Porter. It was Fenton's big mistake in going after Donna at her Aunt and Uncle's home that turned out to be his own undoing. with the house surrounded by at least a dozen policemen Fenton's crazed love, or obsession, for Donna made him walk right into the trap that the cops set for him. But not after the slippery as an eel Fenton just about did them all in with only Det. Winn still around and on his feet in him being able to finally stop the crazed lunatic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary, Great Cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donna gets ready for Prom Night 3 years after her family was murdered. The Killer, of whom is her old Chemistry/Science teacher and is in love with her, stalks her after escaping from an institution and gradually kills her friends one by one, soon she's next.The kill scenes in this film aren't flattering. The gore is reduced so much that it comes across as unrealistic. Donna's mother is killed in front of her, she is stabbed multiple times. Though when she is shown after wards, no stab wounds are shown just small drops of blood and her shirt slightly ripped. It makes it way less scarier and is very noticeable.I loved the way this movie was filmed. During the PG-13 kill scenes the camera angles cut to such great angles and visually pleasing sequences. Such as Jessica Stoups death scene, Kelly Blatz death scene.The best scene in the whole film is Dana Davis's death scene. She is chased through the dark construction level of the hotel, this film contains great suspense, the look and colors of the scene is sinister and dark with the use of blue, and plastic sheets covering the constructions sets. This is a great technique which is also used in a creepy sequence in 'The Grudge 2' and 'Saw IV.' When Dana Davis finally meets her demise, her blood squirts up to the plastic sheet which looks so cool and creepy! Its the best part!Although the film is not as good as it could've been, it has so many other good things about. I enjoyed mostly the cinematography, camera angles, music score, soundtrack and look. However the PG-13 use of gore makes the film seem a lot less scary.If your a fan of The Saw Films or Hostel, this film is not for you. If you enjoyed other Pg-13 films such as When a Stranger Calls, you may like this film. Don't have high expectations for the film. But take time to notice its great filming techniques. I really do believe the director should continue directing more horror films using the same type of visually pleasing angles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of all sorts of films, I literally mean I will watch anything. My sister rented this film out along with "One Missed Call" for her 15th birthday party to watch along with her little girly friends and have a little scream, so I thought I would watch it and see if it was just another silly slasher/horror film that will entertain me for a short while. After reading reviews on the internet on both films I decided to watch One Missed Call first. Oh, how that was a mistake. I know I'm not writing about that film but it sucked. I then watched this. I don't know what it was about this film which kept me so gripped. It has a mediocre story line which has been used billions of times and the typical stock characters. The pretty cheerleader and all her friends. Along with the over use of cliché horror and jump tactics this film looked from the beginning to be another one of those horror films I would watch and enjoy jut as a silly scary film.Through out the film you follow the story of a pretty teenage girl (Brittany Snow) and how she has to go to the prom. However, shes previously been stalked and attacked by some crazy teacher and has the horrific memories to support it. Although it seemed as though it would succeed in being a silly horror film, I was amazed. Throughout the film and towards the climax at the end I felt myself feeling things I've never actually felt while watching before. The tension that was built up as you knew people where about to head to their death, and the incredible character creation that has lead you to become familiar with these people, along with Nelson McCormicks alterations on the typical horror cinematography and jump techniques I was left sitting on the end of my seat and greatly enjoying this impressive piece of filmography. The casting was also impeccable. Brittany Snow is incredibly fanciable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is actually a good movie...the suspense is there, and some pretty good action...problem is (i'm not gay) but the villain in this movie is not creepy...he is a good-looking guy...in fact you wonder, why is she running? If he kept his beard then maybe he'd be a bit creepier.Some of the scenes that actually could have given people a jump, or a scare didn't because the scene would be telegraphed. Like in the closet. Instead of jumping for the kill, his head peeks through slowly first seeing a clear image of his face coming through (plus the take was too long), and then he jumps out at you, and the "scare" has been compromised. Too many scenes like that, and it tells me that it was the directors fault...could've been a lot more scary if he stuck to the basics.On the plus column though, the story is actually pretty could and there is some suspense played pretty well in the movie...the actors did a nice job acting, except the guys looked too old for the part, but the girls were perfect. The mystery shrouded around the killer is very good as well. This isn't a bad movie, but I find it to be a really good grade B movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has received many horrible reviews and a very low 3.7/10 here on IMDb - so I was reluctant to watch it. I decided to anyway because of my love of horror movies! "Prom Night" turned out to be a great movie. It had the perfect blend of suspense, horror, mystery and action. I liked the way it got into the action quite quickly. The beginning was great - freaky and the perfect start to this movie. The killer was almost exactly as I imagined him from reading the synopsis.Basically the story is about a high school teacher who is obsessed with this girl. Even after going to jail (for killing her family) - he escapes and comes after her on her prom night. The police are notified of his escape and immediately sends down cops to try and protect her. The killer will do anything he can to get to her - killing anyone that gets in his way.I totally recommend you to watch this movie - despite the bad reviews - because it is a great movie that is freaky, suspenseful and truly enjoyable!</fullReview>

At least rent it and watch it, pretty terrifying if you think about it. I would give the acting in this movie an 8. They could have done better, but i think Brittany Snow and Jessica Stroup did the best jobs. The relationship between the villain and the victim is different, but terrifying in as way. You could call this a very dark love story, because all the man wants is to be with Donna (Brittany Snow). He will do anything and kill everyone just to get to her.So, the question is, who will be crowned king and queen, and who will lose their life?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie - Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't get how everyone can hate on this movie so much. While it doesn't contain much suspense, it still maintains it's point and follows a real story line.The movie is about a young girl Donna (Brittney Snow), who became the infatuation of a high school teacher, who later became obsessed with her. The obsession eventually became deadly when he kills her entire family, in order for her to "only have him".She eventually moves in with her aunt and uncle (Jessalyn Gilsig &amp; Linden Ashby), and are supported by her friends, Claire (Jessica Stroup) &amp; Lisa (Dana Davis).. along side their boyfriends Ronnie (Collins Pennie) &amp; Michael (Kelly Blatz) and Donna's boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter).The whole movie is about Donna and her senior prom, where her and her friends have a seemingly fun night, not knowing that their old teacher, Richard Fenton (Jonathan Schaech) has escaped from the ward in which he was placed 3 years ago.Fenton arrives at the hotel and checks into a room under a false name. He chooses the third floor after noticing the party Donna has arrived with, and after one of them, Ronnie asks for the keys to their rooms on the third floor.Eventually Fenton decides to find Donna, not before killing various people from the hotel, and some of Donna's friends. I won't go into great detail about the movie, or spoil the ending, as it's really up to you to watch the movie.All in all, this movie is a great film to sit at home and watch with a bowl of popcorn. It's enjoyable, and perhaps the reason why it's gotten such bad reviews is because there isn't much gore, but I think that's what makes it a good movie.. they risked over doing the movie with too much, so they gave it just enough.The acting is excellent, and the casting is amazing, Brittney Snow, Dana Davis &amp; Jessalyn Gilsig are great actors.Absolutely a movie that's worth buying and watching over &amp; again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is no way near as bad as some people are making out! It is a bit predictable, but I'm nearly 15 and I enjoyed it and was scared by it. I went to see it with some friends; it's a jumpy movie with some very good bits in it. It IS a horror movie and not a bad one at that. I give it 6 out of 10. If you want a short horror that has good moments and is jumpy and thrilling - get this! It won't let you down...I've seen much worst if I'm honest. Almost 7/10 ;)It is about a girl who has had a killer stalking her family for all her life, but now she is 18 and the killer is supposedly in jail, locked away, after killing her Mum &amp; Dad. So she makes her way to her prom with a bunch of friends and is ready for a good night... However, is he really behind bars?Thanks x</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I know for a fact that I've seen the original "Prom Night" (released in 1980 and starring Jamie Lee Curtis) at one point in my life, but it was so mundane and insignificant that I don't actually remember anything about it. In other words I haven't got the slightest idea why specifically this slasher deserved the remake treatment, but apparently it doesn't matter, as the new version is a remake "in name only". One could claim there definitely are some plot-similarities between the two movies, but then again, nearly ALL teen-slasher movies feature these prototypic characteristics. As dreaded but expected, "Prom Night 2008" is an incredibly redundant, politically correct and frustratingly routine new horror movie that contributes a great deal in giving the genre a bad reputation nowadays. The movie nonetheless opens mildly promising; with a modern reworked version of the song "Time of the Season" (the original sung by The Zombies would even have been better of course, but still?) and some niftily shot images during the opening credits. Immediately after that, it's just a never-ending spitfire of dull clichés, out of date stereotypes, painfully ineffective attempts to build suspense, bloodless killings, unsurprising twists and acting performances that are beyond amateurish. Johnathon Schaech is a good and versatile actor, but I haven't seen him star in a good film since "The Doom Generation", and somebody really ought to advise him to put a stop to his frequent collaborations with writer/director J.S. Cardone. Schaech's performance is the only remotely decent aspect about "Prom Night", as he depicts a former teacher with a deadly and permanent obsession for one of his female students. Three years before Mr. Fenton barbarically slaughtered Donna's family and swore to return before he was declared insane and got institutionalized. Now he escaped and heads straight for Donna's hometown, just during a night that should have been one of the greatest nights of her life? the Prom! The main problem with "Prom Night" (or at least one of the many) probably lies with the characters. You don't care whether they live or die since they're such fake and cardboard individuals. I mean, come on? The jock, the sensitive guy, the competitive bitchy girl, the gym teacher with lesbian tendencies, the obsessive cop, the rookie cop, the good-hearted aunt and uncle and so on. Perhaps if the film were intended as a parody the cast of stereotypes could have worked, but unfortunately everyone involved in the production takes this stinker dead serious. The PG-13 says it all in this case: goody-goody childish garbage without violence, guts or even a minimum of sleaze.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't deserve the bashing it's getting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think sometimes it's fashionable for everyone to hate, or at least state they hate, a film. A couple of years ago it was 'I Know Who Killed Me' and with both these films, I watched them with an open mind and found them both to be fun. entertaining and stylish movies, that really didn't deserve the critical bashing they got.No Prom Night doesn't resemble the original- but if there's one thing Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake taught me, a remake that sticks too closely to it's source material is more interesting in concept than execution. It's the same with US remakes of East Asian horror- while most people are raving about how fantastic The Ring is, those who have seen the original are bored by it's uninspired retelling. I want people to take the source material and roll with it, I want new ideas, a completely new take- because if I wanted to watch the same film twice, I'd replay the original, not venture out to the DVD store. Perhaps this is the reason I was very impressed by Rob Zombie's Halloween- well at least the first half.Prom Night reminds me of the slasher films I fell in love with during the 90's- horror was given a boost after Scream and fun, hip films like I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Faculty and, to a lesser extent, Urban Legend were out in cinemas, and for a teenager who grew up on horrors, it was heaven. Prom Night is a tight film, with likable characters, breezy dialogue, some slick cinematography, and some genuinely tense moments. There's so much horror out there that drags on, perhaps under the misplaced belief that it's building tension, but this film hits the ground running, and keeps going.It's not especially original, some of the shots of the Prom Night partiers feels a little bit too music video which comes across as trying too hard to be cool, but the film kept me watching, and interested all the way through.With regards to the gore, this film doesn't need it. I watched the unrated DVD, which apparently only adds a minute of blood splats here and there, but even without this I don't think this film would feel neutered- because this film isn't about gore. It's not like the DVD of My Bloody Valentine I watched recently, where the cuts to gore were so apparent that the film felt like it had lost something important- like I was watching the shreds of what was left after a major edit.Prom Night was never made to depend on gore to draw it's audience in- you get a coherent fun little film despite this. And at a time when so many horror films rely on gore, torture and sadism, it's nice to have a film that almost feels like a more simplistic, even innocent, entry into the genre- one where you want the girl to survive, not wondering what gruesome way she can be murdered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prom Night (2008) 1/2 (out of 4) Remake of the 1980 film has a 15-year-old girl (Brittany Snow) being stalked by a deranged teacher who eventually kills her mother. The teacher is sent to a nut house but escapes three years later just as the girl is about to go to prom. As with most modern remakes this one here pretty much just borrows the title and setting of the original film and tries to work on its own. This is certainly the worst of these modern remakes that I've seen and I was really shocked at how bad this film was. The direction is among the worst I've ever seen from someone doing a studio film, although I've heard some come to his defense saying there wasn't anything to be done with this screenplay. Perhaps that's somewhat true but the murder sequences are among the worst I've ever seen and there's not a bit of life to the movie. There's also no atmosphere and no suspense, which again falls on the director. The performances are what you'd expect from a film like this but Snow never really jumps out or stands out, which, again, isn't good for a slasher like this. The "unrated" version I watched still wasn't too graphic. The final avoids a BOMB rating from me as it does pick up during the final ten minutes and one character is killed who wouldn't normally be killed in a film like this so I will give it credit for that but this is no reason to sit through this film.</fullReview>

This movie is one of the best newer horror movies I've seen in a long time. I'm so sick of the gore horror movies...we've been needing a really good horror flick that's more scary than gross and we finally have it. The acting in this movie was pretty good I thought, and the cast did a great job. The story line was good. It may not have been TOTALLY believable, but it was a lot more believable than Hatchet or some of those other retarded movies I've seen recently. I definitely think this movie deserves a watch because it really is an incredible movie. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prom Night 2008, can not understand why all the bad comments. True it has very little to do with the original but that aside it is actually a really great film. Keep in mind that for PG-13 it still manages to be a horror film. I believe that was smart on the studios part since 13 and older would be the target audience for a movie that is about a prom whether it be "The Prom" or any high school dance. Britney Snow might have helped carry the movie, not sure, but still in the end it was up there with the rest. The movie has a sharp well polished look to it, and for many of the actors (not all of them) they are pretty likable and pass for any scary movie. By the way might be one of the sexiest serial killers since Michael Myers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly refreshing - not great - teen thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me Prom Night was actually a pleasant viewing. After reading the copious negative reviews on IMDb, and an appalling (then) 3.7 rating, I was expecting bad acting, no script, no brainer slasher, but this is not what Prom Night is at all. A brief synopsis - maniac falls in love with schoolgirl, kills family, gets arrested, goes to jail, escapes from jail, goes looking for schoolgirl. Simple enough, and this is where the bulk of the film begins - Senior Prom Night, and the night Mr Maniac picks to ..uh.. woo Mrs Schoolgirl ..? Okay, so there's better and easier nights to pick, but this wouldn't do much for the films title. The movie gets underway like any other average teen horror, predictable killings and cheap scares as the killer closes in on his prey, there's a small amount of underlying tension building throughout the first half, but it could have been done so much better if it wasn't ruined by the typical Hollywood rush job. But okay, its not a masterpiece. The second act for me is the best. I enjoyed the way the film introduced a Police Detective with evident intelligence, and as we soon learn the killers close on the tail of our schoolgirl heroine, the film reaches its best parts, and we're not just seeing the film almost purely from the viewpoint of the victim (like so many poor horrors), but seeing the whole situation for what it is. We're stepping back and saying 'Here We Are, This is Where We're At' and this for me was refreshing. The third act was predictably the big...let down. I take back the Police Detectives evident intelligence, you've let me down sir..some bad decisions on your half. Bit of an anticlimax ending also, but hey, what ya gonna do.The acting? Good actually. No Oscars here, but there were hardly any cheesy lines, fake expressions or what not. Brittany Snow is good, and the supporting cast do what they can with the airtime they're given. Overall, not a bad film. Probably better for me going in with low expectations, which may have heightened the experience. Its not a horror though, which some people may argue why it was bad. Come to this film expecting a thriller and you'll enjoy it more. There's no gore, not a lot of suspense and no creepy haunted house here. This is the straight to DVD kind of thriller. Some people will moan about the predictable clichés (there were some) and the predictable plot (okay, the final act was predictable) but lets face it, its not going for any Film of the Year awards. Its good fun, just sit back, go in with no expectations and enjoy the ride. There are so many awful awful films out there with better ratings than 3.7, this isn't one of them.Craig</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole movie were people going up to the hotel room one by one and getting killed. It was also predictable. Those are the main bad reasons. Some good things i liked was the suspense. it was jumpy. Also, it kinda makes you think of what you would do in this situation. I haven't seen the original PROM NIGHT so i don't know what to compare it to. My best is that if you saw and liked I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER then you would probably like PROM NIGHT (2008), butPROM NIGHT (2008) is more of a cat and mouse kind of movie. What else can you expect from a PG-13 horror movie? Fits my standards an overall was a decent movie that we all could have lived without.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We should have known that the main character would have lived in this movie. Why did the only black woman in the entire movie have to be killed? Why did people continue to go upstairs when their friends didn't return? That psychopath should have been locked under the jail in this movie. Why didn't they send him to jail when he killed the main character's mother father and brother? This movie had a lot of suspense in it. We were sitting at the edge of our seats the entire time while watching this. Unfortunately, so many innocent people were murdered by that crazy man before he was finally taken down. And Idris did a good job as the detective. We all should have known he was going to save the day. I feel so guilty laughing at this horror movie. It was more funny than scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a bad remake of a bad seventies slasher movie starring Jamie Lee Curtis.If you like fake scares--Oh, it's just her aunt, it's just some pigeons that have no earthly reason to be there, and my favorite, OH! It's just a lamp--this is your movie.There are really only two surprises in the entire film. It's typical bad slasher movie. In its day, the original Prom Night was just a bad attempt to recreate the John Carpenter Halloween-magic. 25 years later, some are still trying to match it......and failing.And the PG-13 rating doesn't help....we don't even get to see any old-fashioned sex and gore--usually in that order.Though the performances were good, the characters and the storyline, different from the original, were just not engaging. By the end I didn't care so much about who lived and who died as much as I cared about when it would be over.Skip Prom Night. If you want scared, go see The Ruins. I found myself laughing more than screaming. OK, that's a lie......I didn't scream I give it a C for "Who Crapped This Thing?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. That's all I can say. This movie is definitely NOT a remake of the 1980 original, even though every review and ad I read in the papers claimed it was. It's really nothing other than a badly clichéd 'horror' knock-off. I like the original. Yes, Jamie Lee Curtis is in it, but she's not even the main focus of that movie which many seem to have forgotten. Anyway, I digress...This very typical, ordinary, plain and so-bad-and-cliché-you-can-say-what's-going-to-happen-before-it-does 'film' should have been direct-to-DVD, if even that. It's like a cable special that somehow made it to the screen. All of the actors are too old and not very likable/relatable. When they're offed, you could care less. It's crap masquerading under the Prom Night title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the feeling that the movie wouldn't be that great, but I still wanted to see it anyway, though I hate PG-13 horror. So I went into this with an open mind and really was blown away. The performances are pretty decent and no-one is a bad actor, a little blood would have been nice when they died though. Knowing who the killer is right away, and having him as Donna's teacher, makes him that little more scary than a Michael or a Jason. It was refreshing to watch a horror movie without guts, unnecessary nudity, or the F-word in every sentence. Overall the movie felt sort of 80's in a way. Yes it is occasionally old-school, yes it is predictable, and yes it is sometimes cheesy, but that's what I liked. I highly recommend this movie for a fun time, but leave your mind at the door otherwise you won't have fun. I look forward to the Extended DVD for more.</fullReview>

He looked like the real deal, his face was just enough to be...wow! Brittany Snow was great. Nicely filmed as said great angles. The scenes were switched back and forth very nicely although maybe some weren't needed. There were a couple of little corny things that happened but it was good!:) In some way it reminded me of Flightplan, how the guy has everyone fooled into thinking something else and plays out his hidings and tricks so smoothly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie, i went to see it three different times in the theater last April. I know that ti was a remake, but it didn't really follow the same plot line as the 1980 flick. Don't get me wrong, i love both of them, but the 1980s Prom Night was more of a slasher flick and 2008's Prom Night is more of a suspense thriller, which totally rocked. If you are a fan of Brittany Snow and Jessica Stroup, like I am, then you will definitely die for this flick. Brittany Snow(John Tucker Must Die) finds herself target by an escaped mental patient Johnathan Schaech(The Forsaken and Hush), who comes after her three years later after targeting her and her family. When she goes to her senior prom with her close friends Jessica Stroup(90210 and Hills Have Eyes 2), Scott Porter, Dana Davis, Collins Pennie, Kelly Blatz, he hides inside the hotel, waiting to strike. As her friends begin to disappear, she must confront her past in hopes to survive the night. This movie really rocked, i like the ones with obsessive psychopaths and the things that they will do to express their love. So definitely check it out and its also a Screen Gems release.</fullReview>

McCormick is not a well known directer but he outdid himself on PROM NIGHT. The characters were well created. If this was the film that had Jamie Lee Curtis, I would go out of my mind! This picture is better than the original. I like the plot better, both movies have very good plots, but the new two-thousand eight version was executed in a better matter. This movie is dated to release on DVD in Augusr, I will rent or even buy it, and i will have a more vivid comment. I look forward to more thrillers from McCormick, but I hope there are't any sequels to PROM NIGHT (2008). By the way, to the negative people, you can not compare this movie to its original. You can't go picking it apart. Love it for what it is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this was a really good remake! Although the story is very different to the original, to me, it's still a remake. In the original, the killer was masked and you don't find out until the end, but this time, you know exactly who the killer is. In the original, the prom is at Hamilton High School, in this one, it's at a Grand Hotel. The prom was visually pretty! In the original, a little girl died six years before the prom, and the kids responsible swear not to tell no one, and the killer comes to the prom to kill them, in the remake, a teacher named Richard Fenton becomes obsessed with a student named Donna, and he breaks out of prison 3 years later to see her again and will kill anyone who gets in his way. I also like how it was more police-oriented and showed them searching the rooms of the hotel. Detective Winn is cool. He reminds me of Dr. Loomis in Halloween. Also, Donna is very sexy. If you want to see the movie for a straight remake of the original, you'll be highly disappointed, but if you stay open-minded and enjoy the movie for what it is, hopefully you'll love it! I highly recommend PROM NIGHT!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Teenage Slasher Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides all the girls in the theater screaming their heads off every two minutes, it was an amazing movie. Johnathon Schaech gave an amazing performance as Richard Fenton. Hes the perfect guy to play the role of a creepy killer. The amount off effort that Brittany Snow put into her role as Donna Keppel. Brittany Snow is nicely cast as the vulnerable Donna whose nightmares give us an early opportunity to understand the circumstances in which her parents and brother were murdered. There's fun and laughter as Donna and her two best friends prepare for their big night with cool frocks, hairdos, stretch limos, attentive boyfriends and high expectations. From the start, director Nelson McCormick injects jabs of uncertainty into the proceedings. Tension builds as we, the audience, know more than the characters. There's the clanging of the hangers in the closet, the creaking door, a disappearing face in the mirror, a figure in the doorway. There are screams, a splash of bright red blood and shadows in the darkness. Predictably, the first victim is someone we don't know. The next is someone we care little about. Then the killings step up a notch.McCormick toys with the tone, flitting back and forth to the light and gleam of the ultra modern LA Club-style prom for relief, after each killing. There's a contrast of obsessions - between Johnathon Schaech's darkly broody killer, Richard Fenton, and Idris Elba's Detective Winn. Fenton obsesses about Donna as something he must possess, while the detective is determined to stop Fenton at all costs. Schaech, with his angular features and disturbing stare is a convincing villain while excellent editing by Australian Jason Ballantine (Wolf Creek, Rogue) keeps the story moving as it neatly unsettles our equilibrium. Unashamedly catering for its target market, Prom Night delivers pretty much what you expect with enough scares to satisfy but not to keep you awake till the wee small hours. If your into suspenseful horror movies or just wanna see a good movie, i strongly suggest you go see this movie as soon as possible. and i know this review isn't detailed about the movie, but thats because i don't want to spoil it for you. and trust me, you wont want to miss this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people are saying that this is horrible...but they are wrong wrong wrong. I love this movie, I screamed a few times not because I was all that scared but because it really makes you jump. Brittany Snow is very good at playing a character like this, she is very believable. I am definitely going to watch this more than once. It was over way way to fast, but there isn't ever one boring second. I really enjoyed this film, and it is definitely worth going to see.It is very suspenseful, its not as scary as it has been made out to look, but it will keep you on your toes for sure. Definitely a slumber party movie. The best movie I have yet to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Movie! Definitely Worth it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand all the negative reviews about this movie. Its an awesome, suspenseful mystery thriller. Its not really a horror film but more of a thriller. The acting was awesome. Brittany Snow was perfect. She was awesome and her poor character has such a depressing life. Her friends and family dead. Definitely go see this movie. It is well worth it. Ignore these negative reviews because they don't apply to this amazing movie. I also love how there wasn't any gore. I don't like gore. This movie was just perfect and I'm going to go again. The person who played the teacher was awesome too. Perfect man for the part. I was scared going to sleep last night! Sum it all up..great movie..go see it...its a fun night of entertainment..Overall 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extremely fun suspenseful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prom Night was very close to the best movie of the year. I honestly loved it so much. I thought that it was so suspenseful and hip. I loved the sudden scenes that would make you jump. In my opinion their were only a couple that got me jumping. The rest of the theatre though every single five minutes they would scream and jump. The theatre was getting very annoying. It was pretty hard to enjoy the movie listening to all the young teenagers scream and talk. So when you can enjoy the movie even with the young teens it must be a good movie. It didn't even seem like a remake based on the original. I had seen the original one and it was very different than this one, it had nothing the same at all. The whole entire cast was great. I loved the killer they chose for this movie who was played by Johnathon Schaech. He did a great job making himself look like what a real stalker would. Brittany Snow did a very good job as well surprisingly. Everyone thought she would do a bad job. I also thought she would to but she did a good job. She didn't act like a dumb blonde. It was very different from what I expected though. I didn't think that the hotel they stayed at would be where the prom was held. This was a very fun movie to watch. I think mostly teenagers would enjoy this movie. The story was pretty cliché but in my opinion I liked the story a lot. Some of the visuals were pretty cool at the prom. If you want a lot of blood and gore you wont like this. If you are looking for suspense and pretty jump out of your seat scenes then this is the movie for you. It was amazing go see it. Overall I loved it and think that all the teenagers should go see this movie. The only thing is if you look for the theatre to be quiet it wont be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Night to die for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've not seen the original (1980) Prom Night but the remake was not really scary but it was quite entertaining. The story is about Donna (or Donor Kebabs for a laugh) who is away to a prom with her friends and expects it to be the best night of her life, but an obsessed killer is after her (which is related to her terrible past). The story is simple and the cast is unknown but it is better that way because then you can just concentrate on the mystery.At first the prom was beautiful with a great atmosphere but turns into horror. It is another low budget slasher movie which has been tackled a lot of times in Hollywood but I had no problem with it because I had a good time watching it and you can see every penny spent from the $18 million budget. Prom Night is not the kind of film that is going to appeal to everyone and it is best not to take it too seriously. I would recommend it to people who liked movies like Scream.</fullReview>
