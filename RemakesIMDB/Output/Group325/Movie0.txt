		<shortDescription>One of the classics of world cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do they clean the streets in Rio De Janeiro? Well, of course they do. When this carnival is over.And if you watch this movie you will see that they do it very near the end of the last reel, as in the morning when the truck comes round spraying water, just one of a thousand little details that director Marcel Camus got right, and one of the most insignificant. But it is from a multiplicity of detail that an edifice of cinematic genius is constructed.The true brilliance of Black Orpheus lies in the people who live on the side of the cliffs overlooking the harbor at Rio. It is their energy that prevails. Then there is the color, the costumes, the pounding rhythms, the spectacular vitality of life that is depicted as a carnival of dance and song in which we are driven along as on a wave. And yet there is the constant reality of death. And it strikes in way we cannot comprehend, fatalistically, and we are helpless to do anything about it. And then Orpheus sings, a new Orpheus perhaps, and the sun rises again, and a little girl in white, looking like Eurydice in miniature, begins to dance as the little boy Orpheus plays his guitar, telling us that time has come round again.Well, that's the plot as adapted by screen writer Jacques Voit from the play by Vinicius d Moraes as divined from the Greek mythology. Supporting this arresting conception is the music by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luis Bonfa. I recall the former as the composer of bossanova who gave us "The Girl from Ipanema" and made the samba international. Starring in the title role as the streetcar conductor who is loved by all is Beno Melo, who might be seen as the natural man and native of paradise. The very pretty Marpessa Dawn plays Eurydice, an innocent from the country who falls in love with Orpheus and his song. Lourdes de Oliveira plays his intended, Mira who is hot blooded, vital and beautifully ordinary. But the actress I recall most vividly from the time I first saw this in the sixties was Léa Garcia who played Serafina. Her exuberance and comedic flair struck me as something completely different from anybody I had ever seen before. And then there are the boys who follow Orpheus around and emulate his every move. With their torn shirts and unflagging optimism, they represent the new day that will dawn.If you haven't seen this classic of world cinema, you are in for a singular experience. There is nothing else like it that I know of. And it is as fresh today as when it was made almost half a century ago.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>Orpheus and Eurydice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is a film that deserves to be restored, "Orfeu Negro", seems to be a logical choice. Judging by the copy we recently saw at New York's Film Forum, it shows how the Eastmancolor in which it was photographed, has faded. This is a film that is about color as seen in that photogenic city that is Rio de Janeiro, with its infinite cacophony of colors and sexuality at the time of carnival.Vinicius de Moraes play, "Orfeu do Carnaval", served as the basis of inspiration for French director Marcel Camus and his co-writer, Jacques Viot, for the movie. Mr. Moraes adapted the Greek tragedy and transplanted it to Rio at the time of carnival. Nowhere in the world do people live just for those precious days of the year where everyone goes crazy during the annual ritual.The tragedy of Orpheus and Eurydice plays well against that backdrop. Orfeu, a tram conductor meets and falls in love with the beautiful an sweet Eurydice. Their love is doomed from the start because Orfeu has promised Mira he will marry her. They are seen prior to the fateful meeting going to register for a marriage license.Eurydice has a premonition that something will happen to her as a man dressed in a death costume and mask keeps following her, and at one point, he promises the young woman, he will return for her. In the meantime, Orfeu and Eurydice realize they are meant for one another. During the parade, Serafina, Eurydice's cousin exchanges places with her so she can stay home with the merchant marine boyfriend who has just arrived. Mira realizes the deceit and fights with Eurydice, who flees in horror, only to be follow by the Death figure."Orfeu Negro" relied on unknowns for the main characters. The handsome Bruno Mello and the gorgeous Marpessa Dawn play the doomed lovers with conviction. Jean Bourgoin's camera loved them and they are photographed against the colors of the carnival and Rio. Lourdes Oliveira and Lea Garcia have good moments as Mira and Serafina, respectively and Jorge DosSantos is a natural as Chico.The other best thing in the film is the fabulous music by Luiz Bonfa, and Antonio Carlos Jobim. The songs and the music we hear in the soundtrack proved these two men were on the way to establish themselves as the best composers and in the case of Mr. Jobim, interpreter of their creations which will culminate with the triumph of the Bossa Nova period that was produced in Brazil at the time.Marcel Camus, ultimately, is the man to be congratulated because of his vision in finding beauty even in the favelas where most of the action takes place in capturing the color and sensuality of Rio de Janeiro during carnival.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rio de Janeiro, where myths become real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it does nothing else, seeing "Black Orpheus" will make you want to pack up immediately and go to Rio de Janeiro. The movie convinces you that the city's sparkling harbor and dramatic green hills must be one of the most beautiful landscapes on earth, especially when accompanied by a soundtrack of energetic samba and smooth bossa nova music. The cliffside shantytowns teem with vitality, and are never too poor to rig up an elaborately costumed samba show for Carnival. Even the fact that the movie retells a tragic Greek myth barely detracts from the overall effect. It makes Rio seem even more magical, a place where archetypal stories of love and death still hold their power. In this version, Orfeu (Breno Mello) is a streetcar conductor who moonlights as a musician, and Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn) is an innocent country girl. The movie starts as a simple love triangle (Orfeu has an inconvenient fiancée) but becomes increasingly surreal as it progresses. Death, represented by a man in a skeleton suit, literally pursues Eurydice while going unnoticed by everyone else, who may assume he is just dressed up for Carnival. (His motivations are never explained, but perhaps he is jealous of Eurydice's youth and beauty.) The movie finds clever ways to depict the events of the original legend, and adds a wonderful sense of atmosphere, as Orfeu goes through the "underworld" in the middle of the night.Lourdes de Oliveira and Léa Garcia give vivid supporting performances, as, respectively, Orfeu's jealous fiancée and Eurydice's exuberant cousin. I also liked the two scrappy, unsentimental street kids who idolize Orfeu.Overall, "Black Orpheus" is a successful attempt to place a Greek myth in a modern context, retaining the story's original tragedy while adding new, contrasting flavors and rhythms. I would especially recommend it to fans of Baz Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge," another color- and-music-saturated film with a love story inspired by the Orpheus legend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie dazzles me so much that whenever I'm truly depressed, I can watch it and my mood elevates. It's hard to say what aspect is best: the cinematography is superb (makes you want to take the first plane to Rio), the cast is wonderful, the music is haunting and beautiful, and the Orpheus/Eurydice myth is well suited to the setting in a Rio favela. I've only seen it on video, but I keep hoping it will be revived somewhere so I can catch it on the big screen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of users will not believe it,but in his native France ,Marcel Camus's name is slowly fading.Worse,"Orfeo negro" is demeaned :it is given only one star in the French dictionary of films.Part of the reason can be found,I think ,in the rest of Camus's career which is mediocre and tarnished his magnum opus by association.But it's unfair.It's a shame a lot of young FRench young people do not even know the existence of this jewel."Orfeo negro" is perfection itself: -Its score is one of the most marvelous I can think of ,now stirring,now wistful as this unforgettable song to make the sun rise.-The Greek myth is superbly recreated ,and the exotic landscapes add magic to the script.-The actors are dynamic ;the three leads ,Breno Mello,Lourdes de OLiveira and the wunderkind Marpessa Dawn are excellent-why didn't she make the career she deserved?- -The original version is in Portuguese ,which shows Camus's respect for his audience.-Best scenes:perhaps the scenes in the house of death,with the walk in the papers;also the final scene where children are still there ,to help the sun rise again and again.The meeting with Death in a power station.An hymn to the sun and to immortality,"Orfeo Negro" is all this and more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Orfeu Negro" places the Orpheus legend in Rio de Janeiro at the time of its Carnival. Marcel Camus' film is fast paced, shot it beautiful color, has lovely and vibrant music (by Luis Bonfa and Antonio Carlos Jobim) and a most attractive cast, particularly the two leads. There is a vital, throbbing tempo established which seems to propel the story forward in an almost choreographic manner. The film remains a quite unique piece of work, with many haunting images.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Ehrenstein's Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Potential Spoilers!)From the moment of its first appearance, at the Cannes Film Festival in 1959--where it won the Palme d'Or--it was clear that Black Orpheus was a very special film. Taking the ancient Greek myth of a youth who travels to the land of the dead to bring back the woman he loves, and transporting it to the slums of modern day Rio de Janeiro, this bitter-sweet romantic tragedy has charmed audiences the world over with its beauty, color, and--above all--its music. In fact, so important is Black Orpheus' musical dimension that you might say the film's roots aren't in images but in sounds.The first shot shows an ancient frieze of the lovers, Orpheus and Eurydice. But what grabs your attention as it hits the screen is the sound of the music playing underneath it--a guitar softly strumming the chords of the film's main musical theme. A mood of quiet reverie is created only to be shattered almost immediately as the frieze explodes before our eyes, only to be replaced by a series of fast-moving shots of dancers preparing for Carnival. But even those colorful sights are undercut by a sound that, beginning here, runs through the length of the film--the eruptive, convulsive, infectious beat of the Latin American pop sound known as "bossa nova".Though bossa nova had been the cornerstone of Latin American music for many years, it's safe to say that prior to the release of Black Orpheus the world at large had never really heard it before. The film changed the world of music overnight. Its composers, Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luis Bonfá, became international stars. The film's main themes, "Manha de Carnival" and "O Nossa Amor," permeated the public consciousness in a way that hadn't been seen since Anton Karas' unforgettable zither theme for The Third Man. But make no mistake, none of these musical glories would have been possible without the film that holds them all together--Black Orpheus.The Orpheus of myth was the son of the god Apollo and Calliope, a muse. His singing tamed wild beasts and quited raging rivers. The Orpheus of the film is a lowly streetcar conductor whose singing makes him a favorite of the slum neighborhood where he lives. The original Eurydice was likewise high-born when compared to the film's heroine--a simple country girl visiting the big city of Rio for the first time in her life. Ordinarily saddling such everyday characters with mythological barnacles would make for dramatic awkwardness. But thanks to the context of Carnival it all works perfectly. A once-a-year blowout where rich and poor alike can masquerade in whatever identities they choose, Carnival is the ideal setting for sliding a mythical mask over commonplace reality. And director Marcel Camus proves to be quite adept at juggling this balancing act between the fantastic and the real.The figure of Death that pursues Eurydice through the streets of Rio could be the literal personification of fate--or the sort of everyday maniac found on the streets of any major city. Likewise, Eurydice's death from a streetcar cable is a neat transportation of the original legend in which she died from a serpent's bite on her leg. Best of all is the film's climax, in which Orpheus visits the underworld--here represented by Rio's Bureau of Missing Persons--and a Macumba ceremony in which he tries to make contact with his dead love. As in the legend, the story of the film ends on an unhappy note. Still this nominally sad conclusion is undercut by the spirit of the largely unprofessional cast (Breno Mello was the champion soccer player, Marcpessa Dawn a dancer from Pittsburgh); director Camus' obvious love for Rio and its people; and the joyous, rapturous, unforgettable musical score.--David Ehrenstein</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly a magical film! Black Orpheus (Orfeu Negro) transports you and makes you long for the Rio of the late 50s (slums and all). Marcel Camus has taken a classic tale of eternal love and transplanted it into "modern times" flawlessly. It has it all -- love, suspense, myth, music, dancing, tragedy -- set amidst the frenetic backdrop of the carnival. I'll always thank the friend who introduced me to this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Body in Dance and Heart in Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely have we encountered movies like this one: a timeless mythical story from Greece brought to screen in Brazilian context, the couple come from the very heart of Brazilian society, from Rio. Yet, what links them is the same sweet feeling that have linked the people for thousands of years no matter what nationality, beliefs or family background. Yes, that is what BLACK ORFEUS offers undeniably. The great romance that bursts out in the magnificence and lavishness of Rio's carnival when, truly, body in dance combines with heart in love. Yet, is that the only reason for calling this movie classic? As a matter of fact, there have been lots of love stories on screen that were quickly forgotten. What is, in fact, the very uniqueness of BLACK ORFEUS that differs it from other movies and that makes it an interesting cinema production after all these years? We could say, though ridiculous this may seem, that it is everything about this movie that makes it a timeless work on screen. Yet, such a generalized view may, of course, result in simplification and confusion. There are specifically two factors that make BLACK ORFEUS significant or still worth attention: the first one aforementioned timeless love story uniquely and accurately put in the context of Brazil, which, in itself, must have been a challenge due to its innovative nature but the task was beautifully crafted by the director; the second being the cinematography of the movie which still, after almost 50 years, appears to be astounding. Those two aspects, for many viewers, constitute this "everything." This enthusiasm may be compared to a beautiful painting you admire thanks to its exquisiteness. In the same way, any film which has an interesting story and is visually stunning occurs to be an unforgettable work of art. And indeed, BLACK ORFEUS is a lovely visual work, the colors are stunning and the imagery is brilliant. The gorgeous views of Rio, the beautiful moments of sunrise and the charming views of little houses overwhelm even the most cynical viewers. But what about the rest? Such aspects like performances or action cannot be analyzed in terms of modern cinema, according to what we find in the majority of Hollywood productions. Acting is superb yet their evaluation is exposed to certain opinions that not necessarily occur consistent. These are all Brazilian actors, many of whom are unexperienced when concerning "grand cinema" but this very fact appears to be beneficial for the film since their performances result in authenticity and freshness. You really have a feeling that you watch real people in the very circumstances of the carnival in Rio and their love is genuine. There is a perfect chemistry between Breno Mello as Orfeus and Marpessa Dawn as Eurydice. They beautifully fit to their roles and even their life stories proved that mysterious link. Consider that they both died the same year... Lourdes Oliveira gives rather a funny performance as Mira but is also memorable.IL ORFEU NEGRO is a very valuable film, a sweet and authentic love story that will for long maintain in your memory as body in dance during the carnival and heart in love during romance. I highly recommend it hoping that like the song of Orfeus was capable of bringing sunrise to the world, this movie will bring in many people the rise of quest for beauty and a profound admiration of tenderness. Only then we can find simple things unusual just like the little boy who perceived his kite as the beautiful sun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Voodoo and Samba as the Root of Black Orpheus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many reasons Black Orpheus is important to cinema. First, how many people know that prior to Marcel Camus making this film the late Orson Welles attempted to capture Rio Carnival but with no story, plot, or script? In 1942, Welles discovered voodoo was at the root of the carnival samba, and started filming in the favelas, the slum shanty towns on the hills of Rio...it was considered by Hollywood to be anti-establishment and dangerous by Brazilian authorities. Thus, Welles was not able to complete his film.Samba is a Portuguese form of music, the word was derived from the West African bantu word "semba", meaning "invoke the spirit of the ancestors". Long outlawed as a dangerous expression of black slave culture, samba music eventually gained legitimacy and became a big part of carnival.Nearly 20 years later Black Orpheus achieves what Welles was trying for and goes beyond it. To start Marcel Camus had a script to work from whereas Welles was trying to wing it on the spot. Camus successfully recreated the Orpheus-Eurydice myth using the Rio Carnival as the back drop. The main characters retain the mythological names, including the symbolic Death. This works because it is Afro-Latin culture where pagan-Christian names were more evident and because the Carnival itself was such an important part of the story. History manifests as a deja vu, a cyclical progression of event and re-incarnation, understood only by the occultic transformation of samba, trance and possession, for which the Carnival is the engine.To those who misunderstand or are ignorant of samba, voodoo, or the Rio Carnival Black Orpheus may seem overwhelming, especially because of all the singing and dancing but samba (and Carnival) is ritual, in its most elementary form it is a raw cacophony of primitive drumming, clapping, chanting... and the droning cries of the dancers who stagger on the edge of the "stage", seeking possession and reincarnation.Black Orpheus won the Palm d'Or in 1959 at Cannes. It was seen as progressive because it featured black actors and the pluralist culture of modern Brazil. It also gives outsiders a view inside of a ritualistic, non-Western culture and that is why it was and is so important to cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, innocent and sad; and with a great score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Morning, such a pretty morning. A new song is born, Singing of your eyes, your laughter, your hands. There will be a day when you come From the strings of my guitar That only your love sought. A voice comes and talks about kissing, Kisses lost in your lips. Sing, my heart, happiness is back In the dawn of this love." And so Orpheus (Breno Mello), a happy-go-lucky trolley conductor in Rio de Janeiro, and Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn), a young girl from the country who has come to stay with her cousin in a Rio slum high on a mountain overlooking the city, fall in love. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed. Orpheus is handsome, confident and loves women as much as they love him. When he discovers Eurydice, however, she becomes all he has ever wanted. But Eurydice, caught up in her joy with Orpheus, still is frightened of a man masked as Death who she is convinced intends to kill her. But carnival is starting. There are costumes to buy and masks to wear, dancing to practice, life to be enjoyed. Through it all, the hot, sensual bossa nova beat of Antonio Carlos Jobin's and Luis Bonfa's music permeates everything. The movie is so lyrical, so innocent and so joyous as it starts that it's easy to hope that in this version of the Greek myth there will be a different ending. There is not. But the intensity of carnival carries us along. The happiness and spirit of the friends and neighbors of Orpheus captures us just as much as the music. The almost child-like passion of Orpheus and Eurydice is so open and true, we realize that it can't last. One of the most lyrical passages is early in the movie when Orpheus begins to play on his guitar a song he has written. Two scruffy little boys are with him. They believe Orpheus can make the dawn come by playing his guitar at daybreak. As Orpheus plays, one boy holds a baby goat and the other a rooster to keep them quiet. "Morning, such a pretty morning, a new song is born..." Orpheus sings. Next door, Eurydice hears him and stops to listen. In that moment the myth becomes a real thing. And Orpheus, after he and Eurydice have slept the night together, sings another song while Eurydice dreams on... "My happiness is dreaming in the eyes of my lover. It's like this night, passing, Seeking the dawn. Speak low, please, So she might wake up happy, Offering a kiss of love. Sadness has no end. Happiness does. Happiness is like a drop of dew on a flower's petal, Brilliant and tranquil, then grieving, Then falling like a tear of love." Then carnival arrives, and so does Death. At the end of the movie Orpheus and Eurydice are joined for eternity. On the mountain top as dawn breaks, the two little boys bring the new sun as one plays Orpheus' guitar and Orpheus' song "...Morning, such a pretty morning. A new song is born..." They are joined by a little girl, dressed in white, who begins to dance around them, and they join her. At this point, I didn't know whether to smile or cry. I think I did both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't go for art films but I'm a fan of Greek Mythology so this had an interesting twist to it. It's definitely a movie u have to watch with no interruptions,the pulsating music and spirited performances move u along swiftly to the inevitable sad climax. The cast is all newcomers and do very well in their roles. It's fascinating to see the poverty of Rio but the carnival lifts everybody up like a religious experience and provides an escape from their dreary lives. The photography is first rate. Supposedly some of the Carnival footage is from a film Orson Welles shot in 1941 called It's All True but he was so long shooting it,RKO cancelled the production. The director of Orpheous staged a fake carnival on a side street in the Rio slums with 200 extras,much to his delight the entire neighborhood got excited about filming and the crowd swelled to 20,000,making it a really lavish spectacle,complete with dancing and costumes. The Criterion DVD has great sound and color. I usually like to use the subtitles but for some resin they don't match the English soundtrack so it's best to leave it off,unless u want to hear the original Portugese.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brazil's election as host of the 2016 Olympics creates a really big reason to watch Marcel Camus's "Orfeo Negro" ("Black Orpheus" in English). I had never known the Orpheus myth until I saw this film, and what a way to learn it! Of course the movie's main pleasure is to see Carnaval. In this version, Rio de Janeiro conductor Orpheus (Bruno Mello) falls in love with country woman Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn), but can't forget his relationship with Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira). The bossa nova soundtrack is like a character by itself. To be certain, Antonio Carlos Jobim is best known for "Girl from Ipanema".All in all, this is a truly fine experience. As it turns out, Barack Obama's mother Ann Dunham saw "Black Orpheus" in the theater - before she met Barack Sr. - and it was her first real exposure to black culture.Really great.</fullReview>

The setting of the Orpheus story in the hillsides and streets of Rio, with the brilliant actors, is nothing short of a miracle. Everything in the movie is beautiful to look at, and the music becomes as much a part of the atmosphere as the very air these beautiful actors breathe. The final scene, with the children, being magically prepared to fall into the roles the adults have just left, must remain with the viewer as one of the most affecting things in this magnificent movie.

A further comment I read was that Bossa Nova had been the cornerstone of Latin American music for many yearsLatin American ? N?o ! Brazilian ! Many years before Black Orpheus ???I didn't think Messrs Jobim, de Morais and Gilberto were that old ?A Brazilian who did not like the film has commented that to depict the lives of the poor in the favelas as carefree and happy as inaccurate ? Surely they must have some dignity even in poverty? Surely they must smile sometimes? Tragedy and Saudade. Tristeza and Tragedy. Of course there is tragedy the film is based on a Greek play. Too much tragedy and the film would not have any balance, it would be too dark. Too dark in the Brazilian sunshine. It is Carnaval, a time to sing and dance and forget the tragedy of poverty and the favelas. It is Carnaval and Samba rules. If you don't like the "Feijoada" and Samba of Brasil go out for a McDonalds. Throw away the burger and eat the box ? you wont know the difference, real food is not for you, or real music.To quote Dorival Caymmi:- "Who does not like Samba you'd rather not meet "There's sick in the head or lame in the feet."A great film, a film that introduced Bossa Nova and Samba to a World with shoes made of lead. Listen to the beat can you stay in your seat ? Onions ? Is that a tear I see in your eye for two tragic lovers serenaded by soulful music ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that gets better as it goes along. It starts out working too hard to show how colorful and full of life the Brazilians are. This was directed by a Frenchman, and although it is sympathetic to its subjects, there's a tinge of condescension as well. This fades into the background as the plot kicks in.The film is a retelling of the Orpheus myth-- does the film achieve mythic power? Not quite, but it comes a lot closer than you would be expecting from the beginning of the film. The film tries to answer the question of whether there is value in trying to be happy when happiness will be destroyed, and what-- if anything-- is left when that happens. The words of the ultra-famous bossa nova song Tristeza ('sadness') asks, and tries to answer, this question as it recurs throughout the film.The acting is uneven, but ultimately effective at convincing us of the emotions that matter most in this film: love, fear, and loss. That the protagonists are physically beautiful helps them bear the burden of being myth-figures: that, and the fact that they don't try to "act mythical".The film's use of the Orpheus myth is not at all subtle. But the performance of Mello as Orpheu gains depth as the character's dogged refusal to believe he has lost Eurydice carries him through the "underworld" of Rio in search of her. And I was moved by the ending, as Orpheu tries to invoke the blessings of a new day to keep his hope and his love alive.I haven't seen another film quite like this one-- I think this is reason enough to see it. The music is great of course, and it's interesting to see a Carnival of Rio back when it was still an event for ordinary people: now it's an international tourist event. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Music, Carnaval and love story. All in a mythical Brasil, in soft pagan shadows and old Greek memory. A gentle film about desire and hate, about revenge and death.A marvelous film thanks to the precision of details. The soul of ancient tragedy is present. The Latino hubbub, with pre- Christian rites and images inebriation is present too and the movie is result of this subtle fight and wonderful completion.It is hard to define a film of this category. Artistic value is part of scenes in personal past and the film is only ladder for a golden age space. So, the gifts of "Orfeu Negro" is perfect refinement, the delicate acting."Black Orpheus" is a precious tracery about human condition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>should have scrapped the classical myth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know using the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice is considered an admirable things about this film, but I thought it added nothing to the plot and, in fact, wrenched things about in ways that made parts of the film quite incomprehensible. We'll let pass the absurdity of the names that derived from the myth, these Portuguese-speaking Brazilians with names like Orpheus, Eurydice, Hermes and dogs named Cerberus. That was bearable, although it put the film slightly off-kilter. The Orpheus and Eurydice myth really came into play near the end, when Eurydice is lost and Orpheus searches desperately for her. When I was young and first saw this film, not knowing the myth, this section seemed like utter nonsense; today, I see the nonsense is there, and I can see why, because the film maker was willing to shoehorn his story into the myth, no matter the consequences.The essence of the myth is Orpheus descending into the underworld to rescue his wife; he plays his lyre, so beautifully that no one can deny him, not even the guardians of the underworld, who allow him to lead Eurydice out of the underworld, on condition he not look back at her until both are safely back in the world of light. Just as he himself steps out into the light, he looks back, too soon, and Eurydice disappears from him forever. But what has that to do with the story in this film? The film is a modern, realistic love story. In the climactic scene after Orfeus has searched everywhere for Eurydice, he is taken to a crowded room where a voodoo-like ceremony is under way. He is told to "call" for Eurydice if he wants to find her, so he joins in the mass, ritualistic song, so quietly that his voice cannot be heard - quite a departure from the Greek myth. An old woman behind him appears to be possessed by a spirit, and she speaks with the voice of Eurydice, asking Orfeus if he loves her enough to be satisfied with her voice, never to look on her again. He turns to see where the voice is coming from, and all traces of Eurydice disappear. Now where is the sense in this, in terms of the story we have watched up to this point? We've been following an entirely realistic love story for over 90 minutes, in which the woman has gone missing and her lover has been searching desperately for her. Where has she gone? Has she died? Has she been kidnapped? No, an old lady in a voodoo ceremony speaks with her voice. Huh? What's this about? She tells him he must not try to look at her. Say what? Why not? No reason, it's just all nonsense. He turns to look, and we are to believe that he will never find his lover again. Again we ask why not? Does this make any sense at all? No, it doesn't, except in so far that the realistic love story has been wrenched and mangled in order to fit, in a rough sort of way, the plot line of an old Greek myth.The film would have been far better off to provide a proper resolution to the situation, one which fit with the realistic, this-world ethos of the rest of the movie. In my opinion, the use of the myth interfered in a bad way with an otherwise interesting and enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Orpheus is great entertainment as well as a classic, but for me it also calls into question cultural history as we know it. It is unexplainable how a film so far above the level of the culture of 1959 could exist. It is like the Pyramids. Part of the answer of course is it is not an American film. In a year that brought an academy award with Ben Hur, a corny Roman epic, The Nun's Story, Porgy and Bess and Some Like It Hot, there could be film so far above the fray as Black Orpheus. That's what a classic is, but what a classic! Black Orpheus is not about racism, American or otherwise. It has nothing to do with race. Race is swept off the board in one sweep by the fact that there is no white person in the film. It takes place in the heart of Rio in a place where white culture is simply non-existent so far as the film is concerned. Nor is it a coy, self-conscious effort to elevate blacks by producing an all-black film, but it simply is a product of the culture it depicts. And just as simply it excels and out distances other films being produced in the same decade not just quantitatively. It makes me think that the producers were entirely above in sophistication, like the Titans or the Illuminati.The tale of Orpheus and Eurydice is enacted against the backdrop of the primitive energy of Carnivale, but backdrop is the wrong word. It is the music, the rhythm of Carnival,its primitivity, which enables the myth of Opheus to once again spring into reality.Anyone who enters the theater prepared for a didactic treatment about race will leave cleansed by the film's innocence of such issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I became familiar with international films back in the 1960's watching L.A. television. Most were dubbed in English. Unfortunately, the original English language version for this film is no longer to be had. An English language version exists on DVD now, but the music sound quality isn't great. Best to watch this beauty with English subtitles.And music is what makes this love story great. Orpheus learns the meaning of true love with his neighbor's cousin, Eurydice, amid the relentless rhythms of Rio's Carnival.The film is a bit artsy. Of course, a film seen dozens of times is vulnerable to scrutiny. However, the images burst with the natural color and beauty of Rio. It was obvious that the intention of the makers was to contrast the genuine happiness that can be discovered in human affection with the short-lived, superficial pleasure found in Carnival. The ceremony to evoke the dead was most likely authentic. If not, it was over-the-top, conceptually. The mixing of real and contrived imagery was superbly achieved.Black Orpheus is a timeless, cinematic treasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would never have taken a look at this film except for that haunting theme by Jobim. Back in the 60's CBC-TV's Saturday Night Summer movies used the "Carnival" song Orphee composes as their "theme music". After years of hearing it, I had to track down the source and finally the film. And I was not disappointed at all. I had seen this film after viewing Cocteau's version of Orpheus (which I absorbed with fascination). But in the end I decided that I preferred this 'earthy' telling of the tale, set in the magic and hysteria of Carnival in Rio. All the actors seem so natural. I feel as though I am catching a glimpse of "reality", and at the same time I know the universality of the story being told. It is haunting and sad and yet leaves you feeling there is hope. That the sun will rise when the song is played. And that is the magic of Jobim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Modern updating of the Greek legend "Orpheus and Eurydice" set in Rio during Carnival. Local man meets a naive young woman from the country and they fall in love, but theirs is a doomed affair: he's set to marry a man-hungry spitfire and she's being stalked by a mysterious admirer in costume. French-Brazilian co-production was an international hit and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, so it's rather a pity it isn't better. There's wonderful music by Luiz Bonfá and Antonio Carlos Jobim, local ambiance and romance, but the story is awfully creaky by now, and the direction is flat and inexpressive. The color cinematography gives the film a tasty allure, but this verbose plot is ready-built for tragedy, and ultimately all we are left with is the locale and the pretty samba music. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Black Orpheus" (1959), directed by Marcel Camus, is based on a play which is an adaptation of the Greek legend of Orpheus and Eurydice. The story is modernized, set in a favela in Rio de Janeiro at Carnavale.Everyone is excited and preparing for carnival. The children dance, the women, sexy and uninhibited, dance as they go about their daily activities. Into this festive atmosphere comes the shy Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn) who is visiting her cousin Serafine (Lea Garcia) in order to escape a man that she claims wants to kill her. She rides to the end of the train line, and meets the handsome conductor, Orfeu (Breno Mello), who comes on to her, but she pushes him away. Eurydice's cousin is happy to see her, though she's expecting to be joined shortly by her boyfriend Chico (Waldemar de Souza).Orfeu is engaged to to the slender, vivacious Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira) who wants to get a marriage license that very day. When the man at the license bureau hears Orfeu's name, he asks if Mira is Eurydice. Not knowing the story, Mira becomes jealous and wants to know who she is. She then wants Orfeu to buy her an engagement ring, though what he really wants to do is get his guitar out of hock. She buys the ring; he gets his guitar. Eventually he and Eurydice fall in love, and the mythology is played out as the costumed Death lurks nearby.This is a astonishingly stunningly beautiful, exuberant film filled with color, scenery, gorgeous music, dancing, and beautiful people enjoying carnival in their bright costumes. The most famous part of the film, of course, is its magnificent bossa nova score by Antônio Carlos Jobim and Vinícius de Moraes, though the most famous song, Manh? de Carnaval (A Day in the Life of a Fool) was written by Luiz Bonfa.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the two children, Benedito and Zeca (Jorge Dos Santos and Aurino Cassiano) who follow Orfeu around and believe that his guitar playing causes the sun to rise in the morning. The final scene of the two boys dancing and a little girl joining them is fantastic.What a movie. It was Obama's mother's favorite, and with good reason. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exuberant tragedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Greek mythology and transferred to modern day Rio at Carnival, Black Orpheus resonates with a colorful energetic euphoria that will have you dancing in the aisles or your living room in no time. Country girl Euridice arrives in Rio the week of carnival. Disoriented and intimidated by the big city she crosses paths with streetcar conductor Orfeo, very much the rake but engaged to the incendiary self absorbed Miro. Orfeo falls heavily for Euridice who disguises herself to dance with Orfeo on the evening of the big parade. When Miro catches wind of the deception the festivities take on a ugly undertone.Soaked in samba and uninhibited joie de vivre it is hard not to be swept up in the controlled chaos that is Carnival in Rio. Director Marcel Camus does an excellent job of defining the city and capturing the mood and enthusiasm as backdrop for his doomed lovers as he moves his camera between the choking downtown to the mountainous favelas where joy and poverty live side by side. As the star crossed lovers Breno Melo and Marpessa Dawn are the ideal of youth and beauty caught up in the passions and rhythms of Rio and their hearts. Lourdes De Oliveira as Mira is a whirling dervish of dance and vengeance to behold while Lea Garcia as Serafina provides comedy relief.Regardless of its tragic overtones Black Orpheus in the hands of Camus and his mostly non- professional cast remains a celebration of life and love amid a colorful tableau of unrestrained, defiant joy. I would also argue that it is the best non-Italian color neo-realist musical in history if such a category existed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tuesday June 6, 7:15pm The NeptuneWhen Orpheus sang he calmed wild beasts, stilled the rivers and made the trees dance. To save his lover Eurydice he descended into hell. Marcel Camus' brilliant adaptation of this classic Greek myth moves to the hypnotic sounds of Rio de Janeiro during Carnival as parades of luminous brown bodies dance with abandon in a riot of color and sensual extravagance, set to the pulsating beat of the Bossa Nova. Black Orpheus seduced an international film audience in 1959, combining warm Brazilian rhythms with the story of a singing streetcar conductor and a country girl, thrust together in the wild pre-lent abandon, only to meet their tragic and legendary fate. Eurydice dies when she is 'bitten' by an electric trolley car line and Orpheus, denying her death, travels to the Bureau of Missing Persons to find her before death ultimately finds him. Cinemaphiles should consider this extraordinary film required viewing.</fullReview>

And Marpessa Dawn is a beautiful Euridice; I believe Cocteau met her in Paris and I was dumbfounded to find out she was an American (or is, if she's still living).Possible spoiler but I don't believe it is: And Death is absolutely chilling as he mingles in the crowd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With such an interest in Greek mythology, I found this to be an interesting take on the old story of Orpheus and Eurydice. In the Greek tale, Eurydice dies and Orpheus, who sings to the rising sun everyday, is lost and heartbroken. With the opportunity to bring her back from the fires of Hades, Orpheus embarks on a journey which is almost successful. However, his impatience (he cannot look at Eurydice as they walked out of Hades) proves to be Orpheus' undoing. This film brought a whole new flair to the old story, setting the myth during the days of Mardi Gras. Fluid with multiple colors and dancing, this film encompasses the beauty and rhythm of the Brazilian nation. An interesting and colorful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Greek legend of Orpheus and Eurydice updated to Rio de Janeiro of 1959 during carnival. It's shot in bright color and is subtitled. Orpheus (Breno Mello) is being pushed into marriage by beautiful but dangerous Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira). Then he meets sweet innocent Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn) and falls in love. But Death is stalking Eurydice and Mira will kill to get Orpheus...I only know the bare facts of the Greek legend and I think you DO need some knowledge of it to totally enjoy the film...but maybe not. The film is bursting with energy...there is virtual nonstop music and some of the most incredible dancing I've ever seen in a film. What's most pleasing about this film is seeing a community of black Porteguese men and women who are always there for each other and always happy and dancing. It may not be realistic but it fits the movie perfectly. Mello and Dawn are both attractive with great bodies and make a very likable couple. de Oliveira is downright frightening as Mira...and the appearance of Death (a man in a skintight black costume with a skull mask) is actually quite scary. But it's the music and dancing that propels this film...it takes up a great part of it and you can't take your eyes off the screen! Towards the end I actually caught myself sort of "dancing" in my seat bopping to the music! The film does drag down a little at the end when a character dies and a strange (and dull) voodoo ceremony is thrown in...but this is a small complaint. A riveting beautiful film--I've been lucky enough to see it twice in a theatre. I give it a 9.</fullReview>

This movie is on par with other great timeless classics: The Seven Samurai by Akira Kurosawa, Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, for example. They are all movies with depth and passion. They not only tell a story, which they do well, but delve into the minds and hearts of the characters. In The Seven Samurai the passion is in the fight for Honor, and in the power of good over evil. In Casablanca the passion is in the love of two people which must ultimately take second place to the greater good of mankind. In Black Orpheus the passion is in the enduring love of a man and a woman.

		<fullReview>I had first watched this subtitled in French following my second viewing of Jean Cocteau's seminal masterwork ORPHEUS (1950); both these factors contributed to my being let down by the film, so I was anxious to give it a second - and proper - viewing.Still, I might go so far as to say that I liked it even less this time around: while the Rio Carnival certainly offers the tragic love story of Orpheus and Eurydice a vivid and uniquely offbeat - if relentlessly noisy - backdrop, there's simply too much local color here (the non-stop dancing is particularly grating) proceeding to rather overwhelm the plot itself...which is what drew me to it in the first place! In fact, the figure of Death which pursues Eurydice doesn't turn up until 40 minutes into the film; its intermittent appearances create some genuine tension here, particularly the superbly-lit scene by the trains where Death finally catches up with its prey - through the unwitting aid of Orpheus himself!The latter stages see Orpehus searching for his beloved in the 'netherworld' - stumbling, at long last, on a (rather embarrassing) séance where she speaks to him through an old woman in a trance but, as legend has it, he's not content with just hearing her voice and so ends up losing her forever. The final scene, too, is great: Orpheus has reclaimed Eurydice's body, but his going back to 'reality' and the general hubbub of the Carnival (which, given the debris, the flames and the highstrung appearance of Orpheus's former girl, seems to have turned violent in the couple's absence) results in his own unfortunate death; all is not lost, however, as the kids who hang around him throughout the film seem to have finally acquired his unique 'gift' of making the sun rise with the power of guitar playing!While undeniably interesting in itself and occasionally powerful, BLACK ORPHEUS is no match for the intellectual but totally fascinating poetic touch rendered the tale in Cocteau's definitive version (with which I hope to re-acquaint myself in the near future via the British Film Institute's R2 SE DVD that I purchased recently).P.S. It seems incredible to me that BLACK ORPHEUS not only won the Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar but the Palme D'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival - where it was competing against such superior films as Luis Bunuel's NAZARIN, Alain Resnais' Hiroshima MON AMOUR and Francois Truffaut's THE 400 BLOWS! For the record, the jury members for that particular year included directors Michael Cacoyannis and Julien Duvivier, producer Carlo Ponti and Hollywood star Gene Kelly!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A retelling of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, set during the time of the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro.Barack Obama notes in his memoir "Dreams from My Father" (1995) that it was his mother's favorite film. Obama, however, didn't share his mother's preferences upon first watching the film during his first years at Columbia University: "I suddenly realized that the depiction of the childlike blacks I was now seeing on the screen, the reverse image of Conrad's dark savages, was what my mother had carried with her to Hawaii all those years before, a reflection of the simple fantasies that had been forbidden to a white, middle-class girl from Kansas, the promise of another life: warm, sensual, exotic, different." An interesting interpretation. Indeed, what I find interesting is how what it means to be black varies so much from one country to the next. What we see here could never have been an American film in 1959. It is just so far outside of what was possible. And yet, it seems perfectly natural for Brazil.The Greek mythology parallel is nice, but it is most interesting to see what passed for Brazilian culture in the 1950s. What an entirely different world from what we knew in the United States.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn) arrives in Rio de Janeiro in time for the festival to escape a man whom she believes is trying to kill her. She catches a tram driven by popular playboy Orfeu (Breno Mello), who naturally falls for Eurydice's youthful beauty. Ofeu is engaged to Mira (Lourdes De Oliveira) but is particularly unenthusiastic about the idea, and uses his new pay packet to get his guitar from the pawn shop in time for the carnival rather than to buy Mira an engagement ring. Discovering that Eurydice is staying next door to him with her cousin Serafina (Lea Garcia), Orfeu falls in love with her. But during the carnival, the man Eurydice believes is trying to kill her tracks her down, revealing that he is in fact Death dressed in a skeleton costume and has come to claim her.Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, as well as the Academy Award and Golden Globe for the Best Foreign Language Feature, Black Orpheus is a rather strange beast, and the surprise victor in a year that saw Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows and Alain Resnais' Hiroshima Mon Amour released. Although it can be argued that these are technically better films, it's not hard to see why Black Orpheus won, as its sheer individualism in its beauty, colour and culture makes it stand out above the rest. Many directors, including Orson Welles, had tried to capture the wonder of Rio's carnival, but French director Marcel Camus somehow manages to place you there amongst the samba and the sun, yet never letting the visuals overshadow this poetic, and actually very funny, re-telling of the Orpheus myth.Perhaps the most popular telling of this story in film is Jean Cocteau's Orphee (1950), the central film to his Orpheus trilogy. Cocteau invested his own ideas of surrealism, poetry and art into his film, and was more re-interpretation than re-telling, and as magnificent as that film is, it does tend to ignore the thing that Orpheus was known for, which is his almost God-like gift for music. Transporting the story to Rio's carnival, an explosion of tribal samba amongst an array of outlandish costumes, writhing bodies, and beautiful women, brings the story to life, and rather than Gods, we have voodoo doctors and fancy dress. It seems strange that Marcel Camus has done nothing of any real note since this film's success, as he somehow manages to juggle neo-realism and fantasy to a stunning degree, and created one of the most memorable films of the 1950's.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Orpheus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did remember this title rather well having seen it featured in the book 1001 Movies You See Before You Die, and of course with that recommendation there was no way I was going to miss an opportunity to watch this French/Brazilian film. Basically in Rio De Janeiro, trolley conductor and musician Orfeus (Breno Mello) is engaged to Mira (Lourdes De Oliveira), and new in town is Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn) arrives during the time Carnival week. She is running away from a stalker, Orpheus is instantly attracted to her, and he introduces her to life in this new place, including meeting station guard Hermes (Alexandro Constantino), and given directions she finds her cousin Serafina (Léa Garcia). Orpheus is not enthusiastic about his upcoming wedding, he even buys a new guitar instead of an engagement which Mira wants, this is so that he can eventually celebrate and join in the carnival. He is happy to see Eurydice living next door to him, they do have her stalker Death (Ademar Da Silva) come and find her, but he is chased away, and Serafina's sailor boyfriend Chico (Waldemar De Souza) distracts her attention, so they can connect properly. Orpheus, Mira, Serafina and Eurydice all take part in the carnival with colourful dresses and instruments and join in all the dancing and celebrations, and of course during this Mira finds out about the deception. Death shows up again, and Orpheus tries to chase him away again, and in the process Mira hangs from a power line to get away, and her fiancé accidentally kills her turning the power on. A distraught Orpheus tries to look for Eurydice, but he is told by someone that she may be dead, he goes into essentially the Underworld to search for her. There is a point when he finds what may be her in an older being, and she may in fact be dead, and he mourns, but he finds her body in the dark world and carries it away to take home and bring her back to life. The end is not happy though, as jealous Mira spots Orpheus holding Eurydice on the edge of a cliff, throws a stone that hits his head, and both them fall to their deaths. Also starring Jorge Dos Santos as Benedito. I will be honest that I guess I didn't fully catch on to the Greek story being retold in a more modern form, the cast were all fine, and the love story was interesting enough, but what I personally enjoyed was all the brightly coloured and musical carnival action in between everything, overall however it is a worthwhile romance. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very likable movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to not like this movie. It's colorful and cheerful and has plenty of likable characters in it, despite of the movie not being made in the best way imaginable.It's actually quite odd. This is a movie set in Brazil and entirely spoken in Portugese as well but the movie is however made by French people behind the camera's and with French money. It's also the reason why the Oscar for best foreign picture went to France instead of Brazil, when this movie won in its category.But don't worry, this movie is still very much Brazilian. It actually uses lots of cultural aspects and settings within its story, which is the foremost reason why the movie also works out original and pleasant. The Brazilian carnival plays a large part within the movie its story, so you can expect lots of dancing, cheerful people and bright colors. All reasons why this movie simply had to be done in color. All of the Rio de Janeiro backdrops also work out beautifully for the movie because of that.The movie manages to build up a real pleasant atmosphere because of all of that. You would really like to be a part of that world while watching the movie and hang out with some of the movie its likable characters.But the story in itself is still also a serious one. After all, it is a love-story, based on an ancient myth and like most of these stories go, they have plenty of dark elements and themes to them and also don't necessarily end well.This obviously wasn't a very expensive movie to make, which still can mostly be seen back in its acting. Most of the cast-members obviously didn't had any experience, which was quite distracting at first but as the movie moved along it became less and less noticeable.The story doesn't always connect. The difference between the first and the second half of the movie, especially the last 20 minutes or so, are too different from each other. I understand that the movie at first really wanted to be cheerful and uplifting, in order for the darker and more emotional second half of the movie to hit harder but the transition just doesn't feel that very natural and besides caused the movie to drag after a while.But despite these complaints, this movie remains a very good and likable one!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Works, And It Doesn't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parts of the movie work very well-the beautiful scenery, the interesting characters and how they intrigue among each other, the depiction of Carnival, and the message that the government's power in a poor country like Brazil is at best limited. Other parts don't; the major characters are named after those in the Greek Orpheus myth, but the story fails to really follow the myth. For one thing, in the myth, Orpheus uses his music to soothe all the various creatures he encounters on his way through Hades to reach his wife Eurydice there; in this movie, Orfeu's guitar is used to entertain people, and its only (supposed) power is to make the sun rise. And to try to reach Eurydice, Orfeu is brought to attends a voodoo-type ceremony where she talks through a woman supposedly gifted with a spirit.The movie has other loose ends as well. We never find out who the masked mystery man presumably stalking Eurydice is or what was his motivation in doing so. Orfeu and Mira get engaged at the beginning of the story, but Orfeu never seems to have ever been in love with her to begin with, and everyone tries to hide Orfeu's affair with Eurydice rather than Orfeu simply breaking off the engagement.Not a bad movie, but hardly a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie. It made a big splash at the Oscars and Cannes way back in 1960. Set in Rio de Janeiro during the Carnival Festival, this Brazilian (Portugese language) film is an updated re-telling of the Greek legend of Orpheus and Eurypide. Neither of the two stars of this film is famous but they both look good in their roles as does the rest of the cast - all very attractive looking. The soundtrack is by Antonio Carlos Jobim - his first for a film I think.The dances, colours and costumes of the film give it a unique visual look. The first song that Orpheus plays on the guitar is wonderful. Contrary to the impression you might get from the reviews, there is nothing fantastical in the movie like going to the land of the dead or anything. Its all grounded in reality but ultimately a stylistic exercise that creates a fantasy world. It has aged well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a wonderful reputation and is regarded as a classic, so when I got a copy of the film I was expecting something amazing. And, by the time it was complete, I felt like I just didn't get it--why was this film so highly regarded? Perhaps most of the reason this film left me so cold was that Jean Cocteau's version of the story of Orpheus and Eurydice was so much better--with amazing camera work and acting. On the other hand, "Orfeu Negro" just seemed to have one thing going for it--its intense Samba score. The problem is that after a short time I wanted the music to stop!! The viewing experience was like having ADHD and taking crack--it was just so hyper-kinetic it made me want to scream. As for the story, it sure seemed a lot more superficial--they dance and dance and Orfeu falls for Eurydice so easily--with no real character development or even build up. The citizens of Rio all seem like mindless children--dancing their lives away--a rather patronizing view of the nation! And, because of this, I can see why the Brazilians disliked this one-dimensional view the film gave of them.As I said, I just don't get this film--it didn't do much to satisfy me and I will strongly suggest to my friends they see Cocteau's version instead--it seems much closer to the original source material and is just so much more interesting.</fullReview>

It's not strictly a musical although it boasts a very good score by Luiz Bonfa and Antonio Carlos Jobim as it transposes the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice to Rio during carnival and it was for its score and for director Marcel Camus' superb use of colour, (DoP is Jean Bourgoin) that it became famous. However, the acting and the script leave a lot to be desired and you get the feeling a lot more could have been made of the setting. You may also wonder what all the fuss was about as it is certainly not the masterpiece some people said it was at the time.</fullReview>

Black Orpheus, or Orpheu Negro, is a wonderful piece on life and love's meaning, as shown on the lovely ambiance of the Rio carnival. If a bit slow at first, it immediately catches speed, as well as our hearts, as soon as Orpheu and Eurydice meet, showing us just how nice life can be, as well as how devastating it is to lose the meaning of life itself. The film does what a romantic or drama film should do at its best: showcase not only the character's emotions, but the watchers emotions as well, making up for a joyful ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Better Than White Orpheus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you decide to watch this movie, I hope you like dancing, because that is what half the movie is, and it is monotonous, repetitive dancing to monotonous, repetitive music.The movie is based on the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, but it's not any better than the myth was. Orpheus asks his girlfriend Mira to marry him, and then on the same day, he meets Eurydice and has sex with her. Then, instead of at least breaking off his engagement, he just dances with Eurydice at the carnival in front of Mira. So, he's a louse, right? Wrong. The movie wants us to like Orpheus and despise Mira. You figure it out.Anyway, there is a guy running around with a death mask on who wants to kill Eurydice and eventually succeeds. We don't know why, because she says she never had anything to do with him. I guess we are supposed to accept this as mythologically inevitable. Or, you can just assume the guy is wearing a hockey mask.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fame backfires!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Palme d'Or and Oscar's BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM (although it should have been rewarded to Brazil instead of France) double-honour is a tremendous wow factor to lure in cinephiles, but sometimes the prestige backfires, the film may introduce Samba and Boss Nova to the world, but how can it overshadows an awkward truth, it won over 400 BLOWS (1959, 9/10) in the Cannes competition, a mania of over-exploited exoticism may be the answer.Marcel Camus' second film, it restyles the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice during the Carnival ruckus in Rio de Janeiro, the black Orpheus (Mello) is a boisterous trolley conductor who is just engaged to an even more boisterous girl Mira (de Oliveria), at the same day, he meets his Eurydice (Dawn), a young girl flees from her home to her cousin Serafina (Garcia) because Death (De Silva) is stalking her. While Serafina and Orpheus are next-door neighbours on a hill overlooking the city, naturally the serendipity pulls them together after lavishly sambaing with the folk, which consequently interrupted by a macabre encounter with the flamboyant Death sporting a clownish gymnastic suit.Orpheus is a musician, he has the power to bring sunrise every morning by crooning with his guitar, he and Eurydice copulate during the very first night out of irresistible passion, and the next day is the Carnival, but the fierily jealous Mira cannot bear the betrayal meanwhile Death is also on his track to his prey. A tragedy occurs in the heat of the Carnival, and Orpheus is in complete despair to bring Eurydice back, but he cannot yield to the "don't look back" warning in a ritual ceremony, thus his lost is permanent, and the myth comes to a climax in a deadly fall. But mercifully, the finale heralds an auspicious future, a new Orpheus is born out of schmaltzy puppy love, a false hope is better than a bizarre dismay out of a sloppy production. The acting is inadequate, playing-house, sometimes unbearably hammy (de Oliveria and Garcia are two examples of overdoing their characters with opposite reactions, irksome and hilarious), the rumbustious dancing and bandwagon scenes are affecting enough to involuntarily shake your posterior but enough is enough, we are not watching a documentary about local customs and manners of Carnival or Brazil. The detachment between the narrative and lush surroundings is markedly protruded, but the appreciable saving grace is Camus contrives to frame awe- inspiring panorama shots and overhead takes, with the poverty-stricken people roister in their festival, which showcases their aboriginal glee is authentic (at least mostly). The more grim and satanic facet of the ancient Greek legend is deadened by the unremitting revelry and polychromatism, if only Camus could pander to the obsession of the dark side of the myth a bit more, say, the grisly corridor in the missing person division or the fluorescent terminus where Eurydice absurdly being electrocuted, the film would be more palatable both in visual style and in emotive rhythm.</fullReview>

I did very much like Jobim's music in the film, and the scenery and photography, but I didn't see much else here.Festival scenes are impressive for the feeling of suppressed fury, and the approach of "death" is quite scary. The confrontation scene in the warehouse feels forced, though, like so much else in this movie stretching to fit itself into a costume, as it were, that doesn't quite fit it.</fullReview>

Many Brazilians took offense to the some of the portrayals of life in the favelas (slums) of Rio, and the film was recreated (by a Brazilian) in 1999. It is titled "Orfeu" (not BLACK orfeu). In my opinion it is a better movie, better acted, and more accurate. Still has the beautiful music of Vinicius de Moraes as in Black Orfeu. Rent the newer one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Black Orpheus", as my summary states, is a modern retelling of the myth of Orpheus &amp; Eurydice. The film is set in Rio de Janeiro during the time of Carnaval. On the eve of his wedding, Orpheus meets Eurydice and they fall madly in love. However, Death lurks around every corner, intent on claiming Eurydice for himself.Familiarity with the source material would probably aid your appreciation but it isn't essential. The film moves along at a brisk pace and sports an energy that makes it hard to resist. The bossa nova soundtrack contributes greatly to this effect.The cast boasts no outstanding performances but the leads, Breno Mello &amp; Marpessa Dawn, make an engaging couple. The direction of Marcel Camus impressively creates a colourful landscape and fills it with the almost ever-present music of Antonio Carlos Jobim.While I feel that the latter stages of the film didn't work quite so well without prior knowledge of the underlying mythology I still found the film enjoyable on the whole. I wouldn't rank it among the greats of foreign film but it does possess a charm all its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlooked film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marcel Camus's 1959 French film, Black Orpheus (Orfeu Negro), made in 1959, in Portuguese, is by no means a great film, but it is a landmark film; an odd amalgam of modernity and the worst stereotypes about black culture worldwide. The whole film is practically one long festival of song and dance, which while apropos for the setting- Rio de Janeiro's Carnival, nonetheless kills off any hope for a real story. Yet, despite the dancing, singing, and merrymaking, it is not a musical, per se, and quite a bleak film, in that it reinforces the notion, however true, that poverty is something that no amount of merriment can deny.Based upon the mythic love of Orpheus and Eurydice, and Vinícius de Moraes' musical play Orfeu Da Conceiç?o, it is a huge leap upward from the so-called Orphic films of Camus's countryman Jean Cocteau, yet it is ultimately a tale that it all fluff and little meat. It is not great cinema, but it is great entertainment. That this foreign equivalent of the staid Hollywood musical format has such a high international reputation owes far more to the biases against Hollywood than to any real positive qualities this film has. Its landmark status as a film derives from its bringing the bossa nova beats of Latino music to the world stage. Imagine if the 1990s craze, The Macarena, had been featured in a film, and you'll have an idea of the impact of this film.In truth, the real and only star of the film is the music, whose soundtrack was written by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luis Bonfá, and the vivid- no, gorgeous, colors. This is one of those films meant for color. It would simply not have been the same in black and white. Black Orpheus won the 1959 Cannes Film Festival Palm D'Or Grand Prize as well as the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. Camus and Jacques Viott wrote the screenplay, what little of it there is. In a sense, the whole plot of this film is just an excuse for the wonderfully infectious music, making this film, arguably, the world's first music video, over two decades before the dawn of MTV. The film's two main theme songs, Manha De Carnival and O Nossa Amor, became international hits. Before this film only Hollywood musical numbers took off in the public's consciousness, but as they were all based on Broadway tunes they already well known. Perhaps only the zither music of Anton Karas, in the 1949 film, The Third Man, had as big an impact previously. However, as memorable as that great film's scoring was, it never moved people the way this music does?. The film has a strange quality of being both surreal and cinema verité, even as the cliffside shots of the sea are stunningly lush. It is apt that the film ends both poetically and realistically, with the dancing children blissfully unaware that poor people, such as themselves, almost always end up living and dying pathetically, as did this Orpheus and Eurydice. None of the actors ever went on to star in anything even remotely as successful as this film, and neither did Camus, a filmic one hit wonder whiz kid, although his 'hit' was hardly high art. Despite that, Black Orpheus, while not being a cinematic full meal nevertheless is a sweet piece of candy, and thus has to be judged more on its entertainment value than its artistic value; mindful that, unlike the Orphic films of Cocteau, it, at least succeeds on one level, however lowest common denominator that may be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>if you watch it for the spectacle, music, and often terrific direction, you'll get your money's worth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why though I didn't find Black Orpheus to be a flat-out, blow-me-away masterpiece. Maybe my expectations were a little high; hearing for years about it from my mother (into Brazilian music), and that it won a simultaneous golden palm and Oscar in 1959. And for quite a while, despite being directed by Marcus Camus (French), and meant for a worldwide audience, was THE film to see from Brazil and Rio. What is interesting, and occasionally a little frustrating, is how the film is shot actually not too complicated, the camera never does any moves that boggle the mind too much, or go into jump-cuts in editing. It's actually in a kind of documentary/realism (which was Camus's style anyway) capturing the lives of the poorer people of Rio and also the living-for-dancing kind of life they lead, keeping some hope. This, however, is mixed with the mythical story of Orpheus, who deals with death in order to save his love.But in a way, not all the time but some of the time, for me, the Orpheus story, despite being integral to the film, got in the way of some of the more exciting parts of the film. Obviously, the chief reason to see the film is for the entertainment value, which is pumped up by delivering dancing, a pulsating musical beat, and what ends up getting filled into the not-too-static framing; a lot of dancing, and a lot of people, practically all non-actors I'd imagine, delivering the goods. And then the storyline comes in. Orpheus is a bus worker who also has a great gift for romancing through the guitar and his looks. It doesn't help his new engagement that a cousin of a friend, Eurydice, comes into the picture and changes everything- they fall in love, the kind of melodramatic, powerful kind of love that is affecting in its classic-film kind of style...and then there's Death, who's following along her trail. It's done as a kind of literal interpretation, and one wonders how things may lead up to a tragic climax. It's woven together fine, but I wasn't as moved by the romantic scenes so much as the others involving the real people.In fact, one wonders what this film could've been, either better or maybe not as good, if it was a straight documentary ala Orson Welles's It's All True about the lives of the poor in Rio who get together to Samba the night away. It's really exhilarating to see the sequences of the carnival, and even the 'rehersal' that takes place in the smaller part of town. There is also one other scene that had me sit up and take notice- when Orpheus, on the search for Eurydice, is with his 'guide' being a janitor, he's taken to a kind of voodoo room where spirits take control over people in the midst of a weird dance. I didn't understand this scene, like it was something alien to a far extreme. But it was one of my favorite parts of the film as well, for the power in seeing these real people act in this- for them- 'normal' kind of act. Maybe I'll like it more on another viewing, for now though I did like it, and would recommend it, and to whom I'm not totally sure. Yet it is one of the seminal films from their country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was celebrated in its day. Since then, several things have changed.One is that the peculiar French racism, though not as out of fashion as the American version of the time, has been revealed as what it is. The engaging abstract quality of the Greek drama has here been reduced a similar simplification, but to stereotypes: the sweaty, muscular buck, the even sweatier, sex-hunting watermelon eating lunk, the sexy black woman who is all breasts and scowls, other black women of type... and all of them grinning into a future that values dancing above all else.And of course it isn't just dancing but what in its day was considered closer to sex than walking.Its amazing that the noble "Amos and Andy" is still forbidden but this retains the reputation of its Oscar.The second thing is though the music and color was somewhat bold for the day (we're talking 50 years ago), there's scant enjoyment to be gotten from it today. That leaves us to marvel and settle into the film-making and story. Or not, because there is not much of either here -- just another example of continental sentimental expressionism.You really do deserve better than this in your life.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw BLACK ORPHEUS in a film aesthetics class at California State University, Northridge. For some reason, it is considered one of the greatest films ever made by many of the CSUN film department's faculty. I think that claim is highly debatable.There are aspects of BLACK ORPHEUS that deserve praise. I admired the costumes and the music and even some of the acting. However, the story is incredibly slow paced and never really grabbed my interest in the first place. Also, Orpheus himself is not as heroic as the movie claims to he is. The guy ditched his fiancee for another woman right before his wedding! What kind of a hero/lover is that? And what's with that ending? I guess Orpheus gets what he deserves, but it doesn't really solve anything in a way that makes sense.</fullReview>
