		<shortDescription>Great production values put to evil use in this horribly acted love story set in a Rio favela</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rio de Janeiro in widescreen CinemaScope is quite a sight, that´s for sure, and the carnival parade with the famous escolas de samba (samba schools) do sound great in digital sound. But money (it cost some U$ 7 million, a record for Brazilian standards) and the technology it can buy does not make a good film, especially if it´s a tragic love story, like this one.Two awful leads (Tony Garrido and Patrícia França) play Orfeu and Euridice, who are supposed to be in love, but we just have to take their word for it. Their love, and the movie, takes place in a Rio favela (shanty town), located high up in the hills of the city. It´s a fascinating set (built entirely for the shooting) which stands-in for a fascinating Brazilian inner-world, packed, in real life, with its own special rules and laws which the movie prefers to ignore.As it is, Orfeu shows us a great set, rather than the interesting parallel society it seems to be examining. Walter Salles´ Central Station did a pretty good job at rendering its station with documentary-like accuracy. Orfeu renders its favela with soap opera-like consistency.It´s a pity, because some of the supporting characters almost come to life. Orfeu´s parents, Zezé Motta and Milton Gonçalves, display the respect and dignity their small favela roles demand. Isabel Fillardis also makes an impression, as one of Orfeu´s women who may have had a big break after making the Playboy centerfold. But these are characters who have little screen time, although Brazilian music superstar, Caetano Veloso, does get an overlong and rather embarassing cameo appearance. You can´t miss him. He´s the animatronic-like puppet, playing a guitar on somebody´s roof.Diegues, who made the excellent Bye Bye Brazil, in 1980, seems to be so infatuated with his toys (the movie is technically very good) that he loses it altogether, especially in a story set in the dog days of Brazilian carnival, but totally devoid of the unique atmosphere of the Brazilian carnival.

		<shortDescription>Dreadful Rubbish !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. The acting was so bad, a better job would have been done by employing a queue of people waiting for a bus ! The script is execrable, dreadful. The direction dire, don't allow the director to control traffic anywhere, there would be a pile up ! What illegal substance was the man on ? Perhaps he got next door's cat to do the work. It would have proved a better result.This film shows just how good the original, Black Orpheus, is. There is no need to refer to that masterpiece in case the mere mention of Orfeu might tarnish a great work.I play in a Samba Bateria in Europe and have never been to Brasil so I was interested in the shots of Carnaval. The director seemed to have even taken away some of the magic of that event, so flat was his direction.The drug dealer 'Lucinho' had the acting talent of a mannequin. He had obviously seen John Travolta in Pulp Fiction and tried to model his distinct lack of ability on Travolta. Well he couldn't even mimic Travolta. Orfeu was like a kid they had just pulled off the street who had been kicking a football about ten minutes earlier. They would have got a better cast if they had enrolled first year drama students in their first week of college; where their tutor was off sick and they had spent the first week in the canteen drinking coffee.The dialogue and plot line was a joke. In fact this would be one of those films that is so bad while meant to be serious the audience end up falling about laughing. The director wanted to give the story ? or lack of it, a feeling of the film City of God; not guns and roses but guns and favelas.A very attractive girl played 'Mira' ? perhaps the one redeeming feature of the film. Euridice acted like a Portuguese au-pair from up-country lost in Manchester.The ending of the film was so dreadful I can't even bring myself to think about it. It should have been the director who was thrown off the side of a hill.I noticed that some people from Los Angeles liked the film, perhaps they don't have any quality to measure the film against? Before I watched the film I looked on IMDb and saw that someone from the UK who has had a long interest in Brasil, complained about the film. Perhaps with this accurate appreciation, I should have avoided it; but as they say, you learn more from taking one really bad photograph than from twelve good ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pale shadow of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 18 when I became enchanted by all things Brazilian and held a lifelong ambition visit that beautiful country. This admiration of all things brazillian was the result of a visit to a London cinema with an older cousin to see the masterpiece Black Orpheus.This was a truly magnificent film, based on the legend of Orpheus and Eurydice, and set among the slum dwellers of Rio at carnival time. I did not see this film again until quite recently when I purchased the DVD. The film retains it's magical qualities after all these years and can be watched over and over again.While looking for Black Orpheus, I became aware of the modern version Orfeu which I also purchased on DVD. I must say that this film fails miserably on most counts. The characters are wooden, the acting average, and the music can not live with the score of the 1959 film. On top of this the symbolism does not work, and the whole film lacks poetry. I have asked many friends to watch both of these films and the result is unanimous praise for Black Orpheus and a Luke warm reception for Orfeu.I visited a favela last year and it is true that the modern version is much more true to life, but that misses the point. This is a comparison between a work of art, and a very average remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melodramatic, chintzy acting, but great soundtrack and good cinematography.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from Orfeu. I wish I could say this movie was good, cause I like Diegues, but it was not. His excellent movie Quilombo sold me on his historical honesty and ability to tell a story. Using the backdrop of Rio and Carival you don't even get a sense of the city and the joy of the Carnival. He uses some shots that show the beauty of the city and intricate scene shots but there just isn't enough. The acting is not good. It was poorly cast. The female roles should have been re-arranged. Mira should have played the "best dancer". The best dancer should have played Euridice and Euridice should have been eliminated and barred from the set. The lead role of Orfeu was decent enough, but he needed much more to play off of. And there was no romance. This was a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dazzling Cinematic Production with Minimal Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Carlos Diegues knows how to capture atmosphere with his camera and effects and when that atmosphere is the splendid garish gaudiness of Carnival in Rio de Janeiro there is plenty to entertain the eye. 'Orfeu' as a story, supposedly a re-interpretation of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth updated to current times and set in the slums (favelas) of Rio, is just not there.The title character Orfeu (handsome and talented singer Toni Garrido) does sing and play his guitar, his playing ends the night and serenades the rising of the sun, but here he a quasi-Rap star, beloved by his townsfolk of the hillside favela, and by all the women who come into his view. Eurídice (Patrícia França) enters his life, as she comes to Rio after the death of her parents in the provinces, and the meeting results in instant love. There is violence from the police invasions of the slums, drug lords such as Lucinho (a disastrously misused Murilo Benício who happens to be one of Brazil's biggest stars), female envy from Orfeu's many ex-lovers (Isabel Fillardis, Maria Ceiça), and parental concern from Orfeu's parents Conceiç?o (Zezé Motta) and Inácio (Milton Gonçalves). But the story, or at least a semblance of one, gets buried in all the extravagant production of police raids and the Carnival parades: it just ends without much point - except that there is a reprise of the musical theme from 'Black Orpheus' to carry you back down memory lane.Though the quality of acting is generally substandard by comparison to most great films out of Brazil, the style of acting is supposedly the accepted norm for the popular Brazilian novellas on television. And the sensual presence of Toni Garrido does raise the quality of the movie. But if the art of 'Black Orpheus' or Jean Cocteau's 'Orphee' is what you are expecting, this film will not satisfy. If you are looking for a colorful, splashy extravaganza about Rio during Carnival, here is your ticket! Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but hard to follow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinematography of this film is beautiful. The symbolic use of light to indicate mood (and abrupt changes in it) is very well done. Also the colors are vibrant, beautiful affairs with vibrant, samba music to go with it.The part of the movie that fails is the acting. It is hard to follow simply because the characters' emotions are hard to read. I have watched many subtitled or silent films, take Chaplin's "The Kid" for example, that are easy to follow simply because of the good acting. In this film I had a hard time keeping up with the plot because I didn't have a clue what was going on without reading the subtitles. Even then I had a hard time following the motives on occasion. For example, the drug dealer Lucinho seems to have no motivation for his violence late in the film, yet his actions are a crucial plot point.The real shame about this being a foreign language film, at least for me, is that reading all the subtitles to keep up kept my eyes away from the beautifully composed shots. Any one of those stills could be taken as a photograph and be a work of art on their own. Sadly, they would probably be better artwork than the film itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic, passionate, sensual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie captivated me from the very beginning. This sparkling, contemporary portrayal of Black Orpheus recaptures the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice and again sets it in a favela in the hills above urban Rio de Janeiro. The lives, loves and losses of 3 generations of shanty town dwellers are vibrantly documented over the course of a Carnival holiday. Dreadlocked, handsome Orfeu, who has achieved local fame through the success of his shows at the Sambadrome faces the usual pressures of a celebrity who comes from poor beginnings. He chooses to remain living in the favela, he claims, to show the youth that there is more than one way to success, the other way being that of his 'almost brother', Lucinho, a psychotic gang leader who reigns over the 'hood with drugs and terror. When beautiful, otherworldly Eurydice arrives in the rough-hewn streets to visit a distant aunt she captures Orfeu's heart, much to the disdain of the local women, most of whom have some claim on him, whether real or imagined. The two find true love against a pulsating backdrop of Carnival performances, jealousy, police violence, interfering relatives, and flimsy homes held together by not much more than romantic and colorful scarves. The acting in Orfeu is raw and energetic and the passion that interweaves the mythical tale is ethereal by design, and enchanting by its very nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Orfeu for the 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orfeu Negro for the 90's. Complete with laptops, cell phones and automatic weopons in the hillside ghetto of Rio de Jainero. Visually the movie is great. I especially enjoyed the lead actor playing Orfeo, and the actors playing his mother, father and the teen-ghetto artist Michael. Orfeo and Euridice never quite connect in a powerful way. So emotionally the movie didn't move me as strongly as it might have. I did enjoy watching the Carnival and the music in the film is very nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colorful, good entertainment considering the source</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ORFEU is a good reworking of the Orpheus story. It has been remade using all of Vinicius de Morais' criteria for an updated version. Among the criteria was adding the modest modern forms of the art. ORFEU does that wonderfully in depicting the current underworld ruling the favelas (poor shanty towns), and the modern trends in language and music, including Brazilian rap. It is definitely an updated version of the late 50's "Black Orpheus." Now, whether one prefers the comparatively nostalgic '50s ORPHEUS or not is another matter. And that should not be the yardstick on which this film is rated. Understandably, a lot of people have problems with accepting rap in Brazilian samba, overt sexuality (which is rampant even on Brazilian prime-time TV) and the nuanced acting of Brazilian telenovelas, which, like it or not, is what the people are used to, and the popular standard for acting in Brazil. Whether this style of acting is good or bad is definite subjective. Regular people in Brazil overact more than those in the movie have been accused of doing. Go there and see people in a normal discussion, then argue about who overacts. I therefore assure you that ORFEU delivers what it intended, and with fabulous sound and cinematography, state of theart. Whether you preferred the "innocent" days of the 50s to today's rougher climate is of course your choice, but it's not fair to vent your anger or to criticize the film for it. Criticize society, whomever. But not the artists in this movie. They are representing things as they are right now, whether you like it or not. It's unfortunate that since most don't like the general state they take it out on the movie. The movie is definitely worth watching. It only reflects society, and kind of sanitized at that. The acting is the best you'll get from a bunch who have to master Samba dancing, singing, looking wonderful, and seeming realistic, just for starters. They do that and more in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ancient Greek mythology meets 90s Brazilian telenovela</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orfeu mixes elements of Greek mythology and classical theatre with Brazilian telenovelas. That may sound like a recipe for disaster, but to me the director actually pulled it off.It was fascinating to me as someone from Western Europe to see how different life in the favelas is (both in good and bad ways), and to see the ancient Greek story set in such a different context. The cinematography is also great.I can see how some would be disappointed if they were expecting to get immersed into a convincing story set in the midst of a full blown carnival extravaganza though.The main characters Orfeu and Euridice didn't really come to life to me as genuine likable individuals that I could identify with, but more as the original Greek personas. However most other members of the cast did not have this "problem" and provided plenty of convincing drama.Also although we are treated to some scenes of the amazing Rio carnival, the director doesn't really seem to immerse us in that world of extravagance. We are almost looking at it from a distance, as if to say it's not that important to the actual story.To sum it all up: what makes Brazil interesting is that it is such a melting pot, and melting very different elements into a lively stew is exactly what happens in Orfeu. It may not always be that easy to digest, but boring it is not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not too bad, though the actors are a little weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually liked this movie, though others I know found it alright. We actually watched it in my Intro to Film and Video class...at first I didn't know if I would be able to follow it as well, since I had to read the subtitles (in English), however I quickly got engrossed in the setting and use of night and day. Though I found the "drug lord" character not to be the best actor, nor some of the other characters in the film, I found the music to be the key for this film. The use of awesomely bright colors and loud pulsating music brought the Carnival scene to life for me as a viewer. The love attraction of Orfeu and Euridice was a little weak, but the imagery is well done. Though the story at times strays from the original Greek myth it was based on, it was an interesting twist on it. I think some of you will enjoy it, and others not. It sort of feels like the modern day Romeo and Juliet with Leo DeCaprio (sorta). So if you found that interesting, you might like this film too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so beautiful, so sad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one who loved and and read and saw the old version, Orfeu Negro, and who has lived on the songs for 40 years or so, I can say that this is a really good film. It is superior to the old one in many ways but what it gains in sophistication, it loses in enchantment. Never the less, it is a major and almost successful effort at a peep into a reality one cannot even begin to imagine. It is also admirable for the respect with which every single one of the inhabitants of the hopeless world of the "Favelas" are depicted, down to the last of the "evil characters" or the shifty one whose crying scene closes the film.It is also a beautiful love story and the recognizable connection to the Greek original is also remarkable.</fullReview>
