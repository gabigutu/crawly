		<shortDescription>British Version is Fast-Paced, Witty, &amp; Atmospheric</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both versions of Hitchcock's "The Man Who Knew Too Much" are well worth watching, and each one has its own strong points. While this British version cannot match the Hollywood remake in terms of star power and lavish production, it has several strengths of its own: it is fast-paced, filled with wit, and nicely atmospheric. Despite being 20 years older, it is also more 'modern' in its portrayal of the woman whose child is kidnapped.Aside from Peter Lorre, always a big plus to any movie, the cast does not have too many names that would be familiar to today's audiences, but they all are good actors who fit in well with the style of Hitchcock's British films, exuding self-control and good-natured wit even in the most trying of circumstances. Edna Best as the heroine is noticeably different from Doris Day, lacking the glamour but giving a convincing performance as a more determined, resourceful mother.There are some interesting settings in this version, too, with much of the action taking place in some interesting buildings in a less elegant neighborhood in London. A lot of it looks a bit murky in the old black-and-white print, but in a sense even that adds to the atmosphere.Certainly there are those who have good reasons for preferring the remake, but every Hitchcock fan should watch the original, too. Hitchcock's British films had a pleasant style all their own, and while this one might not measure up to "The Lady Vanishes" or "The 39 Steps", it's still very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch and the "Anarchist Revolt" of 1911 in London</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the novel, THE SECRET AGENT, Joseph Conrad had dissected the world of anarchists, double agents and spies, and police in the East End of London of 1894, the year that an attempt to destroy the Greenwich Observatory occurred. Alfred Hitchcock used Conrad's novel for his film SABOTAGE in 1936. But two years earlier he did the film THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. It was the first of two films in which Peter Lorre was directed by him. It was also the only one of his movies that he remade complete with title. But he decided to use the film to film a scene from British criminal history - the January 1911 "Siege of Sidney Street".There had been an incident in December 1910 when several Russian aliens were involved in a burglary in Houndsditch. The proceeds of their robberies (aside from supporting themselves) helped fund anti-Tsarist activities in Russia. They killed three constables in making their escape from the shop. They were eventually tracked down to a house on Sidney Street, and fired at the police who tried to get them to surrender. The Home Secretary of the day (a politician named Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill) sent out troops, sharp shooters, and artillery. The cannon set the house on fire, and the men found inside were found to be dead. The best account of the event is Donald Rumbelow's THE SIEGE OF SIDNEY STREET called THE HOUNDSDITCH MURDERS in Great Britain.Here, instead of radicals (called anarchists in 1911) we have foreign conspirators planning an assassination in London of a foreign head of state. Peter Lorre is the leader. Leslie Banks and his family are on vacation to Switzerland. Banks witnesses the murder of a Frenchman (Pierre Fresney, a great French star of the period - this English film is a rarity for him). Fresney reveals the assassination plot to Banks, and Lorre and his associates kidnap his daughter (Nora Pilbeam) to keep his mouth shut. But the police are aware that he heard something from Fresney, and try to pressure him to talk.So we watch Banks try to track down his daughter (and get captured himself) while his wife goes to the Albert Hall to see what she can do.The finale of the film is based on the Siege - with some exceptions (one of the bobbies in the Houndsditch tragedy is shot and killed in the start of the movie's version of the incident). But Hitchcock maintains the suspense to the end, when the last villain is taken care of.It's an interesting film - not a great one. And it is somewhat different from the 1956 remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Early Hitchcock...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps a bit hard to watch for younger generations, but this is the superior version of the yuppie couple whose only child is kidnapped and held for ransom (remade under the same title in the 50s by the same director, Alfred Hitchcock). The film doesn't live up to "The 39 Steps" or "The Lady Vanishes" as one of Hitch's early works, but it is a superb example of classic low-budget filmmaking at its best. Yes, the effects (like the opening ski slope run) are incredibly laughable, but hey--it was filmed on a virtually empty budget by a relatively unknown director at the time with a low-budget cast in Britain.Superb.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sending Hitch on his way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Alfred Hitchcock made several better films than this, including the 1956 remake, The Man Who Knew Too Much is a milestone film for the rotund master of suspense. It was the first film that got him noticed outside the United Kingdom, it led to bigger budgets for Hithcock to work with in British film industry and eventually to his departure for America.Leslie Banks and Edna Best, Mr.and Mrs. upper class British couple on holiday in Switzerland with their adolescent daughter Neva Pilbeam. A Frenchman they befriend, Pierre Fresnay, is killed right in front of them on a dance floor and he whispers something to Banks about a planned assassination in London to occur shortly. The spies suspect what the dying Fresnay has said to Banks and grab Pilbeam to insure the silence of her parents.The rest of this short (75 minute) feature is Banks and Best trying to both foil the assassination and get their daughter back. At the climax Best's skill at skeet shooting becomes a critical factor in the final confrontation with the villains.Peter Lorre made his English language debut in The Man Who Knew Too Much and was very effective with the limited dialog he had. I've often wondered why Hitchcock never used Lorre more in some of his later features.Although the 1956 version has far better production values, this version still holds up quite well and is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vintage Hitchcock that is a little too stiff for it's own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst on holiday in Switzerland to compete in winter sports the Lawrence family inadvertently meet a spy who is killed in front of them. He passes information to them relating to an assassination but, before they can pass on the information their daughter is kidnapped for their silence. Back in London they decide to start looking for the kidnappers and prevent the assassination themselves.Hitchcock's strength here is that an wholly unlikely plot which is full of holes is masked by a sense of wit and good feeling that covers the flaws. The whole thing falls down under scrutiny and as a thriller it doesn't really cut it as well as I'd hoped ? it certainly doesn't compare to The 39 Steps. However the film is very classy and very, very British.I expect to American audiences nowadays that the very polite gentleman like approach of the film is very strange but it works quite well. The final shoot out lacks excitement simply because it is unrealistic in the extreme but it's still quite enjoyable and has it's moments. Lorre is good as the villain but lacks the smarmy qualities he brought to later films. Leslie Banks is very good as the solid British hero and Best is good as his sassy (if underused) wife. Wakefield has a good comedy role as Banks' side kick.Overall the age of the film means it feels very stagy and very stiff but there's still much to enjoy with good settings, comedy and vintage Hitchcockian touches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's best films, and entirely undervalued. I love most of Hitch's films. His bigger productions of the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s are probably best loved, but I really like his grittier, more reality-based films as well. During that period, The Wrong Man is almost entirely overlooked, despite being one of his greatest achievements. This kind of film was most common during his British career, where he had less money to work with. I myself am least familiar with the first chunk of the man's career, but I have seen enough of them. My favorite so far is definitely Sabotage (1936), which is another criminally underrated film. The first version of The Man Who Knew Too Much is a close second favorite. A terrorist group (led by Peter Lorre) kills a secret agent in Switzerland. Bob and Jill Lawrence discover that the group is planning to assassinate a foreign diplomat in London in the upcoming days, so the group kidnaps their daughter to keep them quiet. They're unwilling to tell the police about the kidnapping, and eventually take it upon themselves to find her. They have to do it quickly, for, if the diplomat is killed because they withheld information from the police, a second World War could rest upon their shoulders. The story isn't particularly complex, but Hitchcock's cinema is as spectacular as it ever was, while aiming for a low key. There are a dozen memorable scenes in the film, most notably the concert with the slowly revolving camera as Jill Lawrence scans the room for the assassin. And I love the realistic standoff near the end of the film, as the police slowly move citizens to safety as the terrorists shoot from the dark. The acting is also very good, with Edna Best (as Jill Lawrence) and especially Peter Lorre (how can you not love this guy?) standing above the rest. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eye Candy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched this film, I could barely differentiate characters I was so unused to watching old, high-contrast B&amp;W films. By the third time around, I had made everything out and it became one of my favorite movies of all time. The 50's remake, though James Stewart is one of my favorite personalities in the history of civilization, just isn't the same film.First and foremost, Peter Lorre. Anyone who has seen him in M, then laments his minor roles in Hollywood films, should see this film. It's too bad that Hollywood couldn't create more roles like this for him. Abbott is one of the greatest of Hitchcock's sympathetic villains... better than Claude Rains in Notorious, better than James Mason in North by Northwest, comparing favorably to Robert Walker in Strangers on a Train and Shadow of a Doubt's Joseph Cotton, in a fraction of the screen time. He is charming, well-mannered, and portrays more warmth, humanity, and poetry in his words and actions than any of the above.On the other hand, he is an assassination plotter and kidnapper and this is light-hearted entertainment (unlike the second version, which is all nerves and no wit).The cinematography is wonderful. The thing I love most about very early Hitchcock is the German influence (he interned at UFA and his first film, the Pleasure Garden, was a German co-production). Of all of Hitchcock's great works, this is the one most in tune with the aesthetics of silent film, and an important benchmark for one of the few directors whose careers encompass so much of film history. Even the classic 39 Steps filmed the following year does not make such extensive use of "camera tricks" (as Hitch would come to deride them later in his career).The closeups of Frank Vosper's hair, the pin associated with Nova Pilbeam, the POV shots of Edna Best's fainting and Hugh Wakefield tuning out at the church, the entire Albert Hall sequence... they're wonderful touches from the era of telling stories strictly through pictures that you just won't find even in Hitch's later British work. There are plenty of striking frame compositions (over the shoulder, through the gate, formations of people, and that beautiful shot towards the beginning of silhouetted father and daughter looking out the window at Mum) and revealing pans a la Carl Dreyer (my favorite are when Peter Lorre swirls from Vosper to Leslie Bank's face as the music on the radio crescendos, Banks raising a cigarette to his mouth... and at the very end with the police, camera pans to the door, rifles rise.)Hitch also milks the soundtrack for all it's worth. The early films of both Lang and Hitch stick out for their creative and stylistic use of sound. Most overtly, M had Peer Gynt, The Man Who Knew Too Much has the Stormcloud Cantata. There are plenty of more subtle audio cues, the best of which is Peter Lorre's chiming pocket watch. Using music as a cover-up is a motif, as well as sounds of warning and interruption. Compare and contrast the instances, intelligent patterns emerge. This is one well thought out little thriller.When the characters talk, they usually have something clever to say. Leslie Banks has the perfect voice for delivering the obligatory dry British wit... "just leave me a bone on the mat," "sir, you have beaten my wife and she has run off with another man... you are a dirty dog," and, my favorite, "has it been fireproofed?" But if Banks has the best lines, Lorre has the best speech, in the scene setting up the Albert Hall sequence. **possible spoilers on horizon** In the 50's version, this scene is purely informational, basically the villains filling in the audience on the particulars of the plot. But in the original, this is the money scene. Lorre brings in little Nova for a "touching scene" of father and daughter reunited, relates with flair and humor the assassination setup to Vosper, then the whole "Shakespeare... a great poet" speech. Nova is torn from Daddy and the scene ends with a closeup of the obviously moved Lorre, slowly casting his eyes down. Also scope that earlier quick cutaway shot of him, eyes downcast, framed by four co-conspirators. Nice composition.Is the acting solid? Wouldn't normal people be really thrown off by these events, like in the 50's version or the more recent Ransom? Let's say the acting is great in the context of the film. Banks and Lorre, of course, carry the film. Cicely Oates is a prototypical Mrs. Danvers. Nova Pilbeam, who I never noticed much until after watching Young and Innocent, smiles, frowns, looks back and forth between adults, and cries "daddy, daddy!" to sink your heart. Lovely. Edna Best turns away from the camera to show she is crying. She gets nicely worked up in the Albert Hall sequence, but she has nothing on Doris Day in the remake (nor Frank Vosper on Reggie Nalder). But the camerawork carries the day. Kudos also to the bit parts of all the policemen at the end. The many brief but poignant (or at the very least discernible) characterizations keep us caring after the emphasis shifts from the main characters.An extremely subjective 10 out of 10. This is not a "great film" in the manner of M or Shadow of a Doubt. It's mind and eye candy, probably best appreciated by silent film buffs. I'd recommend it to students of German expressionism, fans of early Lang, etc. And, of course, British Hitch fans shouldn't overlook this in all the accolades given to 39 Steps and Lady Vanishes. Same goes for Young and Innocent and Sabotage. Even Secret Agent has interesting things about it, though not that many and Peter Lorre is reduced to a role more like the kind he is delegated to in many a Humphrey Bogart movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Lorre - the Scene Stealer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess that I rather like this earlier version more than the definitely more polished, bigger budgeted 1956 version. Don't get me wrong, that film is a fine film too, but the lower budget, the quick pace, and the presence of Peter Lorre make this one a gem. Alfred Hitchcock, the undeniable maser of suspense, shows his early skills as a director able to create suspense and engineer circumstances that affect individuals who would normally NOT be affected by them - a Hitchcock trademark. Here we have Leslie Banks and Edna Best playing the parents of a young teen girl who has been kidnapped because her parents were the last ones spoken to by a man(a friend) at a party in a European country. Intrigue abounds, the man tells Best who then tells Banks of a note in a brush handle that alerts them to some international incident that will occur in England. Well, the kidnappers alert them of what they have done and shut them up. But through parental devotion, once in England, the father begins to hunt for his daughter. This film has all those Hitchcock trademarks that we know Hitchcock for. We have the normal person(s) put into extremely difficult and complicated situations. We have expressive camera angles. We have humour amidst taut, tense action. We have good, all-around acting. Banks, just a year or so removed from his awesome portrayal of General Zaroff in The Most Dangerous Game, gives an incredibly low-key, convincing performance as a father trying to find his daughter no matter what. He is able to inject light touches of humour here and there to make his performance all the more real. Best is adequate although a bit wooden. Hugh Wakefield as the uncle is a real hoot. Cicely Oates as a nurse is also very convincing. Peter Lorre; however, solidifies his English/American career as a heavy. Coming from a Hungarian background and not able to speak English yet, Lorre learns his part phonetically - which is all the more impressive when you see his performance as a killer with little scruples yet a generous sense of humour. Lorre conveys menace in his ever-alert eyes and his almost sugary voice. Hitchcock knows just how to use him and the climatic scene really is pulled off rather well. This movie is not very long and it is a tad creaky. It has little budget as well, but it conveys lots of action and suspense and has some very good performances. The air of conspiracy, another director's trademark touch, pervades the film almost from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting idea, not the best execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitccock's first major release in the USA and Peter Lorre's first English-speaking role are two firsts scored by this 1934 thriller. This is, of course, also Hitchcock's first attempt to to make this film. His second, released in the mid-50s was more successful and better funded. This very British and relatively pithy film retains most of the character of Hitchcock's earlier efforts, but is lean and economical, with less camera play and simpler cinematography and pacing.The acting is generally very good. Of the main cast, Nova Pilbeam, who plays the kidnapped daughter of Leslie Banks and Edna Best, is the only survivor today, at the age of 87. Most of the action centers on Banks,and he is fine, but (and I tend to think this is Hitchcock's doing) very emotionally compressed throughout the film. Banks' Bob Lawrence has a loving, flirty, wife (Best) and a delightful young daughter (Pilbeam). They are away on holiday in the alps when a new friend of their is shot dead while dancing with Best. As he dies, he passes along some information which creates the family's predicament. Lorre and his people kidnap young Pilbeam in exchange for Banks' silence, and he must then decide what to do. It seems that no matter what he does, his daughter is likely to die.It is remarkable that Lorre did not even know what he was saying throughout most of this performance. The legendary actor, as usual, dominates all of his scenes and gives the film a creepy, psychotic feeling that would have been difficult to achieve without him.The plot is a bit light on logic, but brisk, satisfyingly convoluted and entertaining. The script is OK, but often maintains too stiff an upper lip. A few opportunities for elaboration were missed - probably a limitation inherent in the original Wyndham Lewis story. I think it would have been interesting (and more credible) if the authorities had followed up on their knowledge that Banks knew something and trailed him throughout the film. This could have added an extra layer of potential suspense, mystery and obfuscation, since Best's heightened paranoia might have lead him to suspect all sorts of things about anybody keeping tabs on him.Hitchcock definitely knew he had a potential gem here, and it is a credit to him that he revitalized the film with Jimmy Stewart in the 1950s - after establishing himself as a force to be reckoned with.Worth seeing for Hitchcock fans and those interested in early British film as well as fans of the 1950s version. O/w only very mildly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early gem by the Master of Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few artists have done as much for the thriller genre in film as British director Alfred Hitchcock, who not only was a pioneer of many of the techniques that would become widely used nowadays, but also across his career he literally invented a great amount of the rules that would shape the genre. While his career didn't seem to have started on the best way (his first movie, "The Pleasure Garden" was a failure), after the success of "The Lodger" in 1927, Hitchcock would become one of the most popular young directors in the United Kingdom, and it wouldn't take him much to be recognized worldwide. That recognition came in 1934, when his thriller "The Man Who Knew Too Much" was released, becoming his most acclaimed and successful movie to date and the one that would make him to be noticed by Hollywood. Not only this movie would introduce Hitchcock to America, it would also introduce one of cinema's most important actors: Peter Lorre."The Man Who Knew Too Much" begins in Switzerland, where Bob and Jill Lawrence (Leslie Banks and Edna Best) are on a winter sports holiday with their teenage daughter Betty (Nova Pilbeam). The reason for their visit is that Jill competes in a target shooting competition, and a family friend, Louis Bernard (Pierre Fresnay) competes in a skiing event. During a dinner, Bernard is murdered by an unseen shooter, but before dying he informs the Lawrences about a conspiracy to kill an important diplomat in London. The Lawrences are confused at first by the spy's revelation, but soon the confusion becomes a preoccupation, as the conspirators have kidnapped their daughter Betty in order to keep them quiet. Now the Lawrences know too much, and that knowledge may cost them their daughters, but while unable to tell the police their situation, the couple decides to find their daughter themselves.The screenplay for "The Man Who Knew Too Much" was written by Edwin Greenwood and A.R. Rawlinson, although it was based on a story co-written by D.B. Wyndham-Lewis and Charles Bennett. While the writing of the film was a cooperative effort, it is Charles Bennett's style the one that's shown the most through the story. Bennett's plays and screenplays became the basis of many of the most representative Hitchcock thrillers, and one could say that along with the Master of Suspense, he shaped the genre in its early days. "The Man Who Knew Too Much" includes many of Bennett's trademarks such as criminal spies, their political conspiracies and the innocent people that are dragged unto them; all spiced up by a very British humor that makes the whole thing even more enjoyable.While by 1933 Hitchcock already had made several remarkable films, "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is probably the first of his movies that truly can be considered as an emblematic Hitchcock film, as his style is finally shaped in this movie. Taking the best of Wyndham-Lewis and Bennett's story, Hitchcock brings to life a captivating tale of adventure and mystery that literally takes its innocent characters to the darkest alleys of London. Visually, the movie is a joy, as with the excellent work by cinematographer Curt Courant, Hitchcock shows the influence of German expressionism in his work and creates wonderful images of striking contrast between light and shadows. His dominion of suspense shines in many scenes of the film, particularly in an impressive sequence that serves as climax of the movie, where Hitchcock takes full advantage of the introduction of sound to movies.The performances by the actors are of an excellent quality, with Leslie Banks leading the cast with his charming presence and very British wit. His ability to mix drama with comedy makes his character a very real and likable person, that portrays remarkably the everyman placed in an uncommon situation. While Banks truly makes a great job, the real star of the film is the amazing Peter Lorre as the leader of the conspirators. In this his first work in English, Lorre shows off his enormous talent and steals every single scene he appears in, a remarkable task considering this was his first movie in English and that he had to learn his lines phonetically. Edna Best is good, albeit nothing spectacular; quite the opposite are Frank Vosper and Nova Pilbeam, who make an amazing work considering their limited screen time. Hugh Wakefield has a very funny supporting role where he masterfully displays his talent for comedy.When most people hear about "The Man Who Knew Too Much", the instant memory is often that of Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day trying to recover their kidnapped son in the 1956 version of the movie. That is because Alfred Hitchcock decided to remake this classic in color and with the benefits of being a more experienced filmmaker and having a bigger budget to do it. But even when the Master himself prefer the remake, personally I think that the original movie is the superior version. True, the 1934 version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is not a perfect film, it has an irregular pace (at times too slow, at times too fast) and its plot has some very unlikely situations; however, it has a great charm and a powerful style very difficult to ignore. It is certainly dated by today's standards, but while the remake is technically superior, this one has a heart.After making this movie, the Master's career would only go higher and higher, as the next year he would follow the success of this film with another legendary masterpiece, penned again by Bennett: "The 39 Steps". It has been quoted many times that Hitchcock named this underrated movie, "the work of an amateur", as he stated his preference towards the 50s remake, but here I must disagree with the Master, as personally I think that this is the version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" that should be seen. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If ever a film was in need of restoration it's this. Ironically one of the easiest Hitchcock films to see (because it's in public domain, you can usually pick up a copy in the drugstore for about $3), it's also impossible to find a print of it that's not hideous to look at and practically inaudible. For now, it still looks like the best film of Hitchcock's British Primitive period. Avoiding the clumsiness endemic to the likes of "Secret Agent" and "Blackmail" by pretty much dispensing altogether with character development or a comprehensible plot, it travels like "North by Northwest" along a series of loosely linked set pieces that without adding up to much provide an entertaining and intriguing passing show. Considerably jazzing up the proceedings is the zaftig, boyish young Peter Lorre, who with decadent charm (and not for the first or last time) transforms the putative villain into the tragic hero of the piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite occasional dull spots, this early Hitchcock shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob and Jill Lawrence are a middle-class English couple on holiday in Switzerland; Jill is a crack shot and narrowly loses a competition because of interference from their beloved daughter, but this doesn't stop the Lawrences from doing everything possible to save their daughter when she is kidnapped by a group of spies planning an assassination that the Lawrences have accidentally learned about. The first quarter or so of the movie didn't really move all that well, a bit too much cuteness and exposition given the short running time, but once the locale shifts to London and Bob decides to take matters into his own hands the plot quickens and the film picks up considerably. The dentist-chair scene is as riveting as anything in Hitchcock's British filmography, and Peter Lorre is commanding as the leader of the desperate would-be assassins. I particularly liked the novelty of having a great knock-down, drag-out fight with chairs and pews in a church, and the atmosphere of the interiors in the old hideaway house, with the (expected and foreshadowed) reappearance of crack-shot Jill's talents make for a taut and thrilling finish. A bit more judicious editing and this might well have been a great one; as it is, well worth seeing for Hitchcock or Lorre fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll have to admit that I'm at a disadvantage here; when I learn more about a film from other reviewers than from watching it myself, then that's a problem. Although the plot of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" seems generally straightforward, the movie allows too many cryptic elements to get in the way of what could have been a satisfying mystery. By the time we get to the scene where a witchy looking woman establishes the secrecy of "the first degree of the seven fold ray", I didn't know whether to laugh or rewind to see if I missed something.In retrospect, the cryptic note retrieved by Mr. Lawrence (Leslie Banks) from the handle of a shaving brush was a craftily written message, leading to a dentist named Barbor, and eventually to the Albert Hall, a place, not a person as indicated by "A. Hall". But for all the intrigue, it's never made clear why the assassination target was being eliminated. Okay, so Louis Bernard was killed because he knew of a plot to assassinate a diplomat named Ropa, but why was Ropa a target? Come to think of it, why was the note even written and secured in the shaving brush? Did Bernard have to refer to it every now and then to remind himself what was going to happen?With it's disjointed scenes, "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is hard to follow and a bit disorienting, however I'll give Alfred Hitchcock credit for this early effort. For perspective, I'll have to watch some of his other work of the same era, though this movie certainly can't hold a candle to his later works like "Psycho" or "North by Northwest".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Version?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Which version do you prefer? I'm going to make myself unpopular by saluting the 1934 film which?once the action moves to London?has an alarmingly gritty feel to it, a realistic atmosphere that transcends all the otherwise transparent plot devices to make the story chillingly suspenseful. I'm inclined to echo the ecstatic reviews accorded "The Man Who..." by the New York press of March, 1935. The movie is short, sharp, cogent, powerful, with stand-out performances from Edna Best, Peter Lorre, Frank Vosper, Cicely Oates, Henry Oscar, and in a brief part (and his only English-language movie), Pierre Fresnay.As a trivia footnote, everyone knows that Hitch has no cameo in this version; but few people, if any, have pointed out that producer Michael Balcon is briefly on-screen instead. He's the patron wearing glasses sitting behind the intended victim at Albert Hall.By contrast, the re-make often seems overblown and oddly, equally synthetic in its opening scenes. Although it runs much longer than the original, it has less action and its villains simply don't stand comparison, despite the sterling efforts of Bernard Miles and Brenda de Banzie. Carelessly dubbed Daniel Gelin and obvious padding with Alan Mowbray and Hillary Brooke are likewise big drawbacks. However, this version does build to a more extended, more potent Albert Hall climax, and also revels in superior production values.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Tell her they may soon be leaving us. Leaving us for a long, long journey"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitch's first international success, and a picture he was to remake himself over twenty years later. It is also the earliest of his espionage adventure thrillers ? he would set his own template for this type of film a year later with The 39 Steps, but here he was still experimenting.When Hitchcock remade The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1956 he wanted to put the original completely out of mind and start from scratch with same basic synopsis. But even if Hitchcock wanted to think of them as completely separate pictures, comparing them directly shows just what had and what hadn't developed yet in his film-making formula. The most significant difference for me is in the character who kidnaps the child. By 1956, a Hitchcock film wasn't a Hitchcock film without the audience being misled at some point, hence the kidnappers being a friendly middle-aged couple that no-one would suspect. In 1934 however, the kidnapper is played by the very sinister German actor Peter Lorre. For those who don't know, Lorre made his debut playing a serial child killer in Fritz Lang's M, and well, let's just say he got kind of typecast from then on.The storyline in 1934's Man Who Knew Too Much is quite uneven and episodic, moving from one set piece to another. Some sections are way too long, while at other times it seems to skip forward a bit too fast. But it's all good fun, and rarely gets boring. One of the little set pieces I particularly like is the scene with the struggle over teeth pulling and laughing gas. Hitchcock probably chuckled to himself here as he exploited the fear virtually everyone seems to have of going to the dentist.The plot builds up to the climactic assassination scene at the Albert Hall. It's a brilliant mix of editing being varied shots to build up tension in the style of DW Griffith or Eisenstein, which Hitchcock was so good at even in his early days. Here the build up is given even greater strength by the booming orchestra score which it is synced to. To compare the versions again, the 1956 Albert Hall climax has a much wider scope and a more frantic feel, but the 1934 version keeps that surreal, sinister edge which wasn't as sharp in Hitchcock's later films.The film ends with a shootout between the cops and the villains. This section seems a bit overlong and repetitive, and bizarrely seems to turn into a scene from Oliver Twist at the end. Mind you, it's more enjoyable than the corny Doris Day/Que Sera Sera ending of the 1956 version.As far as the practical directing style goes it's fairly typical of Hitchcock's British period. Heavily influenced by German Expressionism, particularly the work of Fritz Lang, it's full of irregular camera angles, cramped and dingy interiors, close-ups of faces looking directly into the camera and early camera tricks such as dissolves and double exposures. It also contains an early example of one of those unique Hitchcock camera movements, where he draws you in on a particular object, in this case a gun planted in someone's back.The acting talent is OK here, with the usual faceless, plummy-voiced English cast typical for early Hitchcock pictures. The one standout is Peter Lorre, who was in his first English-speaking role and learnt his lines phonetically. He struggles a fair bit with the English dialogue, but his physical acting is absolutely superb. I have to say as well ? another comparison ? Nova Pilbeam is a much less annoying child actor than that little brat in the 1956 version.I'm not sure whether I prefer the 1934 or the 1956 version. Both are very good but neither are brilliant. However, considered alone 1934's Man Who Knew Too Much, while not the most well-constructed film, is good fun and one of the better films of Hitchcock's British period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original v. Remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a long-standing tradition in film for someone to come along at a later time and feel moved to remake a movie now considered a classic.In many cases, the remake is really nothing more than an homage to the earlier version----perhaps updated to reflect the use of color and employment of some subsequent technical advances---but with little else to offer. "Prisoner of Zenda" (1952) and the recent "Psycho" come to mind as examples of such productions.Occasionally, the creator of the earlier film feels inspired to try to improve upon it himself. This by no means ensures success. Compare Frank Capra's "Lady for a Day" (1934) with his "Pocketful of Miracles." ((1951) On the other hand, many believe that DeMille's "Ten Commandments" (1956) is better in its story telling than his silent version made in 1923.So much has been written about the two versions of "Man Who Knew Too Much" that there is very little one can add that hasn't been said before. Having seen them recently back-to-back, my personal opinion is that they are both flawed---but in different ways. The earlier film is quaintly primitive---particularly in matters involving continuity, use of sound, editing and other technical issues. On the other hand, the later version seems excessively padded with much extraneous material, has a male juvenile actor who is quite inferior to Nova Pilbeam in the original and has villains who lack the unique menace of Peter Lorre---with his rare combination of subtle humor, wit and terror.In the end, the viewer is left with a sort of Hobson's Choice. Hitchcock himself said that the earlier work was that of a skilled amateur while the latter was the effort of a seasoned professional. No doubt in many ways he is right.But there is something to be said about the sheer originality and power of a first effort----flawed though it may be. "Citizen Kane" was also the product of a skilled amateur. Could a more mature Orson Welles have improved upon it even with its flaws?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All through his career Hitchcock did great films; this was not one of them.A man knows too much, his daughter is kidnapped to secure his silence, and in the denouement all is resolved to the accompaniment of gunfire and rooftop drama.Anyone who has seen 1930s Fritz Lang films- 'M' comes to mind- will know how far this urban narrative of crime and conscience falls short of what had already been done in that genre at that time. There is an altogether amateurish air about much of the staging and acting which subverts any sense of menace, darkness, and depravity that Hitchcock might have been seeking to instil.What it is worth watching out for, however, is the sequence associated with the shooting at the Albert Hall. Once that kicks off it is as if the film has been given a blood transfusion. The camerawork is lively, the cuts are interesting, and the way that everything combines to a climax is masterly. Here you can see the future master: Hitchcock effortlessly orchestrate all the resources to impressive and memorable effect: when the scream comes you really feel as well as hear it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Lorre; What a Great Villain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is pretty intense movie. It moves along well, with some interesting twists and turns along the way. It contains some classic Hitchcock moves. Mainly, the crowded theatre scene. The proper British woman, wondering if she should do anything and interrupt the concert, even though her daughter's life may be at stake. As for villains, Peter Lorre and his henchmen(women) are absolutely delightful in an awful sort of way. As an American it is hard for me to have that stiff upper lip. Everyone is so controlled. Some of the humor is far fetched but much of the movie is tongue in cheek. Still, it works very well. The frontal assault at the conclusion seems wasteful, considering they had the crooks dead to rights, but one can accept it as trying to evaluate the situation. One distracting thing for me is the daughter. I've seen this film a number of times. The fact that she looks older than her mother always bothers me. She is also rather tiresome and silly. Still, this is great fun, shot well, and Lorre makes us really pull for the good guys because he is such a psycho.</fullReview>

Leslie Banks is the stiff upper lip English hero battling against a bizarre band of sinisterly-accented foreigners operating out of a dental surgery and a spiritualist church!

		<shortDescription>Still the real "Man Who Knew Too Much"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was inspired by a real event, a prolonged street battle between Engish police and a group of violent anarchists holed up in a house in a fairly respectable working-class neighborhood. The politics are important exactly because Hitchcock refuses to play them up. Thus in the final gun battle, we are given a surprisingly sympathetic portrait of Abbot - in a most remarkable performance by Peter Lorre - as a sophisticated, misguided idealist, but equally sympathetic portraits of the dedicated, hard-working policemen he helps gun down.Leading up to this battle is a surprising mixture of almost unrelieved suspense and, of all things, humor, most of it in the mode of high irony. Hitchcock presents us with a snapshot of an England bordering on the insufferably smug mixed with the culturally chaotic - emphasized by the the fact that the 'church' the anarchists hold up in is dedicated to the cult of sun-worship(!) - the result of the wildly extravagant wealth England enjoyed towards the end of the 19th Century, here portrayed as rapidly vanishing in a European political climate perpetually threatening world war.All of this would prove uncomfortably heavy from any other director. But Hitchcock uses his editing brilliant, not only within scenes, but moving scene to scene, to effect a rapid pace that never gives us time for reflection on such issues. Instead we hold onto the hero's coattails and hope for the best, even when the worst threatens at every turn.A truly remarkable suspense film that still packs a punch. Far superior to the '50s remake, which tends to be inflated beyond the story's natural strengths, a bit gaudy, largely overacted, and lacking in the solid, if troubling, political grounding we find here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From a modern standpoint, it's quite hard to understand why so many people claim to prefer this 1934 thriller to its 1956 remake. It's technically primitive (as is immediately evident in the opening sequence) and often clumsy, with one of the weakest climaxes in a Hitchcock film ever (a totally suspenseless shootout). However, there are some brilliant Hitchcockian touches (the singing in the church, the famous Albert Hall sequence), and, above all, there is a delicious, way-ahead-of-its-time performance by Peter Lorre - the one area where the original clearly outshines the remake. Almost every scene featuring Lorre is a highlight of this movie. (**1/2)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder at the clash of cymbals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's early British career, included the original version of this film, which evidently the director thought needed to be retold. He did get his wish in the 1956 glossier Technicolor remake while already established in Hollywood. The 1935 was, in retrospect a lot of fun, although it's hard to imagine its appeal to today audiences. The original black and white film feels a lot stagy and perhaps less fluid than the second take, but like all sequels, even with its flaws, the first film has its own merits. Curt Courant was credited with the cinematography.The earlier version, made in the Lime Grove Studios, presents a different Hitchcock that most of today's viewers will probably not appreciate. Yet, there is so much wit that went into the production, it will be hard to dismiss it as a minor work by the director. Sure, in retrospect, this film has a feeling of being a bit more unpolished than its remake, but that was the style of the period in the British cinema.The acting is what makes the film such an enjoyable experience. Peter Lorre is the best thing in the picture. With his strange hair, Mr. Lorre, made quite an effort to speak perfect English, the language not being his native tongue. Mr. Lorre had left his native Germany to pursue his film career in England. Lorre's Abbott is part of the kidnapping plot that took Betty Lawrence hostage. Frank Vosper's Ramon was another asset. Leslie Banks and Edna Best, one of Hitchcock's blonds, were perfect at the Lawrences. Pierre Fresnay's role was later done by Daniel Gelin. Hugh Wakefield, Cicely Oates, and Nora Pilbeam did excellent work in supporting roles.Supposedly the Albert Hall sequence, although mentioned in the IMDb page as having been used as a location, was not, in reality. The whole film was shot in the studio. The real concert Hall comes out in all its glory in the 1956 version. On a curious note, one never gets to know what was the reason for the killing of the diplomat attending the performance of Arthur Benjamin's "Storm Clouds" cantata, for orchestra and full chorus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfred Hitchcock and Peter Lorre make for a fine, fast-paced and unnerving thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When faced with the same story directed by the same man, the first more than 70 tears old with somewhat dated acting and a terrible, dark, fuzzy DVD transfer (in the version I watched), and the other in color, modern and slick, glossy and entertaining, with charismatic leads and 45 more minutes of screen time, which do you watch? If it weren't for the intense and lasting irritation of seeing a first-class movie terribly presented, I'd vote for Hitchcock's 1934 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much. The story is the same. A couple on vacation sees a friend shot. The man gives them a message that must be delivered to Whitehall. A foreign dignitary will be assassinated during a performance in Albert Hall. The plotters, to keep the couple from stopping their plans, kidnap their child. If they deliver the message and alert authorities to the assassination, the couple's child will be killed. They decide to find their child themselves. It builds up to a crashing cantata in the Hall and then the desperate rescue of the child. Not bad at all. In 1934 Hitchcock dishes up for us a tense thriller with the emphasis on tightly constructed sequences. The humor is there only as a counterpoint. Hitchcock moves the story briskly toward that showdown in Albert Hall, then tops that with a violent shootout that leaves bodies on the floor. Bob and Jill Lawrence (Leslie Banks and Edna Best) are an upper-class British couple, well-bred, smart, plucky and brave. Hitchcock also gives us a creepy, riveting, smiling villain in Abbott, played by Peter Lorre in his first English language film. Lorre learned his lines phonetically; he knew almost no English. Lorre focuses the film as an intense, unpredictable thriller every time he's on screen. In 1956, Hitchcock gives us an upper-middle class American couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) with a cliché of a husband who enjoys not knowing anything about foreign cultures and an all-American corn-fed wife in serious need of medication. Hitchcock uses that extra 45 minutes on lengthy, sly humor and colorful tourist photography, neither of which advances the story. Despite Stewart's earnestly laconic performance and Day's overwrought emoting, the bones of the thriller still keep us interested. Still, I had the feeling that with the 1934 movie I was watching one of the best of Hitchcock's English movies and with the 1954 version I was watching just one of his highly professional and entertaining Hollywood hits. To see what I mean, compare the 1934 sequence in the dentist's office - a struggle silent except for groans and the sound of laughing gas escaping - and the 1956 sequence in the taxidermist's shop. One is suspenseful, almost queasy and masterful. The other is just an excuse for a few laughs. The clever and tense showpiece of both versions is in the Albert Hall and it works both times. The emotional conclusion, the rescue of the child, is a far different story. In 1954 we have an embassy dinner, Doris Day singly loudly and Stewart and his son walking down the stairs. It works if you have nothing to compare it with. In 1934, the nearly 15-minute shootout brings everything to a murderous climax, with ingenious rescues, violent confrontations and the emotionally satisfying fate of Abbott. His death is, well, kind of fun as well as satisfying. Hitchcock takes the time at the start of the movie to establish Jill Lawrence as a crack shot with a rifle. We learn why he did this now, and it has nothing to do with Abbott. Peter Lorre, plus Hitchcock's way of building a clever, tense story, makes this movie a pleasure to watch. But let's not forget Leslie Banks and Edna Best. She was a competent star actress who never quite reached the top. I wonder what she might have done without such a frumpy name. She makes Jill a woman who will not have a nervous breakdown. When Jill needs to pull a trigger, she does. Leslie Banks was a fine stage actor who had a decent career in the movies. He was wounded in WWI and was left with half his face paralyzed and disfigured (not horribly but easy to notice). When he played nice guys or heroes, he showed the good side. With bad guys, he showed the damaged side. To see him use those two sides of his face as a charming host and then as a really bad guy, watch The Most Dangerous Game. Perhaps somewhere there is a fine, restored version of this movie. If so, it would be a pleasure to watch and to own.</fullReview>

The terror is palpable. The building of suspense is masterful. The villains are very creepy and very likely to achieve their aim. You can't possibly figure out how this could unravel and as I mentioned, it has, without question, the best timed scream in Cinema. Not to be confused with the lesser 1956 version, also by Hitchcock (which is still worth seeing even if it isn't quite as good), The Man Who Knew Too Much is one of Hitchcock's best and one to see again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knockabout Hitchcock Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock and Truffaut almost had an argument over the relative value of this (1934) version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" and the 1956 remake. Hitchcock, always averse to confrontation, finally admitted that the early film was the work of a talented amateur and the 1956 version that of a professional.For a "talented amateur," this is pretty good stuff. It's true that the later version is glossier, more tense, and edgier, but this one is a lot of fun. We don't really worry for a moment that the kidnapped child (Nova Pilbeam) of Leslie Banks and Edna Best will be harmed. Nor can we readily imagine that the anonymous ambassador will be assassinated at the Albert Hall. Leslie Banks and his pal, who are trying to locate the place in London where the child is being held, don't seem to take the threat too seriously either. Where Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day played the pursuit almost entirely straight (with the exception of one ludicrous scene in a taxidermist's shop), Banks and Buddy make wisecracks and engage in one comic adventure after another -- even a horrifying scene is the office of a sinister dentist who grins demoniacally as he intones, "That one had better come out." (Gulp.) Edna Best as the anxious mother isn't around all that much. The place occupied by Doris Day in the remake is taken by Banks' somewhat mentally stunted male buddy. You can get more laughs out of a male buddy than out of a fearful wife. You can bop the buddy over the head, hypnotize him, hit him with folding chairs, and pull his tooth. Try doing that to a near-hysterical Doris Day.Yes, the 1956 version is a more polished film, but it's a different kind of film too. This one is almost farcical and has Peter Lorre as a suavely sneaky murderer. It has a climactic shoot out that isn't particularly well done. But they're both identifiably Hitchcockian. Take your pick. You win either way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's be honest these early Hitchcock films of the 20's and 30's can be difficult to watch. The sound and picture are of poor quality, but the work is the best that the master of suspense ever produced. In my opinion Hitchcock should only be watched in black and white. Of course, there are exceptions such as "To Catch a Thief" and "North by Northwest", but for the most part, the early films are the essential films. In this film noir, a couple's child is abducted in St. Moritz and the two spend the film trying to recover her. The film is clever and chilling in parts. I found the film so intriguing that I took a trip to St. Moritz this past summer. As I rolled through the various tunnels throughout the Alps, I thought about how that very track was where many of Hitchcock's inspirations originated. This is a great film and a classic in the film noir genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Template</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock did more than make an entertaining suspense film with this early British talkie. He created a template to follow in later films, all with the central idea of innocents trapped in a web of geopolitical intrigue. "The 39 Steps", "Secret Agent", "Foreign Correspondent", "Saboteur", "Notorious", and "North By Northwest" are all its remakes as much as the other "Man Who Knew Too Much" Hitchcock made in 1956.There's ample humor, slight-of-hand, and misdirection plays in this movie, and Peter Lorre presents us with one of the best villains in Hitchcock's overstocked oeuvre. But I understand what Hitchcock meant when he called this the work of "an inspired amateur." "Too Much" is patchy in tone and pace. While it interests and impresses, it never quite engages. Yet it's also a film that paved the way for Hitchcock's unequalled career, and you are never bored by it.Bob and Jill Lawrence are in St. Moritz, where she is competing in a skeet-shooting contest. A shot of another kind brings their mountain idyll to a sudden halt, as a friend's murder places vital information for British authorities in their hands. Before anything can be done, the Lawrences' daughter is kidnapped. "Say nothing of what you have found or you will never see your child again", reads a note they get. Pressure builds as authorities try to get the Lawrences to spill the beans to save a life, perhaps many."If there is any trouble - I hope you'll remember you're to blame," a shadowy Foreign Office man exclaims.Hitchcock sets things off quickly here, introducing the key killing less than ten minutes in and squeezing the entire film into 75 minutes. Perhaps that's why the lead performances are so wooden. Leslie Banks as Bob Lawrence and Edna Best as Jill are the weak links in this film, 1930s sound technology making worse their high, reedy voices. Everything seems designed for shock and effect, and while it works more often than not, there's a hollowness at its core, like with a much-celebrated chair fight that never feels the least bit real, or a fight with a maniacal dentist that ends way too easy.But there's a lot to love in this film, or at least really like, beginning with the clever humor, both in the script and the way Hitchcock frames it. Things in this film happen in perverse ways. A gun-shot man almost seems embarrassed by his fatal wound. A woman answers a phone while we think (wrongly) we know who is on the other line.What pushes this film into stronger territory still is Lorre as the head bad guy, Abbott. It's unusual seeing him play the character he does here, not because he's a sympathetic bad guy (Lorre was always good at that) but because he's so suave. When he threatens, it's not in that "Help me, Rick" strangled voice of his so often imitated but almost a cooing undertone. More often he laughs, quite engagingly, or else smiles at a prisoner to assure them that all is fine that he is in charge and they will be safe as long as they obey him. When one of his henchmen pulls out a gun, thinking the law is onto them, Lorre grins and almost winks as he motions for the guy to relax.The climax of the film is especially well-shot, using a real-life 1911 incident in London's Sidney Street as the basis for a gunfight between the villains and the police with the Lawrences stuck in the middle as always. It is here that one most gets a sense of Hitchcock's fledgling mastery, as well as the unique quality of darkness this film has over the 1956 "Too Much," whatever the later film's virtues.Not great Hitchcock, but pretty close, "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is a fine stepping stone for a director who was knowing more all the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock mixing Expressionism and Peter Lorre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is best remembered for the expressionist influences on Hitchcock surfacing in the some of the scenes that do not tend to show in the later works of the director. In this film there is the scream that is followed by a gunshot?Hitchcock used the scream to be followed by an engine whistle in "Blackmail" made earlier. In the remake of the film the aural effect gets further diluted?another evidence that the director was no longer a wide-eyed disciple of what he learned in Europe.Details such as the chiming pocket watch worn by Peter Lorre, the close up of the villain's hair from behind his head, the close up of the teeth in front of the dentist's clinic, the visual gimmick of the camera view going off-focus to indicate the state of a character are examples of Hitchcock being influenced by early European expressionist cinema. The reversal of the role of the dentist and patient was probably the closest Hitchcock came to slapstick comedy though the entangling of the knitting as the dance went on was sheer visual entertainment.The five hands pointing to a bullet hole in the glass pane seemed to be overdone, considering that the shot and the breaking glass is never heard by the dancers. Another strange sequence is the brawl inside the church when chairs are thrown around but no sound is heard outside.This film is one of the few films of Hitchcock that show women as strong individuals?the others are "Jamaica Inn," "Rebecca," "Spellbound," " Easy virtue" and perhaps "Marnie." Here the leading lady is a sharpshooter, outdoing the cops at shooting. She even flirts with a man in front of her husband and daughter! Peter Lorre is as usual able to combine fear and sympathy?Hitchcock's best villains always did this ("Frenzy" and " Sabotage" are good examples as well). Lorre's role carries the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***** Some Spoilers Ahead *****"The Man Who Knew Too Much" is an early film from director Alfred Hitchock. A couple (Leslie Banks and Edna Best) on Holiday in Switzerland make the acquaintance of a gentleman who is suddenly shot. Before he dies, he involves them in a political intrigue and an assassination attempt. The result is that their daughter (Nova Pilbeam) ends up being kidnapped and the couple is given a note warning them that if they inform the police, they will never see her again. The suspense builds when the father tries to locate the girl himself and while the mother must decide whether to stop the assassination and risk the death of her daughter or say nothing and let a man be killed."The Man Who Knew Too Much" has many great Hitchock touches and shows his developing mastery of the complexity of telling a story on film. Several things in the movie are connected when the story goes full circle: for example, the mother, who is a crack shot with a rifle, loses a competition with a gentleman due to a distraction, and she later interferes with a shot by the same man who turns out to be the hired assassin. There are some other interesting tie-ins of events like this in the film which made me think and make the film fun to watch over again. The sense of humor which Peter Lorre's character has in the story is great. Edna Best is touching and watchable as the mother.Unfortunately, I wouldn't consider this one of Hitchcock's best. Portions of the film are annoyingly dated, including some of the filming techniques such as utilizing the technique of having the actors occasionally work while far too obviously standing in front of a film of background activity on a screen behind them. It was poorly done a couple of times in this film. Also, several of the characters were rather bland and I found it hard to determine who they were and just how they fit into the movie. Hitch has done much better, but if you are a Hitchcock fan, you'll no doubt find this film of interest. I rate it a 74/100.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rollicking Dark Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much is rollicking if at times rather dark fun. With a witty script by, among others, Charles Bennett, D.D. Wyndham-Lewis and Emlyn Williams, the films journeys from St. Moritz, where an English couple's daughter has been kidnapped by a group of international criminals with plans to assassinate a foreign dignitary, to London, where most of the film takes place. The exposition of the early scenes in Switzerland is somewhat vague and unsatisfying, but once the action moves to England things improve considerably. There are political and social undercurrents throughout the film, which seems from time to time to be either anticipating or warning about a world war. Foreigners (i.e. non-Brits) come off badly, though the British are themselves presented as scarcely more competent, if a good deal more benevolent.By today's standards this is a primitive film, though to anyone with a feeling for the past it's a delight. The London of 1934 is presented as a largely seedy place of forbidding, under-lit streets populated by often unsavory characters. Several scenes stand out as set pieces, notably a tense, semi-comical trip to a dingy dentist's office. Also a standout is a meeting in the church of a strange, sun-worshipping religious sect used as a cover by the criminals, climaxing in a humorous m?lée in which characters throw tables and chairs at one another. A shootout between the criminals and the police is extremely well done, as we get to view it from several different perspectives, at street-level, from the rooftops, and so on.As the mother, Edna Best gets to play a character at once lady-like and heroic, while the father, portrayed by the very capable Leslie Banks, while certainly brave enough, is somewhat ineffectual, if witty. Nova Pilbeam, as the daughter, has an odd, sharply angled face that makes her strangely compelling and sympathetic. Peter Lorre's ring-leader, with a white racing streak in his hair, comes across as a basically gentle soul unfortunately beset by demons he cannot control, which in turn make him do distasteful things he disapproves of and comes to regret.Hitchcock does a fine job of directing the film, arguably the first "real" Hitchcock picture, and a big hit when it first came out. He maximizes suspense and has a way of stressing relationships between characters that are not in the script but come about because of the way they're photographed. The criminals are at all times presented as human, while the good guys are flawed in many ways. We can see many of the themes that turn up in Hitchcock's later films,--the "wrong man", the way international events impinge on provincial Anglo-Saxons, the incompetence of the police--in their early stages. What had yet to emerge was the smoothness, the perfect timing, the elegant construction of his later American films. The director's talent, like Chaplin's in his early films, is still in a kind of music hall-vaudeville phase, which is to say crude, with wonderful, shining moments, but lacking the fine-tuned, lapidary qualities one associates with his best work. That would come later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early thriller foreshadows many of the things that would later become trademarks of Hitchcock's films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Knew Too Much is the first in a string of six thrillers released by Alfred Hitchcock in the 1930s that would go on to associate him with the thriller genre for the rest of his career, whether he liked it or not, in many cases. We see the origins of many Hitchcock staples such as his fascination with trains, his fear and contempt for the police, the wrong man theme and, not necessarily one that made it into many of his later films, a rather disappointingly simple and routine storyline. We get the clichéd cops and robbers type storyline, but in this film, rather than bringing it down, the simple plot adds to the film as a whole because it complements Hitchcock's skills as a director in that he was able to construct such a lively and interesting film using only a mediocre plot.Bob and Jill Lawrence are on a family vacation when they stumble into a circle of crime that leaves them fighting for the life of their daughter, unable to go to the police for help because it would risk her life even more. They become deeply involved in this criminal scheme before they even realize it, leaving them to the task of getting their daughter back from the criminals entirely on their own. The risk to their daughter's life is contrary to the constant humor that permeates the film from beginning to end. Even in the most tense and serious moments, Hitchcock inserts incongruous humor ('When Louie was killed there was a paper in this brush.' 'How terribly thrilling?') that strangely is able to lighten the tone of the film without taking away from the tension created by the kidnapping.The script itself is brilliantly simple, and the performances are mostly first rate. Peter Lorre in particular, who had to learn his lines phonetically because he did not speak much English, is highly effective, but sadly Edna Best does not leave much of an impression. Her reaction to the news that her daughter has been kidnapped is some of the weakest acting I've ever seen in a Hitchcock film.The film has a spectacular climax scene, which takes place in a crowded theater and is probably one of the single scenes that really showed Hitchcock and the viewing audience what he was best at in film-making. In considering this and other films that followed the recent and disappointing Rich and Strange, Hitch's films seem to have become more focused on what he is best at, and the climactic scene in this movie I think was one of the main catalysts for that shift. This one should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake, What remake???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early English Hitchcock.....it can't be beat. This film did not need to be remade with Doris Day's singing added! Yikes, it's like adding dancing to "Notorious". Leslie Banks, a good, solid British actor does quite well in the lead and brings some humor to an otherwise dramatic part. Nova Pilbeam, a strange looking girl, who Hitchcock used to better advantage in "Young and Innocent", looks too old for the part here. Edna Best, the sharpshooting wife is fine and Pierre Fresnay, who went on to shine in "Grand Illusion", does a nice job as the friend with a secret. But, of course, it is Peter Lorre, who had just fled from an erupting Germany, that one remembers when this film is mentioned. His character, at once slimy and kind, is the epitome of what Lorre could do to garner sympathy for the villain. Too bad, his talents were not better served once he came to Hollywood. His best pictures were done early and this is one of them. This British Hitchcock is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the masterpiece the remake is, but absolutely stunning (possible spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wonderful early Hitch, often used as a testcase for the relative merits of the director's English and American work. The comparison is seemingly unfair, this being considered a superior English Hitch, the remake jaded and uninspired. I actually prefer this latter, Doris Day notwithstanding - it has Hitch in absolute control of his medium; a rich, visual and formal coherence that is compelling and complex; an extraordinary James Stewart performance; a transmutation of the thriller genre into the dreamlike trauma of a man whose complacent bourgeois life suddenly evaporates out of his control (see especially the whole Church sequence). The original is lesser on these counts, but brings all the mislaid virtues of English Hitch that can still shock viewers familiar only with the American work.The plot is almost identical until the climax, but seems utterly different because of the difference in Hitchcock's style - the one is swift and dislocating, the other is laidback yet unnerving. Bob Lawrence, unspecifiedly wealthy, his sharpshooting wife Jill and impish daughter Betty, are on holiday in a Swiss ski resort with their friend Louis Bernard. Unbeknownst to his companions, Bernard is a British spy, and is shot by German agents. Before he dies, he gets word to Bob to hide a secret piece of information, concerning an assassination attempt by the same agents which could spark off another world war. They kidnap Betty to ensure his silence, but he manages to trace them to a suburban church.Hitchcock is often accused of having a misogynistic aversion to mothers, but, as Robin Wood pointed out, it is fathers, and by extension patriarchy, that most provokes his ire. Bob Lawrence is a wonderful character, droll, relaxed, bravely concealing terrible emotion, but he is an inept hero, and worse father. Indeed, he is placed on the same level as his daughter, a childish imp of subversion - she disrupts a ski-run, he, wonderfully, entangles an elegant dance in his wife' knitting.He lets his wife flirt with another man, while he lounges aimlessly and puts his daughter in the vulnerable position where she can be kidnapped. When he begins actively searching for her, he puts his friend in physical (and worse?) danger. On finding the villains' hiding place, he is paralysed, and when he finally helps his daughter escape, he puts her in VERTIGinous danger of her life. This is the rock on which the gendered society of the time was based.His wife, on the other hand, is this fop's opposite, both morally and heroically. She literally wears the trousers at the beginning, engaging in shooting competitions with renowned sportsmen. Indeed, it looks like the family is hemming her in - her daughter makes her lose the contest, and when they go back to London she is conventional and hysterical, coded in her wearing feminine clothes, while her husband does all the detective work.But while he digs ever bigger holes for herself, she does all the heroic work he should be doing - she foils the assassination, she leads the police to the terrorists, and she saves her daughter by symbolically appropriating the phallic gun of male preserve. This is thrilling stuff in an age when the battle for emancipation had ended, and bourgeoisification had returned the housewife to the kitchen.It's not just on a narrative level that the woman is pre-eminent - she brings coherence to the plot. Because, as with all his English films, Hitchcock plays merry havoc with form, disorienting the viewer with shock edits; grotesque visuals; unnerving camera angles; dislocating use of sound; the interruption of smooth narrative flow with an almost music-hall flippancy. One of Hitchcock's primary means of derailing the forward thrust of narrative is the elaborate set-piece, which, while fulfilling the needs of plot, slow down the action, turn it into a different kind of spectacle, almost abstracting it. The chair fight in the Church is an hilarious example of this.Best of all, though, is the climax. Although not based on it, this film shares a title with a G.K. Chesterton novel, and the climax shares with Chesterton the terrifying flooding of normality with the dreamlike and violently absurd. The war of attrition that takes place between the police and the Germans is horrifying it its plausibility and brutality, made even worse by Hitchcock humanising the puppets he is about to fell. The narrative has pretensions to global significance, with its intimations of a possible World War, but it is this destabilising on the local level, this wrenching of the domestic by inhuman 'ideological' forces that truly frightens.The acting in English Hitch is usually seen as inferior to the Hollywood classics, and it is true that Leslie Banks is no Cary Grant or James Stewart; but his old-boy japery conceals great depths. Best of all, though, is Peter Lorre, brutal and terrifying, yes, but a cultured melancholy man who seems truly unhappy to have to do what he does; genuinely affected when his lesbian assistant is killed. His final suicide is less a refusal of capture than the final release of a metaphysically tormented soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irregular Early Work of Alfred Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In St. Moritz, the British crack shot Jill (Edna Best) is competing in shooting with the foreigner Ramon (Frank Vosper). She loses the finals and she goes to a dinner party with her husband Bob Lawrence (Leslie Banks), their teenage daughter Betty (Nova Pilbeam) and their fellowship friend and skier Louis Bernard (Pierre Fresnay). While dancing with Jill, Louis is deadly shot by a sniper and he asks Jill to get a shaving brush in his room and deliver to an authority in the consulate. Bob finds a hidden message inside the brush, but he receives a note informing that his daughter was kidnapped and his wife and he should not tell anything to the police. Jill and Bob return to London and the secretary of the Foreign Office Gibson George Curzon) explains that Louis belonged to the special services and was spying the attempt of assassination of a prominent European diplomat while visiting London. Bob decides to investigate a clue with his friend Clive (Hugh Wakefield) in Wapping and discovers that the murder will take place at the Albert Hall. However, he is imprisoned by the conspirators and Jill goes to the theater to avoid the crime. "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is one of the early Alfred Hitchcock's movies and very irregular in its execution. There are brilliant moments, like the sequence in the Albert Hall or the shooting in the ending; or funny, like for example the sequence of Bob's prank in the ball with the knit line or the witty dialogs during the competition. Unfortunately, there are also some dull moments, like the scenes with the annoying Betty; or the silly fight in the church; or the lack of credit to Clive's explanation to the policemen; or why Abbot did not kill Bob and Betty. The cinematography is not good in the Brazilian DVD released by Continental distributor, but it is the only chance to see this work of Alfred Hitchcock. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "O Homem Que Sabia Demais" ("The Man Who Knew Too Much")</fullReview>

Edna Best and Leslie Banks play a couple whose teenage daughter is abducted for ransom. The film might be dated but it is worth watching his earlier work. This film shows the dark side of human nature. The scene in the church where it's first to be authentic but is actually a front turns to be dark comedic in the film. We don't see women involved in such illegal and immoral activities. The cast here are mostly known for British theatrical backgrounds. Nova Pilbeam plays the kidnapped daughter.

		<shortDescription>A recognisably English thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opinions on this film seem to divide fairly dramatically between those who consider all the English cast to be 'wooden' and implausible and those who find them immediately recognisable and charming: "well-bred, smart, plucky and brave". (Apparently corresponding neither to the generational nor the national dividing lines one would expect, to judge by the comments I overheard at tonight's screening in London.) I would assign myself very definitely to the second camp: these are characters immediately familiar to anyone who knows the films or popular novels of the period, reassuringly akin in their reticence and understated courage and use of humour to defend their deepest feelings (American viewers, think 'hobbits'...). And it's refreshing to see an ordinary middle-aged couple taking a major role on screen rather than heavily glamorised star-types.Hitchcock's films always benefited from a judicious dose of humour to alleviate the tension, and this one has a light touch with it, along with the usual touch of slight naughtiness (the mattress that is "still warm", for instance...) It manages to wrong-foot both the viewer and/or cinematic conventions a few times (when the villain fires at the hero and actually gets him, for instance, or when it is shown that the Secret Service have -- as of course they would -- ordered an intercept on the phone) although some of the plotting is inevitably somewhat arbitrary in order to force a more exciting set-up. I did feel that Peter Lorre's comic-book-mastermind performance was a bit over the top compared to the other actors (as with his character in "Secret Agent").I was wondering why the name 'Nova Pilbeam' rang a bell. In fact, this is the same actress who was to give such a good performance as an adult only a few years later in "Young and Innocent". As a child actress she is adequate; she would do better things later.I found this one of the more enjoyable Hitchcocks so far, probably because I got on with its sense of humour. The villains are just about ruthless enough to be credible (so often with this sort of plot, one is left asking "why didn't they just KILL him?!"), the authorities are less bumbling than convenience often dictates, minor characters are swiftly and vividly created (always a good sign... I loved Mrs Brockett...) and the ending is neatly foreshadowed in the beginning. I do hope somebody remembered poor Uncle Clive though :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of Hitchcock's early works, before he got to be nicknamed as The Master of Suspense. Therefore, it may not be considered truly "hitchcockian" for some. But for those who love his cinema in general, then this is a good bet.In my opinion, this movie is interesting enough without being that intriguing. There is some action in it, but it's a very elderly type of action. There is some suspense, but not much.The best thing about this movie is the magnificent swiss scenario. Scenario aside, the best moments of the movie are any with the fantastic actor Peter Lorre. With his charm and charisma, he makes the movie better. Apparently he couldn't speak English at this stage yet, but you couldn't tell that in the movie.The cover of the movie is hilarious. I wonder why in the world would they put Peter Lorre's face green as if he was an ogre...Even though this film might not be that "hitchcockian" (that is, at least in the traditional sense of the word), it is, like all Hitchcock's films, strange and weird.This movie had a remake (made by Hitchcock himself) but I've never seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Man Who Knew Too Much' is one of Hitchcock's earlier underrated works. It may not be his best due to certain flaws such as plot holes but it remains an entertaining film as it cleverly balances suspense and humour. The cinematography is usually a plus point in most of Hitchcock's films and here it's no difference. The writing of the characters is quite good for a movie that is of the film noire genre. The dialogues are witty and loaded with sarcastic humour. The atmosphere is also quite well set. Some of the sets don't look overly polished, elegant or artificial as was the case in most movies of the time and this adds a realistic touch. The acting by Leslie Banks, Edna Best and Peter Lorre is brilliant. About 22 years later, Hitchcock would remake this film. I wonder why he chose to do so. Perhaps I'll know after seeing the 1956 Doris Day version. As for this movie, it is great fun and also interesting to see something from the early days of cinema just after the silent film era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Best British Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people seem to prefer Alfred Hitchcock's "The Thirty Nine Steps" (1935) as his best British film. Another film he made in Britain is vastly better, and it is called "The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1934) (remade in 1956 under the same name by Hitchcock himself). Wheres "The Thierty Nine Steps" has a nice central performance by Robert Donat and so good situations (like the hero being hand cuffed to the heroin for part of the movie), some of it has dated badly, especially the back projection used when Donat is in Scotland. This isn't to take anything away from "The Thirty Nine Steps". Its immensely enjoyable, but its not as good as "The Man Who Knew Too Much". This film has hardly any back projection (the only use of it is in a short segment at the beginning set in Switzerland), and has a brilliant leering performance from one of the great character actors of all time, Peter Lorre. Also, there are more memorable sequences, such as the recreation of the Sidney Street Siege, escapades including a dentist chair, and a East End Mission. There are polished performances from Leslie Banks, Edna Best and Frank Vosper. A film to treasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man Who Knew Too Much is one of Alfred Hitchcock's early thrillers and shows his flair as a director. This is film is very short and fast paced, and follows the formula that Hitchcock mastered.The film focuses on the Lawerence Family who were on holiday in Switzerland. They befriend a Louis (Pierre Fresnay), a Frenchmen. During their final night of the Lawerence's stay Louis is a killed and he tells Bob (Leslie Banks) to go to his room and retrieve his information and tell the British Consul. Bob does this, but the spy-ring kidnap his daughter and say he will never see her again if he passes on the information. When back in London, Bob and Jill (Edna Best) are heartbroken, but refuse to tell the police or the Foreign Office anything, fearing for their daughter. After receiving a call from Wapping, East London, Bob and Jill's brother go to discrit before the police, hoping to find his daughter before the police.This isn't Hitchcock's best film, but it's a good film. Some of the acting lets it down because it's a little over-the-top, Peter Lorre steals the show with his subtle but sinner performance as the head of the spy-ring. What makes the film work is the visual and the plot twists. There are some excellent Hitchcock shots and cuts which became his trademark. There was also a good final shoot-out which was based on real events.It's a decent watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This early Alfred Hitchcock version of a film he remade in 1956 is far superior. For one, it lacks the Hollywood gloss of the remake and for another it was way ahead of its time with a woman heroine, the mother of the kidnapped child, as the rescuer.This was Hitch's first important film in that it got him favourable notices outside of the UK and also facilitated bigger budgets for the films that were made after this one.Leslie Banks and Edna Best, play Lawrence and Jill, a wealthy English couple in Switzerland with their adolescent daughter, Betty, played by Neva Pilbeam. They are there for a skeet shooting competition, it turns out that Jill is an all star champion skeet shooter.Louis, played by Pierre Fresnay, is a new friend of the couple's who flirts outrageously with Jill all with the complicit and amused tolerance of Lawrence. He is killed while dancing with Jill in the hotel ballroom and his last words, which they both overhear, are about a planned assassination in London.As protection, the spies kidnap Betty to ensure her parents' silence.What follows is the parents' attempts to get their daughter returned while fobbing off the British government's insistence on their revealing the secret.Peter Lorre is amazing as the bad guy, his English often phonetic, it turns out but his acting subtle and layered with nuance. His first British film.The ending is stellar.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A British couple named Lawrence and Jill (Leslie Banks and Edna Best) find out about an assassination attempt that will take place. However their young daughter Betty (Nova Pilbeam) is kidnapped to prevent them from telling the police. Lawrence tries to find Betty before the assassination takes place.Early Hitchcock which he purportedly dismissed later. He said this was made by an amateur and the 1950s remake was made by a professional. Hitchcock is welcome to his own opinion but I think this and the remake are both equally good. This one moves much quicker (this is 75 minutes--the remake runs 2 hours) and has a great script with plenty of droll British humor. It's beautifully directed and it's fun to see Hitchcock experimenting with camera angles and shots which he would perfect later in life. The acting is OK. Banks and Best are just so-so as the parents. They act far too calm for people who have just had their only child kidnapped. Pilbeam seems far too old for her role. The other actors are just OK. The one really good performance comes from Peter Lorre in his first English language film. It's hard to believe that he learned much of his role phonetically--he seems well aware of what he's saying and doing at all times. This all ends with the justly famous Albert Hall sequence and leads to an exciting climax--watch when Best grabs a gun! A very good, quick Hitchcock film. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

Sure Peter Lorre is great as the mastermind villain, and the plot is intriguing and fast paced, but due to the lack of Hitchcock's famous fast cut, tense inducing directing it doesn't standout.Still not a bad film but by a long-shot, just not one of Hitch's greatest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Man Who Knew Too Much" is one of Director Alfred Hitchcock's early British sound films and one of his best.A British family, the Lawrences, are on holiday somewhere in the Alps. Father Bob (Leslie Banks) is your typical Hitchcock everyman, Mom Jill (Edna Best) is a crack skeet shooter and daughter Betty is a typical teenager. Louis Bernard (Pierre Fresney) is a close family friend. During a skeet shooting contest between Ramon Levine and Jill, the mysterious Abbott (Peter Lorre) distracts her and causes her to lose the match. Hang on to the sharpshooter aspect.later, Bernard is assassinated in the hotel dining room while dancing with Jill. Bob Lawrence comes to his aid and Bernard before he dies, confides in him about a plot to assassinate a high European official and that vital information on same is hidden in his room.Abbott and Levine who are in reality spies, try to get the information but learn that Lawrence has it and is under police protection. To force him to turn over the vital info (the time and place of the assassination), they kidnap his daughter Betty.The rest of the film follows the Lawrences attempts to locate their missing daughter and foil the assassination plot.This is the first film that I can remember that used the term "Nazi" (remember this was 1934) in relation to the villain (Lorre). Also, unusual for a Hitchcock film, the film contains a western style shootout involving the good guys (Scotland Yard) and the bad guys (the Nazis), in what I call call the "Gunfight at Picadilly Circus". Its supposed to be based on an actual event. Lorre by the way reportedly learned his part phonetically as his English was not so good at this point.And yes, Hitchcock's cameo. I had a hard time spotting him and even now I'm not positive that it was him. In the hotel dance sequence watch when the camera pans the orchestra from behind and look at the drummer.Remade in 1956 with James Stewart and Doris Day (Que sera, sera).</fullReview>

But, it is not only the fact that the film is shot in black and white which makes it the superior version, but it is the clever use of the camera, which exploits, and thereby captures the movement, (e.g ski run), character (e.g. Peter Lorre), and atmosphere ( e.g, the Albert Hall scene).Such direction of the camera means that sound and dialogue are to an extent, irrelevant and unnecessary. This concludes that it is the silent era when visual affects were paramount, and where he learned his trade, is the source of Hitchcock's genius in film-making.As to the acting, the credit in this film goes to Peter Lorre, giving his menacing, villainous character a sense of wit, and impishness.As to the film's plot, it epitomises the coming of modernity and an evolving 'brave new world', which is scarred by the fact that the 'self' is forced to succumb to corruption and unscrupulous behaviour and acts to survive it. Such means of survival of modernity, are encouraged, and made easier by the use of guns, which are symbolic of this 'brave new world'. Here in The Man Who Knew Too Much, the gun is given ambiguous ethical status, which in the hands of the mother is counteracting the misuse of them by villains. In this respect, Hitchock detracts from the stereotype hysterical woman, in showing here as a strong matriarch, and cool, calm, and rationalised, character. Through this, Hitchcock gives the audience a hint of women's evolving roles within modernity.Overall, one of Hitcock's best films, especially in the way he portrays the lead woman's strength and resilience of character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man and his wife and child are on vacation in Switzerland. The wife is dancing with a gentleman when he happens to get shot. Before he dies, he reveals he's a secret agent--unfortunately, soon afterwards, the daughter is kidnapped so that the two adults don't tell anybody about what they've witnessed. Taking it into their own hands, they try to stop the assassination of a diplomat and save their daughter at the same time.The best parts of this movie are the visuals and the suspense, both of which Hitchcock is renowned for, indeed. Several clever editing sequences, along with a some very direct camera usage, results in a pretty well set-up movie that is fine to watch for craft.The writing is okay, but it's not nearly as good as the directing and imagery; neither is the acting, but it's fine as well. Peter Lorre is good. For the most part, this film is pretty good, but a few plot holes and a sort of unmotivated climax kind of bring the movie down a bit. Also, this movie is pretty British, which while I don't mean it to be a bad thing, definitely shows a few different conceits than oftentimes Americans are used to... humor popping up in random spots, e.g.Still, definitely worth the watch and for the Hitchcock fan a must see.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's best British movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's hear it for British Hitchcock, shall we? From 1925-1939, Hitchcock made his movies in the country across the pond and became that country's premier director before traversing the Atlantic to make a movie called Rebecca for Hollywood.These movies in the 30s show Hitchcock developing his craft, working together miraculous scenes with inconsistency and making movies that ranged from downright terrible (Juno and the Paycock) to supreme art (Murder!, The 39 Steps). The Man Who Knew Too Much -- the first version -- is one of the latter.In this high-contrast 1934 movie, a dying secret agent confides to his friend the location of the information he had gathered. The friend's husband finds the information - which concerns the plot to assassinate a prominent European leader, but the man is forced into silence by the kidnapping of his daughter. He reacts by going with his brother to track down the criminals themselves, while his wife is sent to stop the planned assassination. The movie climaxes at Albert Hall, where the attempt is to take place.This movie is early Hitchcock at his finest. Humor is everywhere in the movie, and the climax at Albert Hall as the symphony builds to its thunderous conclusion is simply wonderful. Peter Lorre as the villain is fabulous, as always. His slimy persona is perfect for the movie, and he is truly one of the greater unrecognized actors of early cinema. It is amusing to note the vague prejudice to foreigners that occurred during the early part of the century as well.It is not typical Hitchcock in that it doesn't accuse the wrong man of murder, nor does it throw in a violent plot twist. Instead it builds tension to a stunning climax and is part of a series of excellent British Hitchcock movies.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie with Peter Lorre in a role that seems to repeat itself from "M". Leslie Banks is the star of this movie though and his character and his character's family(which I think is a spinoff of Hitchcock and his family) are the coolest family unlike the corny family Hitchcock's 1956 remake which seems to take away Albert Hall suspense. The end after the Albert Hall part is probably the most stunnig sequences in film history. Does anybody know if Gaumont or Gainborough Pictures are still around?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Early Hitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man Who Knew Too Much, The (1934) *** (out of 4) A couple (Leslie Banks, Edna Best) are on vacation when they overhear an assassination plot. To keep them quiet the terrorist kidnap their young daughter and hold her until after the plot gets carried out. Many people will debate whether this film or Hitchcock's 1956 remake is better but to me they are both entertaining if very flawed movies. This one here does benefit from a very good ending, which is certainly the highlight of the movie. I'd say the casting in the remake was better but Banks still delivers a fine performance here as does Peter Lorre who clearly steals the film with his devilish performance as one of the bad guys. The weakest point to this film is Best who I was never too impressed with. I found her performance here to be quite bland and straight-forward and I'd also add that the daughter in the film is quite annoying. For the most part I think Hitchcock does a very good job at directing the film and this includes some rather stylish scenes during a murder at the start of the movie and the build up to the assassination is also handled very well. I think one negative thing was the pacing of the film, which I found to be all over the place and at times it made the 75-minute running time film a bit long. This certainly isn't the director's best movies but it's still a nice little thriller that's certainly worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch called this movie "the act of a talented professional" and the remake "the work of a seasoned professional." I would reverse the two.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And the theatrical masterpiece that is "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is actually living proof that Alfred Hitchcock WAS a seasoned professional at the time he made the film. I'm certainly not putting down the 1955 remake with James Stewart and Doris Day, which is a masterpiece in its own right (it having been directed by Hitchcock as well), but there's several things missing in the remake which make the original far superior to it, such as:* The very presence of the genius of Peter Lorre, save alone the fact that he did not yet have a good grasp on English at the time and delivered his lines phonetically.* The presence of Bob Lawrence's friend Clive, portrayed by Hugh Wakefield.* The fight scene with the traitorous dentist.* The frantic chair fight in the church.* The exceptional marksmanship of the hostage's mother.* The astonishing shoot-out at the end of the film which puts the original "Assault on Precinct 13" to shame.The story begins with a father, mother, and daughter bearing witness to a murder. Soon afterward, those responsible abduct the young daughter, threatening the parents that they will never see her again if they reveal any secrets that the victim told them just before he died. As the events unfold, the mother and father and a family friend take it upon themselves to rescue their daughter, becoming entangled in an assassination plot orchestrated (quite literally) by the abductors.If you're a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock - and a big fan of the 1955 version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" - then you don't want to miss out on the original 1934 version, which was not only an early testament to Hitchcock's directing abilities, but in my opinion, is a superior film in its own right. After all, isn't the original always the best version anyway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch's first go at the same movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock actually made two movies called The Man Who Knew Too Much. This first one from 1934 starring Peter Lorre is known as the British version, coming a full 22 years before the lavish Hollywood remake starring James Stewart. This is an excellent movie, very fast paced and full of wit.A couple has their child kidnapped in order to prevent them divulging any information that a dead spy has told them. Can you see the theme of regular people facing extraordinary circumstances seeping out? Hitch again makes it compelling to the average viewer because we are the star, putting ourselves in the position of the leading characters.The great part of this movie is that you never scream at the characters for what they should be doing. The bad guys are very bad and do not commit any stupid mistakes, although you can see the appropriate ending coming as the mother is a famous sharp-shootist. There's always a reason that they don't shoot on sight, in order to keep the others from prying. And Peter Lorre, who did not know English at the time and had to learn the part phonetically, was extremely scary. That sneer of his made it possible for him to explode at any time. Hitch contains it until an explosive final confrontation.This movie receives a major recommendation as I believe it sets some cinematic foreshadowing of movies to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Effective early Hitchcock."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An English couple (Banks and Best) are involved in a plot to assassinate a foreign diplomat after a British agent is shot in front of their very eyes while on holiday in Switzerland. Before he dies he passes on a clue, which will reveal the identity of the assassination ring, and he instructs the couple to pass on the information to British intelligence. However, the ring kidnaps their young daughter (Pilbeam) and threaten to kill her if they pass on the information.Effective early Hitchcock (even though the execution is a little primitive by today's standards), with some memorable sequences, including the climax at the Royal Albert Hall that uses the will she or won't she technique to perfection. The shoot out leading up to it in London's East End was inspired by the 1911 Sydney Street siege. Good performances too, especially from Leslie Banks and Edna Best as the distraught English couple who are dramatically swept out of their hum drum lives into the world of espionage, while a young Peter Lorre also deserves praise as the leader of the assassination ring in his first English speaking part.Hitch later remade the film in Hollywood in 1956 with James Stewart and Doris Day in the Leslie Banks and Edna Best roles while Bernard Miles played the Peter Lorre part. Hitch described the first version as the work of a talented amateur and the remake as the work of a professional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better of the two films Hitch made, to my thinking...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this twice now, once in '82 as a 16 year old, and now today, at 33...What can I say? It still holds up, though the Madacy Co print I have is kinda murky. I still like Edna Best's sharpshooting, I like her spunk(not to sound patronizing), and her being able to foil the shooting in the Orchestra. I thought the Mr. was sorta like the Thin Man's slightly doltish brother or cousin, but he was okay too. Peter Lorre helps make the movie, with his trademark slime in full view for all to see, the plotline about a repeat of 1914 is handled quite well too. Nova Pilbeam was a Hitch fave of the '30s, could have played Nancy Drew if it had been offered to her I think. It's kinda neat seeing the baddies holed up in the church, too. That was unexpected.Overall, this is the film that is said to have been Hitch's first 'Big' movie, which put him in the public eye more and sent him on his way to the 39 Steps, Lady Vanishes, etc. Having seen the Lodger, too, his second, a silent one from '27, I will add that am sure Hitch always had his gift, but it was being honed sharper and sharper as the 30s went along, and here, in '34, it shows.I would give this *** outta ****, creaky at times but suspenseful and done quite well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There were better women then</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were better women then--and children--that is, before the 1950's. Hitchcock made this picture twice, and the two versions are practically a feminist text about the fall. In 1934, woman is athlete, expert in firearms, able to save her child when every man around her is paralyzed with fear. In 1956, woman is Doris Day, able only to wail a song that the child hears and wails back at. In 1934 the child is a delightfully and slightly impudent half-adolescent girl; in 1956, an ineffectual little boy. In 1934, woman can tease her husband with another man, but without in any sense betraying him; in 1956, she is a possession who has given up her career to cater to him. The 1934 movie is a good thriller, with a good subtext about real marriage; the limp 1956 remake is a mere simulation of tension covering bland propaganda for the sort of 50's marriage that inevitably produced both feminism and widespread divorce.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a tendency to like Hitchcock's American movies best.But these English movies were certainly,as an user points out ,"a prelude to the achievements of the greatest filmmaker of all time" ."The man who knew too much" (1934) is somewhat less exciting -notably the concert scene- and less moving -there's nothing in the finale that comes close to Doris Day's song which echoes through the house in its remake.But it's funnier.Humour was sometimes ponderous in the 1956 version,notably that scene in the Morroccan restaurant.Whereas I was afraid of the boy's fate ,I do not take Peter Lorre's tongue in chick acting very seriously and it seems that Hitchcock does not worry that much for the little girl.Look how the dad does justice to the meal in the villains' den.The "moving" father/daughter last farewell is abruptly cut anyway.On the other hand we are treated to the delights of the director' s good mood : the hero,using the tune of a canticle to communicate is a hilarious scene ;so is the harmonium drowning the sound of the rumble in the church;and who could be afraid of the respectable old lady carrying a revolver? Two French actors are featured in both versions.Daniel Gélin in the 1956 remake and Pierre Fresnay in this one;Fresnay would become Henri-Georges Clouzot 's(often nicknamed "French Hitchcock" )favorite actor in the forties.</fullReview>

Granted that this WAS 1934 but the "fight" scenes and the insane shoot-out at the end sink this work. I'm sure Hitchcock himself re-made this because he knew in 1956 he could do it far greater justice.Lorre stole every scene he was in - the man just had something intangible. It was unaffected by anything going on around him. Banks played the gun-ho tewwibly bwitish father well (except for the fight scenes....tossing chairs at one another???? ) Edna Best's contribution as Jill Lawrence was somewhat less than a 4-star turn....Very ho-hum in the upshot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tons of plot problems--but still watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 30s, Alfred Hitchcock made a lot of wonderful films (such as THE 39 STEPS, THE LADY VANISHES and SABOTAGE). While this isn't nearly as good, it is still a watchable suspense film.First, the bad: The plot of an international conspiracy to assassinate a head of state is fine but there were just way too many plot holes to make it believable. Once the couple's daughter was kidnapped, they refused to help the police or secret service. That's a little tough to believe, but that's not the problem. The problem was when the seemingly ordinary couple and their butler are able to so quickly infiltrate this mob and thwart their plans--yet not have the daughter killed as a result of their meddling! None of this made any sense at all, but I guess it was kind of fun to watch. Also, and perhaps I am being too picky, but in the first five minutes of the film, the child appeared to be quite a brat and I was actually rooting for the bad guys to kill her! Now, the good: The assassins were pretty scary people and the film was never slow or dull. The film had quite a bit of action and violence for a Hitchcock film and on this level alone the film was engaging.If you compare this film with the later remake (also by Hitchcock), you will no doubt notice that the original is a much simpler and shorter film. It also lacks much of the polish of the remake, though, mercifully, does not have all the awful singing and whiny performance of Doris Day like the later version. I generally like Doris Day, but not in this film. So, in balance, despite the remake being a little bit better film, I prefer the original for this sole reason!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Hans Gruber, there was Peter Lorre...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the original, saw the remake, well, let's just say that If Hitchcock remade his own movie, that might be because he felt that some aspects were too dated or far below the level of perfectionism upon which he built his reputation.To give you an example: there's an overlong chair fight which is so bizarre and grotesque you don't know if you're supposed to laugh or to be thrilled, I guess it was meant to be funny, but it's like Hitchcock never knows exactly where to go. Abd even comedy requires a good timing in the execution so I couldn't believe my eyes and had to rewind the scene. When Lawrence (the father played by Leslie Banks) gets his friend Clive off the temple, he's hit on the shoulder, he freezes and then acts as if he was hurt in the head. I know this is the 30's, and I didn't let modern standards affect my opinion, the ski accident was quite well made for the time and at least, Hitch had the guts to try something, Pierre Fresnay's death scene was awkward but it could work, and I didn't have a problem either with Edna Baker's fainting and hitting the floor with her arm first, but that chair moment, as trivial as it was, was too much for me. All right, there can be mistakes in movies, but not in something of the caliber of "The Man Who Knew Too Much".See, it's precisely because I was drawn by the film that I'm so critical. I loved the witty interactions within the couple, especially in these awesome scenes where Jill was both flirting with the ski champion and teasing Lawrence. And talk about Hitch's mischievous mind, just when we had enjoyed the little knitting prank, the murder happens and the story picks up and, unfortunately, this is where the movie gets itself in the situations where the likeliness of goofs and mistakes increases. But it's a shame because the beginning is so beyond the 30's standards that I felt disappointed when it became as cheesy and laughable as a 30's film. So if we feel the film is dated, it's precisely because it starts with non-dated elements. And one of the most modern aspects is Peter Lorre, who, half a century before Alan Rickman in "Die Hard", plays the sophisticated and friendly-at-first-sight villain, getting more and more sinister as the plot advances. Peter Lorre is half the rating the film gets.And his performance is so immense it dwarfs all the others, which were good actually. Edna Best had that average type look that magnified her strength as a mother, making her revenge at the end even more savory, going from "Never raise any children" to holding her traumatized girl in the arms, and Nova Pilbeam was actually quite convincing in the daughter's role, I've seen kids acting worse in later movies so let's give her the credit for that. I also discovered a new actress, Cicely Oates who played the intimidating Nurse Agnes, and I was saddened to know she passed away the year of the film's release; it's a pity because she could have been a great Mrs. Danvers, and I just love the eyes of Lorre witnessing her sudden death during the shootout. She and the actor who played the killer were worthy additions to an already complete villain... which leads me to the most problematic character: the father.I have nothing negative to say about Leslie Banks, but I have nothing eulogistic either, from his constant frowning in the first act, he struck me as a continually malcontent character, one who considered his wife a burden more than anything else, but after the kidnapping, nothing really seemed to affect him. Granted he was supposed to be the stronger one, but I wish he could display more emotional range, even in the most critical situations, his expressions were the same, as if he deliberately chose the one that could pass everywhere, whether during a shootout or over the course of his investigation. Speaking of this investigation, I know Hitch has a wicked sense of humor and it was fun to hear that Clive guy scream at the dentist, being hypnotized or the two men using exchanging crucial instructions while pretending to sing, but I couldn't buy that from a father whose daughter's life was at stakes. Oh well, let's just say it was fun, but for the sake of the dark atmosphere and the whole black-and-white thing, they should have stuck to a more sinister tone, even the dentist's scene is quite under-exploited when you consider its potential. It's only near the end, just when you think the climax would consist on the cymbal crashing and the attempted murder that the film delivers a terrific shootout sequence, and quite a violent one, that had many cops getting killed which was quite new for the time. But the gunfight goes so long that again, it allows some goofs and mistakes to be done, especially the laughable way the characters die. It's all in the execution, and I guess Hitch was only warming up before starting to be more perfectionist in his work.By the way, am I the only one who finds the film a bit prophetic, as it centers on the assassination of a Head of State during an official visit, in 1934, the same year, the King of Yugoslavia was assassinated during his visit in France, and it was the first time the camera's eye caught such an event. Speaking of this, would really a man like the father not know about Sarajevo and the Archduke assassination that lead to World War 1 as the script suggests. I mean the film was made at a time where everyone lived the Great War, so I find it highly unlikely that people wouldn't know about its starting point, especially for a man who was supposed to know too much?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that Hitchcock saw fit to remake The Man Who Knew Too Much 22 years after his first attempt says a lot about his earlier rendition: it's got potential, but it's rough-around-the-edges, with too much guff to make it a wholly satisfying experience. Unsurprisingly, the 1956 version is the slicker and more enjoyable of the two films, Hitch having refined his style over the intervening decades.The 1934 film stars Leslie Banks and Edna Best as married English couple Lawrence and Jill, who uncover a plot to assassinate a foreign diplomat, which forces the terrorists to kidnap their daughter Betty (Nova Pilbeam) in order to keep them quiet. Of course, Lawrence and Jill being the protagonists in a Hitchcock film, they decide to track down their missing girl by themselves?While not a particularly remarkable example of Hitchcock's work, the film suffering from those foibles of early film-making, stiff performances and weak pacing, as well as a shootout at the end that doesn't know when to quit, the film is still worth checking out if only to see how it measures up to the better-known remake. Banks and Best don't come out of the comparison too well, being rather bland when compared to James Stewart and Doris Day, but Peter Lorre effortlessly makes his mark as villain Abbott.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934): Dir: Alfred Hitchcock / Cast: Leslie Banks, Edna Best, Peter Lorre, Frank Vosper, Pierre Fresnay: Thrilling suspense by director Alfred Hitchcock regarding a planned assassination and a kidnapping. Leslie Banks and Edna Best learn of their daughter's kidnapping but cannot reveal any information about the planned assassination. Banks ends up captive after an attempt for answers but he holds strong pooling his resources particularly his hope in his wife. The climatic shootout with police is well executed but overlong with Banks making the obvious save of his son. Best is still available for a climax during an orchestra. She will be the strong factor while Banks is under restraint. Peter Lorre steals scenes as a hardened villain leading the terrorist group. What the climax proves is that even the most skilled and hardened of criminals cannot escape the reality of death. Frank Vosper is also featured among the supporting players. He will assist Banks in the investigation and even become involved in a violent key scene. Pierre Fresnay plays the initial murder victim who will pass valuable information onto the couple, which leads to the paranoia. Theme regards knowing information and what to do with it. For Hitchcock that information became subject to clever writing and tension. Classic shootout finale works despite many anti-climatic moments. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In honor of Alfred Hitchcock's birthday I decided to sit down and watch one of his earlier films, the original The Man Who Knew Too Much. it's nowhere near as polished as his later classics but there is still some entertainment to be had. The premise is very similar to what he tackled in later ventures. It deals with a man and his family who get caught up in a murder and end up 'knowing too much'.One of the problems early on in the film is that most of the leading men all look similar. That is, except for the brilliant Peter Lorre. His character is filled with mystery so I wont spoil anything but I think he was the main bright spot in the film. He stole every scene he was in and then some. Leslie Banks was very reminiscent of Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity with his vulnerability but also how slick he can be as well. The plot of the film ends up being a bit too convoluted for a Hitchcock film, but I was nonetheless impressed by some of the feats he was able to pull off in such an early time in his career. The main one being the end gun battle. Now, the actual scene itself is far bigger than the actual film, so it can seem out of place. But you have to commemorate Hitchcock on his ambition here.So I enjoyed my time watching the film although it's not constructed very well at all. I give Hitchcock a pass and just hope when I watch his own remake of the film it turns out better.+Impressive for a 1934 Hitchcock film +Lorre's performance -Slow at times &amp;convoluted plot 6.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes slow but stick with it to the exciting finale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting oddity is my take on this film. Acting is generally poor, especially Edna Best (an early example of a Hitchcock blond) , who behaves like a silent movie star out her depth in talkies. The pace is often pedestrian although I did enjoy "The Siege of Sidney Street" like finale. At times, the despicable foreign baddies and the oh so respectable goodies talk to each other as though attending a genteel cocktail party. Some of the deliberate humour is well done, although some scenes such as the chair fight are unintentionally hilarious. Like many Hitchcock films, across his career, there are moments of movie brilliance and others of almost amateurish ineptitude. Worth a look for a rather portly Peter Lorre whose hair and teeth are a joy to behold!Brief real-life views of 1930's London also interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to wonder if I'd think differently of this film had I seen it before the 1956 film. But, such is the course that life can take, I saw the one with Morroco, James Stewart and Doris Day, and Que Sera Sera first. Though that film may have more of the polish of a seasoned professional in 1956 (in contrast to the young upstart proving himself all over after a string of flops in 1934), it benefits greatly from a longer run-time to give more meat on the bones of the story, and a tighter grip on the suspense.Nevertheless, the original film that one could argue got the career of Alfred Hitchcock much on a roll in the 1930's has much to recommend it for. In this story that starts off in Switzerland - "Brotherly Love" except for certain foreign travelers - and a surprise bullet during a dinner party that kills a French spy (with the final words spoken to Jill (Edna Best), on holiday with her husband Lawrence (Leslie Banks) and child and sets a chain of events that leads to kidnapping, an assassination attempt during classical music concert and "Sun Worshipers", it's usually never less than riveting.The director keeps the pace fast - maybe too fast, one could argue. For filmmaking that is so rich and tightly edited and composed with a rhythm that feels just right when Hitchcock and company get into the set pieces, such as the dentist office or the Sun Church, or that final stretch in the gun battle, certain other scenes just feel... flat. All of the main actors are adequate, but it's hard to argue if one prefers this version Banks over Stewart, or even Best over Day. They aren't bad actors in the slightest, but there's little in the way of any personality about them. Best is at her best, so to speak, during that Albert Hall number - actually, I'll give it, she is up to everything else in that sequence and is great.If the plot doesn't leave much room to breathe or anything in the way of character development (different than bits of behavioral humor, which do connect more often than not), there is one ace in the hole for Hitchcock: Peter Lorre. After seeing him in M, he knew he found his Abbot (yeah yeah, odd name, but whatever, this ain't a comedy in THAT way). It's astonishing to read that Lorre didn't know English very well at the time and did the performance phonetically; the way he speaks is cutting at every turn, and he sets the tone for his group of criminals out to wreak havoc on spies and diplomats. He's... cool for such an evil bastard: when the father is anxiously hurling chairs in the church at the other bad guys to get his daughter back, Lorre just leans back on a wall and watches as it happens, knowing it'll play itself out in its way. When things cool down just a bit, he goes face to face with the hero. Close-ups, so intense, with a cigarette always dangling just a little.This is such iconic work for this actor - among his very best, and making it a memorable heel in the Hitchcock canon - that one can (almost) forgive any other flaws in the script, such as rushed exposition, or kind of dropping doing anything with the daughter after a set up with her in Switzerland that made her seem fairly interesting for a minute or two. There's a reason Lorre is on the poster and not Leslie Banks: by the end, it's not like we exactly *want* him to get away, but... the guy's a force of nature, let's put it that way. The Man Who Knew Too Much, both versions, are crackerjack pieces of suspense (with occasional surprise, and there's a difference between the two) and it's admirable how coiled the suspense gets for when it pops.This Hitch guy, watching this, he's going places...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>British couple Bob Lawrence (Leslie Banks) and his wife Jill (Edna Best) are on a Swiss ski vacation with their daughter Betty. They befriend fellow resort goer Louis Bernard (Pierre Fresnay). Louis is shoot dead in a crowded dance floor. He passes information to the couple to get to the British Consulate. Then they get a note claiming to have kidnapped Betty. The couple returns to London without their daughter. Gibson from the Foreign Office thinks that Louis had uncovered a plot to kill a foreign dignitary but the couple won't give up the info with Betty's life on the line. Bob and his brother Clive start following the note and finds the kidnappers Ramon (Frank Vosper) and Abbott (Peter Lorre). They find out Royal Albert Hall is the location and Jill has to stop it by herself.Alfred Hitchcock's directing style is there. He's putting his camera moves into action. There are still aspects that are closer to silent pictures. Peter Lorre is the most compelling actor despite his limited English skills. In the end, this is interesting to see these camera moves but they may be distracting from the story. The work is still a little stiff. It does have the sly Hitchcock humor. This is good early Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock made two versions of this film. This one and he remade it in 1956. Bob Lawrence (Leslie Banks) his wife Jill (Edna Best) and his daughter Betty (Nova Pilbeam) are a British family on a vacation in Switzerland. They befriend a Frenchman named Louis Bernard (Pierre Fresnay) who is assassinated, but before he dies he tells Jill some vital information to be told to the British Government. The terrorists who killed Louis led by a man named Abbott (Peter Lorre) kidnap Betty so Bob won't tell the police and they go off to get their daughter back. The film works because your invested in what Bob and Jill are doing and you want to see them get their daughter back. Lorre does a good job as Abbott and when I watch the film I still think of him as Hans Beckert from M. I feel the suspense was good but could have been better. Overall I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the 1956 remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this 1934 movie better than the Jimmy Stewart, Doris Day 1956 remake. It seemed by 1956 superannuated director and actors--who knew their importance--remade a 1934 movie and really detracted from the film's storyline by their presence. Something like "The Man who Knew too Much" DIRECTED by Alfred Hitchcock and STARRING Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. Even the 1954 "Dial M for Murder" seems driven by story line and not by the acting of the performers, no matter how excellent their performance was. In 1934, film was still new and so the production values are those of the 1930s and lacks the polish of later movies. (But look at 1935 "Top Hat" for true sophistication and wit that lasts into 2014--still fresh in 2014.) The story, as others have pointed out,has holes in the plot line--but one senses the fun of making such a movie with such a gruesome subject as kidnap and murder that would be a precursor to "Monk" or "The Pink Panther" where comedy plays an important role in the dark doings of murder and kidnapping.And Peter Lorre shines; one wonders why he wasn't asked to play the villain in the 1956 remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film by the great Alfred Hitchcock?sounds promising, oh yeah. But, The man who knew too much is a disappointing film. Mostly because it is, or at least try to be some kind of crime-drama-thriller film, but in the end it looks like a dull flick, and it's in most parts, even unintentionally funny. That sounds weird, talking in that way about one of the "greatest directors ever" but that's the truth, unfortunately. I am taking in consideration the fact that is a film made in 1935, but I don't know, I' ve seen before a few films made in the 30s that were actually good, but that one is just a fiasco. I mean, what was that 'chairs fight' scene in the church? I mean, really? I never laughed so hard with a scene in a non-comedy film in a long, long time. And even if wasn't by certain dull scenes, the film would still being outdated. Yeah, the time is the worst enemy of everybody. It obviously didn't stand the test of time. But okay, I liked some aspects of the cinematography, I found the shootout scene to be very well made and with some interesting use of lightning, specifically in the streets, creating some kind of atmosphere that you usually see in the films-Noir. But all in all, there Is no much to be said about that film. The story is dull, and worth noting, outdated, I didn't like the acting at all? well, it's fair to say that It's a mess of a film. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite classic Hitchcock but very good Hitchcock still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake needs to be re-watched by me, from memory it was more polished than this film with the better production values, had two great lead performances, a fun scene with the taxidermist and the plot is more fleshed out due to a longer length, but it also wasn't as witty or suspenseful as this, the child was an annoyance and the Que Sera Sera song was unnecessary. This said, the remake does need to be re-watched to see whether that's correct or not. This film is not perfect, and is not as good as The 39 Steps, Sabotage and especially The Lady Vanishes of the 30s British period Hitchcocks but is definitely worth seeing still. It did come across as too short, so the story had a tendency to be rushed and convoluted, and there are times where the action was on the stiff side. The Man Who Knew Too Much is well made still, the settings and locations are a wonder to behold and fit the story like a glove while the photography is atmospheric and professionally done. The music from Arthur Benjamin has a haunting sweeping quality, not among the all-time great Hitchcock film scores but very competent and fits the mood of the film well. The script has a fresh wit and the gallows humour that it's laced with is still humorous and holds up relatively well, the scripting for the more suspenseful scenes is good too and doesn't detract. The story is not perfect, but is mostly interesting and suspenseful, with some great scenes like the chair scene, the dentist scene and the climax. The cast are good generally, Peter Lorre is the definite standout managing to be creepy with a dose of humanity also. Leslie Banks carries the film well, a deliberately emotionally compressed performance but not a wooden one. Edna Best is moving and sympathetic in her role, while Hugh Wakefield is a hoot. Nora Pilbeam did come across as an annoying brat at first but as she grew more resourceful and somewhat feisty she does become less so. All in all, classic Hitchcock it isn't quite, but very good Hitchcock it is. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like users at the IMDb board here, I too am at wonder why Hitchcock had the urge to remake this film. Agreed, Leslie Banks is no James Stewart, but Bernard Miles is no Peter Lorre, either, who gave a truly creepy performance as the main villain - with a face of a villain. One can argue that the 1956 film is technically superior than the 1934 original, but even that is relative, since the 1956 Panavsion has been surpassed by modern cameras. It does not matter, I have to hand it to Hitchcock - if there is one reason for a remake, than it is for the director to remake his own original film himself! Here, Hitchcock directed "twins" that are equally good, giving that pure suspense story he knows how to build, here (and in the remake) revolving around parents trying to find a kidnapped child and accidentally finding themselves into a spy conspiracy ring. The dentist sequence is very inventive for its time and might have inspired The Marathon Man (1976), while I enjoy that black and white cinematography that gets me back into those good old times of passionate filmmaking and mood. The flaws? For my taste, the ending seems to drag, and the finale is nowhere nearly as good as it could have been. Honestly, though, it does not matter, both films are classics. Which ever version you chose, you cannot lose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Who Knew Too Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rare that you get a great filmmaker remaking their own film, but Master of Suspense director Sir Alfred Hitchcock (Rear Window, Vertigo, North by Northwest, Psycho, The Birds) did this when he went to America when he remade this British classic with James Stewart and Doris Day in 1956, I was intrigued to compare the original version. Basically married British couple Bob (Leslie Banks) and Jill Lawrence (Edna Best) and their daughter Betty (Nova Pilbeam) are on vacation in Switzerland, the mother/wife is taking part in a clay pigeon shooting contest, and doing this the family meet foreigner and hotel guest Louis Bernard (Pierre Fresnay), and one night Jill has a dance with this man. Following this she witnesses the assassination of a French spy, who passes on a piece of vital information to be given to the British consul about an upcoming plot, and then he dies, and knowing that this information has been passed the assassins kidnap Betty. Led by charming but wicked Abbott (Peter Lorre), the assassins are holding the daughter hostage in order to keep the couple from spreading the given information to the authorities or anyone else, and unable to get help they return to England, and instead try to find a way to get her back themselves, investigating the clues they have. They follow some leads, based on names and places passed from the dead spy and various others sources, and they discover that the plot coming up is for the assassins to kill the head of state from another European country at the Royal Albert Hall during a concert performance. The idea is for the politician to be shot during a famous piece of music played by the orchestra, and the gunshot will occur at the point in the music when there is a crash of the cymbals, and when Jill attends the concert and realises this she distracts the gunman by screaming, and he is caught and arrested. Bob meanwhile tracks the villains to a dockland area in Wapping, London, and their hideout is in a place of worship, like a church with cult followers, he is held prisoner but manages to escape, and the building gets surrounded by police and all guns are blazing. Betty inside the compound is taken to the roof by the bad guys, and when the one grabbing onto her is seen Jill grabs a gun and uses her skills of clay shooting to kill the man, it turns out he was also the man who beat her in the Switzerland contest, Abbott commits suicide and the daughter is returned safe to her parents. Also starring Frank Vosper as Ramon, Hugh Wakefield as Clive, Cicely Oates as Nurse Agnes, D.A. Clarke-Smith as Police Inspector Binstead and George Curzon as Gibson. I recognise the story from the remake version, most of the same elements, the 1956 version had a few bigger changes, such as locations and what happens to the villains, but it is the same concept, I will be honest in saying that I much prefer the remake to this original version, however this does have great casting, especially Lorre as the lead villain, and there is still a great sense of suspense, so it is a very watchable thriller. Good!</fullReview>

Maybe this is just the version found on Netflix and a better transfer or remaster exists. (Criterion, perhaps?) But that aside, it is a solid film and worth enjoying -- for more reasons than just seeing Peter Lorre in his first English-speaking role.What stood out for me was what I must call the "chair fight" sequence. If you find the film lacking action, you can just watch the scene with chairs flying around and smashing on people. I mean, really, who does not want to see a chair fight?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling Hitchcock Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overshadowed by its glossy remake, this version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is perhaps Hitchcock's first great mystery. Unfortunately, it has not retained its status as a celebrated classic because of Hollywood's version of the story (re-created by the master himself) and a certain song that is even more popular than both movies. Instead of the American teaming of James Stewart and Doris Day, this version stars the "veddy British" Leslie Banks and Edna Best as a couple vacationing in Switzerland for a winter sporting event (skiing and skeet shooting) when they learn of an assassination plot. Their daughter is kidnapped as an insurance policy to prevent them from squealing, but Banks isn't content to leave well enough alone. He finds himself dealing with the plotters which include a ruthless dentist and a group of sun worshipers before venturing to a concert hall where the intended assassination will take place.Like Miss Day in the remake, Edna Best's face shows the anguish building up to the intended attempted murder. This version isn't as fleshed out or as colorful as the remake, but the simple way it is made makes it even better. Peter Lorre, in his only Hitchcock film, makes a most memorable villain. He's even sinister by saying "Good Evening", making another polite rogue with mayhem on his mind. As the daughter, Nova Philbeam plays a pesky character whose chattiness interrupts her mother's skeet shooting and causes a skier to loose when she chases after her pooch.Outstanding photography and quickly cut editing shows why almost 80 years later, Hitchcock is still the master of suspense. Even when you know who done it and basically how it will end, he keeps you on the edge of your seat with the subtle humour he later mastered in his on-screen commentary on his hit TV series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best of Hitchcock's British spy thrillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man Who Knew Too Much" was one of a number of films with an espionage theme made directed by Alfred Hitchcock during his early British period. It involves what was to become a recurring feature in Hitchcock's work, that of the man or woman who "knows too much" in that he or she has accidentally come into possession of certain information which places them in danger from the villains. Other films with this basic plot include "The 39 Steps" and "The Lady Vanishes" from his British period and "North by North West" and the remade "Man Who Know Too Much" from his American one. (This was the only film Hitchcock ever remade; I have not seen the 1956 remake for a long time so I will not attempt to compare the two films directly).Bob and Jill Lawrence are a British couple on a winter sports holiday in St. Moritz with their daughter Betty. (Betty is played by Nova Pilbeam, who three years later would star in Hitchcock's "Young and Innocent"). One evening a Frenchman named Louis Bernard, whom they have befriended, is shot dead in their hotel. It turns out that he is a spy and before dying he passes them some vital information be delivered to the British consul. Unfortunately, the villains realise that the couple are in possession of the information and kidnap their daughter to ensure their silence. (One might ask why they don't simply kill Bob and Jill, but if they did that there wouldn't be a film).Afraid to contact either the consul or the police, the Lawrences return to England where they carry out their own investigations and discover that the villains intend to assassinate a distinguished European statesman named Ropa during a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. (This was an early example of Hitchcock's fondness for setting key scenes in, or on, famous buildings or structures). This leads into two suspense sequences, the first during the concert itself, the second during a confrontation between the police and the assassins at the hide-out where they are holding Betty captive.The shoot-out at the end of the film was based on the Sidney Street Siege, a real-life incident which took place in the East End of London in 1911; Hitchcock would have been a boy at the time, living in Leytonstone only a few miles away. The criminals involved in that siege were anarchist refugees from Tsarist Russia, but in the film we never learn what nationality the assassins are, what their political motivation is or why they want Ropa dead.At 72 minutes this is one of Hitchcock's shortest films; it is, for example, little over half the length of the 1956 remake, even though that version omits some plot details such as the final shoot-out. It has a concision and brevity which are well suited to the thriller genre, with few distractions from the main plot, although there are some humorous asides in the early scenes in Switzerland and in the scene in the church used by the mysterious religious cult which serves as a front for the terrorists. It also has, unusually for early Hitchcock, a memorable villain in Peter Lorre's Abbott, the suave and outwardly charming leader of the assassins. There are some outstanding villains in some of the films from his American period, such as Joseph Cotton's Uncle Charlie in "Shadow of a Doubt", Robert Walker's Bruno in "Strangers on a Train" and Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates in "Psycho", but in his British period he tended to concentrate more on the heroes. Lorre's performance is all the more remarkable given that he could not speak English at the time and therefore had to learn his lines phonetically.This is not the best of Hitchcock's British spy thrillers. Leslie Banks and Edna Best- an early example of the Hitchcock Blonde- seem a rather stolid, Mr and Mrs Average Suburban Couple, lacking the charisma of Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll in "The 39 Steps" or Michael Redgrave and Margaret Lockwood in "The Lady Vanishes". Those films were a brilliant combination of suspense, comedy and romance which have remained classics despite the passage of more than seven decades since they were made. "The Man Who Knew Too Much", by contrast, is a well-paced thriller, highly effective given the technical limitations of the period, but not in the same class as those masterpieces. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>British couple Leslie Banks and Edna Best (as Bob and Jill Lawrence) are on a late winter holiday in the Swiss alps, with perky teenage daughter Nova Pilbeam (as Betty), when tragedy strikes. Close family friend Pierre Fresnay (as Louis Bernard) is shot dead while dancing with Ms. Best; but, before expiring, he passes her a note. As it turns out, Mr. Fresnay was a Special Service spy for Great Britain, and his note contains some information about an assassination plot. To keep Best and Mr. Banks from cooperating with authorities, silver-streaked Peter Lorre (as Abbott) and his enemy agents kidnap little Miss Pilbeam...Alfred Hitchcock re-made "The Man Who Knew Too Much" for 1950s audiences, with Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. "Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional," the director reflected. Neither film represents the best Hitchcock of its decade; and, they are often compared, with varying degrees of irrelevance. This version is better by being shorter, but the other one makes some undeniable directorial improvements. Watch for career-advancing performances from Fresnay, Pilbeam, and especially English language learner Lorre; along with the usual Hitchcock touches.******* The Man Who Knew Too Much (12/34) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Leslie Banks, Edna Best, Peter Lorre, Nova Pilbeam</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action, Espionage and Laughter from a young Master of Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I nearly haven't seen all of Alfred Hitchcock's films yet, and I actually doubt I ever will? Why? Because when it comes to cinema, I simply just adore the underdogs a lot more than the major classics. I prefer to watch Hitchcock's raw &amp; gritty serial killer flick "Frenzy" over his acclaimed and far more sophisticated murder mysteries, like "Dial M For Murder" and "Rear Window", I seek out his earliest and most obscure accomplishments, like "The Lodger: A Story of London Fog", rather than to sit down for the widely available milestones like "North by Northwest" and "Vertigo", and I much rather wanted to see the cheap 1934 original version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" instead of the polished 1956 remake. The ultra-cheap and often downright clumsily put together original noticeably carries the trademarks of an over-enthusiast young director, yet with more than enough indications already that this man would one day be considered as the greatest filmmaker of all times. The pacing is wildly uneven and the wholesome often comes across as very incoherent and full of irregularities, yet the film is entertaining and absorbing throughout its entire (short) running time of barely 75 minutes. Whilst on holiday in Switzerland ? or at least in front of a couple of cardboard sets that are supposed to look like the Swiss Alps ? a very atypical London family (daddy is skiing champion, mommy is a sharpshooter and the daughter is just an annoying brat) befriends a spy working for the British Embassy. When he gets shot during a party, he requests the wife to transfer essential knowledge regarding a political assassination to the consul in London. The evil assailant, Abbott, witnesses the spy's last words and orders his accomplices to kidnap the Lawrence's young daughter. Tied to the threats that they will kill his daughter in case he transfers the information, Bob Lawrence and his friend start their own private attempt to find the daughter AND prevent the assassination. There are some extreme gaps in logic (read: the plot sometimes just doesn't make sense) and the film is overly talkative. I didn't mind when it was the wonderful Peter Lorre who was talking, but literally every other single character in the film is rather irritating. There's very little suspense in this early film by the "Master of Suspense", because it's difficult to take the kidnapping and the assassination scheme seriously. The hero and the villain communicate with each other like they're best friends and the plot is continuously interrupted with comical sequences, like at a dentist's office and a religious community. The finale, in contrast to the rest of the film, is action-packed and pretty much resembles a famous Quentin Tarantino shootout; but then in 1930's style. My main reason to check out this film was the aforementioned Peter Lorre and he certainly doesn't disappoint. Lorre was a unique actor (just look at his face on the movie poster), seemingly born to depict weird, perverted and villainous characters. He accomplished his most legendary roles (to me at least) in the horror genre, with classics such as "M", "Mad Love" and "The Beast with Five Fingers" but he also shined in great immortal classics like "Casablanca" and "Arsenic and Old Lace".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film Hitchcock made twice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the version one.There a British couple witness an assassination of a French spy in St.Moritz, Switzerland.Before he dies he passes on to them some vital information.They need to be kept silent so their daughter is being kidnapped.Soon the couple finds out that the group plans to assassinate an European ambassador during a concert at the Royal Albert Hall.The Man Who Knew Too Much is one of the most critically acclaimed films of Alfred Hitchcock's British period.He made it in 1934.The new version made in America came in 1956 and it starred James Stewart and Doris Day.Here we have Leslie Banks playing Lawrence and Edna Best playing Jill.Their daughter Betty is being played by Nova Pilbeam.The fantastic Peter Lorre plays a crook called Abbott.This is his first English language film and he had to learn his lines phonetically.Hugh Wakefield plays Clive.In one funny scene Lawrence and Clive sing false words to a hymn at a church that is filled with villains.So this movie doesn't give only thrills but it offers a few laughs, as well.The second version made of this movie is slightly better but this goes pretty close.Hitchcock knew his thing wherever he was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>early Hitchcock with some gems that survive time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock made 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' twice, and fans of the master will debate forever which one is better. In any case this first version dated 1934 is probably the first remarkable film in his early career, and the one that often opens the series of Hitchcock movies in the cinematheques or at TV.The story is quite linear and lacks the complexity of his later films, and there are quite a lot of action and dialog elements that look timed-out for the contemporary viewer. However this just makes more visible the real gems in the film, which already tell about the great director that Hitchcock was becoming. These are to be found for example in the way he films the principal female hero who goes through the anguish of having her daughter kidnapped or the hypnosis scene in the prayer house - both masterly combinations of psychology in acting and camera work. We do see in his interiors construction elements that will become classical as the stairs and also the terror of the heroes climbing and finding themselves on the verge of abyss. But most of all the memorable character of the film is the villain Abbott played by Peter Lorre (Jewish German actor we will find later in Casablanca) which became a real model for bad guys for the history of cinema. If Lorre was living today he could be distributed and act perfectly in a modern Batman for example. This kind of ageless creation is what makes Hitchcock cinema great and keeps such films at least in part relevant until today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much better than the later version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This original version of the film is far superior to the 1956 edition, with James Stewart and a horribly miscast Doris Day. Edna Best, the mother in this 1934 film, is sturdy and heroic on behalf of her kidnapped daughter, as opposed to Doris's alternately screeching and whimpering (and typically prim 1950s'-style) Mom. And the stiff-upper-lip Leslie Banks is also better than the arrogant-American-style Stewart.The dark-ish and seedy London sets are appropriate to the storyline. And best of all, the climax (which I will not, of course, reveal!), shows off the best of British sang-froid.And yes, Peter Lorre is a treat in this. His performance is wonderfully peculiar and piquant.Skip the boring colored 1956 version - this black-and-white thriller is the one to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before he made it in Hollywood (and indeed, played a major role in making Hollywood as we know it), Alfred Hitchcock was an English film director; the smartly titled 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' is one of his earliest efforts. It demonstrates a surprising flair for comedy: Chaplinesque farce, black comedy and a prototype Bond villain all feature. But it also contains other, probably inadvertent comedy: the reaction of the hero and his wife to their daughter being kidnapped and their friend being shot (and indeed, the reaction of the friend in question to his shooting) are frankly laughable; Hitchcock was later famed for his thrillers, but the primitive style of acting, writing and direction fail to create real dramatic tension for modern viewers. There are some nice touches; I particularly liked the casual way the film cuts between the high drama of an attempted assassination at the Albert Hall, and a brief shot of the cool villains eating dinner. It's worth remembering that talkies had only been around for five years when this film was made; the modern film was still very much a work in progress, and many of the technologies and ideas that have since become commonplace were yet to be developed. But it's still a great title, even if it shows its age in all other respects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story ... uninteresting characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From my "non-historical" perspective, this movie was simply above average. It was probably much more interesting back in the 30s. The story is good, the sets are nice, but the characters weren't very interesting. This is probably why I never really felt very interested in the movie.Basically, the movie is about a girl that is kidnapped to keep her parents from revealing information about an assassination plot. The parents are simple vacationers who, as victims of circumstance, acquire the information unwittingly.The main problem with the movie seemed to be the characters. They are not very interesting. The mother character is a little to over-the-top and ends up being immediately unlikeable given the way she treats her husband and child. The father seems a bit "daft" and disinterested given that his child is kidnapped, and the only other characters are some uninteresting "authorities" and the criminal faction.Furthermore, movies like these really need closed-captioning. See it with captions if you can. The sound is often bad and the old British accents are sometimes hard to understand.If you tend to like Hitchcock movies, you're better off finding another one. This is "ok", but not his best work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible, but a little dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are traveling abroad in an Alfred Hitchcock film, chances are things are going to go wrong. Such is the case in The Man Who Knew Too Much, a very early Hitchcock film that he actually remade twenty years later. The film stars Leslie Banks and Edna Best as a couple on holiday in Switzerland along with their young daughter. Everything is going fine until a friend of theirs is murdered, and in his dying breath he tells them a crucial piece of information about an imminent assassination attempt. The couple has to keep this information safe and sound, but when they deny having any information their daughter is kidnapped and they must try to do all they can to get their daughter back and stop this assassination from succeeding.The Man Who Knew Too Much has pretty much all the makings of a good film. It has a well thought out and well executed story, well rounded and multi dimensional characters, and with Alfred Hitchcock in the directors chair he obviously does some interesting things with the camera throughout the film. We see a variety of unique shots that would later translate into Hitchcock's overall style of filmmaking. The acting is pretty sub par aside from the great Peter Lorre, but it's not too dreadful.The thing is, I just wasn't crazy about this film and it really didn't do much for me. The story, while neat and intelligent, is a little disjointed at times and I found myself getting lost pretty easily. The film really tries to be suspenseful, but it isn't at all. This is definitely due to the time period and how much different films were made back then, but I honestly didn't feel anything during The Man Who Knew Too Much.Hitchcock shows that he will one day grow into a legendary director through some of the unique camera angles and movements he employs in this film, but overall I found the film to be a little lackluster. I shrugged when it was over, and I could not see myself watching this again. It's not an inherently bad film, it's just not much of anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very fascinating film experience for Hitchcock fans - beaten by the remake only because it was directed by the same man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's quite common (especially nowadays) for a movie to be remade. But it's a little more rare for a movie to be made twice by the same director. Cecil B. DeMille remade not one, but four of his own films. Alfred Hitchcock did so just once. The film he chose to remake was his 1934 film "The Man Who Knew Too Much." In an interview with Francois Truffaut, he said the original was made by a talented amateur and the remake by a professional. He was right and the remake with James Stewart and Doris Day is not only the better, but it's one of Mr. Hitchcock's very best. However, the original with Leslie Banks, Edna Best, and a scene-stealing Peter Lorre is still a fascinating film experience.In the 1934 version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much", Leslie Banks and Edna Best are traveling parents in Switzerland when they witness an assassination attempt and discover information of an upcoming one. However, before they can alert the police, they are blackmailed by criminals led by Peter Lorre, who have taken their young daughter hostage.There really is not a whole lot to say about the original "The Man Who Knew Too Much" especially once you've seen the superior 1956 remake. This I will say; I enjoyed the movie, but it's not one I could watch every week without the novelty wearing off. It's an original story with some great performances especially be Peter Lorre, but it's not exactly memorable either. So in the end, my recommendations go out mainly to Hitchcock fans. But my advice is ultimately to see the remake with James Stewart and Doris Day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #118: The Man Who Knew Too Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>118: The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) - released 12/1/1934, viewed 9/11/08.A gunfight with the FBI outside Chicago results in the death of Baby Face Nelson. KEVIN: Our very first Alfred Hitchcock film is hardly a masterpiece, but still a standout suspense yarn among all the rom-coms and melodramas of this year. Were that not the case, this movie would be pretty disposable. As it is, it's a healthy dose of Hitchcock-style cool. Except for Peter Lorre, I didn't recognize any of the actors in this movie, which made me realize that casting recognizable faces can sometimes help the viewer follow the story easier. The leading husband and wife (Leslie Banks and Edna Best) came off kind of bland, but do what they must to move the story along. It was hard to get emotionally invested in their daughter being abducted by bad guys because the actors didn't sell it much beyond what's written in the script. As sometimes happens with movies like this, it's the villains, especially Lorre, who really make it worth seeing, even though we never get a good idea of what their clandestine organization is all about.DOUG: I don't have a whole lot to say in overview for this, our first Hitchcock movie on the Odyssey, so I'll just sum up my thoughts with some bullet points: --I couldn't tell you why we chose this to be our first Hitchcock film on the Odyssey instead of The Lodger. Still, Hitch did consider this film the real start of his career, so I guess we'll be okay. -We had to watch this one twice to catch the complexities of the plot and get through everyone's accents. Why do so few of these old DVDs have captions? --Peter Lorre, fresh out of Germany in his first English-speaking role, drops just a bit of weight and sports a skunky white streak in his hair to play the villain of the piece. --A lot of the film does seem overtly experimental, especially in the transitions, like cutting to a screaming train as Jill sees the ransom note. Even this early in his career, Hitch wanted to try new things. --A word on the authorities in this film: The lead government heavy who gets in Lawrence's face seems almost angry at him for not handing over the info, even though he knows this will cost the kidnapped daughter her life. Lawrence has no obligation to help the police or the government if his family is in danger, so it should be their priority to help him get his kid back before he hands over the information they want. --I look forward to checking out the '56 remake eventually and comparing the two. I know Hitch preferred the later one (and I probably would too, if I got to take something I made while I was a rookie and make it again as a pro), but many buffs prefer this early version. --I would only recommend this film if you are really, really curious about Alfred Hitchcock and his early work; otherwise, there are many far better choices from the career of the Master of Suspense. Last film: Imitation of Life (1934). Next film: Bright Eyes (1934).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked the remake better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good film but I personally enjoyed the remake better. I think the major reason for this is I am familiar with James Stewart, who has so often been the 'everyman' and had such a likable down to earth screen persona, that the idea of an ordinary man caught up in extraordinary events reverberated with me when I watched him in the later film. That and the fact that I saw the remake first. Because the remake was always in my mind's eye when I watched this, it was difficult not to notice how primitive this film is in comparison. Still, this is very good and among its strengths are the always entertaining Lorre and the quite rousing (for its time) gunfight. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man who knew too little</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a man who knew too little about the DVD culture, having owned a DVD player for only the two most recent months of my 55 years of watching movies or television or just sleeping in a crib. One of the first DVD movies I purchased was done so not so much for cinematic fulfillment but for budgetary reasons. The choices were THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH with Alfred Hitchcock's name above the title and a couple of yuppies on the cover for $13 or the same movie title with a scar-faced Peter Lorre exuding evil on the jewel box cover. The latter jumped out at me from the budget bin. It is the original 1934 b&amp;w version wherein Mr. Hitchcock's name appears in petite pica on the bottom line of the screen title card. I paid $2.87 for the original MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH and believe that the then relatively unknown Mr. Hitchcock's paid slightly more than that for special effects, like when a skiing contestant in the Swiss Alps stumbles down a mountain to avoid a dog and the teenager who is chasing it. This is where Peter Lorre's character earns his scar tissue and, in this opening scene, one witnesses murder, wit and suspense as evolved in the mind of Alfred Hitchcock. "The Prime Minister of the Sinister" filled half the cast with his legislators of evil and the other half with Leslie Banks and Edna Best as the teenager's parents, who have their daughter forcibly removed from their lives by Germanic- sounding assassins. The conspirators are compared to the assassins of Archduke Ferdinand, which resulted in World War I. There is irony flavored with political prescience here: the original MWKTM was filmed in 1934 when Adolf Hitler was still referred to in small pica and none of the assassins are Aryan blonde?though totally plausible?but the courageous hero of the film is a blonde from England. Rather than heap ten more paragraphs of praise for this Hitchcock thriller that provided the firmament for a spectacular career, allow this viewer, who knew too little about a lot of things, to guarantee the reader that another legendary director, five years before making Citizen Kane, responded enthusiastically and inspirationally to this 1934 film. Though Orson Welles' The Third Man has a more obvious Hitchcock influence, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is where it all began. Luckily for him, I also guarantee that Orson Welles paid considerably less than I did to witness this stunning embryonic journey of a film-making genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Primitive by today's standards...inferior to Hitch's '56 remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock believed, with good reason, that his first version of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH was "amateurish" (his own words) and felt he could do more justice to the story by giving it a modern remake with Bernard Herrmann's magnificent music adding dimension to the suspense. He even used Herrmann as a conductor for the Albert Hall concert sequence--which is much more complex in execution than it is in this version and changed the setting for the story. In this version, however, that sequence is probably the most Hitchcockian of all the scenes in the movie with some clever editing touches.LESLIE BANKS and EDNA BEST are nowhere as charismatic as James Stewart and Doris Day in the '56 version. The opening scenes are crude enough to be laughable and Peter Lorre's villainy was much more refined once he understood the English language, instead of learning his part phonetically, as he did here. Furthermore, the shootout at the end is not only awkwardly staged but is undercut by the unrealistic sound effects of dummy bullets. Edna Best is less than convincing as a sharpshooter for that final scene. The whole rooftop scene is excruciatingly amateurish as a wrap-up for the story. Clumsy ending. And it must be said that all of the events leading up to the scene in the church tabernacle, are more than a little absurd. Hitchcock tried to get comic effect out of some of these scenes, to little effect. The strain shows.It's a story that cried for a remake--and Hitchcock did a marvelous job of visualizing it as a highly successful vehicle for James Stewart and Doris Day years later in exotic settings and more realistic touches to the story with the villains not appearing like stock caricatures, but humanized.Summing up: Hitchcock was right to remake it as a much better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not top-notch Hitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big Hitchcock fan, I was keen to at last see the earlier British version of the two "Men Who Knew Too Much" but have to admit to some disappointment. It didn't help that the print I watched seemed poorly lit and suffered from equally poor sound and even making allowances for its early "talkie" status, I just couldn't engage with it to any great extent.It has a strange opening scene where the young girl who is later kidnapped by the "assassination bureau" gets knocked down on a ski-slope by a ski-jumper who turns out to be a British spy and not long for this world as it happens. Just as he expires he confides a vital secret to the girl's very pukka parents which soon involves the whole family in a plot to murder an important foreign dignitary at the Albert Hall. The action then moves back to London to lead up to the murder attempt and aftermath before it all ends as you'd expect.The main problem for me with the film was just how dated the acting and language were. More than that, the whole mise-en-scene was just too ridiculous for words, with really dodgy continuity the order of the day. The big scene at the Royal Albert Hall comes off slightly better but is still much inferior to its handling in the 1956 James Stewart remake while the extended shoot-out sequence that follows substitutes action for suspense, a mistake from which Hitchcock would learn and fast.Only Peter Lorre as the stylish villain and perhaps Edna Best as the emotionally torn wife and mother acquit themselves well in the acting stakes - for the rest it's a case of stiff, stagy overacting all round I'm afraid, at times looking like an eye-rolling contest in front of the camera.On the evidence of this I'd recommend Hitchcock fans keen to view his early work perhaps start instead with "The 39 Steps" from a couple of years later when the Master had learned more about pacing, plot development and yes, suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADHitchcock is inarguably one of the best directors of all times, but the original The Man Who Knew Too Much is a clear example that you're no one is born with talent, one learns it through effort and experience. This movie is clearly Hitchcock at his most inexperienced. As a matter of fact, most of his pre-Hollywood days are. It seems working under the studio system - and under his eternal nemesis, David O. Selznick - certainly improved his quality, as the elements and conditions he worked with improved, too.As it goes, this movie is still enjoyable if you're particularly curious to follow the Master's career from the beginning until his zenith - Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, etc., but it's not really a great movie with good acting - excepting the always great Peter Lorre - dialogue - there are several plot inconsistencies - or directing, although many of the techniques would foreshadow Hitchcock's career.I must say I liked the climatic gun fight; a bit unrealistic, but somewhat ahead of its time. And completely unexpected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never made any secret of the fact that I find Hitchcock vastly overrated - which isn't the same as finding him incompetent - and whilst I would never go out of my way to see one of his movies if, as they are doing this week, they give them away for the price of a newspaper I buy anyway then hey, sure I'll watch them, as I did here. Hitch has often been quoted as treating actor like cattle and that is borne out to some extent here when he allows Pierre Fresnay - later to star in Le Corbeau, a finer movie than Hitch could even aspire to - to be killed off after one reel. I don't mid a film being implausible if it can compensate in other ways - like wit, class, style - but alas, all that happens here is we wonder why an ordinary, if affluent man, Bob Lawrence (Leslie Banks) should be able to casually produce a gun when setting out to search for some bad guys, or how the bad guys themselves not only had a plentiful supply of guns of all shapes and sizes but also - and most risible of all - at least one large steel box of ammunition so heavy it could only be dragged rather than carried. It really won't do though I accept that disciples everywhere will disagree.</fullReview>
